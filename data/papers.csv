Within an individual, XCI-skew differs between blood, fat and skin tissue, but is shared across immune cell types. XCI skew increases with age in blood, but not other tissues, and is associated with smoking. XCI-skew is increased in twins with Rheumatoid Arthritis compared to unaffected identical co-twins.

A few studies of small sample sizes have revealed associations between blood DNA methylation and neuropsychopathology, however, large-scale epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) are needed to investigate the utility of DNA methylation profiling as a peripheral marker for the brain. Here, in an analysis of eleven international cohorts, totalling 3337 individuals, we report epigenome-wide meta-analyses of blood DNA methylation with volumes of the hippocampus, thalamus and nucleus accumbens (NAcc)-three subcortical regions selected for their associations with disease and heritability and volumetric variability. Analyses of individual CpGs revealed genome-wide significant associations with hippocampal volume at two loci. No significant associations were found for analyses of thalamus and nucleus accumbens volumes. Cluster-based analyses revealed additional differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with hippocampal volume. DNA methylation at these loci affected expression of proximal genes involved in learning and memory, stem cell maintenance and differentiation, fatty acid metabolism and type-2 diabetes. These DNA methylation marks, their interaction with genetic variants and their impact on gene expression offer new insights into the relationship between epigenetic variation and brain structure and may provide the basis for biomarker discovery in neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric conditions.",

Adverse early-life exposures are associated with higher liver fat percentages in children. Differential DNA methylation may underlie these associations. We aimed to identify differential DNA methylation in newborns and children associated with liver fat accumulation in childhood. We also examined whether DNA methylation at 22 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) associated with adult non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with liver fat in children. Within a population-based prospective cohort study, we analyzed epigenome-wide DNA methylation data of 785 newborns and 344 10-year-old children in relation to liver fat fraction at 10 years. DNA methylation was measured using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina). We measured liver fat fraction by Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Associations of single CpG DNA methylation at the two-time points with liver fat accumulation were analyzed using robust linear regression models. We also analyzed differentially methylation regions using the dmrff package. We looked-up associations of 22 known adult CpGs at both ages with liver fat at 10 years. The median liver fat fraction was 2.0% (95% range 1.3, 5.1). No single CpGs and no differentially methylated regions were associated with liver fat accumulation. None of the 22 known adult CpGs were associated with liver fat in children. DNA methylation at birth and in childhood was not associated with liver fat accumulation in 10-year-old children in this study. This may be due to modest sample sizes or DNA methylation changes being a consequence rather than a determinant of liver fat.",

Here, we investigate age-by-sex differences in blood-based DNA methylation in an unrelated cohort of 2586 individuals between the ages of 18 and 87â€‰years, with replication in a further 4450 individuals between the ages of 18 and 93â€‰years. Linear regression models were applied, with stringent genome-wide significance thresholds (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰3.6â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-8</sup>) used in both the discovery and replication data. A second, highly conservative mixed linear model method that better controls the false-positive rate was also applied, using the same genome-wide significance thresholds. Using the linear regression method, 52 autosomal and 597 X-linked CpG sites, mapping to 251 unique genes, replicated with concordant effect size directions in the age-by-sex interaction analysis. The site with the greatest difference mapped to GAGE10, an X-linked gene. Here, DNA methylation levels remained stable across the male adult age range (DNA methylation by age râ€‰=â€‰0.02) but decreased across female adult age range (DNA methylation by age râ€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.61).

To test whether periconception paternal body mass index (BMI) is associated with DNA methylation patterns in newborns, to examine associations between maternal and paternal BMI and the epigenome of offspring, and to examine persistence of epigenetic marks at ages 3 and 7 years. Project Viva is a prebirth cohort study of mothers and children including 2128 live births that enrolled mothers from April 1999 to July 2002 and followed offspring to adolescence. This study analyzed the subset of participants with available data on paternal BMI and DNA methylation in offspring blood in the newborn period, at age 3 years, and at age 7 years. Data were analyzed from July 2017 to October 2019. The primary exposure was paternal periconception BMI; associations were adjusted for maternal prepregnancy BMI and stratified according to maternal BMI above or below 25. The primary outcome was genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in offspring blood collected at birth, age 3 years, and age 7 years. A total of 429 father-mother-infant triads were included. The mean (SD) periconception paternal BMI was 26.4 (4.0) and mean maternal prepregnancy BMI was 24.5 (5.2); 268 fathers had BMI greater than or equal to 25 (mean [SD], 28.5 [3.3]) and 161 had BMI less than 25 (mean [SD], 22.8 [1.8]).

Epigenetic changes of metabolic genes in cord blood may contribute to excessive neonatal adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity. This study aims to evaluate the association of cord blood DNA methylation patterns with anthropometric measures and cord blood leptin, a biomarker of neonatal adiposity. A cross-sectional study was performed on a multiethnic cohort of 114 full term neonates born to mothers without gestational diabetes at a university hospital. Cord blood was assayed for leptin and for epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles via the Illumina 450K platform. Neonatal body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze associations between individual CpG sites as well as differentially methylated regions in cord blood DNA with measures of newborn adiposity including anthropometrics (birth weight, fat mass and percent body fat) and cord blood leptin. False discovery rate was estimated to account for multiple comparisons. 247 CpG sites as well as 18 differentially methylated gene regions were associated with cord blood leptin but no epigenetic changes were associated with birth weight, fat mass or percent body fat.

In the absence of genotype data this process can lead to ambiguity in data interpretation when a sample has polymorphisms at a methylation probe site. A common way to minimize this problem is to exclude such potentially problematic sites, with some methods removing as much as 60% of array probes from consideration before data analysis. Here, we present an algorithm implemented in an R Bioconductor package, MethylToSNP, which detects a characteristic data pattern to infer sites likely to be confounded by polymorphisms. Additionally, the tool provides a stringent reliability score to allow thresholding on SNP predictions. We calibrated parameters and thresholds used by the algorithm on simulated and real methylation data sets. We illustrate findings using methylation data from YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria), CEPH (European descent) and KhoeSan (southern African) populations. Our polymorphism predictions made using MethylToSNP have been validated through SNP databases and bisulfite and genomic sequencing. The benefits of this method are threefold. First, it prevents extensive data loss by considering only SNPs specific to the individuals in the study. Second, it offers the possibility to identify new polymorphisms in samples for which there is little known about the genetic landscape. Third, it identifies variants as they exist in functional regions of a genome, such as in CTCF (transcriptional repressor) sites and enhancers, that may be common alleles or personal mutations with potential to deleteriously affect genomic regulatory activities. We demonstrate that MethylToSNP is applicable to the Illumina 450K and Illumina 850K EPIC array data and is also backwards compatible to the 27K methylation arrays. Going forward, this kind of nuanced approach can increase the amount of information derived from precious data sets by considering samples of the project individually to enable more informed decisions about data cleaning.",

As analyses of bulk tissue may obscure association signals and hamper the biological interpretation of findings, these changes were studied on a cell type-specific level. In 3 collections of human postmortem brain (nÂ = 206) and 1 collection of blood samples (NÂ = 1132) of MDD cases and controls, we used epigenomic deconvolution to perform cell type-specific methylome-wide association studies within subpopulations of neurons/glia for the brain data and granulocytes/T cells/B cells/monocytes for the blood data. Sorted neurons/glia from a fourth postmortem brain collection (nÂ = 58) were used for validation purposes. Cell type-specific methylome-wide association studies identified multiple findings in neurons/glia that were detected across brain collections and were reproducible in physically sorted nuclei. Cell type-specific analyses in blood samples identified methylome-wide significant associations in T cells, monocytes, and whole blood that replicated findings from a past methylation study of MDD. Pathway analyses implicated p75 neurotrophin receptor/nerve growth factor signaling and innate immune toll-like receptor signaling in MDD. Top results in neurons, glia, bulk brain, T cells, monocytes, and whole blood were enriched for genes supported by genome-wide association studies for MDD and other psychiatric disorders. We both replicated and identified novel MDD-methylation associations in human brain and blood samples at a cell type-specific level. Our results provide mechanistic insights into how the immune system may interact with the brain to affect MDD susceptibility. Importantly, our findings involved associations with MDD in human samples that implicated many closely related biological pathways.

This catalog, containing over 280,000 mutations, reveals a wide diversity of tissue-specific mutation profiles associated with gene expression levels and chromatin states. For example, lung samples with low expression of the mismatch-repair gene MLH1 show a mutation signature of deficient mismatch repair. In addition, we find pervasive negative selection acting on missense and nonsense mutations, except for mutations previously observed in cancer samples, which are under positive selection and are highly enriched in many healthy tissues.

Over the course of a 2-week diet intervention, in which we first introduced a healthy diet followed by a diet rich in sugar, sperm motility increased and stabilized at high levels. Small RNA-seq on repeatedly sampled sperm from the same individuals revealed that tsRNAs were up-regulated by eating a high-sugar diet for just 1 week. Unsupervised clustering identified two independent pathways for the biogenesis of these tsRNAs: one involving a novel class of fragments with specific cleavage in the T-loop of mature nuclear tRNAs and the other exclusively involving mitochondrial tsRNAs. Mitochondrial involvement was further supported by a similar up-regulation of mitochondrial rRNA-derived small RNA (rsRNA). Notably, the changes in sugar-sensitive tsRNA were positively associated with simultaneous changes in sperm motility and negatively associated with obesity in an independent clinical cohort. This rapid response to a dietary intervention on tsRNA in human sperm is attuned with the paternal intergenerational metabolic responses found in model organisms. More importantly, our findings suggest shared diet-sensitive mechanisms between sperm motility and the biogenesis of tsRNA, which provide novel insights about the interplay between nutrition and male reproductive health.",

Here, we report an epigenome-wide association study of 1123 proteins from 944 participants of the KORA population study and replication in a multi-ethnic cohort of 344 individuals. We identify 98 CpG-protein associations (pQTMs) at a stringent Bonferroni level of significance. Overlapping associations with transcriptomics, metabolomics, and clinical endpoints suggest implication of processes related to chronic low-grade inflammation, including a network involving methylation of NLRC5, a regulator of the inflammasome, and associated pQTMs implicating key proteins of the immune system, such as CD48, CD163, CXCL10, CXCL11, LAG3, FCGR3B, and B2M. Our study links DNA methylation to disease endpoints via intermediate proteomics phenotypes and identifies correlative networks that may eventually be targeted in a personalized approach of chronic low-grade inflammation.",
Yes,20200113,ewas,31910897,Replication and expansion of epigenome-wide association literature in a black South African population.,Clin Epigenetics,"DNA methylation is associated with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and related traits. Methylation data on continental African ancestries are currently scarce, even though there are known genetic and epigenetic differences between ancestral groups and a high burden of NCDs in Africans. Furthermore, the degree to which current literature can be extrapolated to the understudied African populations, who have limited resources to conduct independent large-scale analysis, is not yet known. To this end, this study examines the reproducibility of previously published epigenome-wide association studies of DNA methylation conducted in different ethinicities, on factors related to NCDs, by replicating findings in 120 South African Batswana men aged 45 to 88Â years. In addition, novel associations between methylation and NCD-related factors are investigated using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip. Up to 86% of previously identified epigenome-wide associations with NCD-related traits (alcohol consumption, smoking, body mass index, waist circumference, C-reactive protein, blood lipids and age) overlapped with those observed here and a further 13% were directionally consistent. Only 1% of the replicated associations presented with effects opposite to findings in other ancestral groups. The majority of these inconcistencies were associated with population-specific genomic variance. In addition, we identified eight new 450K array CpG associations not previously reported in other ancestries, and 11 novel EPIC CpG associations with alcohol consumption. The successful replication of existing EWAS findings in this African population demonstrates that blood-based 450K EWAS findings from commonly investigated ancestries can largely be extrapolated to ethnicities for which epigenetic data are not yet available. Possible population-specific differences in 14% of the tested associations do, however, motivate the need to include a diversity of ethnic groups in future epigenetic research. The novel associations found with the enhanced coverage of the Illumina EPIC array support its usefulness to expand epigenetic literature.",

Ageing involves the decline of diverse biological functions and places a limit on a species' maximum lifespan. Ageing is associated with epigenetic changes involving DNA methylation. Furthermore, an analysis of mammals showed that the density of CpG sites in gene promoters, which are targets for DNA methylation, is correlated with lifespan. Using 252 whole genomes and databases of animal age and promotor sequences, we show a pattern across vertebrates. We also derive a predictive lifespan clock based on CpG density in a selected set of promoters. The lifespan clock accurately predicts maximum lifespan in vertebrates (R<sup>2</sup>â€‰=â€‰0.76) from the density of CpG sites within only 42 selected promoters. Our lifespan clock provides a wholly new method for accurately estimating lifespan using genome sequences alone and enables estimation of this challenging parameter for both poorly understood and extinct species.",

Although current approaches to methylome analysis have been helpful in revealing an epigenetic influence in major human diseases, this type of analysis has proven inadequate for the translation of these advances to clinical diagnostics. As in any clinical test, the use of a methylation signal for diagnostic purposes requires the estimation of an optimal cutoff value for the signal, which is necessary to discriminate a signal induced by a disease state from natural background variation. To address this issue, we propose the application of a fundamental signal detection theory and machine learning approaches. Simulation studies and tests of two available methylome datasets from autism and leukemia patients demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in clinical diagnostics, providing high discriminatory power for the methylation signal induced by disease, as well as high classification performance. Specifically, the analysis of whole biomarker genomic regions could suffice for a diagnostic, markedly decreasing its cost.",

Reduced concentrations and methyl-flux of methionine in 1-carbon metabolism have been reported in acute, but not recovered, ESAM, suggesting downstream DNA methylation changes could be relevant to differences in SAM pathogenesis. Here, we assess genome-wide DNA methylation in buccal cells of 309 SAM children using the 450â€‰K microarray. Relative to NESAM, ESAM is characterized by multiple significantly hypomethylated loci, which is not observed among SAM-recovered adults. Gene expression and methylation show both positive and negative correlation, suggesting a complex transcriptional response to SAM. Hypomethylated loci link to disorders of nutrition and metabolism, including fatty liver and diabetes, and appear to be influenced by genetic variation. Our epigenetic findings provide a potential molecular link to reported aberrant 1-carbon metabolism in ESAM and support consideration of methyl-group supplementation in ESAM.",

It predicts age quite well from 353 CpG sites in the DNA methylation profile in unknown samples and has been used to calculate &quot;age acceleration&quot; in various tissues and environments. The model systematically underestimates age in tissues from older people. This is seen in all examined tissues but most strongly in the cerebellum and is consistently observed in multiple datasets. Age acceleration is thus age-dependent, and this can lead to spurious associations. The current literature includes examples of association tests with age acceleration calculated in a wide variety of ways. The concept of an epigenetic clock is compelling, but caution should be taken in interpreting associations with age acceleration. Association tests of age acceleration should include age as a covariate.",

Using genome-wide methylation profiling and machine learning methods, we investigated the utility of CpG methylation status to differentiate blood from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) from normal blood. We established a CpG methylation panel that can distinguish ALL and AML blood from normal blood as well as ALL blood from AML blood with high sensitivity and specificity. We then developed a methylation-based survival classifier with 23 CpGs for ALL and 20 CpGs for AML that could successfully divide patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, with significant differences in clinical outcome in each leukemia type. Together, these findings demonstrate that methylation profiles can be highly sensitive and specific in the accurate diagnosis of ALL and AML, with implications for the prediction of prognosis and treatment selection.",

Bariatric surgery has been proposed as an alternative therapy showing promising results. It leads to substantial weight loss and improvement of comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes. Increased adiposity is associated with changes in epigenetic profile, including DNA methylation. We investigated the effect of bariatric surgery on clinical profile, DNA methylation, and biological age estimated using Horvath's epigenetic clock. To determine the impact of bariatric surgery and subsequent weight loss on clinical traits, a cohort of 40 severely obese individuals (BMI = 30-73 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was examined at the time of surgery and at three follow-up visits, i.e., 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The majority of the individuals were women (65%) and the mean age at surgery was 45.1 Â± 8.1 years. We observed a significant decrease over time in BMI, fasting glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and free fatty acids levels, and a significant small increase in HDL levels (all p values &lt; 0.05). Epigenome-wide association analysis revealed 4857 differentially methylated CpG sites 12 months after surgery (at Bonferroni-corrected p value &lt; 1.09 Ã— 10<sup>-7</sup>). Including BMI change in the model decreased the number of significantly differentially methylated CpG sites by 51%. Gene set enrichment analysis identified overrepresentation of multiple processes including regulation of transcription, RNA metabolic, and biosynthetic processes in the cell. Bariatric surgery in severely obese patients resulted in a decrease in both biological age and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) (mean = - 0.92, p value = 0.039). Our study shows that bariatric surgery leads to substantial BMI decrease and improvement of clinical outcomes observed 12â€‰months after surgery. These changes explained part of the association between bariatric surgery and DNA methylation. We also observed a small, but significant improvement of biological age. These epigenetic changes may be modifiable by environmental lifestyle factors and could be used as potential biomarkers for obesity and in the future for obesity related comorbidities.",

To further establish the utility of breast milk as a tissue-specific biospecimen for investigations of breast carcinogenesis we measured genome-wide DNA methylation in breast milk from women with and without a diagnosis of breast cancer in two independent cohorts. DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina HumanMethylation450k in 87 breast milk samples. Through an Epigenome Wide Association Study we explored CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis in the prospectively collected milk samples from the breast that would develop cancer compared with women without a diagnosis of breast cancer using linear mixed effects models adjusted for history of breast biopsy, age, RefFreeCellMix cell estimates, time of delivery, array chip, and subject as random effect. We identified 58 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with a subsequent breast cancer diagnosis (q-value &lt;â€‰0.05). Nearly all CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis were hypomethylated in cases compared with controls and were enriched for CpG islands. In addition, inferred repeat element methylation was lower in breast milk DNA from cases compared to controls, and cases exhibited increased estimated epigenetic mitotic tick rate as well as DNA methylation age compared with controls. Breast milk has utility as a biospecimen for prospective assessment of disease risk, for understanding the underlying molecular basis of breast cancer risk factors and improving primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer.",

The goal of the current study is to compare the diagnostic performance of DNAm markers across three tissues: AECs, nasal epithelial cells (NECs), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Additionally, we focused on the results using the machine learning algorithm in the context of multi-locus effects to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the optimal subset of CpG sites. We obtained 74 subjects with asthma and 41 controls from AECs, 15 subjects with asthma and 14 controls from NECs, 697 subjects with asthma and 97 controls from PBMCs. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation levels in AECs, NECs and PBMCs were measured using the Infinium Human Methylation 450â€‰K BeadChip. Overlap analysis across the three different sample sources at the locus and pathway levels were studied to investigate shared or unique pathophysiological processes of asthma across tissues. Using the top 100 asthma-associated methylation markers as classifiers from each dataset, we found that both AEC- and NEC-based DNAm signatures exerted a lower classification error than the PBMC-based DNAm markers (p-valueâ€‰=â€‰0.0002). The area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis based on out-of-bag errors using the random forest classification algorithm revealed that PBMC-, NEC-, and AEC-based methylation data yielded 31 loci (AUC: 0.87), 8 loci (AUC: 0.99), and 4 loci (AUC: 0.97) from each optimal subset of tissue-specific markers, respectively. We also discovered the locus-locus interaction of DNAm levels of the CDH6 gene and RAPGEF3 gene might interact with each other to jointly predict the risk of asthma - which suggests the pivotal role of cell-cell junction in the pathological changes of asthma. Both AECs and NECs might provide better diagnostic accuracy and efficacy levels than PBMCs. Further research is warranted to evaluate how these tissue-specific DNAm markers classify and predict asthma risk.",

Here, we show that 3-dimensional (3D) chromatin interactions both within and between topologically associating domains (TADs) frequently change in ER+â€‰endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells and that the differential interactions are enriched for resistance-associated genetic variants at CTCF-bound anchors. Ectopic chromatin interactions are preferentially enriched at active enhancers and promoters and ER binding sites, and are associated with altered expression of ER-regulated genes, consistent with dynamic remodelling of ER pathways accompanying the development of endocrine resistance. We observe that loss of 3D chromatin interactions often occurs coincidently with hypermethylation and loss of ER binding. Alterations in active A and inactive B chromosomal compartments are also associated with decreased ER binding and atypical interactions and gene expression. Together, our results suggest that 3D epigenome remodelling is a key mechanism underlying endocrine resistance in ER+â€‰breast cancer.",

However, current models inadequately define its role within the hierarchy of gene regulation. Analysis of independent datasets shows an unanticipated overlap between DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility at enhancers of steady-state stem cells, suggesting that these two opposing features might exist concurrently. To define their temporal relationship, we developed ATAC-Me, which probes accessibility and methylation from single DNA library preparations. We identified waves of accessibility occurring rapidly across thousands of myeloid enhancers in a monocyte-to-macrophage cell fate model. Prolonged methylation states were observed at a majority of these sites, while transcription of nearby genes tracked closely with accessibility. ATAC-Me uncovers a significant disconnect between chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation status, and gene activity. This unexpected observation highlights the value of ATAC-Me in constructing precise molecular timelines for understanding the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation.",

DNA methylation is a potential mechanism underlying the impacts of environmental exposures on fetal development; however, very few studies have been done elucidating the role of DNA methylation linking prenatal Se and child neurobehavior. We aimed to investigate the associations between placental Se concentration and epigenome-wide DNA methylation in two U.S. cohorts, and to assess the association between Se-related DNA methylation modifications and newborns' neurobehavior. We measured placental Se concentrations in 343 newborns enrolled in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study and in 141 newborns in the Rhode Island Child Health Study. Genome-wide placental DNA methylation was measured by HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and newborn neurobehavioral development was assessed by the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scales (NNNS). We meta-analyzed the associations between placental Se concentration and DNA methylation in each cohort, adjusting for covariates. We also fit multiple linear regression and ordinal logistic regression for methylation and newborn NNNS summary scores. We identified five Se-related differentially methylated CpG sites. Among them was cg09674502 (GFI1), where selenium concentration was positively associated with methylation (Î²-coefficientÂ =Â 1.11, FDR-adjusted p-valueÂ =Â 0.045), and where we observed that a one percent methylation level increase was associated with a 15% reduced odds of higher muscle tone in the arms, legs and trunk of newborns, (OR [95% Confidence Interval, CI]Â =Â 0.85 [0.77, 0.95]). We also observed for each interquartile range (IQR)Â increase in selenium concentration in the placenta, there was 1.76 times greater odds of higher hypotonicity (OR [95% CI]Â =Â 1.76 [1.12, 2.82]). Placental selenium concentration was inversely associated with muscle tone of newborns, and hypermethylation of GFI1 could be a potential mechanism underlying this association.",

In the case of a continuous covariate like smoking pack years (SPY), a measure of lifetime exposure to tobacco toxins, a spike at zero can occur. Hence, all non-smokers are generating a peak at zero, while the smoking patients are distributed over the other SPY values. Additionally, the spike might also occur on the right side of the covariate distribution, if a category &quot;heavy smoker&quot; is designed. Here, we will focus on methylation data with a spike at the left or the right of the distribution of a continuous covariate. After the methylation data is generated, analysis is usually performed by preprocessing, quality control, and determination of differentially methylated sites, often performed in pipeline fashion. Hence, the data is processed in a string of methods, which are available in one software package. The pipelines can distinguish between categorical covariates, i.e. for group comparisons or continuous covariates, i.e. for linear regression. The differential methylation analysis is often done internally by a linear regression without checking its inherent assumptions. A spike in the continuous covariate is ignored and can cause biased results. We have reanalysed five data sets, four freely available from ArrayExpress, including methylation data and smoking habits reported by smoking pack years. Therefore, we generated an algorithm to check for the occurrences of suspicious interactions between the values associated with the spike position and the non-spike positions of the covariate. Our algorithm helps to decide if a suspicious interaction can be found and further investigations should be carried out. This is mostly important, because the information on the differentially methylated sites will be used for post-hoc analyses like pathway analyses. We help to check for the validation of the linear regression assumptions in a methylation analysis pipeline. These assumptions should also be considered for machine learning approaches. In addition, we are able to detect outliers in the continuous covariate. Therefore, more statistical robust results should be produced in methylation analysis using our algorithm as a preprocessing step.",

Epigenetic processes including DNA methylation potentially mediate the relationship between genetic factors, the environment and cardiovascular disease. Despite an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in individuals of South Asians compared to Europeans, it is not clear whether associations between blood pressure and DNA methylation differ between these groups. We performed an epigenome-wide association study and differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis to identify DNA methylation sites and regions that were associated with systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and hypertension. We analyzed samples from 364 European and 348 South Asian men (first generation migrants to the UK) from the Southall And Brent REvisited cohort, measuring DNA methylation from blood using the Illumina InfiniumÂ® HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. One CpG site was found to be associated with DBP in trans-ancestry analyses (i.e. both ethnic groups combined), while in Europeans alone seven CpG sites were associated with DBP. No associations were identified between DNA methylation and either SBP or hypertension. Comparison of effect sizes between South Asian and European EWAS for DBP, SBP and hypertension revealed little concordance between analyses. DMR analysis identified several regions with known relationships with CVD and its risk factors. This study identified differentially methylated sites and regions associated with blood pressure and revealed ethnic differences in these associations. These findings may point to molecular pathways which may explain the elevated cardiovascular disease risk experienced by those of South Asian ancestry when compared to Europeans.",

We assayed genome-wide DNA methylation in non-Hispanic white smokers with and without COPD using blood samples from the COPDGene enrollment visit. We tested whether DNA methylation was associated with mortality in models adjusted for COPD status, age, sex, current-smoking status, and pack-years of cigarette smoking. Replication was performed in a subset of 231 individuals from the ECLIPSE study. We identified seven CpG sites associated with mortality (FDR &lt; 20%) that replicated in the ECLIPSE cohort (p &lt; 0.05). None of these marks were associated with longitudinal lung function decline in survivors, smoking history or current smoking status. However, differential methylation of two replicated PIK3CD sites were associated with lung function at enrollment (p &lt; 0.05). We also observed associations between DNA methylation and gene expression for the PIK3CD sites.

Epigenome-wide changes in DNA methylation in peripheral blood were studied from pre- to post measurement of bullying exposure, in a longitudinal study of the population-based Generation R Study and Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (combined <i>n</i> =Â 1,352). Linear mixed-model results were meta-analysed to estimate how DNA methylation changed as a function of exposure to bullying. Sensitivity analyses including co-occurring child characteristics and risks were performed, as well as a Gene Ontology analysis. A candidate follow-up was employed for CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) sites annotated to <i>5-HTT</i> and <i>NR3C1</i>. One site, cg17312179, showed small changes in DNA methylation associated to bullying exposure (<i>b</i> =Â -2.67e-03, SEÂ =Â 4.97e-04, <i>p</i> =Â 7.17e-08). This site is annotated to <i>RAB14</i>, an oncogene related to Golgi apparatus functioning, and its methylation levels decreased for exposed but increased for non-exposed. This result was consistent across sensitivity analyses. Enriched Gene Ontology pathways for differentially methylated sites included cardiac function and neurodevelopmental processes. Top CpG sites tended to have overall low levels of DNA methylation, decreasing in exposed, increasing in non-exposed individuals. There were no gene-wide corrected findings for <i>5-HTT</i> and <i>NR3C1</i>. This is the first study to identify changes in DNA methylation associated with bullying exposure at the epigenome-wide significance level. Consistent with other population-based studies, we do not find evidence for strong associations between bullying exposure and DNA methylation.",

However, limited information, including on genetic and epigenetic contributors to FVIII variation, is available specifically among African Americans (AAs), who have higher FVIII levels than Europeans. We measured FVIII levels in ~3,400 AAs from the community-based Jackson Heart Study and assessed genetic, epigenetic, and epidemiological correlates of FVIII, as well as incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) associations. We assessed cross-sectional associations of FVIII with CVD risk factors as well as incident CHD, stroke, heart failure, and mortality associations. We additionally assessed associations with TOPMed whole genome sequencing data and an epigenome-wide methylation array. Our results confirmed associations between FVIII and risk of incident CHD events and total mortality in AAs; mortality associations were largely independent of traditional risk factors. We also demonstrate an association of FVIII with incident heart failure, independent of B-type natriuretic peptide. Two genomic regions were strongly associated with FVIII (ABO and VWF). The index variant at VWF is specific to individuals of African descent and is distinct from the previously reported European VWF association signal. Epigenome-wide association analysis showed significant FVIII associations with several CpG sites in the ABO region. However, after adjusting for ABO genetic variants, ABO CpG sites were not significant. Larger sample sizes of AAs will be required to discover additional genetic and epigenetic contributors to FVIII phenotypic variation, which may have consequences for CVD health disparities.",

The ensuing multiple test corrections affect the statistical power to detect associations, likely contributing to prevalent limited reproducibility. Array probes measuring proximal CpG sites often have correlated levels of DNAm that may not only be biologically meaningful but also imply statistical dependence and redundancy. New methods that account for such correlations between adjacent probes may enable improved specificity, discovery, and interpretation of statistical associations in DNAm array data. We developed a method named Co-Methylation with genomic CpG Background (CoMeBack), that estimates DNA co-methylation, defined as proximal CpG probes with correlated DNAm across individuals. CoMeBack outputs Co-methylated Regions (CMRs), spanning sets of array probes constructed based on all genomic CpG sites, including those not measured on the array, and without any phenotypic variable inputs. This approach can reduce the multiple test correction burden, while enhancing the discovery and specificity of statistical associations. We constructed and validated CMRs in whole blood, using publicly available Illumina Infinium 450K array (450K) data from over 5,000 individuals. These CMRs were enriched for enhancer chromatin states, and binding site motifs for several transcription factors involved in blood physiology.

We evaluated the impact of a 1-year Mediterranean-like diet in a pilot study including 120 elderly healthy subjects from the NU-AGE study (60 Italians, 60 Poles) by measuring the changes in their epigenetic age, assessed by Horvath's clock. We observed a trend towards epigenetic rejuvenation of participants after nutritional intervention. The effect was statistically significant in the group of Polish females and in subjects who were epigenetically older at baseline. A genome-wide association study of epigenetic age changes after the intervention did not return significant (adjusted p value &lt;â€‰0.05) loci. However, we identified small-effect alleles (nominal p value &lt;â€‰10-4), mapping in genes enriched in pathways related to energy metabolism, regulation of cell cycle, and of immune functions. Together, these findings suggest that Mediterranean diet can promote epigenetic rejuvenation but with country-, sex-, and individual-specific effects, thus highlighting the need for a personalized approach to nutritional interventions.",

We use BENGI to test several published computational methods for linking enhancers with genes, including signal correlation and the TargetFinder and PEP supervised learning methods. We find that while TargetFinder is the best-performing method, it is only modestly better than a baseline distance method for most benchmark datasets when trained and tested with the same cell type and that TargetFinder often does not outperform the distance method when applied across cell types.

We associated breastfeeding and blood mtDNA content 14-15 years later while adjusting for confounding variables. Compared with non-breastfed adolescents, mtDNA content was 23.1% (95%CI: 4.4-45.2; pâ€‰=â€‰0.013) higher in breastfed adolescents. Being breastfed for 1-10 weeks, 11-20 weeks, and &gt;20 weeks, was associated with a higher mtDNA content of respectively 16.0% (95%CI: -7.1-44.9; pâ€‰=â€‰0.191), 23.5% (95%CI: 0.8-51.3; pâ€‰=â€‰0.042), and 31.5% (95%CI: 4.3-65.7; pâ€‰=â€‰0.021). Our study showed a positive association between breastfeeding and mtDNA content in adolescents which gradually increased with longer periods of breastfeeding. Higher mtDNA content may be an underlying mechanism of the beneficial effects of breastfeeding on children's metabolism.",

Placental epigenetic mechanisms may underlie these associations. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study to identify placental DNA methylation changes associated with maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and rate of gestational weight gain at first (GWG1), second (GWG2), and third trimester (GWG3). Participants of the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies with genome-wide placental DNA methylation (nâ€‰=â€‰301) and gene expression (nâ€‰=â€‰75) data were included. Multivariable-adjusted regression models were used to test the associations of 1â€‰kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase in prepregnancy BMI or 1â€‰kg/week increase in GWG with DNA methylation levels. Genes harboring top differentially methylated CpGs (FDR Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) were evaluated for placental gene expression. We assessed whether DNA methylation sites known to be associated with BMI in child or adult tissues, were also associated with maternal prepregnancy BMI in placenta. Prepregnancy BMI was associated with DNA methylation at cg14568196[EGFL7], cg15339142[VETZ], and cg02301019[AC092377.1] (FDR Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05, P ranging from 1.4â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-10</sup> to 1.7â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-9</sup>). GWG1 or GWG2 was associated with DNA methylation at cg17918270[MYT1L], cg20735365[DLX5], and cg17451688[SLC35F3] (FDR Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05, P ranging from 6.4â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-10</sup> to 1.2â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-8</sup>). Both prepregnancy BMI and DNA methylation at cg1456819 [EGFL7] were negatively correlated with EGFL7 expression in placenta (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05). Several CpGs previously implicated in obesity traits in children and adults were associated with prepregnancy BMI in placenta. Functional annotations revealed that EGFL7 is highly expressed in placenta and the differentially methylated CpG sites near EGFL7 and VEZT were cis-meQTL targets in blood. We identified placental DNA methylation changes at novel loci associated with prepregnancy BMI and GWG. The overlap between CpGs associated with obesity traits in placenta and other tissues in children and adults suggests that epigenetic mechanisms in placenta may give insights to early origins of obesity.",

However, the construction of the original pan-tissue epigenetic clock did not include skeletal muscle samples and hence exhibited a strong deviation between DNA methylation and chronological age in this tissue. To address this, we developed a more accurate, muscle-specific epigenetic clock based on the genome-wide DNA methylation data of 682 skeletal muscle samples from 12 independent datasets (18-89 years old, 22% women, 99% Caucasian), all generated with Illumina HumanMethylation (HM) arrays (HM27, HM450, or HMEPIC). We also took advantage of the large number of samples to conduct an epigenome-wide association study of age-associated DNA methylation patterns in skeletal muscle. The newly developed clock uses 200 cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides to estimate chronological age in skeletal muscle, 16 of which are in common with the 353 cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides of the pan-tissue clock. The muscle clock outperformed the pan-tissue clock, with a median error of only 4.6 years across datasets (vs. 13.1 years for the pan-tissue clock, P &lt; 0.0001) and an average correlation of Ï = 0.62 between actual and predicted age across datasets (vs. Ï = 0.51 for the pan-tissue clock). Lastly, we identified 180 differentially methylated regions with age in skeletal muscle at a false discovery rate &lt; 0.005. However, gene set enrichment analysis did not reveal any enrichment for gene ontologies. We have developed a muscle-specific epigenetic clock that predicts age with better accuracy than the pan-tissue clock. We implemented the muscle clock in an r package called Muscle Epigenetic Age Test available on Bioconductor to estimate epigenetic age in skeletal muscle samples. This clock may prove valuable in assessing the impact of environmental factors, such as exercise and diet, on muscle-specific biological ageing processes.",

To date, few studies have examined differences in DNA methylation associated with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In this study, we profiled genetic and methylomic variation across the genome in saliva samples from children (age 7-12 years) with clinically established ADHD (Nâ€‰=â€‰391) and nonpsychiatric controls (Nâ€‰=â€‰213). We tested for differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with both ADHD diagnosis and ADHD polygenic risk score, by using linear regression models including smoking, medication effects, and other potential confounders in our statistical models. Our results support previously reported associations between ADHD and DNA methylation levels at sites annotated to VIPR2, and identify several novel disease-associated DMPs (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰1e-5), although none of them were genome-wide significant. The two top-ranked, ADHD-associated DMPs (cg17478313 annotated to SLC7A8 and cg21609804 annotated to MARK2) are also significantly associated with nearby SNPs (pâ€‰=â€‰1.2e-46 and pâ€‰=â€‰2.07e-59), providing evidence that disease-associated DMPs are under genetic control. We also report a genome-wide significant association between ADHD polygenic risk and variable DNA methylation at a site annotated to the promoter of GART and SON (pâ€‰=â€‰6.71E-8). Finally, we show that ADHD-associated SNPs colocalize with SNPs associated with methylation levels in saliva. This is the first large-scale study of DNA methylation in children with ADHD. Our results represent novel epigenetic biomarkers for ADHD that may be useful for patient stratification, reinforce the importance of genetic effects on DNA methylation, and provide plausible molecular mechanisms for ADHD risk variants.",

Astrocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis<sup>2</sup>, but little is known about the heterogeneity of astrocytes and its regulation. Here we report the analysis of astrocytes in multiple sclerosis and its preclinical model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by single-cell RNA sequencing in combination with cell-specific Ribotag RNA profiling, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq), genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and in vivo CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic perturbations. We identified astrocytes in EAE and multiple sclerosis that were characterized by decreased expression of NRF2 and increased expression of MAFG, which cooperates with MAT2Î± to promote DNA methylation and represses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory transcriptional programs. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signalling in astrocytes drives the expression of MAFG and MAT2Î± and pro-inflammatory transcriptional modules, contributing to CNS pathology in EAE and, potentially, multiple sclerosis.

Epigenetic profiles can be derived from blood cells, but to our knowledge, it is unknown whether these predict established brain alterations associated with schizophrenia. To identify an epigenetic signature (quantified as polymethylation score [PMS]) of schizophrenia using machine learning applied to genome-wide blood DNA-methylation data; evaluate whether differences in blood-derived PMS are mirrored in data from postmortem brain samples; test whether the PMS is associated with alterations of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex hippocampal (DLPFC-HC) connectivity during working memory in healthy controls (HC); explore the association between interactions between polygenic and epigenetic risk with DLPFC-HC connectivity; and test the specificity of the signature compared with other serious psychiatric disorders. In this case-control study conducted from 2008 to 2018 in sites in Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, blood DNA-methylation data from 2230 whole-blood samples from 6 independent cohorts comprising HC (1238 [55.5%]) and participants with schizophrenia (803 [36.0%]), bipolar disorder (39 [1.7%]), major depressive disorder 35 [1.6%]), and autism (27 [1.2%]), and first-degree relatives of all patient groups (88 [3.9%]) were analyzed. DNA-methylation data were further explored from 244 postmortem DLPFC samples from 136 HC and 108 patients with schizophrenia. Neuroimaging and genome-wide association data were available for 393 HC. The latter data was used to calculate a polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia. The data were analyzed in 2019. The accuracy of schizophrenia control classification based on machine learning using epigenetic data; association of schizophrenia PMS scores with DLPFC-HC connectivity; and association of the interaction between PRS and PMS with DLPFC-HC connectivity. This study included 7488 participants (4395 men [58.7%]), of whom 3158 (2230 men [70.6%]) received a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The PMS signature was associated with schizophrenia across 3 independent data sets (area under the curve [AUC] from 0.69 to 0.78; P value from 0.049 to 1.24â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7) and data from postmortem DLPFC samples (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.63; Pâ€‰=â€‰1.42â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4), but not with major depressive disorder (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.51; Pâ€‰=â€‰.16), autism (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.53; Pâ€‰=â€‰.66), or bipolar disorder (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.58; Pâ€‰=â€‰.21). Pathways contributing most to the classification included synaptic processes. Healthy controls with schizophrenia-like PMS showed significantly altered DLPFC-HC connectivity (validation methylation/magnetic resonance imaging, tâ€‰&lt;â€‰-3.81; P for familywise error, &lt;.04; validation magnetic resonance imaging, tâ€‰&lt;â€‰-3.54; P for familywise error, &lt;.02), mirroring the lack of functional decoupling in schizophrenia. There was no significant association of the interaction between PMS and PRS with DLPFC-HC connectivity (Pâ€‰&gt;â€‰.19). We identified a reproducible blood DNA-methylation signature specific for schizophrenia that was correlated with altered functional DLPFC-HC coupling during working memory and mapped to methylation differences found in DLPFC postmortem samples. This indicates a possible epigenetic contribution to a schizophrenia intermediate phenotype and suggests that PMS could be of interest to be studied in the context of multimodal biomarkers for disease stratification and treatment personalization.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we analyze 1497 RNA-seq data in combination with their genotype data and identify SNPs that are associated with expression throughout the genome by dissecting expression features to genes (eGene) and exon-exon junctions (eJunction). Then, we colocalize eGene and eJunction with SCZ GWAS using SMR and fine mapping. Multiple ChIP-seq data and DNA methylation data generated from brain were used for identifying the causal variants. Finally, we used a hypothesis-free (no SCZ risk loci considered) enrichment analysis to determine implicated pathways. We identified 171 genes and eight splicing junctions located within four genes (SNX19, ARL6IP4, APOPT1, and CYP2D6) that potentially contribute to SCZ susceptibility. Among the genes, CYP2D6 is significantly associated with SCZ SNPs in eGene and eJunction. In-depth examination of the CYP2D6 region revealed that a nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant rs16947 is strongly associated with a higher abundance of CYP2D6 exon 3 skipping junctions. While we found rs133377 and other functional SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium with rs16947 (r<sup>2</sup>â€‰=â€‰0.9539), histone acetylation analysis showed they are located within active transcription start sites. Furthermore, our data-driven enrichment analysis showed that CYP2D6 is significantly involved in drug metabolism of codeine, tamoxifen, and citalopram. Our study facilitates an understanding of the genetic architecture of SCZ and provides new drug targets.",

There has been an interest in developing epigenetic biomarkers for HAD that might complement clinical assessment. Because alcohol consumption has been previously linked to DNA methylation (DNAm), we aimed to select DNAm signatures in blood to predict HAD from two demographically and clinically distinct populations (N<sub>total</sub>â€‰=â€‰1,549). We first separately conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for phosphatidylethanol (PEth), an objective measure of alcohol consumption, and for self-reported alcohol consumption in Cohort 1. We identified 83 PEth-associated CpGs, including 23 CpGs previously associated with alcohol consumption or alcohol use disorder. In contrast, no CpG reached epigenome-wide significance on self-reported alcohol consumption. Using a machine learning approach, two CpG subsets from EWAS on PEth and on self-reported alcohol consumption from Cohort 1 were separately tested for the prediction of HAD in Cohort 2. We found that a subset of 143 CpGs selected from the EWAS on PEth showed an excellent prediction of HAD with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 89.4% in training set and 73.9% in validation set of Cohort 2. However, CpGs preselected from the EWAS on self-reported alcohol consumption showed a poor prediction of HAD with AUC 75.2% in training set and 57.6% in validation set. Our results demonstrate that an objective measure for alcohol consumption is a more informative phenotype than self-reported data for revealing epigenetic mechanisms. The PEth-associated DNAm signature in blood could serve as a robust biomarker for alcohol consumption.",

Associations of DNAm with various outcomes like incident type 2 diabetes, plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (HOMA of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) as well as with gene expression were investigated. Discovery (<i>n</i> = 6,820) and replication (<i>n</i> = 1,450) phases associated five DNAm sites with statin use: cg17901584 (1.12 Ã— 10<sup>-25</sup> [<i>DHCR24</i>]), cg10177197 (3.94 Ã— 10<sup>-08</sup> [<i>DHCR24</i>]), cg06500161 (2.67 Ã— 10<sup>-23</sup> [<i>ABCG1</i>]), cg27243685 (6.01 Ã— 10<sup>-09</sup> [<i>ABCG1</i>]), and cg05119988 (7.26 Ã— 10<sup>-12</sup> [<i>SC4MOL</i>]). Two sites were associated with at least one glycemic trait or type 2 diabetes. Higher cg06500161 methylation was associated with higher fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.34 [95% CI 1.22, 1.47]). Mediation analyses suggested that <i>ABCG1</i> methylation partially mediates the effect of statins on high insulin and HOMA-IR. Gene expression analyses showed that statin exposure and <i>ABCG1</i> methylation were associated with <i>ABCG1</i> downregulation, suggesting epigenetic regulations of <i>ABCG1</i> expression. Further, outcomes insulin and HOMA-IR were significantly associated with <i>ABCG1</i> expression. This study sheds light on potential mechanisms linking statins with type 2 diabetes risk, providing evidence on DNAm partially mediating statins' effects on insulin traits. Further efforts shall disentangle the molecular mechanisms through which statins may induce DNAm changes, potentially leading to <i>ABCG1</i> epigenetic regulation.",

Advances in molecular genetics have led to the realization that essential concepts in the framework of molecular biology are still missing. Clinical medicine is plagued by similar shortcomings: The questioning of current paradigms could open new vistas and invite challenging approaches. This article presents an unconventional idea. Foreign DNA which is regularly ingested with the essential food supply is not completely degraded. Small quantities of fragmented DNA rather persist transiently in the gastro-intestinal tract of mice and can be traced to various organ systems, except for cells in the germ line. Foreign DNA entering and persisting in mammalian cells can stochastically lead to genome-wide alterations of transcriptional and CpG DNA methylation profiles. In the course of food-ingested DNA invading somatic cells, completely new cell types can be generated which might be involved in the causation of common ailments.

We found the longitudinal growth of functional BAs accelerated around age 70; average levels of BA curves differed by sex across the age span (50-90 years). All BAs were correlated to varying degrees; correlations were mostly explained by CA. Individually, all BAs except for telomere length were associated with mortality risk independently of CA. The largest effects were seen for methylation age estimators (GrimAge) and the frailty index (FI). In joint models, two methylation age estimators (Horvath and GrimAge) and FI remained predictive, suggesting they are complementary in predicting mortality. ",

Though there has been some investigation of the role that molecular indicators may play in mediating neighborhood exposures, there has been little effort to incorporate newly developed epigenetic biomarkers into our understanding of neighborhood characteristics and health outcomes. Using 157 participants of the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study with detailed assessments of neighborhood characteristics and genome-wide DNA methylation profiling via the Illumina 450K methylation array, we assessed the relationship between objective neighborhood characteristics and a validated DNA methylation-based epigenetic mortality risk score (eMRS). Associations were adjusted for age, race, sex, ever smoking, ever alcohol usage, education, years spent in neighborhood, and employment. A secondary model additionally adjusted for personal neighborhood perception. We summarized 19 neighborhood quality indicators assessed for participants into 9 principal components which explained over 90% of the variance in the data and served as metrics of objective neighborhood quality exposures. Of the nine principal components utilized for this study, one was strongly associated with the eMRS (Î² = 0.15; 95% confidence interval = 0.06-0.24; P = 0.002). This principal component (PC7) was most strongly driven by the presence of abandoned cars, poor streets, and non-art graffiti. Models including both PC7 and individual indicators of neighborhood perception indicated that only PC7 and not neighborhood perception impacted the eMRS. When stratified on neighborhood indicators of greenspace, we observed a potentially protective effect of large mature trees as this feature substantially attenuated the observed association. Objective measures of neighborhood disadvantage are significantly associated with an epigenetic predictor of mortality risk, presenting a potential novel avenue by which neighborhood-level exposures may impact health. Associations were independent of an individual's perception of their neighborhood and attenuated by neighborhood greenspace features. More work should be done to determine molecular risk factors associated with neighborhoods, and potentially protective neighborhood features against adverse molecular effects.",

We demonstrate that cg06690548 hypermethylation in PD is associated with down-regulation of the SLC7A11 gene and show this is consistent with an environmental exposure, as opposed to medications or genetic factors with effects on DNA methylation or gene expression. These findings are notable because SLC7A11 codes for a cysteine-glutamate anti-porter regulating levels of the antioxidant glutathione, and it is a known target of the environmental neurotoxin Î²-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA).

We also explored associations of gestational age with DNA methylation measured at 4-18â€‰years in additional pediatric cohorts. Follow-up analyses of DNA methylation and gene expression correlations were performed in cord blood. DNA methylation profiles were also explored in tissues relevant for gestational age health effects: fetal brain and lung.

Pathway analyses identified enrichment for biological processes critical to embryonic development. Follow-up of identified genes showed correlations between gestational age and DNA methylation levels in fetal brain and lung tissue, as well as correlation with expression levels.

The molecular basis of this finding is uncertain. We aimed to test the hypothesis that DNA methylation changes occur during critical illness and that early parenteral nutrition (or a specific macronutrient component hereof) contributes to these changes, which could explain its negative effects on neurocognitive development. This pre-planned secondary analysis of the multicentre PEPaNIC trial (2012-18) included all patients with a last PICU day blood sample (n=825, aged 0-17 years at PICU admission) who were randomly allocated (1:1) to early parenteral nutrition or late parenteral nutrition, as compared with 352 demographically matched healthy children. Investigators were masked to treatment allocation. We used the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip to determine the genome-wide peripheral blood leukocyte DNA methylation of 865â€ˆ859 CpG sites, yielding high-quality results for 403 patients allocated to early parenteral nutrition and for 411 patients allocated to late parenteral nutrition. Applying a false discovery rate of less than 0Â·05, DNA methylation of patients on the last PICU day was compared with that of healthy children, after excluding all CpG sites differentially methylated upon PICU admission, because these reflected pre-admission conditions and altered leukocyte composition. We used bootstrapped multivariable linear and non-linear regression analyses to assess the effect of early parenteral nutrition versus late parenteral nutrition on illness-induced alterations in DNA methylation and to what extent differentially methylated CpG sites explained impaired neurocognitive development 2 years later. During PICU stay, 159 CpG sites were methylated differently in patients admitted to the PICU than in healthy children, with mean effect sizes of 2Â·6% (SD 2Â·5) up to 21Â·6% (p&lt;0Â·02). These differentially methylated CpG sites occurred in genes involved in brain development, plasticity, and signalling; neuronal differentiation, migration, and growth; metabolism; transcriptional regulation; physical development and locomotion; and several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Early parenteral nutrition and, in particular, the dose of amino acids, independently contributed to the differential methylation of 37 (23%) of these 159 CpG sites (p=0Â·0001 to 0Â·050), which could explain the adverse effect of early parenteral nutrition on neurocognitive development at 2-year follow-up (R<sup>2</sup> 0Â·61 [SD 0Â·01]). Early parenteral nutrition during paediatric critical illness altered DNA methylation, which suggests a plausible molecular basis for its negative effect on long-term neurocognitive development. Early administration of amino acids, rather than of glucose or lipids, mostly explained the aberrant DNA methylation-a finding that requires further investigation.

Yes,20200316,ewas,32080920,Acute alcohol withdrawal and recovery in men lead to profound changes in DNA methylation profiles: a longitudinal clinical study.,Addiction,"Withdrawal is a serious and sometimes life-threatening event in alcohol-dependent individuals. It has been suggested that epigenetic processes may play a role in this context. This study aimed to identify genes and pathways involved in such processes which hint to relevant mechanisms underlying withdrawal. Cross-sectional case-control study and longitudinal within-cases study during alcohol withdrawal and after 2Â weeks of recovery SETTING: Addiction medicine departments in two university hospitals in southern Germany. Ninety-nine alcohol-dependent male patients receiving in-patient treatment and suffering from severe withdrawal symptoms during detoxification and 95 age-matched male controls. Epigenome-wide methylation patterns were analyzed in patients during acute alcohol withdrawal and after 2Â weeks of recovery, as well as in age-matched controls using Illumina EPIC bead chips. Methylation levels of patients and controls were tested for association with withdrawal status. Tests were adjusted for technical and batch effects, age, smoking and cell type distribution. Single-site analysis, as well as an analysis of differentially methylated regions and gene ontology analysis, were performed. We found pronounced epigenome-wide significant [false discovery rate (FDR)Â &lt;Â 0.05] differences between patients during withdrawal and after 2Â weeks [2876 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites], as well as between patients and controls (9845 and 6094 CpG sites comparing patients at time-point 1 and patients at time-point 2 versus controls, respectively). Analysis of differentially methylated regions and involved pathways revealed an over-representation of gene ontology terms related to the immune system response. Differences between patients and controls diminished after recovery (&gt;Â 800 CpG sites less), suggesting a partial reversibility of alcohol- and withdrawal-related methylation. Acute alcohol withdrawal in severely dependent male patients appears to be associated with extensive changes in epigenome-wide methylation patterns. In particular, genes involved in immune system response seem to be affected by this condition.",

Placental DNA methylation may be the regulatory pathway through which maternal blood pressure influences fetal and adult health outcomes. Epigenome-wide association study of 301 participants with placenta sample examined associations between DNA methylation and millimetre of mercury increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in each trimester. Findings were further examined using gene expression, gene pathway, and functional annotation analyses. Cytosine-(phosphate)-guanine (CpGs) known to be associated with cardiometabolic traits were evaluated. Increased maternal systolic and diastolic blood pressure were associated with methylation of 3 CpGs in the first, 6 CpGs in the second, and 15 CpGs in the third trimester at 5% false discovery rate (<i>P</i> values ranging from 6.6Ã—10<sup>-15</sup> to 2.3Ã—10<sup>-7</sup>). Several CpGs were enriched in pathways including cardiovascular-metabolic development (<i>P</i>=1.0Ã—10<sup>-45</sup>). Increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure were associated with increased CpG methylation and gene expression at <i>COL12A1</i>, a collagen family gene known for regulatory functions in the heart. Out of 304 previously reported CpGs known to be associated with cardiometabolic traits, 36 placental CpGs were associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in our data. The present study provides the first evidence for associations between placental DNA methylation and increased maternal blood pressure during pregnancy at genes implicated in cardiometabolic diseases. Identification of blood pressure-associated methylated sites in the placenta may provide clues to early origins of cardiometabolic dysfunction and inform guidelines for early prevention.

Here, we investigated whether mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation in platelets is altered prior to CVD development in a population of adults with overweight and obesity. We devised a nested case-control study of 200 adults with overweight or obesity who were CVD-free at baseline, of whom 84 developed CVD within 5 years, while 116 remained CVD-free. Platelet mtDNA was isolated from plasma samples at baseline, and mtDNA methylation was quantified in mitochondrially encoded cytochrome-C-oxidase I (MT-CO1; nt6797 and nt6807), II (MT-CO2; nt8113 and nt8117), and III (MT-CO3; nt9444 and nt9449); tRNA leucine 1 (MT-TL1; nt3247 and nt3254); D-loop (nt16383); tRNA phenylalanine (MT-TF; nt624); and light-strand-origin-of-replication (MT-OLR; nt5737, nt5740, and nt5743) by bisulfite-pyrosequencing. Logistic regression was used to estimate the contribution of mtDNA methylation to future CVD risk. ROC curve analysis was used to identify the optimal mtDNA methylation threshold for future CVD risk prediction. A model was generated incorporating methylation at three loci (score 0, 1, or 2 according to 0, 1, or 2-3 hypermethylated loci, respectively), adjusted for potential confounders, such as diastolic and systolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and cholesterol ratio. mtDNA methylation at MT-CO1 nt6807 (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.16; P = 0.014), MT-CO3 nt9444 (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.46, P = 0.042), and MT-TL1 nt3254 (OR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.61, P = 0.008) was higher at baseline in those who developed CVD by follow-up, compared with those who remained CVD-free. Combined use of the three loci significantly enhanced risk prediction, with hazard ratios of 1.38 (95% CI 0.68-2.78) and 2.68 (95% CI 1.41-5.08) for individuals with score 1 or 2, respectively (P = 0.003). Methylation at these sites was independent of conventional CVD risk factors, including inflammation markers, fasting blood glucose concentration, and blood pressure. Methylations of MT-CO1, MT-CO3, and MT-TL1 are, together, strong predictors of future CVD incidence. Since methylation of these mtDNA domains was independent of conventional CVD risk factors, these markers may represent a novel intrinsic predictor of CVD risk in adults with overweight and obesity.",

In this study we sought to: 1) construct a novel 'Poly-Methylomic Profile Score (PMPS)' by transforming schizophrenia-associated epigenome-wide methylation from a previously published epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) into a single quantitative metric; and 2) examine associations between the PMPS and clinical status in an independent sample of 57 schizophrenia (SZ) cases, 59 bipolar disorder (BD) cases and 55 healthy controls (HC) for whom blood-derived DNA methylation was quantified using the Illumina 450Â K methylation beadchip. We constructed five PMPSs at different p-value thresholds by summing methylation beta-values weighted by individual-CpG effect sizes from the meta-analysis of a previously published schizophrenia EWAS (comprising three separate cohorts with 675 [353 SZ and 322 HC] discovery cohort participants, 847 [414 SZ and 433 HC] replication cohort participants, and 96 monozygotic twin-pairs discordant for SZ). All SZ PMPSs were elevated in SZ participants relative to HCs, with the score calculated at a p-value threshold of 1Â Ã—Â 10<sup>-5</sup> accounting for the greatest amount of variance. All PMPSs were elevated in SZ relative to BD and none of the PMPSs were increased in BD, or in a combined cohort of BD and SZ cases, relative to HCs. PMPSs were also not associated with positive or negative symptom severity. That this SZ-derived PMPSs was elevated in SZ, but not BD, suggests that epigenome-wide methylation patterns may represent distinct pathophysiology that is yet to be elucidated.",

The effect of such a stressor on health could potentially be mediated via epigenetics. In this study we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to assess the association between levels of PD with genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in SSA migrants. The Illumina 450â€‰K DNA-methylation array was used on whole blood samples of 340 Ghanaian adults residing in three European cities from the cross-sectional Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. PD was assessed using sum scores of the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS). Differentially methylated positions and regions (DMPs and DMRs) were identified through linear regression analysis. Two hypo-methylated DMPs, namely cg13986138 (CYFIP1) and cg10316525(ANKRD63), were found to be associated with PD. DMR analysis identified 47 regions associated with the PD. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first EWAS for PD in first generation SSA migrants. We identified two DMPs associated with PD. Whether these associations underlie a consequence or causal effect within the scope of biological functionality needs additional research.",

DNA methylation is a major epigenetic mechanism that may contribute to the variation in BMD and may mediate the effects of genetic and environmental factors of osteoporosis. In this study, we performed an epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis in peripheral blood monocytes of 118 Caucasian women with extreme BMD values. Further, we developed and implemented a novel analytical framework that integrates Mendelian randomization with genetic fine mapping and colocalization to evaluate the causal relationships between DNA methylation and BMD phenotype. We identified 2,188 differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) between the low and high BMD groups and distinguished 30 DMCs that may mediate the genetic effects on BMD. The causal relationship was further confirmed by eliminating the possibility of horizontal pleiotropy, linkage effect and reverse causality. The fine-mapping analysis determined 25 causal variants that are most likely to affect the methylation levels at these mediator DMCs. The majority of the causal methylation quantitative loci and DMCs reside within cell type-specific histone mark peaks, enhancers, promoters, promoter flanking regions and CTCF binding sites, supporting the regulatory potentials of these loci. The established causal pathways from genetic variant to BMD phenotype mediated by DNA methylation provide a gene list to aid in designing future functional studies and lead to a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the variation of BMD.",

In this study, we performed an EWAS of PTSD in a cohort of Veterans (nâ€‰=â€‰378 lifetime PTSD cases and 135 controls) from the Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) cohort assessed using the Illumina EPIC Methylation BeadChip which assesses DNAm at more than 850,000 sites throughout the genome. Our model included covariates for ancestry, cell heterogeneity, sex, age, and a smoking score based on DNAm at 39 smoking-associated CpGs. We also examined in EPIC-based DNAm data generated from pre-frontal cortex (PFC) tissue from the National PTSD Brain Bank (nâ€‰=â€‰72). The analysis of blood samples yielded one genome-wide significant association with PTSD at cg19534438 in the gene G0S2 (pâ€‰=â€‰1.19â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-7</sup>, p<sub>adj</sub>â€‰=â€‰0.048). This association was replicated in an independent PGC-PTSD-EWAS consortium meta-analysis of military cohorts (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0024). We also observed association with the smoking-related locus cg05575921 in AHRR despite inclusion of a methylation-based smoking score covariate (pâ€‰=â€‰9.16â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-6</sup>), which replicates a previously observed PGC-PTSD-EWAS association (Smith et al. 2019), and yields evidence consistent with a smoking-independent effect. The top 100 EWAS loci were then examined in the PFC data. One of the blood-based PTSD loci, cg04130728 in CHST11, which was in the top 10 loci in blood, but which was not genome-wide significant, was significantly associated with PTSD in brain tissue (in blood pâ€‰=â€‰1.19â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-5</sup>, p<sub>adj</sub>â€‰=â€‰0.60, in brain, pâ€‰=â€‰0.00032 with the same direction of effect).

Emerging evidence suggests that DNAm age can be tissue-specific and female breast tissue ages faster than other parts of the body. The Horvath clock, which estimates DNAm age across multiple tissues, has been shown to be poorly calibrated in breast issue. We aim to develop a model to estimate breast tissue-specific DNAm age. Genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing data were generated for 459 normal, 107 tumor, and 45 paired adjacent-normal breast tissue samples. We determined a novel set of 286 breast tissue-specific clock CpGs using penalized linear regression and developed a model to estimate breast tissue-specific DNAm age. The model was applied to estimate breast tissue-specific DNAm age in different breast tissue types and in tumors with distinct clinical characteristics to investigate cancer-related aging effects. Our estimated breast tissue-specific DNAm age was highly correlated with chronological age (r = 0.88; p = 2.9 Ã— 10<sup>-31</sup>) in normal breast tissue. Breast tumor tissue samples exhibited a positive epigenetic age acceleration, where DNAm age was on average 7â€‰years older than respective chronological age (p = 1.8 Ã— 10<sup>-8</sup>). In age-matched analyses, tumor breast tissue appeared 12 and 13â€‰years older in DNAm age than adjacent-normal and normal breast tissue (p = 4.0 Ã— 10<sup>-6</sup> and 1.0 Ã— 10<sup>-6</sup>, respectively). Both HER2+ and hormone-receptor positive subtypes demonstrated significant acceleration in DNAm ages (p = 0.04 and 3.8 Ã— 10<sup>-6</sup>, respectively), while no apparent DNAm age acceleration was observed for triple-negative breast tumors. We observed a non-linear pattern of epigenetic age acceleration with breast tumor grade. In addition, early-staged tumors showed a positive epigenetic age acceleration (p = 0.003) while late-staged tumors exhibited a non-significant negative epigenetic age acceleration (p = 0.10). The intended applications for this model are wide-spread and have been shown to provide biologically meaningful results for cancer-related aging effects in breast tumor tissue. Future studies are warranted to explore whether breast tissue-specific epigenetic age acceleration is predictive of breast cancer development, treatment response, and survival as well as the clinical utility of whether this model can be extended to blood samples.",

Rapid increase in throughput and reduction in cost per cell now allow this technology to be applied to large-scale population genetics studies.

We identified 273 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotides in girls and 67 CpGs in boys that were related to puberty and that were replicable in two other investigations. Previously, 457 CpGs (not gender-specific) and 347 (in girls) and 50 (in boys), respectively, were found to be associated with puberty, according to investigations of studies from Denmark (20 girls and 31 boys) and North America (30 girls and 25 boys). The study was based on a birth cohort of 1456 participants born in 1989/90, with follow-up at age 10 and 18Â years. The follow-up included 470 participants with information on DNAm and age of pubertal onset (244 girls and 226 boys). Age of pubertal onset was ascertained retrospectively at age 18Â years. Using the Pubertal Development Scale, both genders were asked about ages of onset of growth spurt, body hair growth and skin changes. Ages at voice deepening and growth of facial hair were inquired from boys; ages at breast development and menarche from girls. Blood samples were collected at 10 and 18Â years of age. DNA was extracted using a standard salting out procedure. The methylation level for each CpG site was assessed using one of two different platforms. DNAm was measured by a ratio of intensities denoted as <i>Î²</i> values for each CpG site. After quality control, 349â€‰455 CpG sites were available for analysis. <i>M</i> values were calculated (log2(<i>Î²</i>/(1-<i>Î²</i>)) to approximate a normal distribution, and their levels were adjusted for blood cell proportions. Linear mixed models were applied to test the association between age of pubertal markers and repeated measurement of DNAm at 10 and 18Â years. In girls, a total of 63â€‰019 CpGs statistically significantly changed after occurrence of any of the five pubertal events and 13â€‰487 were changed subsequent to all five events: the respective number is boys were 3072 and 301. To further exclude false-positive findings, we investigated which CpGs were replicable in prior studies from Denmark or North America, resulting in 273 replicable CpG in girls and 67 CpGs in boys (236 and 68 genes, respectively). Most identified genes are known to be related to biological processes of puberty; however, genetic polymorphisms of only four of these genes were previously linked to pubertal markers in humans. The relative age of pubertal onset to the age of DNAm measurements does not allow causal inference, since DNAm at an earlier age may have affected the pubertal age or pubertal age may have altered later DNAm. This investigation concentrates on autosomes. CpGs on X and Y chromosomes are not included in the current study. Assessment of biological processes involved in pubertal transitions should include epigenetic information. Differential DNAm related to puberty needs to be investigated to determine whether it can act as an early marker for adult diseases known to be associated with puberty. This work was supported by NIH grants R03HD092776 (Epigenetic characterization of pubertal transitions) and R01AI121226.

Although the specific mechanisms driving these responses have not been well-characterized, they are hypothesized to involve the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We quantified genome-wide levels of DNA methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) longitudinally collected from a cohort of elderly patients undergoing major surgery, comparing samples collected at baseline to those collected immediately post-operatively and at discharge from hospital. We identified acute changes in measured DNA methylation at sites annotated to immune system genes, paralleling changes in serum-levels of markers including C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6) measured in the same individuals. Many of the observed changes in measured DNA methylation were consistent across different types of major surgery, although there was notable heterogeneity between surgery types at certain loci. The acute changes in measured DNA methylation induced by surgery are relatively stable in the post-operative period, generally persisting until discharge from hospital. Our results highlight the dramatic alterations in gene regulation induced by invasive surgery, primarily reflecting upregulation of the immune system in response to trauma, wound healing and anaesthesia.",

This study performs a discovery and validation epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) for circulating lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Whole-blood DNA methylation profiles were assessed in a cohort of 1020 elderly individuals using the Illumina EPIC array and independent validation in 359 elderly males using the Illumina 450Â k array. Plasma Lp(a) was measured using an apolipoprotein(a)-size-independent ELISA. Epigenome-wide rank regression analysis identified and validated a single CpG site, cg17028067 located in intron 1 of the LPA gene, that was significantly associated with plasma Lp(a) levels after correction for multiple testing. Genotyping of the site identified a relatively uncommon SNP (rs76735376, MAF &lt;0.02) at the CpG site that largely explained the observed methylation effect. Rs76735376 is an expression quantitative trait loci for the LPA gene and could affect expression by altering enhancer activity. This EWAS for plasma Lp(a) identified a single CpG site within LPA. This association is due to an uncommon, but highly effective genetic variant, which was not in significant linkage disequilibrium with other variants known to influence Lp(a) levels or apo(a) isoform size. This study highlights the utility of CpG site methylation to identify potentially important genetic associations that would not be readily apparent in a comparable size genetic association study.",

Here, we explore the causal nature and predictive utility of DNA methylation measured in peripheral blood with BMI and cardiometabolic traits. Analyses were conducted across the life course using the ARIES cohort of mothers (n = 792) and children (n = 906), for whom DNA methylation and genetic profiles and BMI at multiple time points (3 in children at birth, in childhood and in adolescence; 2 in mothers during pregnancy and in middle age) were available. Genetic and DNA methylation scores for BMI were derived using published associations between BMI and DNA methylation and genotype. Causal relationships between methylation and BMI were assessed using Mendelian randomisation and cross-lagged models. The DNA methylation scores in adult women explained 10% of extant BMI variance. However, less extant variance was explained by scores generated in the same women during pregnancy (2% BMI variance) and in older children (15-17â€‰years; 3% BMI variance). Similarly, little extant variance was explained in younger children (at birth and at 7â€‰years; 1% and 2%, respectively). These associations remained following adjustment for smoking exposure and education levels. The DNA methylation score was found to be a poor predictor of future BMI using linear and cross-lagged models, suggesting that DNA methylation variation does not cause later variation in BMI. However, there was some evidence to suggest that BMI is predictive of later DNA methylation. Mendelian randomisation analyses also support this direction of effect, although evidence is weak. Finally, we find that DNA methylation scores for BMI are associated with extant cardiometabolic traits independently of BMI and genetic score. The age-specific nature of DNA methylation associations with BMI, lack of causal relationship and limited predictive ability of future BMI indicate that DNA methylation is likely influenced by BMI and might more accurately be considered a biomarker of BMI and related outcomes rather than a predictor. Future epigenome-wide association studies may benefit from further examining associations between early DNA methylation and later health outcomes.",

Interestingly, the mutation frequency of CGIs is not uniform with a significantly higher C:Gâ€‰&gt;â€‰T:A substitution rate for intragenic CGIs compared to other types. For non-CGI CpGs, the mutation rate was positively correlated with the distance from the nearest CGI up to 2â€‰kb.

Applying single-cell sequencing to murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, we observed that these mutations disrupt hematopoietic differentiation, causing opposite shifts in the frequencies of erythroid versus myelomonocytic progenitors following Tet2 or Dnmt3a loss. Notably, these shifts trace back to transcriptional priming skews in uncommitted hematopoietic stem cells. To reconcile genome-wide DNAme changes with specific erythroid versus myelomonocytic skews, we provide evidence in support of differential sensitivity of transcription factors due to biases in CpG enrichment in their binding motif. Single-cell transcriptomes with targeted genotyping showed similar skews in transcriptional priming of DNMT3A-mutated human clonal hematopoiesis bone marrow progenitors. These data show that DNAme shapes the topography of hematopoietic differentiation, and support a model in which genome-wide methylation changes are transduced to differentiation skews through biases in CpG enrichment of the transcription factor binding motif.",

The leading genetic variants at stroke risk loci identified to date explain roughly 1-2% of stroke heritability. Most of these single nucleotide polymorphisms are situated within a regulatory sequence marked by DNase I hypersensitivity sites, which would indicate involvement of an epigenetic mechanism.<b>Objective</b>. To detect epigenetic variants associated to stroke occurrence and stroke subtypes.<b>Methods and Results</b>. A two-stage case-control epigenome-wide association study was designed. The discovery sample with 401 samples included 218 ischemic stroke (IS) patients, assessed at Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, Spain) and 183 controls from the REGICOR cohort. In two independent samples (N=226 and N=166), we replicated 22 CpG sites differentially methylated in IS in 21 loci, including 2 CpGs in locus <i>ZFHX3</i>, which includes known genetic variants associated with stroke. The pathways associated to these loci are inflammation and angiogenesis. The meta-analysis identified 384 differentially methylated CpGs, including loci of known stroke and vascular risk genetic variants, enriched by loci involved in lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, circadian clock, and glycolysis pathways.<b>Conclusions</b>. We identified a set of 22 CpGs in 21 loci associated with IS. Our analysis suggests that DNA methylation changes may contribute to orchestrating gene expression that contributes to IS.",

DNA methylation outlier burden (the number of such outlier sites per individual) increases exponentially with age. However, these findings have been observed in small samples.

Significant confounders of both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between outlier burden and age included white blood cell proportions, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and batch effects. In Generation Scotland, the increase in epigenetic outlier burden with age was not purely an artefact of an increase in DNA methylation level variability with age (epigenetic drift). Log<sub>10</sub>-transformed DNA methylation outlier burden in Generation Scotland was not related to self-reported, or family history of, age-related diseases, and it was not heritable (SNP-based heritability of 4.4%, p = 0.18). Finally, DNA methylation outlier burden was not significantly related to survival in either of the Lothian Birth Cohorts individually or in the meta-analysis after correction for multiple testing (HR<sub>meta</sub> = 1.12; 95% CI<sub>meta</sub> = [1.02; 1.21]; p<sub>meta</sub> = 0.021). These findings suggest that, while it does not associate with ageing-related health outcomes, DNA methylation outlier burden does track chronological ageing and may also relate to survival. DNA methylation outlier burden may thus be useful as a marker of biological ageing.",

However, exploiting ctDNA to determine how a patient's cancer is evolving in order to aid clinical decisions remains difficult. This is because ctDNA is a mix of fragmented alleles, and the contribution of different cancer deposits to ctDNA is largely unknown. Profiling ctDNA almost invariably requires prior knowledge of what genomic alterations to track. Here, we leverage on a rapid autopsy programme to demonstrate that unbiased genomic characterisation of several metastatic sites and concomitant ctDNA profiling at whole-genome resolution reveals the extent to which ctDNA is representative of widespread disease. We also present a methylation profiling method that allows tracking evolutionary changes in ctDNA at single-molecule resolution without prior knowledge. These results have critical implications for the use of liquid biopsies to monitor cancer evolution in humans and guide treatment.",

Currently considered the most commonly used illicit psychoactive drug, recreational cannabis is legal in 11 states and Washington, DC, and male use is an important and understudied concern. Questions remain, however, about the potential long-term consequences of this exposure and how cannabis might impact the epigenetic integrity of sperm in such a way that could influence the health and development of offspring. This review summarizes cannabis use and potency in the USA, provides a brief overview of DNA methylation as an epigenetic mechanism that is vulnerable in sperm to environmental exposures including cannabis, and summarizes studies that have examined the effects of parental exposure to cannabis or delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the main psychoactive component of cannabis) on the epigenetic profile of the gametes and behavior of offspring. These studies have demonstrated significant changes to the sperm DNA methylome following cannabis use in humans, and THC exposure in rats. Furthermore, the use of rodent models has shown methylation and behavioral changes in rats born to fathers exposed to THC or synthetic cannabinoids, or to parents who were both exposed to THC. These data substantiate an urgent need for additional studies assessing the effects of cannabis exposure on childhood health and development. This is especially true given the current growing state of cannabis use in the USA.",

Due to analytical difficulties in dealing with sex differences in X-chromosome content and X-inactivation (XCI) in females, this has not been explored for the X chromosome. Using data from middle age to elderly individuals (age 55+â€‰years) from two Danish cohorts of monozygotic twins and the Scottish Lothian Birth Cohort 1921, we conducted an X-chromosome-wide analysis of age-associated DNA methylation patterns with consideration of stably inferred XCI status. Through analysing and comparing sex-specific X-linked DNA methylation changes over age late in life, we identified 123, 293 and 55 CpG sites significant (FDRâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) only in males, only in females and in both sexes of Danish twins. All findings were significantly replicated in the two Danish twin cohorts. CpG sites escaping XCI are predominantly de-methylated with increasing age across cohorts. In contrast, CpGs highly methylated in both sexes are methylated even further with increasing age. Among the replicated sites in Danish samples, 16 (13%), 24 (8.2%) and 3 (5.5%) CpGs were further validated in LBC1921 (FDRâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05).

Many aspects of the transcriptional regulation of LPA are poorly understood and the role of epigenetics has not been addressed yet. Therefore, we conducted an epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation on Lp(a) levels in two population-based studies (total n = 2208). We identified a CpG site in the LPA promoter which was significantly associated with Lp(a) concentrations. Surprisingly, the identified CpG site was found to overlap the SNP rs76735376. We genotyped this SNP de-novo in three studies (total n = 7512). The minor allele of rs76735376 (1.1% minor allele frequency) was associated with increased Lp(a) values (p = 1.01e-59) and explained 3.5% of the variation of Lp(a). Statistical mediation analysis showed that the effect on Lp(a) is rather originating from the base change itself and is not mediated by DNA methylation levels. This finding is supported by eQTL data from 208 liver tissue samples from the GTEx project, which shows a significant association of the rs76735376 minor allele with increased LPA expression. To evaluate, whether the association signal at rs76735376 may actually be derived from a stronger eQTL signal in LD with this SNP, eQTL association results of all correlated SNPs (r2â‰¥0.1) were integrated with genetic association results. This analysis pinpointed to rs10455872 as the potential trigger of the effect of rs76735376. Furthermore, both SNPs coincide with short apo(a) isoforms. Adjusting for both, rs10455872 and the apo(a) isoforms diminished the effect size of rs76735376 to 5.38 mg/dL (p = 0.0463). This indicates that the effect of rs76735376 can be explained by both an independent effect of the SNP and a strong correlation with rs10455872 and apo(a) isoforms.",

Epigenetic and transcriptional variation could influence this phenotypic discordance. Investigation of intra-pair differences in molecular markers and a given phenotype in monozygotic twins controls most of the genetic contribution, enabling studies of the molecular features of the phenotype. This study aimed to identify genes associated with cognition in later life using integrated enrichment analyses of the results of blood-derived intra-pair epigenome-wide and transcriptome-wide association analyses of cognition in 452 middle-aged and old-aged monozygotic twins (56-80 years). Integrated analyses were performed with an unsupervised approach using KeyPathwayMiner, and a supervised approach using the KEGG and Reactome databases. The supervised approach identified several enriched gene sets, including &quot;neuroactive ligand receptor interaction&quot; (<i>p</i>-value = 1.62<sup>âˆ—</sup>10-2), &quot;Neurotrophin signaling&quot; (<i>p</i>-value = 2.52<sup>âˆ—</sup>10-3), &quot;Alzheimer's disease&quot; (<i>p</i>-value = 1.20<sup>âˆ—</sup>10-2), and &quot;long-term depression&quot; (<i>p</i>-value = 1.62<sup>âˆ—</sup>10-2). The unsupervised approach resulted in a 238 gene network, including the Alzheimer's disease gene <i>APP</i> (Amyloid Beta Precursor Protein) as an exception node, and several novel candidate genes. The strength of the unsupervised method is that it can reveal previously uncharacterized sub-pathways and detect interplay between biological processes, which remain undetected by the current supervised methods. In conclusion, this study identified several previously reported cognition genes and pathways and, additionally, puts forward novel candidates for further verification and validation.",

However, few studies have sought to directly optimize a predictor of CVD risk. Furthermore, it is challenging to train multivariate models across multiple studies in the presence of study- or batch effects. Methods and Results Here, we analyzed existing DNA methylation data collected using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 microarray to create a predictor of CVD risk across 3 cohorts: Women's Health Initiative, Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort, and Lothian Birth Cohorts. We trained Cox proportional hazards-based elastic net regressions for incident CVD separately in each cohort and used a recently introduced cross-study learning approach to integrate these individual scores into an ensemble predictor. The methylation-based risk score was associated with CVD time-to-event in a held-out fraction of the Framingham data set (hazard ratio per SD=1.28, 95% CI, 1.10-1.50) and predicted myocardial infarction status in the independent REGICOR (Girona Heart Registry) data set (odds ratio per SD=2.14, 95% CI, 1.58-2.89). These associations remained after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and were similar to those from elastic net models trained on a directly merged data set. Additionally, we investigated interactions between the methylation-based risk score and both genetic and biochemical CVD risk, showing preliminary evidence of an enhanced performance in those with less traditional risk factor elevation. Conclusions This investigation provides proof-of-concept for a genome-wide, CVD-specific epigenomic risk score and suggests that DNA methylation data may enable the discovery of high-risk individuals who would be missed by alternative risk metrics.",

Genomic methylation patterns are dynamically maintained, with DNA methyltransferases mediating inheritance of methyl marks onto nascent DNA over cycles of replication. A recently developed experimental technique employing immunoprecipitation of bromodeoxyuridine labeled nascent DNA followed by bisulfite sequencing (Repli-BS) measures post-replication temporal evolution of cytosine methylation, thus enabling genome-wide monitoring of methylation maintenance. In this work, we combine statistical analysis and stochastic mathematical modeling to analyze Repli-BS data from human embryonic stem cells. We estimate site-specific kinetic rate constants for the restoration of methyl marks on &gt;10 million uniquely mapped cytosines within the CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) dinucleotide context across the genome using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We find that post-replication remethylation rate constants span approximately two orders of magnitude, with half-lives of per-site recovery of steady-state methylation levels ranging from shorter than ten minutes to five hours and longer. Furthermore, we find that kinetic constants of maintenance methylation are correlated among neighboring CpG sites. Stochastic mathematical modeling provides insight to the biological mechanisms underlying the inference results, suggesting that enzyme processivity and/or collaboration can produce the observed kinetic correlations. Our combined statistical/mathematical modeling approach expands the utility of genomic datasets and disentangles heterogeneity in methylation patterns arising from replication-associated temporal dynamics versus stable cell-to-cell differences.",

DNA methylation can predict chronological age, and advanced methylation-predicted age beyond chronological age (DNA methylation age acceleration) is associated with ACEs, adverse mental and physical health, and elevated diurnal and baseline salivary cortisol. Childhood adversity is also associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which produces the neuroendocrine hormone cortisol. It remains unknown whether these associations are specific to certain types of adversity. Herein, we investigate the associations of ACEs with DNA methylation age acceleration and plasma cortisol in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort. In this study of the children in ALSPAC, we used multiple linear regression to examine associations of cumulative exposure to ACE, as well as exposure to ten individual types of ACEs, with Horvath-estimated DNA methylation age acceleration and with baseline plasma cortisol. The ten ACEs were those included in the World Health Organization's ACE International Questionnaire. Data on ACEs were prospectively collected from age 0-14â€‰years. DNA methylation age acceleration and plasma cortisol were measured at mean 17.1â€‰years and 15.5â€‰years, respectively. We included 974 UK children in the present study. Exposure to four or more ACEs compared to zero was associated with DNA methylation age acceleration in girls (Î², 95% CI = 1.65, 0.25 to 3.04â€‰years) but not in boys (Î², 95% CI = - 0.11, - 1.48 to 1.26â€‰years). Also, in girls, emotional abuse and physical abuse were each associated with DNA methylation age acceleration (Î², 95% CI = 1.20, 0.15 to 2.26â€‰years and Î², 95% CI = 1.22, 0.06 to 2.38â€‰years, respectively). No other ACEs were associated with accelerated DNA methylation age in either sex. Associations were also null between ACE and cortisol, and cortisol and DNA methylation age acceleration.

Prior studies have shown that DNA methylation (DNA-M) is associated with lung function and DNA-M at some cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide sites (CpGs) changes over time. This study examined whether changes of DNA-M at lung-function-related CpGs are associated with changes in lung function during adolescence for each gender, and if so, the biological significance of the detected CpGs. Genome-scale DNA-M was measured in peripheral blood samples at ages 10 (nâ€‰=â€‰330) and 18â€‰years (nâ€‰=â€‰476) from the Isle of Wight (IOW) birth cohort in UnitedÂ Kingdom, using Illumina Infinium arrays (450â€‰K and EPIC). Spirometry was conducted at both ages. A training and testing method was used to screen 402,714 CpGs for their potential associations with lung function. Linear regressions were applied to assess the association of changes in lung function with changes of DNA-M at those CpGs potentially related to lung function. Adolescence-related and personal and family-related confounders were included in the model. The analyses were stratified by gender. Multiple testing was adjusted by controlling false discovery rate of 0.05. Findings were further examined in two independent birth cohorts, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Children and Parents (ALSPAC) and the Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiology (BAMSE) cohort. Pathway analyses were performed on genes to which the identified CpGs were mapped. For females, 42 CpGs showed statistically significant associations with change in FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, but none for change in FEV<sub>1</sub> or FVC. No CpGs were identified for males. In replication analyses, 16 and 21 of the 42 CpGs showed the same direction of associations among the females in the ALSPAC and BAMSE cohorts, respectively, with 11 CpGs overlapping across all the three cohorts. Through pathway analyses, significant biological processes were identified that have previously been related to lung function development. The detected 11 CpGs in all three cohorts have the potential to serve as the candidate epigenetic markers for changes in lung function during adolescence in females.",

Consequently, epigenetic dysregulation can cause several diseases, such as cancer, obesity, diabetes, autism, and imprinting disorders. We validate three methods for the generation of epigenome-edited mice using the dCas9-SunTag and single-chain variable fragment-TET1 catalytic domain. We generate model mice for Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), an imprinting disorder, by target-specific DNA demethylation in the H19 differentially methylated region. Like SRS patients, these mice show H19 upregulation and Igf2 downregulation, leading to severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation. This is the first report of an imprinting disease model animal generated by targeted demethylation of specific loci of the epigenome in fertilized eggs.

Here we show that the expression pattern of a major human APR, that is <i>C-reactive protein</i> (<i>CRP</i>), is casually determined by DNMT3A and TET2-tuned promoter methylation status. <i>CRP</i> features a CpG-poor promoter with its CpG motifs located in binding sites of STAT3, C/EBP-Î² and NF-ÎºB. These motifs are highly methylated at the resting state, but undergo STAT3- and NF-ÎºB-dependent demethylation upon cytokine stimulation, leading to markedly enhanced recruitment of C/EBP-Î² that boosts <i>CRP</i> expression. Withdrawal of cytokines, by contrast, results in a rapid recovery of promoter methylation and termination of <i>CRP</i> induction. Further analysis suggests that reversible methylation also regulates the expression of highly inducible genes carrying CpG-poor promoters with APRs as representatives. Therefore, these CpG-poor promoters may evolve CpG-containing TF binding sites to harness dynamic methylation for prompt and reversible responses.",

GAS5 has been implicated in regulating transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor and has multiple functions related to apoptosis, immune function and various cancers. Endophenotypic analyses using peripheral cortisol levels and neuroimaging paradigms showed that methylomic variation in GAS5 network-related probes were associated with stress phenotypes. Postmortem brain analyses documented increased GAS5 expression inÂ the amygdala of individuals with AUD.

However, the mechanisms underlying these impacts are poorly understood. DNA methylation, a crucial epigenetic modification, is susceptible to environmental factors and likely involved in these processes. We conducted a whole-genome bisulfite sequencing study on 120 participants from a highly polluted region (HPR) and a less polluted region (LPR) in China, where the HPR had much higher concentrations of five air pollutants (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and CO) (fold difference 1.6 to 6.6 times; P value 1.80E-07 to 3.19E-23). Genome-wide methylation analysis revealed 371 DMRs in subjects from the two areas and these DMRs were located primarily in gene regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. Gene enrichment analysis showed that DMR-related genes were significantly enriched in diseases related to pulmonary disorders and cancers and in biological processes related to mitochondrial assembly and cytokine production. Further, HPR participants showed a higher mtDNA copy number. Of those identified DMRs, 15 were significantly correlated with mtDNA copy number. Finally, cytokine assay indicated that an increased plasma interleukin-5 level was associated with greater air pollution. Taken together, our findings suggest that exposure to long-term ambient air pollution can lead to alterations in DNA methylation whose functions relate to mitochondria and immune responses.",

Yet, how DNAm patterns across the genome relate to different sleep outcomes, and whether these associations overlap with mental health is currently unknown. Here, we investigated associations of DNAm with sleep and mental health in a pediatric population. This cross-sectional study included 465 10-year-old children (51.3% female) from the Generation R Study. Genome-wide DNAm levels were measured using the Illumina 450K array (peripheral blood). Sleep problems were assessed from self-report and mental health outcomes from maternal questionnaires. Wrist actigraphy was used in 188 11-year-old children to calculate sleep duration and midpoint sleep. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify highly comethylated DNAm 'modules', which were tested for associations with sleep and mental health outcomes. We identified 64 DNAm modules, one of which associated with sleep duration after covariate and multiple testing adjustment. This module included CpG sites spanning 9 genes on chromosome 17, including MAPT - a key regulator of Tau proteins in the brain involved in neuronal function - as well as genes previously implicated in sleep duration. Follow-up analyses suggested that DNAm variation in this region is under considerable genetic control and shows strong blood-brain concordance. DNAm modules associated with sleep did not overlap with those associated with mental health. We identified one DNAm region associated with sleep duration, including genes previously reported by recent GWAS studies.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammatory cytokine easily measured in blood. It has clinical value due to its reliability as a biomarker for systemic inflammation and can indicate cellular injury and disease severity. Elevated levels of CRP in adulthood are associated with alterations in DNA methylation. However, no studies have prospectively investigated the relationship between maternal CRP levels and newborn DNA methylation measured by microarray in cord blood with reasonable epigenome-wide coverage. Importantly, the timing of inflammation exposure during pregnancy may also result in different effects. Thus, our objective was to evaluate this prospective association of CRP levels measured during multiple periods of pregnancy and in cord blood at delivery which was available in one cohort (i.e., Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction trial), and also to conduct a meta-analysis with available data at one point in pregnancy from three other cohorts from the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics consortium (PACE). Secondarily, the impact of maternal randomization to low dose aspirin prior to pregnancy on methylation was assessed. Maternal CRP levels were not associated with newborn DNA methylation regardless of gestational age of measurement (i.e., CRP at approximately 8, 20, and 36â€‰weeks among 358 newborns in EAGeR). There also was no association in the meta-analyses (all p &gt; 0.5) with a larger sample size (n = 1603) from all participating PACE cohorts with available CRP data from first trimester (&lt; 18â€‰weeks gestation). Randomization to aspirin was not associated with DNA methylation. On the other hand, newborn CRP levels were significantly associated with DNA methylation in the EAGeR trial, with 33 CpGs identified (FDR corrected p &lt; 0.05) when both CRP and methylation were measured at the same time point in cord blood. The top 7 CpGs most strongly associated with CRP resided in inflammation and vascular-related genes. Maternal CRP levels measured during each trimester were not associated with cord blood DNA methylation. Rather, DNA methylation was associated with CRP levels measured in cord blood, particularly in gene regions predominately associated with angiogenic and inflammatory pathways.

To better characterize maturational changes in DNAm patterns in these cells, we profile the DNAm landscape at single-base resolution across the first two decades of human neocortical development in NeuN+ neurons using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and compare them to non-neurons (primarily glia) and prenatal homogenate cortex.

RESULTS:
We show that DNAm changes more dramatically during the first 5 years of postnatal life than during the entire remaining period. We further refine global patterns of increasingly divergent neuronal CpG and CpH methylation (mCpG and mCpH) into six developmental trajectories and find that in contrast to genome-wide patterns, neighboring mCpG and mCpH levels within these regions are highly correlated. We integrate paired RNA-seq data and identify putative regulation of hundreds of transcripts and their splicing events exclusively by mCpH levels, independently from mCpG levels, across this period. We finally explore the relationship between DNAm patterns and development of brain-related phenotypes and find enriched heritability for many phenotypes within identified DNAm features.

CONCLUSIONS:
By profiling DNAm changes in NeuN-sorted neurons over the span of human cortical development, we identify novel, dynamic regions of DNAm that would be masked in homogenate DNAm data; expand on the relationship between CpG methylation, CpH methylation, and gene expression; and find enrichment particularly for neuropsychiatric diseases in genomic regions with cell type-specific, developmentally dynamic DNAm patterns.",
Yes,20200601,ewas,32453742,Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression patterns reflect genetic ancestry and environmental differences across the Indonesian archipelago.,PLoS Genet,"Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous country, host to striking levels of human diversity, regional patterns of admixture, and varying degrees of introgression from both Neanderthals and Denisovans. However, it has been largely excluded from the human genomics sequencing boom of the last decade. To serve as a benchmark dataset of molecular phenotypes across the region, we generated genome-wide CpG methylation and gene expression measurements in over 100 individuals from three locations that capture the major genomic and geographical axes of diversity across the Indonesian archipelago. Investigating between- and within-island differences, we find up to 10.55% of tested genes are differentially expressed between the islands of Sumba and New Guinea. Variation in gene expression is closely associated with DNA methylation, with expression levels of 9.80% of genes correlating with nearby promoter CpG methylation, and many of these genes being differentially expressed between islands. Genes identified in our differential expression and methylation analyses are enriched in pathways involved in immunity, highlighting Indonesia's tropical role as a source of infectious disease diversity and the strong selective pressures these diseases have exerted on humans. Finally, we identify robust within-island variation in DNA methylation and gene expression, likely driven by fine-scale environmental differences across sampling sites. Together, these results strongly suggest complex relationships between DNA methylation, transcription, archaic hominin introgression and immunity, all jointly shaped by the environment. This has implications for the application of genomic medicine, both in critically understudied Indonesia and globally, and will allow a better understanding of the interacting roles of genomic and environmental factors shaping molecular and complex phenotypes.",

The foetal genetic component has been previously shown to contribute significantly to the timing of birth, yet little is known about the identity and behaviour of individual genes. The aim of this study was to test the extent genome-wide DNA methylation levels in umbilical cord blood were associated with gestational age at birth (GA). Findings were validated in an independent sample and evidence for the regulation of gene expression was evaluated for <i>cis</i> gene relationships in specimens with multi-omic data. Genome-wide DNA methylation, measured by the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450Â K BeadChip, was associated with GA for 2,372 CpG probes (5% FDR) in both the Pregnancy, Race, Environment, Genes (PREG) and Newborn Epigenetic Study (NEST) cohorts. Significant probes mapped to 1,640 characterized genes and an association with nearby gene expression measures obtained by the Affymetrix HG-133A microarray was found for 11 genes. Differentially methylated positions were enriched for actively transcribed and enhancer chromatin states, were predominately located outside of CpG islands, and mapped to genes enriched for inflammation and innate immunity ontologies. In both PREG and NEST, the first principal component derived from these probes explained approximately one-half (58.1% and 47.8%, respectively) of the variation in GA. Gene pathways identified are consistent with the hypothesis of pathogen detection and response by the immune system to elicit premature labour as a consequence of unscheduled inflammation.",

We performed a comprehensive Epigenome-Wide Association Study (EWAS) to identify associations between breastfeeding and DNAm patterns in childhood. We analysed DNAm data from the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort at birth, 10, 18 and 26 years. The feeding method was categorized as breastfeeding duration &gt;3 months and &gt;6 months, and exclusive breastfeeding duration &gt;3 months. EWASs using robust linear regression were performed to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in breastfed and non-breastfed children at age 10 (false discovery rate of 5%). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using comb-p. The persistence of significant associations was evaluated in neonates and individuals at 18 and 26 years. Two DMPs, in genes <i>SNX25</i> and <i>LINC00840</i>, were significantly associated with breastfeeding duration &gt;6 months at 10 years and was replicated for &gt;3 months of exclusive breastfeeding. Additionally, a significant DMR spanning the gene <i>FDFT1</i> was identified in 10-year-old children who were exposed to a breastfeeding duration &gt;3 months. None of these signals persisted to 18 or 26 years. This study lends further support for a suggestive role of DNAm in the known benefits of breastfeeding on a child's future health.",

Exploring the genetic and non-genetic contributors to AD pathogenesis is essential to better understand its underlying biological mechanisms, and to develop novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. We investigated potential genetically driven epigenetic heterogeneity of AD through summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR), which combined results from our previous genome-wide association analyses with those from two publicly available methylation quantitative trait loci studies of blood and brain tissue samples. We found that 152 probes corresponding to 113 genes were epigenetically associated with AD at a Bonferroni-adjusted significance level of 5.49E-07. Of these, 10 genes had significant probes in both brain-specific and blood-based analyses. Comparing males vs. females and hypertensive vs. non-hypertensive subjects, we found that 22 and 79 probes had group-specific associations with AD, respectively, suggesting a potential role for such epigenetic modifications in the heterogeneous nature of AD. Our analyses provided stronger evidence for possible roles of four genes (i.e., <i>AIM2</i>, <i>C16orf80</i>, <i>DGUOK</i>, and <i>ST14</i>) in AD pathogenesis as they were also transcriptionally associated with AD. The identified associations suggest a list of prioritized genes for follow-up functional studies and advance our understanding of AD pathogenesis.",

These observations have been difficult to explain owing to a global loss of the majority of known epigenetic marks present in parental chromosomes during primordial germ cell development and after fertilization. By integrating previously published BS-seq, DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq data collected during multiple stages of primordial germ cell and pre-implantation development, we find that the methylation status of the majority of CpGs genome-wide is restored after global de-methylation, despite the fact that global CpG methylation drops to 10% in primordial germ cells and 20% in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. We estimate the proportion of such CpGs with preserved methylation status to be 78%. Further, we find that CpGs at sites bound by transcription factors during the global re-methylation phases of germline and embryonic development remain hypomethylated across all developmental stages observed. On the other hand, CpGs at sites not bound by transcription factors during the global re-methylation phase have high methylation levels prior to global de-methylation, become de-methylated during global de-methylation, and then become re-methylated. The results suggest that transcription factors can act as carriers of epigenetic information during germ cell and pre-implantation development by ensuring that the methylation status of CpGs is maintained. These findings provide the basis for a mechanistic description of trans-generational inheritance of epigenetic information in mammals.",

Psychiatry,"Variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with lifestyle factors such as smoking and body mass index (BMI) but there has been little research exploring its ability to identify individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Using penalised regression on genome-wide CpG methylation, we tested whether DNAm risk scores (MRS), trained on 1223 MDD cases and 1824 controls, could discriminate between cases (nâ€‰=â€‰363) and controls (nâ€‰=â€‰1417) in an independent sample, comparing their predictive accuracy to polygenic risk scores (PRS). The MRS explained 1.75% of the variance in MDD (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.338, pâ€‰=â€‰1.17â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-7</sup>) and remained associated after adjustment for lifestyle factors (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.219, pâ€‰=â€‰0.001, R<sup>2</sup>â€‰=â€‰0.68%). When modelled alongside PRS (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.384, pâ€‰=â€‰4.69â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-9</sup>) the MRS remained associated with MDD (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.327, pâ€‰=â€‰5.66â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-7</sup>).

Heritability analyses found additive genetic effects explained 22% of variance in the MRS, with a further 19% explained by pedigree-associated genetic effects and 16% by the shared couple environment. Smoking status was also strongly associated with MRS (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.440, pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰2â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-16</sup>). After removing smokers from the training set, the MRS strongly associated with BMI (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.053, pâ€‰=â€‰0.021). We tested the association of MRS with 61 behavioural phenotypes and found that whilst PRS were associated with psychosocial and mental health phenotypes, MRS were more strongly associated with lifestyle and sociodemographic factors.

We conducted ethnicity-specific and trans-ethnic epigenome-wide association analyses for diet quality and leukocyte-derived DNA methylation at over 400,000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) in five population-based cohorts including 6,662 European ancestry (EA), 2,702 African ancestry (AA), and 360 Hispanic ancestry (HA) participants. For diet-associated CpGs identified in epigenome-wide analyses, we conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine their relations to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and examined their longitudinal associations with all-cause mortality. <b>Results</b> - We identified 30 CpGs associated with either MDS or AHEI, or both, in EA participants. Among these CpGs, 12 CpGs were significantly associated with all-cause mortality (Bonferroni corrected p-value &lt; 1.6Ã—10<sup>-3</sup>). Hypermethylation of cg18181703 (<i>SOCS3</i>) was associated with higher scores of both MDS and AHEI and lower risk for all-cause mortality (p-value = 5.7Ã—10<sup>-15</sup>). Ten additional diet-associated CpGs were nominally associated with all-cause mortality (p-value &lt; 0.05). MR analysis revealed eight putatively causal associations for six CpGs with four CVD risk factors (BMI, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, and type 2 diabetes; Bonferroni corrected MR p-value &lt; 4.5Ã—10<sup>-4</sup>). For example, hypermethylation of cg11250194 (<i>FADS2</i>) was associated with lower triglyceride concentrations (MR p-value = 1.5Ã—10<sup>-14</sup>) and hypermethylation of cg02079413 (<i>SNORA54</i>; <i>NAP1L4</i>) was associated with BMI (corrected MR p-value = 1Ã—10<sup>-6</sup>). <b>Conclusions</b> - Habitual diet quality was associated with differential peripheral leukocyte DNA methylation levels of 30 CpGs, most of which were also associated with multiple health outcomes, in EA individuals.

It is known for its high heritability (&gt;â€‰60%) and involvement in most common morbidities, which makes it a potentially interesting biomarker. Large GWAS studies have already assessed polymorphisms related to VEGF-A. However, no previous research has provided epigenome-wide insight in regulation of VEGF-A. VEGF-A concentrations of healthy participants from the STANISLAS Family Study (n = 201) were comprehensively assessed for association with DNA methylation. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were determined in whole blood DNA using the 450K Infinium BeadChip Array (Illumina). VEGF-A concentration in PBMC extracts was detected using a high-sensitivity multiplex Cytokine Array (Randox Laboratories, UK). Epigenome-wide association analysis identified 41 methylation sites significantly associated with VEGF-A concentrations derived from PBMC extracts.

The placenta, a transient organ at the maternal-fetal interface, regulates fetal growth. Identifying genetic loci where DNA methylation in placenta is associated with birthweight can unravel genomic pathways that are dysregulated in aberrant fetal growth and cardiometabolic diseases in later life. We performed placental epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of birthweight in an ethnic diverse cohort of pregnant women (n = 301). Methylation at 15 cytosine-(phosphate)-guanine sites (CpGs) was associated with birthweight (false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;â€‰0.05). Methylation at four (26.7%) CpG sites was associated with placental transcript levels of 15 genes (FDR &lt;â€‰0.05), including genes known to be associated with adult lipid traits, inflammation and oxidative stress. Increased methylation at cg06155341 was associated with higher birthweight and lower FOSL1 expression, and lower FOSL1 expression was correlated with higher birthweight. Given the role of the FOSL1 transcription factor in regulating developmental processes at the maternal-fetal interface, epigenetic mechanisms at this locus may regulate fetal development. We demonstrated trans-tissue portability of methylation at four genes (MLLT1, PDE9A, ASAP2, and SLC20A2) implicated in birthweight by a previous study in cord blood. We also found that methylation changes known to be related to maternal underweight, preeclampsia and adult type 2 diabetes were associated with lower birthweight in placenta. We identified novel placental DNA methylation changes associated with birthweight.

OBJECTIVE:We performed mutually independent EWAS on transportation noise and air pollution exposures. METHODS:We used data from two time points of the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA) from 1,389 participants contributing 2,542 observations. We applied multiexposure linear mixed-effects regressions with participant-level random intercept to identify significant Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in relation to 1-y average aircraft, railway, and road traffic day-evening-night noise (Lden); nitrogen dioxide (NO2); and particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter <2.5?m (PM2.5). We performed candidate (CpG-based; cross-systemic phenotypes, combined into ""allostatic load"") and agnostic (DMR-based) pathway enrichment tests, and replicated previously reported air pollution EWAS signals. RESULTS:We found no statistically significant CpGs at false discovery rate <0.05. However, 14, 48, 183, 8, and 71 DMRs independently associated with aircraft, railway, and road traffic Lden; NO2; and PM2.5, respectively, with minimally overlapping signals. Transportation Lden and air pollutants tendentially associated with decreased and increased methylation, respectively. We observed significant enrichment of candidate DNA methylation related to C-reactive protein and body mass index (aircraft, road traffic Lden, and PM2.5), renal function and ""allostatic load"" (all exposures). Agnostic functional networks related to cellular immunity, gene expression, cell growth/proliferation, cardiovascular, auditory, embryonic, and neurological systems development were enriched. We replicated increased methylation in cg08500171 (NO2) and decreased methylation in cg17629796 (PM2.5). CONCLUSIONS:Mutually independent DNA methylation was associated with source-specific transportation noise and air pollution exposures, with distinct and shared enrichments for pathways related to inflammation, cellular development, and immune responses.

Cadmium (Cd) has been associated with smoking-related health effects, and its concentration in tobacco smoke is higher in comparison with other metals. We studied the association of Cd and smoking exposures with human blood DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles. We also evaluated the implication of findings to relevant methylation pathways and the potential contribution of Cd exposure from smoking to explain the association between smoking and site-specific DNAm. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of urine Cd and self-reported smoking (current and former vs. never, and cumulative smoking dose) with blood DNAm in 790,026 CpGs (methylation sites) measured with the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC (Illumina Inc.) platform in 2,325 adults 45-74 years of age who participated in the Strong Heart Study in 1989-1991. In a mediation analysis, we estimated the amount of change in DNAm associated with smoking that can be independently attributed to increases in urine Cd concentrations from smoking. We also conducted enrichment analyses and <i>in silico</i> protein-protein interaction networks to explore the biological relevance of the findings. At a false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected level of 0.05, we found 6 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) for Cd; 288 and 17, respectively, for current and former smoking status; and 77 for cigarette pack-years. Enrichment analyses of these DMPs displayed enrichment of 58 and 6 Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes gene sets, respectively, including biological pathways for cancer and cardiovascular disease. In <i>in silico</i> protein-to-protein networks, we observed key proteins in DNAm pathways directly and indirectly connected to Cd- and smoking-DMPs. Among DMPs that were significant for both Cd and current smoking (annotated to PRSS23, AHRR, F2RL3, RARA, and 2q37.1), we found statistically significant contributions of Cd to smoking-related DNAm. Beyond replicating well-known smoking epigenetic signatures, we found novel DMPs related to smoking. Moreover, increases in smoking-related Cd exposure were associated with differential DNAm. Our integrative analysis supports a biological link for Cd and smoking-associated health effects, including the possibility that Cd is partly responsible for smoking toxicity through epigenetic changes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6345.",

To ascertain whether childhood neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with differences in DNA methylation by age 18 years. This longitudinal cohort study analyzed data from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a nationally representative birth cohort of children born between 1994 and 1995 in England and Wales and followed up from age 5 to 18 years. Data analysis was performed from March 15, 2019, to June 30, 2019. High-resolution neighborhood data (indexing deprivation, dilapidation, disconnection, and dangerousness) collected across childhood. DNA methylation in whole blood was drawn at age 18 years. Associations between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and methylation were tested using 3 prespecified approaches: (1) testing probes annotated to candidate genes involved in biological responses to growing up in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods and investigated in previous epigenetic research (stress reactivity-related and inflammation-related genes), (2) polyepigenetic scores indexing differential methylation in phenotypes associated with growing up in disadvantaged neighborhoods (obesity, inflammation, and smoking), and (3) a theory-free epigenome-wide association study. A total of 1619 participants (806 female individuals [50%]) had complete neighborhood and DNA methylation data. Children raised in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods exhibited differential DNA methylation in genes involved in inflammation (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.12; 95% CI, 0.06-0.19; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001) and smoking (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.18; 95% CI, 0.11-0.25; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001) but not obesity (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11; Pâ€‰=â€‰.12). An epigenome-wide association study identified multiple CpG sites at an arraywide significance level of Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰1.16â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7 in genes involved in the metabolism of hydrocarbons. Associations between neighborhood disadvantage and methylation were small but robust to family-level socioeconomic factors and to individual-level tobacco smoking. Children raised in more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods appeared to enter young adulthood epigenetically distinct from their less disadvantaged peers. This finding suggests that epigenetic regulation may be a mechanism by which the childhood neighborhood environment alters adult health.",

During puberty, a drastic neuroendocrine shift signals physical changes resulting in robust sex differences in human physiology. Here, we explore how shifting patterns of DNA methylation may inform these pathways of biological plasticity during the pubertal transition. In this study we analyzed DNA methylation (DNAm) in saliva at two time points across the pubertal transition within the same individuals. Our purpose was to compare two domains of DNAm patterns that may inform processes of sexual differentiation 1) sex related sites, which demonstrated differences between males from females and 2) time related sites in which DNAm shifted significantly between timepoints. We further explored the correlated network structure sex and time related DNAm networks and linked these patterns to pubertal stage, assays of salivary testosterone, a reliable diagnostic of free, unbound hormone that is available to act on target tissues, and overlap with androgen response elements. Sites that differed by biological sex were largely independent of sites that underwent change across puberty. Time-related DNAm sites, but not sex-related sites, formed correlated networks that were associated with pubertal stage. Both time and sex DNAm networks reflected salivary testosterone levels that were enriched for androgen response elements, with sex-related DNAm networks being informative of testosterone levels above and beyond biological sex later in the pubertal transition. These results inform our understanding of the distinction between sex- and time-related differences in DNAm during the critical period of puberty and highlight a novel linkage between correlated patterns of sex-related DNAm and levels of salivary testosterone.",
No,20200615,mosaicism,32460841,The rate and spectrum of mosaic mutations during embryogenesis revealed by RNA sequencing of 49 tissues.,Genome Med,"Mosaic mutations acquired during early embryogenesis can lead to severe early-onset genetic disorders and cancer predisposition, but are often undetectable in blood samples. The rate and mutational spectrum of embryonic mosaic mutations (EMMs) have only been studied in few tissues, and their contribution to genetic disorders is unknown. Therefore, we investigated how frequent mosaic mutations occur during embryogenesis across all germ layers and tissues. Mosaic mutation detection in 49 normal tissues from 570 individuals (Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) cohort) was performed using a newly developed multi-tissue, multi-individual variant calling approach for RNA-seq data. Our method allows for reliable identification of EMMs and the developmental stage during which they appeared. The analysis of EMMs in 570 individuals revealed that newborns on average harbor 0.5-1 EMMs in the exome affecting multiple organs (1.3230â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-8</sup> per nucleotide per individual), a similar frequency as reported for germline de novo mutations. Our multi-tissue, multi-individual study design allowed us to distinguish mosaic mutations acquired during different stages of embryogenesis and adult life, as well as to provide insights into the rate and spectrum of mosaic mutations. We observed that EMMs are dominated by a mutational signature associated with spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines and the number of cell divisions. After birth, cells continue to accumulate somatic mutations, which can lead to the development of cancer. Investigation of the mutational spectrum of the gastrointestinal tract revealed a mutational pattern associated with the food-borne carcinogen aflatoxin, a signature that has so far only been reported in liver cancer. In summary, our multi-tissue, multi-individual study reveals a surprisingly high number of embryonic mosaic mutations in coding regions, implying novel hypotheses and diagnostic procedures for investigating genetic causes of disease and cancer predisposition.",
No,20200615,review,32514149,Unravelling the complex genetics of common kidney diseases: from variants to mechanisms.,Nat Rev Nephrol,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of loci associated with kidney-related traits such as glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, hypertension, electrolyte and metabolite levels. However, these impressive, large-scale mapping approaches have not always translated into an improved understanding of disease or development of novel therapeutics. GWAS have several important limitations. Nearly all disease-associated risk loci are located in the non-coding region of the genome and therefore, their target genes, affected cell types and regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. Genome-scale approaches can be used to identify associations between DNA sequence variants and changes in gene expression (quantified through bulk and single-cell methods), gene regulation and other molecular quantitative trait studies, such as chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, protein expression and metabolite levels. Data obtained through these approaches, used in combination with robust computational methods, can deliver robust mechanistic inferences for translational exploitation. Understanding the genetic basis of common kidney diseases means having a comprehensive picture of the genes that have a causal role in disease development and progression, of the cells, tissues and organs in which these genes act to affect the disease, of the cellular pathways and mechanisms that drive disease, and of potential targets for disease prevention, detection and therapy.",

Reprod.,"Does women's age affect the DNA methylation (DNAm) profile differently in mural granulosa cells (MGCs) from other somatic cells? Accumulation of epimutations by age and a higher number of age-related differentially methylated regions (DMR) in MGCs were found compared to leukocytes from the same woman, suggesting that the MGCs have a distinctive epigenetic profile. The mechanisms underlying the decline in women's fertility from the mid-30s remain to be fully elucidated. The DNAm age of many healthy tissues changes predictably with and follows chronological age, but DNAm age in some reproductive tissues has been shown to depart from chronological age (older: endometrium; younger: cumulus cells, spermatozoa). This study is a multicenter cohort study based on retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data and material derived from healthy women undergoing IVF or ICSI treatment following ovarian stimulation with antagonist protocol. One hundred and nineteen women were included from September 2016 to June 2018 from four clinics in Denmark and Sweden. Blood samples were obtained from 118 healthy women with varying ovarian reserve status. MGCs were collected from 63 of the 119 women by isolation from pooled follicles immediately after oocyte retrieval. DNA from leukocytes and MGCs was extracted and analysed with a genome-wide methylation array. Data from the methylation array were processed using the ENmix package. Subsequently, DNAm age was calculated using established and tailored age predictors and DMRs were analysed with the DMRcate package. Using established age predictors, DNAm age in MGCs was found to be considerable younger and constant (average: 2.7Â years) compared to chronological age (average: 33.9Â years). A Granulosa Cell clock able to predict the age of both MGCs (average: 32.4Â years) and leukocytes (average: 38.8Â years) was successfully developed. MGCs differed from leukocytes in having a higher number of epimutations (PÂ =â€‰0.003) but predicted telomere lengths unaffected by age (Pearson's correlation coefficientâ€‰=â€‰-0.1, PÂ =â€‰0.47). DMRs associated with age (age-DMRs) were identified in MGCs (nÂ =â€‰335) and in leukocytes (nÂ =â€‰1) with a significant enrichment in MGCs for genes involved in RNA processing (45 genes, PÂ =â€‰3.96â€‰Ã—â€‰10-08) and gene expression (152 genes, PÂ =â€‰2.3â€‰Ã—â€‰10-06). The top age-DMRs included the metastable epiallele VTRNA2-1, the DNAm regulator ZFP57 and the anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) gene. The apparent discordance between different epigenetic measures of age in MGCs suggests that they reflect difference stages in the MGC life cycle. N/A. No gene expression data were available to associate with the epigenetic findings. The MGCs are collected during ovarian stimulation, which may influence DNAm; however, no correlation between FSH dose and number of epimutations was found. Our findings underline that the somatic compartment of the follicle follows a different methylation trajectory with age than other somatic cells. The higher number of epimutations and age-DMRs in MGCs suggest that their function is affected by age.

No,20200713,biomarker,32580755,Refinement of cg05575921 demethylation response in nascent smoking.,Clin Epigenetics,"The initiation of adolescent smoking is difficult to detect using carbon monoxide or cotinine assays. Previously, we and others have shown that the methylation of cg05575921 is an accurate predictor of adult smoking status. But the dose and time dependency of the demethylation response to smoking initiation in adolescents is not yet well understood. To this end, we conducted three consecutive annual in-person interviews and biological samplings of 448 high school students (wave 1 (W1)-wave 3 (W3)). At W1 (n = 448), 62 subjects reported using tobacco and 72 subjects reported using cannabis at least once in their life-time with 38 and 20 subjects having a positive cotinine and cannabinoid levels, respectively, at W1 intake. At W3 (n = 383), 67 subjects reported using tobacco and 60 subjects reported using cannabis at least once with 75 and 60 subjects having positive cotinine and cannabinoid levels, respectively, at W3. Subjects with undetectable cotinine levels at all three-time waves had stable levels of cg05575921 methylation throughout the study (88.7% at W1 and 88.8% at W3, n = 149), while subjects with positive cotinine levels at all 3 time points manifested a steady decrease in cg05575921 methylation (81.8% at W1 and 71.3% at the W3, n = 12). In those subjects with an affirmative smoking self-report at W3 (n = 17), the amount of demethylation at cg05575921 was correlated with time and intensity of smoking. We conclude that cg05575921 methylation is a sensitive, dose-dependent indicator of early stages of smoking, and may help to identify smokers in the early stages of smoking.",

The causal pathology of AD (accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau), precedes hallmark symptoms of dementia by more than a decade, necessitating development of early diagnostic markers of disease onset, particularly for new drugs that aim to modify disease processes. To evaluate differentially methylated positions (DMPs) as novel blood-based biomarkers of AD, we used a subset of 653 individuals with peripheral blood (PB) samples in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) consortium. The selected cohort of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and age-matched healthy controls (CN) all had imaging, genetics, transcriptomics, cerebrospinal protein markers, and comprehensive clinical records, providing a rich resource of concurrent multi-omics and phenotypic information on a well-phenotyped subset of ADNI participants. In this manuscript, we report cross-diagnosis differential peripheral DNA methylation in a cohort of AD, MCI, and age-matched CN individuals with longitudinal DNA methylation measurements. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) were performed using a mixed model with repeated measures over time with a P value cutoff of 1 Ã— 10<sup>-5</sup> to test contrasts of pairwise differential peripheral methylation in AD vs CN, AD vs MCI, and MCI vs CN. The most highly significant differentially methylated loci also tracked with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Differentially methylated loci were enriched near brain and neurodegeneration-related genes (e.g., BDNF, BIN1, APOC1) validated using the genotype tissue expression project portal (GTex). Our work shows that peripheral differential methylation between age-matched subjects with AD relative to healthy controls will provide opportunities to further investigate and validate differential methylation as a surrogate of disease. Given the inaccessibility of brain tissue, the PB-associated methylation marks may help identify the stage of disease and progression phenotype, information that would be central to bringing forward successful drugs for AD.",

There is growing evidence that epigenetic dysregulation participates in ADHD. Given that only a limited number of epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of ADHD have been conducted so far and they have mainly focused on pediatric and population-based samples, we performed an EWAS in a clinical sample of adults with ADHD. We report one CpG site and four regions differentially methylated between patients and controls, which are located in or near genes previously involved in autoimmune diseases, cancer or neuroticism. Our sensitivity analyses indicate that smoking status is not responsible for these results and that polygenic risk burden for ADHD does not greatly impact the signatures identified. Additionally, we show an overlap of our EWAS findings with genetic signatures previously described for ADHD and with epigenetic signatures for smoking behavior and maternal smoking. These findings support a role of DNA methylation in ADHD and emphasize the need for additional efforts in larger samples to clarify the role of epigenetic mechanisms on ADHD across the lifespan.",

Overlapping sites between each factor and survival were then assessed using two-step Mendelian randomization to assess whether methylation at these positions causally affected survival. Using the MethylationEPIC array in an OPC dataset, we found novel CpG associations with smoking, alcohol consumption and ~ 3-year survival. We found no CpG associations below our multiple testing threshold associated with HPV16 E6 serological response (used as a proxy for HPV infection). CpG site associations below our multiple-testing threshold (P<sub>Bonferroni</sub> &lt; 0.05) for both a prognostic factor and survival were observed at four gene regions: SPEG (smoking), GFI1 (smoking), PPT2 (smoking) and KHDC3L (alcohol consumption).

Total Environ.,"The Anniston Community Health Survey (ACHS-I) was initially conducted from 2005 to 2007 to assess polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposures in Anniston, Alabama residents. In 2014, a follow-up study (ACHS-II) was conducted to measure the same PCBs as in ACHS-I and additional compounds e.g., polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-like non-ortho (cPCBs) substituted PCBs. In this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), we examined the associations between PCDD, PCDF, and PCB exposures and DNA methylation. Whole blood DNA methylation was measured using Illumina EPIC arrays (n=292). We modeled lipid-adjusted toxic equivalencies (TEQs) for: Î£Dioxins (sum of 28 PCDDs, PCDFs, cPCBs, and mPCBs), PCDDs, PCDFs, cPCBs, and mPCBs using robust multivariable linear regression adjusting for age, race, sex, smoking, bisulfite conversion batch, and estimated percentages of six blood cell types.

Relatively little is known regarding the pathogenesis of gouty inflammation. To investigate the epigenetic background of gouty inflammation independent of hyperuricemia and its relationship to genetics, 69 gout patients and 1455 non-gout controls were included. Promoter-wide methylation was profiled with EPIC array. Whole-genome sequencing data were included for genetic and methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) analyses and causal inference tests. Identified loci were subjected to co-methylation analysis and functional localization with DNase hypersensitivity and histone marks analysis. An expression database was queried to clarify biologic functions of identified loci. A transcription factor dataset was integrated to identify transcription factors coordinating respective expression. In total, seven CpG loci involved in interleukin-1Î² production survived genetic/meQTL analyses, or causal inference tests. None had a significant relationship with various metabolic traits. Additional analysis suggested gouty inflammation, instead of hyperuricemia, provides the link between these CpG sites and gout. Six (<i>PGGT1B</i>, <i>INSIG1</i>, <i>ANGPTL2</i>, <i>JNK1</i>, <i>UBAP1</i>, and <i>RAPTOR</i>) were novel genes in the field of gout. One (<i>CNTN5</i>) was previously associated with gouty inflammation. Transcription factor mapping identified several potential transcription factors implicated in the link between differential methylation, interleukin-1Î² production, and gouty inflammation. In conclusion, this study revealed several novel genes specific to gouty inflammation and provided enhanced insight into the biological basis of gouty inflammation.",

No,20200713,methods,32580727,New targeted approaches for epigenetic age predictions.,BMC Biol.,"Age-associated DNA methylation changes provide a promising biomarker for the aging process. While genome-wide DNA methylation profiles enable robust age-predictors by integration of many age-associated CG dinucleotides (CpGs), there are various alternative approaches for targeted measurements at specific CpGs that better support standardized and cost-effective high-throughput analysis. In this study, we utilized 4647 Illumina BeadChip profiles of blood to select CpG sites that facilitate reliable age-predictions based on pyrosequencing. We demonstrate that the precision of DNA methylation measurements can be further increased with droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). In comparison, bisulfite barcoded amplicon sequencing (BBA-seq) gave slightly lower correlation between chronological age and DNA methylation at individual CpGs, while the age-predictions were overall relatively accurate. Furthermore, BBA-seq data revealed that the correlation of methylation levels with age at neighboring CpG sites follows a bell-shaped curve, often associated with a CTCF binding site. We demonstrate that within individual BBA-seq reads the DNA methylation at neighboring CpGs is not coherently modified, but reveals a stochastic pattern. Based on this, we have developed a new approach for epigenetic age predictions based on the binary sequel of methylated and non-methylated sites in individual reads, which reflects heterogeneity in epigenetic aging within a sample. Targeted DNA methylation analysis at few age-associated CpGs by pyrosequencing, BBA-seq, and particularly ddPCR enables high precision of epigenetic age-predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the stochastic evolution of age-associated DNA methylation patterns in BBA-seq data enables epigenetic clocks for individual DNA strands.",

Methods to correct these batch effects are error-prone, as previous findings have shown. Here, we demonstrate how using the R function ComBat to correct simulated Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450â€‰K) and Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Kit (EPIC) DNAm data can lead to a large number of false positive results under certain conditions. We further provide a detailed assessment of the consequences for the highly relevant problem of p-value inflation with subsequent false positive findings after application of the frequently used ComBat method. Using ComBat to correct for batch effects in randomly generated samples produced alarming numbers of false discovery rate (FDR) and Bonferroni-corrected (BF) false positive results in unbalanced as well as in balanced sample distributions in terms of the relation between the outcome of interest variable and the technical position of the sample during the probe measurement. Both sample size and number of batch factors (e.g. number of chips) were systematically simulated to assess the probability of false positive findings. The effect of sample size was simulated using nÂ =â€‰48 up to nÂ =â€‰768 randomly generated samples. Increasing the number of corrected factors led to an exponential increase in the number of false positive signals. Increasing the number of samples reduced, but did not completely prevent, this effect. Using the approach described, we demonstrate, that using ComBat for batch correction in DNAm data can lead to false positive results under certain conditions and sample distributions. Our results are thus contrary to previous publications, considering a balanced sample distribution as unproblematic when using ComBat. We do not claim completeness in terms of reporting all technical conditions and possible solutions of the occurring problems as we approach the problem from a clinician's perspective and not from that of a computer scientist. With our approach of simulating data, we provide readers with a simple method to assess the probability of false positive findings in DNAm microarray data analysis pipelines.",

There is functional interventional evidence for a role of DNA methylation and the histone post-translational modifications-histone methylation, acetylation and crotonylation-in the pathogenesis of kidney disease, including diabetic kidney disease. Readers of epigenetic marks, such as bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) proteins, are also therapeutic targets. Thus, the BD2 selective BET inhibitor apabetalone was the first epigenetic regulator to undergo phase-3 clinical trials in diabetic kidney disease with an endpoint of kidney function. The direct therapeutic modulation of epigenetic features is possible through pharmacological modulators of the specific enzymes involved and through the therapeutic use of the required substrates. Of further interest is the characterization of potential indirect effects of nephroprotective drugs on epigenetic regulation. Thus, SGLT2 inhibitors increase the circulating and tissue levels of Î²-hydroxybutyrate, a molecule that generates a specific histone modification, Î²-hydroxybutyrylation, which has been associated with the beneficial health effects of fasting. To what extent this impact on epigenetic regulation may underlie or contribute to the so-far unclear molecular mechanisms of cardio- and nephroprotection offered by SGLT2 inhibitors merits further in-depth studies.",

This study aimed to assess if and to what extent such risk stratification could be enhanced by additional consideration of genetic risk scores (GRSs) and epigenetic risk scores defined by DNA methylation. We conducted a nested case-control study of 143 incident LC cases and 1460 LC-free controls within a prospective cohort of 9949 participants aged 50-75â€‰years with 14-year follow-up. Lifetime smoking history was obtained in detail at recruitment. We built a GRS based on 31 previously identified LC-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a DNA methylation score (MRS) based on methylation of 151 previously identified smoking-associated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) loci. We evaluated associations of GRS and MRS with LC incidence by logistic regression models, controlling for age, sex, smoking status, and pack-years. We compared the predictive performance of models based on pack-years alone with models additionally including GRS and/or MRS using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). GRS and MRS showed moderate and strong associations with LC risk even after comprehensive adjustment for smoking history (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] comparing highest with lowest quartile 1.93 [1.05-3.71] and 5.64 [2.13-17.03], respectively). Similar associations were also observed within the risk groups of ever and heavy smokers. Addition of GRS and MRS furthermore strongly enhanced LC prediction beyond prediction by pack-years (increase of optimism-corrected AUC among heavy smokers from 0.605 to 0.654, NRI 26.7%, p = 0.0106, IDI 3.35%, p = 0.0036), the increase being mostly attributable to the inclusion of MRS.

This has led to an increase in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of complex traits, particularly those that are poorly explained by previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the genome and epigenome are intertwined, e.g., DNA methylation is known to affect gene expression through, for example, genomic imprinting. There is thus a need to go beyond single-omics data analyses and develop interaction models that allow a meaningful combination of information from EWAS and GWAS. We present two new methods for genetic association analyses that treat offspring DNA methylation levels as environmental exposure. Our approach searches for statistical interactions between SNP alleles and DNA methylation (G Ã—Me) and between parent-of-origin effects and DNA methylation (PoO Ã—Me), using case-parent triads or dyads. We use summarized methylation levels over nearby genomic region to ease biological interpretation. The methods were tested on a dataset of parent-offspring dyads, with EWAS data on the offspring. Our results showed that methylation levels around a SNP can significantly alter the estimated relative risk. Moreover, we show how a control dataset can identify false positives. The new methods, G Ã—Me and PoO Ã—Me, integrate DNA methylation in the assessment of genetic relative risks and thus enable a more comprehensive biological interpretation of genome-wide scans. Moreover, our strategy of condensing DNA methylation levels within regions helps overcome specific disadvantages of using sparse chip-based measurements.

The acute responses of many inflammatory biomarkers mean they may provide an unreliable picture of the chronicity of inflammation. Recently, a large-scale epigenome-wide association study identified DNA methylation correlates of C-reactive protein (CRP)-a widely used acute-phase inflammatory biomarker. DNA methylation is thought to be relatively stable in the short term, marking it as a potentially useful signature of exposure. We utilise a DNA methylation-based score for CRP and investigate its trajectories with age, and associations with cognitive ability in comparison with serum CRP and a genetic CRP score in a longitudinal study of older adults (n = 889) and a large, cross-sectional cohort (n = 7028). We identified no homogeneous trajectories of serum CRP with age across the cohorts, whereas the epigenetic CRP score was consistently found to increase with age (standardised Î² = 0.07 and 0.01) and to do so more rapidly in males compared to females. Additionally, the epigenetic CRP score had higher test-retest reliability compared to serum CRP, indicating its enhanced temporal stability. Higher serum CRP was not found to be associated with poorer cognitive ability (standardised Î² = - 0.08 and - 0.05); however, a consistent negative association was identified between cognitive ability and the epigenetic CRP score in both cohorts (standardised Î² = - 0.15 and - 0.08). An epigenetic proxy of CRP may provide a more reliable signature of chronic inflammation, allowing for more accurate stratification of individuals, and thus clearer inference of associations with incident health outcomes.",

However, most of the previous studies utilized post-diagnostic blood DNA which may be markers of disease rather than susceptibility. In addition, only a few studies have evaluated the predictive potential of differential DNA methylation in CRC in a prospective cohort and on a genome-wide basis. The aim of this study was to identify a potential panel of DNA methylation biomarkers in peripheral blood that is associated with CRC risk and therefore serve as epigenetic biomarkers of disease susceptibility. DNA methylation profile of a nested case-control study with 166 CRC and 424 healthy normal subjects were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially methylated markers were identified by moderated t-statistics. The DNA methylation panel was constructed by stepwise logistic regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator in the training dataset. A methylation risk score (MRS) model was constructed and the association between MRS and CRC risk assessed. We identified 48 differentially methylated CpGs sites, of which 33 were hypomethylated. Of these, sixteen-CpG based MRS that was associated with CRC risk (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.68, 95% CI: 2.13, 3.38, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰Â 0.0001) was constructed. This association is confirmed in the testing dataset (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.02, 95% CI: 1.48, 2.74, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰Â 0.0001) and persisted in both males and females, younger and older subjects, short and long time-to-diagnosis. The MRS also predicted CRC with AUC 0.82 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.88), indicating high accuracy. Our study has identified a novel DNA methylation panel that is associated with CRC and could, if validated be useful for the prediction of CRC risk in the future.",

In the Taizhou Longitudinal Study (TZL), 123,115 healthy subjects provided plasma samples for long-term storage and were then monitored for cancer occurrence. Here we report the preliminary results of PanSeer, a noninvasive blood test based on circulating tumor DNA methylation, on TZL plasma samples from 605 asymptomatic individuals, 191 of whom were later diagnosed with stomach, esophageal, colorectal, lung or liver cancer within four years of blood draw. We also assay plasma samples from an additional 223 cancer patients, plus 200 primary tumor and normal tissues. We show that PanSeer detects five common types of cancer in 88%Â (95% CI: 80-93%) of post-diagnosis patients with a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 93-98%), We also demonstrate that PanSeer detects cancer in 95%Â (95% CI: 89-98%) of asymptomatic individuals who were later diagnosed, though future longitudinal studies are required to confirm this result. These results demonstrate that cancer can be non-invasively detected up to four years before current standard of care.",

We report the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of smoking in human postmortem brain, focusing on nucleus accumbens (NAc) as a key brain region in developing and reinforcing addiction. Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC array data from 221 decedents (120 European American [23% current smokers], 101 African American [26% current smokers]) were analyzed. DNAm by smoking (current vs. nonsmoking) was tested within each ancestry group using robust linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, cell-type proportion, DNAm-derived negative control principal components (PCs), and genotype-derived PCs. The resulting ancestry-specific results were combined via meta-analysis. We extended our NAc findings, using published smoking EWAS results in blood, to identify DNAm smoking effects that are unique (tissue-specific) vs. shared between tissues (tissue-shared). We identified seven CpGs (false discovery rateâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05), of which three CpGs are located near genes previously indicated with blood-based smoking DNAm biomarkers: ZIC1, ZCCHC24, and PRKDC. The other four CpGs are novel for smoking-related DNAm changes: ABLIM3, APCDD1L, MTMR6, and CTCF. None of the seven smoking-related CpGs in NAc are driven by genetic variants that share association signals with predisposing genetic risk variants for smoking, suggesting that the DNAm changes reflect consequences of smoking. Our results provide the first evidence for smoking-related DNAm changes in human NAc, highlighting CpGs that were undetected as peripheral biomarkers and may reflect brain-specific responses to smoking exposure.",

These health challenges are now thought to be reflected in epigenetic modifications to DNA molecules, such as DNA methylation, which can alter gene expression. Here we report the results of three Epigenome Wide Association Studies (EWAS) in which we assessed the differential methylation of DNA (obtained from peripheral blood) associated with three adiposity phenotypes (BMI, waist circumference, and impedance-measured percent body fat) among American Indian adult participants in the Strong Heart Study. We found differential methylation at 8264 CpG sites associated with at least one of our three response variables. Of the three adiposity proxies we measured, waist circumference had the highest number of associated differentially methylated CpGs, while percent body fat was associated with the lowest. Because both waist circumference and percent body fat relate to physiology, we focused interpretations on these variables. We found a low degree of overlap between these two variables in our gene ontology enrichment and Differentially Methylated Region analyses, supporting that waist circumference and percent body fat measurements represent biologically distinct concepts. We interpret these general findings to indicate that highly significant regions of the genome (DMR) and synthesis pathways (GO) in waist circumference analyses are more likely to be associated with the presence of visceral/abdominal fat than more general measures of adiposity. Our findings confirmed numerous CpG sites previously found to be differentially methylated in association with adiposity phenotypes, while we also found new differentially methylated CpG sites and regions not previously identified.",

However, no large-scale study has investigated whether site-specific DNA methylation predicts all-cause mortality. We used the Illumina-HumanMethylation450-BeadChip to identify blood DNA methylation sites associated with all-cause mortality for 12, 300 participants in 12 Cohorts of the Heart and Aging Research in Genetic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium. Over an average 10-year follow-up, there were 2,561 deaths across the cohorts. Nine sites mapping to three intergenic and six gene-specific regions were associated with mortality (<i>P</i> &lt; 9.3x10<sup>-7</sup>) independently of age and other mortality predictors. Six sites (cg14866069, cg23666362, cg20045320, cg07839457, cg07677157, cg09615688)-mapping respectively to <i>BMPR1B, MIR1973, IFITM3, NLRC5</i>, and two intergenic regions-were associated with reduced mortality risk. The remaining three sites (cg17086398, cg12619262, cg18424841)-mapping respectively to <i>SERINC2, CHST12</i>, and an intergenic region-were associated with increased mortality risk. DNA methylation at each site predicted 5%-15% of all deaths. We also assessed the causal association of those sites to age-related chronic diseases by using Mendelian randomization, identifying weak causal relationship between cg18424841 and cg09615688 with coronary heart disease. Of the nine sites, three (cg20045320, cg07839457, cg07677157) were associated with lower incidence of heart disease risk and two (cg20045320, cg07839457) with smoking and inflammation in prior CHARGE analyses. Methylation of cg20045320, cg07839457, and cg17086398 was associated with decreased expression of nearby genes (<i>IFITM3, IRF, NLRC5, MT1, MT2, MARCKSL1</i>) linked to immune responses and cardiometabolic diseases.

An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) with exploratory pathway analysis may help identify potential pyrethroid-related health effects. We performed an exploratory EWAS of chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure using control participants' blood in the Parkinson's Environment and Genes Study in the Central Valley of California (NÂ =Â 237). We estimated associations of living and working near agricultural pyrethroid pesticide applications in the past 5 years (binary) with site-specific differential methylation, and used a false discovery rate (FDR) cut off of 0.05 for significance. We controlled for age, sex, education, cell count, and an ancestral marker for Hispanic ethnicity. We normalized methylation values for Type I/II probe bias using Beta-Mixture Quantile (BMIQ) normalization, filtered out cross-reactive probes, and evaluated for remaining bias with Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA). We also evaluated the effects of controlling for cell count and normalizing for Type I/II probe bias by comparing changes in effect estimates and p-values for the top hits across BMIQ and GenomeStudio normalization methods, and controlling for cell count. To facilitate broader interpretation, we annotated genes to the CpG sites and performed gene set overrepresentation analysis, using genes annotated to CpG sites that were associated with pyrethroids at a raw pÂ &lt;Â 0.05, and controlling for background representation of CpG sites on the chip. We did this for both a biological process context (Gene Ontology terms) using missMethyl, and a disease set context using WebGestalt. For these gene set overrepresentation analyses we also used an FDR cut off of 0.05 for significance of gene sets. After controlling for cell count and applying BMIQ normalization, 4 CpG sites were differentially methylated in relation to pyrethroid exposures. When using GenomeStudio's Illumina normalization, 415 CpG sites were differentially methylated, including all four identified with the BMIQ method. In the gene set overrepresentation analyses, we identified 6 GO terms using BMIQ normalization, and 76 using Illumina normalization, including the 6 identified by BMIQ. For disease sets, we identified signals for Alzheimer's disease, leukemia and several other cancers, diabetes, birth defects, and other diseases, for both normalization methods. We identified minimal changes in effect estimates after controlling for cell count, and controlling for cell count generally weakened p-values. BMIQ normalization, however, resulted in different beta coefficients and weakened p-values. Chronic ambient pyrethroid exposure is associated with differential methylation at CpG sites that annotate to a wide variety of disease states and biological mechanisms that align with prior research. However, this EWAS also implicates several novel diseases for future investigation, and highlights the relative importance of different background normalization methods in identifying associations.",

Gene expression changes have been found in post-mortem brain of suicide victims. However, it is not clear how in-vivo gene expression change confers risk for suicide. DNA methylation is a form of epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression. Our primary aim is to investigate genome-wide methylation in conferring risk for current suicidal ideation (SI) in schizophrenia. The presence of current SI and genome-wide methylation patterns were assessed in 107 patients with schizophrenia. DNA methylation has been measured in white blood cells as a possible peripheral biomarker of SI. SI was the primary outcome variable in a model including methylation status of white blood cells using the Illumina 450 array. We have tested the association with genome-wide methylation levels in 19 subjects with current SI and 88 subjects without current SI and we found that higher methylation level in the CpG cg06121808 located in the gene SLC20A1 on chromosome 2 was associated with current SI (pâ€‰=â€‰0.000003; beta differenceâ€‰=â€‰0.06). Furthermore, the distal promoter analysis showed that the gene SMPD2 was hypermethylated in suicide ideators (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0001; beta differenceâ€‰=â€‰0.02). Thus, molecular biomarkers could advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of stress-related SI.

Increased exposure to PCBs is associated with adverse health consequences throughout life, including type 2 diabetes and cancer. PCB exposure is also associated with alterations in epigenetic marks and gene transcription, which could lead to adverse health outcomes, but many of these are population-specific. To further investigate the association between PCB and epigenetic marks, DNA methylation was measured at 787,684 CpG sites in 641 peripheral blood samples from the Michigan Polybrominated Biphenyl (PBB) Registry. 1345 CpGs were associated with increased total PCB level after controlling for age, sex, and 24 surrogate variables (FDR &lt; 0.05). These CpGs were enriched in active promoter and transcription associated regions (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05), and in regions around the binding sites for transcription factors involved in xenobiotic metabolism and immune function (FDR &lt; 0.05). PCB exposure also associated with proportions of CD4T, NK, and granulocyte cell types, and with the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05), and the estimated effect sizes of PCB on the epigenome were correlated with the effect sizes previously reported in an epigenome-wide study of C-reactive protein (rÂ =Â 0.29; p =Â 2.22e-5), supporting previous studies on the association between PCB and immune dysfunction.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Placental epigenetic mechanisms may be involved, but no prior epigenome-wide studies have investigated the impact of maternal POPs on placental DNA methylation. We studied the association between maternal plasma POP concentration in early pregnancy and epigenome-wide placental DNA methylation among 260 pregnant women from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies. Our analysis focused on POPs with more than 80% plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification, including 3 organochlorine pesticides (hexachlorobenzene, trans-nonachlor, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), 1 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE 47), 3 polychlorinated biphenyls (138/158, 153, 180), and 6 poly- and perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) (perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA)). Using 5% false discovery rate, POPs were associated with a total of 214 differentially methylated CpG sites (nominal p values ranging from 2.61 Ã— 10<sup>-21</sup> to 2.11 Ã— 10<sup>-7</sup>). Out of the 214 CpG sites, 24 (11%) were significantly correlated with placental expression of 21 genes. Notably, higher PFUnDA was associated with increased methylation at 3 CpG sites (cg13996963, cg12089439, cg18145877) annotated to TUSC3, and increased methylation at those 3 CpG sites was correlated with decreased expression of TUSC3 in the placenta. Increased methylation at cg18145877 (TUSC3) and decreased expression of TUSC3 were correlated with shorter birth length. Out of the 214 CpG sites, methylation at 44 CpG sites was correlated (p value &lt; 0.10) with at least one neonatal anthropometry measure (i.e., birth weight, birth length, and head circumference). Seven CpG sites mediated (p value &lt; 0.05) the association between PBDE 47 and neonatal anthropometry measures. Genes annotating the top differentially methylated CpG sites were enriched in pathways related to differentiation of embryonic cells (PBDE 47) and in pathways related to brain size and brain morphology (PFASs). DNA methylation changes in the placenta were significantly associated with maternal plasma POPs concentration. The findings suggest that placental DNA methylation and gene expression mechanism may be involved in the prenatal toxicity of POPs and their association with neonatal anthropometry measures.",

However, the etiologies contributing to stability and change in DNA methylation have rarely been examined longitudinally. We considered DNA methylation in whole blood leukocyte DNA across a 10-year span in two samples of same-sex aging twins: (a) Swedish Adoption Twin Study of Aging (SATSA; NÂ =Â 53 pairs, 53% female; 62.9 and 72.5Â years, SDÂ =Â 7.2Â years); (b) Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins (LSADT; NÂ =Â 43 pairs, 72% female, 76.2 and 86.1Â years, SD=1.8Â years). Joint biometrical analyses were conducted on 358,836 methylation probes in common. Bivariate twin models were fitted, adjusting for age, sex, and country. Overall, results suggest genetic contributions to DNA methylation across 358,836 sites tended to be small and lessen across 10Â years (broad heritability MÂ =Â 23.8% and 18.0%) but contributed to stability across time while person-specific factors explained emergent influences across the decade. Aging-specific sites identified from prior EWAS and methylation age clocks were more heritable than background sites. The 5037 sites that showed the greatest heritable/familial-environmental influences (pÂ &lt;Â 1E-07) were enriched for immune and inflammation pathways while 2020 low stability sites showed enrichment in stress-related pathways. Across time, stability in methylation is primarily due to genetic contributions, while novel experiences and exposures contribute to methylation differences. Elevated genetic contributions at age-related methylation sites suggest that adaptions to aging and senescence may be differentially impacted by genetic background.",

A number of measures of biological age have been proposed which harness age-related changes in DNA methylation profiles. These measures include five 'epigenetic clocks' which provide an index of how much an individual's biological age differs from their chronological age at the time of measurement. The five clocks encompass methylation-based predictors of chronological age (HorvathAge, HannumAge), all-cause mortality (DNAm PhenoAge, DNAm GrimAge) and telomere length (DNAm Telomere Length). A sixth epigenetic measure of ageing differs from these clocks in that it acts as a speedometer providing a single time-point measurement of the pace of an individual's biological ageing. This measure of ageing is termed DunedinPoAm. In this study, we test the association between these six epigenetic measures of ageing and the prevalence and incidence of the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in high-income countries (n ? 9537, Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study).

Results: DNAm GrimAge predicted incidence of clinically diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease after 13 years of follow-up (hazard ratios = 2.22, 1.52 and 1.41, respectively). DunedinPoAm predicted the incidence of COPD and lung cancer (hazard ratios = 2.02 and 1.45, respectively). DNAm PhenoAge predicted incidence of type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio = 1.54). DNAm Telomere Length associated with the incidence of ischemic heart disease (hazard ratio = 0.80). DNAm GrimAge associated with all-cause mortality, the prevalence of COPD and spirometry measures at the study baseline. These associations were present after adjusting for possible confounding risk factors including alcohol consumption, body mass index, deprivation, education and tobacco smoking and surpassed stringent Bonferroni-corrected significance thresholds.

Conclusions: Our data suggest that epigenetic measures of ageing may have utility in clinical settings to complement gold-standard methods for disease assessment and management.",

Here, to address these questions as part of phase III of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), we mapped cohesin-mediated chromatin loops, using chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), and analysed gene expression in 24 diverse human cell types, including core ENCODE cell lines. Twenty-eight per cent of all chromatin loops vary across cell types; these variations modestlyÂ correlate with changes in gene expression and are effective at grouping cell types according to their tissue of origin. The connectivity of genes corresponds to different functional classes, with housekeeping genes having few contacts, and dosage-sensitive genes being more connected to enhancer elements.

At present, Alzheimer's disease can only be diagnosed at a very late stage when neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment is already irreversible. New early disease markers are needed for earlier and more efficient Alzheimer's disease intervention. To identify early disease markers, we implemented a genome-wide bisulphite sequencing method for the analysis of plasma cell-free DNA methylation profiles and compared differences associated with episodic memory performance in Finnish twin pairs. A noticeable amount of cell-free DNA was present in plasma, however, the amounts as well as the genomic coverage of these fragments varied substantially between individuals. We found no significant markers associated with episodic memory performance in the twins' plasma cell-free DNA methylation profiles. Furthermore, our results indicate that due to the low genomic coverage of cell-free DNA fragments and the variety in these fragments between individuals, the implemented genome-wide bisulphite sequencing method is not optimal for comparing cell-free DNA methylation differences between large groups of individuals.",

However, the high cost of whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) hinders the clinical implementation of a methylation-based cfDNA early detection biomarker. We proposed a novel strategy in low-pass WGBS (~â€‰5 million reads) to detect methylation changes in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from patients with liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: The effective small sequencing depth were determined by 5 pilot cfDNA samples with relative high-depth WGBS. CfDNA of 51 patients with hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC were conducted using low-pass WGBS. The strategy was validated in an independent WGBS cohort of 32 healthy individuals and 26 early-stage HCC patients. Fifteen paired tumor tissue and buffy coat samples were used to characterize the methylation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) integration regions and genome distribution of cfDNA.
RESULTS: A significant enrichment of cfDNA in intergenic and repeat regions, especially in previously reported HBV integration sites were observed, as a feature of cfDNA and the bias of cfDNA release. Methylation profiles nearby HBV integration sites were a better indicator for hypomethylation of tumor genome comparing to Alu and LINE (long interspersed nuclear element) repeats, and were able to facilitate the cfDNA-based HCC prediction. Hypomethylation nearby HBV integration sites (5â€‰kb flanking) was detected in HCC patients, but not in patients with hepatitis and cirrhosis (MethylHBV5k, median:0.61 vs 0.72, PÂ =â€‰0.0003). Methylation levels of integration sites certain candidate regions exhibited an area under the receiver operation curve (AUC) value >â€‰0.85 to discriminate HCC from non-HCC samples.

No,20200907,cohort network,32705500,"The LifeCycle Project-EU Child Cohort Network: a federated analysis infrastructure and harmonized data of more than 250,000 children and parents",Eur J Epidemiol,"Early life is an important window of opportunity to improve health across the full lifecycle. An accumulating body of evidence suggests that exposure to adverse stressors during early life leads to developmental adaptations, which subsequently affect disease risk in later life. Also, geographical, socio-economic, and ethnic differences are related to health inequalities from early life onwards. To address these important public health challenges, many European pregnancy and childhood cohorts have been established over the last 30Â years. The enormous wealth of data of these cohorts has led to important new biological insights and important impact for health from early life onwards. The impact of these cohorts and their data could be further increased by combining data from different cohorts. Combining data will lead to the possibility of identifying smaller effect estimates, and the opportunity to better identify risk groups and risk factors leading to disease across the lifecycle across countries. Also, it enables research on better causal understanding and modelling of life course health trajectories. The EU Child Cohort Network, established by the Horizon2020-funded LifeCycle Project, brings together nineteen pregnancy and childhood cohorts, together including more than 250,000 children and their parents. A large set of variables has been harmonised and standardized across these cohorts. The harmonized data are kept within each institution and can be accessed by external researchers through a shared federated data analysis platform using the R-based platform DataSHIELD, which takes relevant national and international data regulations into account. The EU Child Cohort Network has an open character. All protocols for data harmonization and setting up the data analysis platform are available online. The EU Child Cohort Network creates great opportunities for researchers to use data from different cohorts, during and beyond the LifeCycle Project duration. It also provides a novel model for collaborative research in large research infrastructures with individual-level data. The LifeCycle Project will translate results from research using the EU Child Cohort Network into recommendations for targeted prevention strategies to improve health trajectories for current and future generations by optimizing their earliest phases of life.",

Genome-wide examination of DNA methylation (DNAm) offers an attractive complement to studies of allelic risk given it can reflect the combined influence of genes and environment. The current study used monozygotic twins to identify differentially and variably methylated regions of the genome that distinguish twins with and without a lifetime history of early-onset MD. The sample included 150 Caucasian monozygotic twins between the ages of 15 and 20 (73% female; Mageâ€‰=â€‰17.52â€‰SDâ€‰=â€‰1.28) who were assessed during a developmental stage characterized by relatively distinct neurophysiological changes. All twins were generally healthy and currently free of medications with psychotropic effects. DNAm was measured in peripheral blood cells using the Infinium Human BeadChip 450â€‰K Array. MD associations with early-onset MD were detected at 760 differentially and variably methylated probes/regions that mapped to 428 genes. Genes and genomic regions involved neural circuitry formation, projection, functioning, and plasticity. Gene enrichment analyses implicated genes related to neuron structures and neurodevelopmental processes including cell-cell adhesion genes (e.g., PCDHA genes). Genes previously implicated in mood and psychiatric disorders as well as chronic stress (e.g., NRG3) also were identified. DNAm regions associated with early-onset MD were found to overlap genetic loci identified in the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium meta-analysis of depression. Understanding the time course of epigenetic influences during emerging adulthood may clarify developmental phases where changes in the DNA methylome may modulate individual differences in MD risk.",

To better understand the full spectrum of health consequences, biomarkers that accurately classify cannabis use are needed. DNA methylation (DNAm) is an excellent candidate, yet no blood-based epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) in humans exist. We conducted an EWAS of lifetime cannabis use (ever vs. never) using blood-based DNAm data from a case-cohort study within Sister Study, a prospective cohort of women at risk of developing breast cancer (Discovery N = 1,730 [855 ever users]; Replication N = 853 [392 ever users]). We identified and replicated an association with lifetime cannabis use at cg15973234 (CEMIP): combined p = 3.3â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8 . We found no overlap between published blood-based cis-meQTLs of cg15973234 and reported lifetime cannabis use-associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs; pâ€‰<â€‰.05), suggesting that the observed DNAm difference was driven by cannabis exposure. We also developed a multi-CpG classifier of lifetime cannabis use using penalized regression of top EWAS CpGs. The resulting 50-CpG classifier produced an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.74 (95% CI [0.72, 0.76], p = 2.00â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5 ) in the discovery sample and AUC = 0.54 ([0.51, 0.57], p = 2.87â€‰Ã—â€‰10-2 ) in the replication sample.

Little is known about epigenetic mechanisms of asthma in Latino youth. We conducted a meta-analysis of two epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of asthma, using DNA from white blood cells (WBCs) from 1,136 Latino children and youth aged 6 to 20Â years. Genes near the top CpG sites in this EWAS were examined in a pathway enrichment analysis, and we then assessed whether our results replicated those from publicly available data from three independent EWAS conducted in non-Latino populations. We found that DNA methylation profiles differed between subjects with and without asthma. After adjustment for covariates and multiple testing, two CpGs were differentially methylated at a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P <Â 0.1, and 193 CpG sites were differentially methylated at FDR-adjusted P <Â 0.2. The two top CpGs are near genes relevant to inflammatory signalling, including CAMK1D (Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase ID) and TIGIT (T Cell Immunoreceptor With Ig And ITIM Domains). Moreover, 25 genomic regions were differentially methylated between subjects with and without asthma, at Å idÃ¡k-corrected P <Â 0.10. An enrichment analysis then identified the TGF-beta pathway as most relevant to asthma in our analysis, and we replicated some of the top signals from publicly available EWAS datasets in non-Hispanic populations. In conclusion, we have identified novel epigenetic markers of asthma in WBCs from Latino children and youth, while also replicating previous results from studies conducted in non-Latinos.",

METHODS: We included 126 subjects for atopy analysis and 147 for tissue eosinophilia analysis including 18 normal nasal tissues. We identified differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and genes associated with atopy and tissue eosinophilia. Furthermore, we performed Mendelian randomization analysis and penalized regression along with replication in an independent cohort.
RESULTS: EWAS identified genes, including musashi RNA binding protein 2 (MSI2), associated with atopy, which contained enriched DMPs that that genetically affect atopy. A direct association was observed between MSI2 SNPs and atopy, as well as the causal effect of changes in MSI2 expression and methylation on atopy, which was replicated in a Costa Rican population. Regarding tissue eosinophilia, EWAS identified genes including CAMK1D with enriched DMPs directly contributing to tissue eosinophilia at the gene level. The GO terms of the identified genes for both phenotypes encompassed immune-related terms.results CONCLUSION: The EWAS combined with GWAS identified novel candidate genes, especially the methylation of MSI2, contributing to systemic allergic inflammation. Certain genes displayed a greater association with either systemic or local allergic inflammation; however, a harmonized effect of these genes is expected to influence immune responses.

Here we investigated potential pathogenic mechanisms by assessing DNA methylation associations with dementia risk factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-free participants.
Methods: Associations between dementia risk measures (family history, AD genetic risk score [GRS], and dementia risk scores [combining lifestyle, demographic, and genetic factors]) and whole-blood DNA methylation were assessed in discovery and replication samples (nÂ =Â ~400 to ~5000) from Generation Scotland.
Results: AD genetic risk and two dementia risk scores were associated with differential methylation. The GRS associated predominantly with methylation differences in cis but also identified a genomic region implicated in Parkinson disease. Loci associated with dementia risk scores were enriched for those previously associated with body mass index and alcohol consumption.
Discussion: Dementia risk measures show widespread association with blood-based methylation, generating several hypotheses for assessment by future studies.",

We aimed to discover new differential DNA methylation patterns predisposing obesity and prioritize surrogate epigenetic markers in Koreans.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed multistage epigenome-wide analyses to identify differentially expressed CpGs in obesity using the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array (EPIC). Forty-eight CpGs showed significant differences across three phases: 902 whole blood DNAs from two cohorts (phase 1: n=450, phase 2: n=377) and a hospital-based sample (phase 3: n=75). Samples from phase III participants were used to examine whether the 48 CpGs are significant in the fat tissue and influenced gene expression. Furthermore, we investigated the epigenetic effect of CpG loci in childhood obesity (n=94).
RESULTS: Seven of the 48 CpGs exhibited similar changes in the fat tissue along with gene expression changes. In particular, hypomethylated CpG (cg13424229) on the GATA1 transcription factor cluster of CPA3 promoter was related to its increased gene expression and showed consistent effect in childhood obesity. Interestingly, subsequent analysis using RNA sequencing data from 21 preadipocytes and 26 adipocytes suggested CPA3 as a potential obesity-related gene. Moreover, expression patterns from RNA sequencing and public Gene Expression Omnibus showed the correlation between CPA3 and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and asthma.
CONCLUSIONS: Our finding prioritizes influential genes in obesity and provides new evidence for the role of CPA3 linking obesity, T2D, and asthma.",

Although the cellular and molecular mechanisms of DPN are poorly understood, we and others have shown that altered gene expression and DNA methylation are implicated in disease pathogenesis. However, how DNA methylation might functionally impact gene expression and contribute to nerve damage remains unclear. Here, we analyzed genome-wide transcriptomic and methylomic profiles of sural nerves from T2D patients with DPN.
RESULTS: Unbiased clustering of transcriptomics data separated samples into groups, which correlated with HbA1c levels. Accordingly, we found 998 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 929 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) between the groups with the highest and lowest HbA1c levels. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs and DMGs were enriched for pathways known to play a role in DPN, including those related to the immune system, extracellular matrix (ECM), and axon guidance. To understand the interaction between the transcriptome and methylome in DPN, we performed an integrated analysis of the overlapping genes between DEGs and DMGs. Integrated functional and network analysis identified genes and pathways modulating functions such as immune response, ECM regulation, and PI3K-Akt signaling.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest for the first time that DNA methylation is a mechanism regulating gene expression in DPN. Overall, DPN patients with high HbA1c have distinct alterations in sural nerve DNA methylome and transcriptome, suggesting that optimal glycemic control in DPN patients is an important factor in maintaining epigenetic homeostasis and nerve function.",

One hundred twenty-two newborn-mother dyads from the Isle of Wight (IOW) cohort were studied to identify differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) in maternal blood associated with offspring birthweight. Peripheral blood samples were drawn from mothers at 22-38Â weeks of pregnancy for epigenome-wide DNAm assessment using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K array. Candidate CpGs were identified using a course of 100 repetitions of a training and testing process with robust regressions. CpGs were considered informative if they showed statistical significance in at least 80% of training and testing samples. Linear mixed models adjusting for covariates were applied to further assess the selected CpGs. The Swedish Born Into Life cohort was used to replicate our findings (nâ€‰=â€‰33). Eight candidate CpGs corresponding to the genes LMF1, KIF9, KLHL18, DAB1, VAX2, CD207, SCT, SCYL2, DEPDC4, NECAP1, and SFRS3 in mothers were identified as statistically significantly associated with their children's birthweight in the IOW cohort and confirmed by linear mixed models after adjusting for covariates.

Biological pathway analyses of three of the genes revealed cellular processes such as endocytosis (possibly sustaining an adequate maternal-fetal interface) and metabolic processes such as regulation of lipoprotein lipase activity (involved in providing substrates for the developing fetus). Our results contribute to an epigenetic understanding of maternal involvement in offspring birthweight. Measuring DNAm levels of maternal CpGs may in the future serve as a diagnostic tool recognizing mothers at risk for pregnancies ending with altered birthweights.",

With the aim of exploring peripheral biomarker potential, we have examined DNA methylation patterns in whole blood collected from 284 individuals in the AddNeuroMed study, which included 89 nondemented controls, 86 patients with Alzheimer's disease, and 109 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, including 38 individuals who progressed to Alzheimer's disease within 1 year. We identified significant differentially methylated regions, including 12 adjacent hypermethylated probes in the HOXB6 gene in Alzheimer's disease, which we validated using pyrosequencing. Using weighted gene correlation network analysis, we identified comethylated modules of genes that were associated with key variables such as APOE genotype and diagnosis. In summary, this study represents the first large-scale epigenome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment using blood. We highlight the differences in various loci and pathways in early disease, suggesting that these patterns relate to cognitive decline at an early stage.",

We sought to investigate the association between passive smoke exposure and DNA methylation, which could serve as a biomarker of health risk.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We derived passive smoke exposure from self-reported questionnaire data among smoking and non-smoking partners of participants enrolled in the UK Household Longitudinal Study 'Understanding Society' (n=769). We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of passive smoke exposure with DNA methylation in peripheral blood measured using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC array.
RESULTS: No CpG sites surpassed the epigenome-wide significance threshold of p<5.97Â Ã—Â 10-8 in relation to partner smoking, compared with 10 CpG sites identified in relation to own smoking. However, 10 CpG sites surpassed a less stringent threshold of p<1Â Ã—Â 10-5 in a model of partner smoking adjusted for own smoking (model 1), 7 CpG sites in a model of partner smoking restricted to non-smokers (model 2) and 16 CpGs in a model restricted to regular smokers (model 3). In addition, there was evidence for an interaction between own smoking status and partners' smoking status on DNA methylation levels at the majority of CpG sites identified in models 2 and 3. There was a clear lack of enrichment for previously identified smoking signals in the EWAS of passive smoke exposure compared with the EWAS of own smoking.
CONCLUSION: The DNA methylation signature associated with passive smoke exposure is much less pronounced than that of own smoking, with no positive findings for 'expected' signals. It is unlikely that changes to DNA methylation serve as an important mechanism underlying the health risks of passive smoke exposure.",

However, little is known about the epigenetic signature of MDD in brain tissue. This study aimed to investigate associations between brain tissue-based DNA methylation and late-life MDD.
METHODS: We performed a brain epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of late-life MDD in 608 participants from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) using DNA methylation profiles of the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex generated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip array. We also conducted an EWAS of MDD in each sex separately.
RESULTS: We found epigenome-wide significant associations between brain tissue-based DNA methylation and late-life MDD. The most significant and robust association was found with altered methylation levels in the YOD1 locus (cg25594636, p valueâ€‰=â€‰2.55â€‰Ã—â€‰10-11; cg03899372, p valueâ€‰=â€‰3.12â€‰Ã—â€‰10-09; cg12796440, p valueâ€‰=â€‰1.51â€‰Ã—â€‰10-08, cg23982678, p valueâ€‰=â€‰7.94â€‰Ã—â€‰10-08). Analysis of differentially methylated regions (p valueâ€‰=â€‰5.06â€‰Ã—â€‰10-10) further confirmed this locus. Other significant loci include UGT8 (cg18921206, p valueâ€‰=â€‰1.75â€‰Ã—â€‰10-08), FNDC3B (cg20367479, p valueâ€‰=â€‰4.97â€‰Ã—â€‰10-08) and SLIT2 (cg10946669, p valueâ€‰=â€‰8.01â€‰Ã—â€‰10-08). Notably, brain tissue-based methylation levels were strongly associated with late-life MDD in men more than in women.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified altered methylation in the YOD1, UGT8, FNDC3B, and SLIT2 loci as new epigenetic factors associated with late-life MDD. Furthermore, our study highlights the sex-specific molecular heterogeneity of MDD.",
Yes,20200907,ewas,32811491,In utero and childhood exposure to tobacco smoke and multi-layer molecular signatures in children,BMC Med,"BACKGROUND: The adverse health effects of early life exposure to tobacco smoking have been widely reported. In spite of this, the underlying molecular mechanisms of in utero and postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke are only partially understood. Here, we aimed to identify multi-layer molecular signatures associated with exposure to tobacco smoke in these two exposure windows.
METHODS: We investigated the associations of maternal smoking during pregnancy and childhood secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure with molecular features measured in 1203 European children (mean age 8.1â€‰years) from the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project. Molecular features, covering 4 layers, included blood DNA methylation and gene and miRNA transcription, plasma proteins, and sera and urinary metabolites.
RESULTS: Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with DNA methylation changes at 18 loci in child blood. DNA methylation at 5 of these loci was related to expression of the nearby genes. However, the expression of these genes themselves was only weakly associated with maternal smoking. Conversely, childhood SHS was not associated with blood DNA methylation or transcription patterns, but with reduced levels of several serum metabolites and with increased plasma PAI1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), a protein that inhibits fibrinolysis. Some of the in utero and childhood smoking-related molecular marks showed dose-response trends, with stronger effects with higher dose or longer duration of the exposure.
CONCLUSION: In this first study covering multi-layer molecular features, pregnancy and childhood exposure to tobacco smoke were associated with distinct molecular phenotypes in children. The persistent and dose-dependent changes in the methylome make CpGs good candidates to develop biomarkers of past exposure. Moreover, compared to methylation, the weak association of maternal smoking in pregnancy with gene expression suggests different reversal rates and a methylation-based memory to past exposures. Finally, certain metabolites and protein markers evidenced potential early biological effects of postnatal SHS, such as fibrinolysis.",

We aimed to systematically review the evidence for DNA methylation markers in stool for risk stratification or detection of specific CRC stages, as well as precursors of CRC.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic search in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge to identify relevant studies published until 14th January 2020. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study population characteristics, candidate genes, methylation measurement methods, odds ratios (ORs), overall and stage-specific sensitivities, specificities, areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve, and p-values for statistical significance for OR and for association of methylation levels with stage.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies that reported stage-specific associations or performances of fecal DNA methylation markers for detecting colorectal neoplasms were identified. All studies used methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction for assessing methylation levels in the promoter or exon 1 regions of targeted genes. However, most studies were underpowered and limited by their case-control design. Furthermore, the stage-specific associations or sensitivities were validated for two markers (hypermethylation of GATA4 and VIM) only.
CONCLUSION: Methylation markers in stool may be useful for detection of CRC precursors or CRC staging, but promising candidate markers need to be validated in longitudinal studies on large screening populations, performing epigenome-wide analyses. Identification of stage-specific DNA methylation biomarkers in stool could boost current strategies towards early detection and enable different approaches to precision medicine for CRC.",

RESULTS: By employing genetic instruments as causal anchors, we establish directed associations between gene expression and distant DNA methylation levels, while ensuring specificity of the associations by correcting for linkage disequilibrium and pleiotropy among neighboring genes. The identified genes are enriched for transcription factors, of which many consistently increased or decreased DNA methylation levels at multiple CpG sites. In addition, we show that a substantial number of transcription factors affected DNA methylation at their experimentally determined binding sites. We also observe genes encoding proteins with heterogenous functions that have widespread effects on DNA methylation, e.g., NFKBIE, CDCA7(L), and NLRC5, and for several examples, we suggest plausible mechanisms underlying their effect on DNA methylation.

We perform co-expression network analysis across more than twelve hundred human brain samples, identifying robust ad-associated dysregulation of the transcriptome, unaltered in normal human aging. We assess the cell-type specificity of ad gene co-expression changes and estimate cell-type proportion changes in human ad by integrating co-expression modules with single-cell transcriptome data generated from 27â€‰321 nuclei from human postmortem prefrontal cortical tissue. We also show that genetic variants of ad are enriched in a microglial ad-associated module and identify key transcription factors regulating co-expressed modules.

Previous studies were concentrated on genomic and transcriptomic markers (e.g., mutation burden and immune gene expression). However, these markers are not sufficient to accurately predict a response to ICB therapy.
RESULTS: Here, we analyzed DNA methylomes of 141 advanced NSCLC samples subjected to ICB therapy (i.e., anti-programmed death-1) from two independent cohorts (60 and 81 patients from our and IDIBELL cohorts). Integrative analysis of patients with matched transcriptome data in our cohort (n = 28) at pathway level revealed significant overlaps between promoter hypermethylation and transcriptional repression in nonresponders relative to responders. Fifteen immune-related pathways, including interferon signaling, were identified to be enriched for both hypermethylation and repression. We built a reliable prognostic risk model based on eight genes using LASSO model and successfully validated the model in independent cohorts.

No,20200907,qc,32749174,Reliability of DNA methylation measures using Illumina methylation BeadChip,Epigenetics,"Illumina BeadChips are widely utilized in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Several studies have reported that many probes on these arrays have poor reliability. Here, we compare different pre-processing methods to improve intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). We describe the characteristics of ICC across the genome, within and between studies, and across different array platforms. Using technical duplicates from 128 subjects, we find that with raw data only 22.5% of the CpGs on 450Â K array have 'acceptable' ICCs (>0.5). Data preprocessing steps, such as background correction and dye bias correction, can reduce technical noise and improve the percentage to 38.5%. Similar to previous studies, we found that ICC is associated with CpG methylation level such that 83% of CpGs with intermediate methylation (0.1<Â beta-value <0.9) have acceptable ICCs, whereas only 21% of CpGs with low or high methylation (beta-value <0.1 or >0.9) have acceptable ICCs. ICC is also correlated with CpG methylation variance; after mutual adjustment for beta-value and variance, only variance remains correlated. Many CpGs with poor ICCs (<0.5) are located in biologically important regulatory regions, including gene promoters and CpG islands. Poor ICC at these sites appears to be a consequence of low biologic variation among individuals rather than increased technical measurement variation. ICCs quality classifications are highly concordant across different array platforms and across different studies. We find that ICC can be reliably estimated with 30 pairs of duplicate samples. CpGs with acceptable ICC have higher study power and are more commonly reported in published epigenome-wide studies.",

Proteins represent intermediate phenotypes for disease and provide insight into how genetic and non-genetic risk factors are mechanistically linked to clinical outcomes. Associations between protein levels and DNA sequence variants that colocalize with risk alleles for common diseases can expose disease-associated pathways, revealing novel drug targets and translational biomarkers. However, genome-wide, population-scale analyses of proteomic data are only now emerging. Here, we review current findings from studies of the plasma proteome and discuss their potential for advancing biomedical translation through the interpretation of genome-wide association analyses. We highlight the challenges faced by currently available technologies and provide perspectives relevant to their future application in large-scale biobank studies.",

DNase-seq footprinting enables the prediction of genome-wide binding sites for hundreds of TFs simultaneously. Despite the public availability of high-quality DNase-seq data from hundreds of samples, a comprehensive, up-to-date resource for the locations of genomic footprints is lacking. Here, we develop a scalable footprinting workflow using two state-of-the-art algorithms: Wellington and HINT. We apply our workflow to detect footprints in 192 ENCODE DNase-seq experiments and predict the genomic occupancy of 1,515 human TFs in 27 human tissues. We validate that these footprints overlap true-positive TF binding sites from ChIP-seq. We demonstrate that the locations, depth, and tissue specificity of footprints predict effects of genetic variants on gene expression and capture a substantial proportion of genetic risk for complex traits.",
No,20200907,transcription factor binding,32728250,Global reference mapping of human transcription factor footprints,Nature,"Combinatorial binding of transcription factors to regulatory DNA underpins gene regulation in all organisms. Genetic variation in regulatory regions has been connected with diseases and diverse phenotypic traits1, but it remains challenging to distinguish variants that affect regulatory function2. Genomic DNase I footprinting enables the quantitative, nucleotide-resolution delineation of sites of transcription factor occupancy within native chromatin3-6. However, only a small fraction of such sites have been precisely resolved on the human genome sequence6. Here, to enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from 243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these data to delineate about 4.5 million compact genomic elements that encode transcription factor occupancy at nucleotide resolution. We map the fine-scale structure within about 1.6 million DNase I-hypersensitive sites and show that the overwhelming majority are populated by well-spaced sites of single transcription factor-DNA interaction. Cell-context-dependent cis-regulation is chiefly executed by wholesale modulation of accessibility at regulatory DNA rather than by differential transcription factor occupancy within accessible elements. We also show that the enrichment of genetic variants associated with diseases or phenotypic traits in regulatory regions1,7 is almost entirely attributable to variants within footprints, and that functional variants that affect transcription factor occupancy are nearly evenly partitioned between loss- and gain-of-function alleles. Unexpectedly, we find increased density of human genetic variation within transcription factor footprints, revealing an unappreciated driver of cis-regulatory evolution. Our results provide a framework for both global and nucleotide-precision analyses of gene regulatory mechanisms and functional genetic variation.",

Physiological and genetic adaptations have been documented in populations with a history of living at high altitude. However, the role of epigenetic gene regulation, including DNA methylation, in high-altitude adaptation is not well understood. We performed an epigenome-wide DNA methylation association study based on whole blood from 113 Peruvian Quechua with differential lifetime exposures to high altitude (>2,500) and recruited based on a migrant study design. We identified two significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and 62 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with high-altitude developmental and lifelong exposure statuses. DMPs and DMRs were found in genes associated with hypoxia-inducible factor pathway, red blood cell production, blood pressure, and others. DMPs and DMRs associated with fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) also were identified. We found a significant association between EPAS1 methylation and EPAS1 SNP genotypes, suggesting that local genetic variation influences patterns of methylation. Our findings demonstrate that DNA methylation is associated with early developmental and lifelong high-altitude exposures among Peruvian Quechua as well as altitude-adaptive phenotypes. Together these findings suggest that epigenetic mechanisms might be involved in adaptive developmental plasticity to high altitude. Moreover, we show that local genetic variation is associated with DNA methylation levels, suggesting that methylation associated SNPs could be a potential avenue for research on genetic adaptation to hypoxia in Andeans.Â© The Author(s) 2020.

However, the extent to which epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the etiology of the disorder is unknown. We performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium to identify DNA methylation sites associated with ADHD symptoms at two methylation assessment periods: birth and school age. We examined associations of both DNA methylation in cord blood with repeatedly assessed ADHD symptoms (age 4-15 years) in 2477 children from 5 cohorts and of DNA methylation at school age with concurrent ADHD symptoms (age 7-11 years) in 2374 children from 9 cohorts, with 3 cohorts participating at both timepoints. CpGs identified with nominal significance (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in either of the EWAS were correlated between timepoints (Ïâ€‰=â€‰0.30), suggesting overlap in associations; however, top signals were very different. At birth, we identified nine CpGs that predicted later ADHD symptoms (pâ€‰<â€‰1â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7), including ERC2 and CREB5. Peripheral blood DNA methylation at one of these CpGs (cg01271805 in the promoter region of ERC2, which regulates neurotransmitter release) was previously associated with brain methylation. Another (cg25520701) lies within the gene body of CREB5, which previously was associated with neurite outgrowth and an ADHD diagnosis. In contrast, at school age, no CpGs were associated with ADHD with pâ€‰<â€‰1â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7. In conclusion, we found evidence in this study that DNA methylation at birth is associated with ADHD. Future studies are needed to confirm the utility of methylation variation as biomarker and its involvement in causal pathways.",

DKD is heritable and large-scale genome-wide association studies have begun to identify genetic factors that influence DKD. Complementary to genetic factors, we know that a person's epigenetic profile is also altered with DKD. This study reports analysis of DNA methylation, a major epigenetic feature, evaluating methylome-wide loci for association with DKD. Unique features (n= 485,577; 482,421 CpG probes) were evaluated in blood-derived DNA from carefully phenotyped White European individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes with (cases) or without (controls) DKD (n= 677 samples). Explicitly, 150 cases were compared to 100 controls using the 450K array, with subsequent analysis using data previously generated for a further 96 cases and 96 controls on the 27K array, andde novomethylation data generated for replication in 139 cases and 96 controls. Following stringent quality control, raw data were quantile normalized and beta values calculated to reflect the methylation status at each site. The difference in methylation status was evaluated between cases and controls; resultantP-values for array-based data were adjusted for multiple testing. Genes with significantly increased (hypermethylated) and/or decreased (hypomethylated) levels of DNA methylation were considered for biological relevance by functional enrichment analysis using KEGG pathways. Twenty-two loci demonstrated statistically significant fold changes associated with DKD and additional support for these associated loci was sought using independent samples derived from patients recruited with similar inclusion criteria. Markers associated withCCNL1andZNF187genes are supported as differentially regulated loci (P< 10-8), with evidence also presented forAFF3, which has been identified from a meta-analysis and subsequent replication of genome-wide association studies. Further supporting evidence for differential gene expression in CCNL1 and ZNF187 is presented from kidney biopsy and blood-derived RNA in people with and without kidney disease from NephroSeq. Evidence confirming that methylation sites influence the development of DKD may aid risk prediction tools and stimulate research to identify epigenomic therapies which might be clinically useful for this disease.Copyright Â© 2020 Smyth, Patterson, Swan, Maxwell and McKnight.",

We assessed measures of ETV or chronic stress in children (ETV scale, gun violence, and perceived stress) and their mothers (perceived stress). Each EWAS was conducted using linear regression, with CpGs as dependent variables and the stress/violence measure as a predictor, adjusting for age, sex, the top five principal components, and SVA latent factors. We then selected the top 100 CpGs (by P-value) associated with each stress/violence measure in EVA-PR and conducted a meta-analysis of the selected CpGs and atopic asthma using data from EVA-PR and two additional cohorts (Project Viva and PIAMA).In the EWAS of stress/violence in EVA-PR, gun violence was associated with methylation of cg18961589 inLINC01164(Î²=0.03,P=1.28Ã—10-7), and maternal stress was associated with methylation of cg03402351 inSNN(Î²=0.04,P=1.69Ã—10-7) and cg19064846 inPTPRN2(Î²=0.03,P=3.36Ã—10-7).

Recent evidence links changes in DNA methylation of CpG cites to PTSD. Since clusters of proximal CpGs share similar methylation signatures, identification of PTSD-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) may elucidate the pathways defining differential risk and resilience of PTSD. Here we aimed to identify epigenetic differences associated with PTSD. DNA methylation data profiled from blood samples using the MethylationEPIC BeadChip were used to perform a DMR analysis in 187 PTSD cases and 367 trauma-exposed controls from the Grady Trauma Project (GTP). DMRs were assessed with R package bumphunter. We identified two regions that associate with PTSD after multiple test correction. These regions were in the gene body of HLA-DPB1 and in the promoter of SPATC1L. The DMR in HLA-DPB1 was associated with PTSD in an independent cohort. Both DMRs included CpGs whose methylation associated with nearby sequence variation (meQTL) and that associated with expression of their respective genes (eQTM). This study supports an emerging literature linking PTSD risk to genetic and epigenetic variation in the HLA region.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Here, we examined the relationships between maternal dysglycaemia at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation and DNA methylation in neonates and whether a dietary and physical activity intervention in pregnant women with obesity modified the methylation signatures associated with maternal dysglycaemia.We investigated 557 women, recruited between 2009 and 2014 from the UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT), a randomised controlled trial (RCT), of a lifestyle intervention (low glycaemic index (GI) diet plus physical activity) in pregnant women with obesity (294 contol, 263 intervention). Between 27 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, participants had an oral glucose (75 g) tolerance test (OGTT), and GDM diagnosis was based on diagnostic criteria recommended by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG), with 159 women having a diagnosis of GDM. Cord blood DNA samples from the infants were interrogated for genome-wide DNA methylation levels using the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Robust regression was carried out, adjusting for maternal age, smoking, parity, ethnicity, neonate sex, and predicted cell-type composition. Maternal GDM, fasting glucose, 1-h, and 2-h glucose concentrations following an OGTT were associated with 242, 1, 592, and 17 differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (dmCpG) sites (false discovery rate (FDR) â‰¤ 0.05), respectively, in the infant's cord blood DNA. The most significantly GDM-associated CpG was cg03566881 located within the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 6 (LGR6) (FDR = 0.0002). Moreover, we show that the GDM and 1-h glucose-associated methylation signatures in the cord blood of the infant appeared to be attenuated by the dietary and physical activity intervention during pregnancy; in the intervention arm, there were no GDM and two 1-h glucose-associated dmCpGs, whereas in the standard care arm, there were 41 GDM and 160 1-h glucose-associated dmCpGs. A total of 87% of the GDM and 77% of the 1-h glucose-associated dmCpGs had smaller effect sizes in the intervention compared to the standard care arm; the adjusted r2 for the association of LGR6 cg03566881 with GDM was 0.317 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.012, 0.022) in the standard care and 0.240 (95% CI 0.001, 0.015) in the intervention arm. Limitations included measurement of DNA methylation in cord blood, where the functional significance of such changes are unclear, and because of the strong collinearity between treatment modality and severity of hyperglycaemia, we cannot exclude that treatment-related differences are potential confounders.Maternal dysglycaemia was associated with significant changes in the epigenome of the infants. Moreover, we found that the epigenetic impact of a dysglycaemic prenatal maternal environment appeared to be modified by a lifestyle intervention in pregnancy. Further research will be needed to investigate possible medical implications of the findings.ISRCTN89971375.",

DNA methylation (DNAm) has been shown to be associated with the risk of asthma.We hypothesized that asthma acquisition from pre- to post-adolescence was associated with changes in DNAm during this period at asthma-associated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and such an association was sex-specific.Subjects from the Isle of Wight birth cohort (IOWBC) with DNAm in blood at ages 10 and 18 years (n=124 females, 151 males) were studied. Using a training-testing approach, epigenome-wide CpGs associated with asthma were identified. Logistic regression was used to examine sex-specific associations of DNAm changes with asthma acquisition between ages 10 and 18 at asthma-associated CpGs. The ALSPAC birth cohort was used for independent replication. To assess functional relevance of identified CpGs, association of DNAm with gene expression in blood was assessed.We identified 535 CpGs potentially associated with asthma. Significant interaction effects of DNAm changes and sex on asthma acquisition in adolescence were found at 13 of the 535 CpGs in IOWBC (p-values<1.0Ã—10-3). In the replication cohort, consistent interaction effects were observed at 10 of the 13 CpGs. At 7 of these 10 CpGs, opposite DNAm changes across adolescence were observed between sexes in both cohorts. In both cohorts, cg20891917, located on IFRD1 linked to asthma, shows strong sex-specific effects on asthma transition (p-values<0.01 in both cohorts).Gender-reversal in asthma acquisition is associated with opposite changes in DNAm (males vs females) from pre- to post-adolescence at asthma-associated CpGs. These CpGs are potential biomarkers of sex-specific asthma acquisition in adolescence.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

However, biological pathways underlying these associations are not well understood.To evaluate the association between neighborhood deprivation and epigenetic measures of age acceleration and genome-wide methylation.This cross-sectional study used data from the Sister Study, a prospective cohort study comprising 50â€¯884 women living in the US and Puerto Rico aged 35 to 74 years at enrollment who had a sister with breast cancer but had not had breast cancer themselves. Cohort enrollment occurred between July 2003 and March 2009. Participants completed a computer-assisted telephone interview on demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and residential factors and provided anthropometric measures and peripheral blood samples at a home examination. DNA methylation data obtained for 2630 non-Hispanic White women selected for a case-cohort study in 2014 were used in this cross-sectional analysis. DNA methylation was measured using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChips in whole blood samples collected at baseline. Data analysis for this study was performed from October 17, 2019, to August 27, 2020.Each participants' primary address was linked to an established index of neighborhood deprivation.Epigenetic age was estimated using 4 epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and GrimAge). Age acceleration was determined using residuals from regressing chronologic age on each of the 4 epigenetic age metrics. Linear regression was used to estimate associations between neighborhood deprivation and epigenetic age acceleration as well as DNA methylation at individual cytosine-guanine sites across the genome.Mean (SD) age of the 2630 participants was 56.9 (8.7) years. Those with the greatest (>75th percentile) vs least (â‰¤25th percentile) neighborhood deprivation had higher epigenetic age acceleration estimated by Hannum (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.23; 95% CI, 0.01-0.45), PhenoAge (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.28; 95% CI, 0.06-.50), and GrimAge (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.37; 95% CI, 0.12-0.62). Increasing US quartiles of neighborhood deprivation exhibited a trend with Hannum, PhenoAge, and GrimAge. For example, GrimAge showed a significant dose-response (P test for trend <.001) as follows: level 2 vs level 1 (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.30; 95% CI, 0.17-0.42), level 3 vs level 1 (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.35; 95% CI, 0.19-0.50), and level 4 vs level 1 (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.37; 95% CI, 0.12-0.62). Neighborhood deprivation was found to be associated with 3 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites, with 1 of these annotated to a known gene MAOB (Pâ€‰=â€‰9.71â€‰Ã—â€‰10-08).The findings of this study suggest that residing in a neighborhood with a higher deprivation index appears to be reflected by methylation-based markers of aging.",

The epigenome integrates information from sequence variations and metabolic alterations. Here, we performed a genome-wide methylome association analysis in 500 subjects with DKD from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort for DKD phenotypes, including glycemic control, albuminuria, kidney function, and kidney function decline. We show distinct methylation patterns associated with each phenotype. We define methylation variations that are associated with underlying nucleotide variations (methylation quantitative trait loci) and show that underlying genetic variations are important drivers of methylation changes. We implemented Bayesian multitrait colocalization analysis (moloc) and summary data-based Mendelian randomization to systematically annotate genomic regions that show association with kidney function, methylation, and gene expression. We prioritized 40 loci, where methylation and gene-expression changes likely mediate the genotype effect on kidney disease development. Functional annotation suggested the role of inflammation, specifically, apoptotic cell clearance and complement activation in kidney disease development. Our study defines methylation changes associated with DKD phenotypes, the key role of underlying genetic variations driving methylation variations, and prioritizes methylome and gene-expression changes that likely mediate the genotype effect on kidney disease pathogenesis.",

Long-term effects might be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, yet the literature on this topic is scarce. We performed the first epigenome-wide association study of infant feeding, comparing breastfed vs non-breastfed children. We measured DNA methylation in children from peripheral blood collected in childhood (age 7 years, N = 640) and adolescence (age 15-17 years, N = 709) within the Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomic Studies (ARIES) project, part of the larger Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Cord blood methylation (N = 702) was used as a negative control for potential pre-natal residual confounding.Two differentially-methylated sites presented directionally-consistent associations with breastfeeding at ages 7 and 15-17 years, but not at birth. Twelve differentially-methylated regions in relation to breastfeeding were identified, and for three of them there was evidence of directional concordance between ages 7 and 15-17 years, but not between birth and age 7 years.Our findings indicate that DNA methylation in childhood and adolescence may be predicted by breastfeeding, but further studies with sufficiently large samples for replication are required to identify robust associations.",

DNA methylation levels were measured in DNA extracted from leukocytes using the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. Average follow-up period for this analysis was 13â€‰years.Several new genomic regions were identified as being differentially methylated in cases and controls; the 5 strongest associations were observed for CpGs located in genesTMEM204/IFT140,MFSD6L,FAM134B/RETREG1,KCNQ1D, andC6orf227. For some CpGs located in chromosome 16p13.3 (near genesTMEM204andIFT140), associations were stronger with shorter time to diagnosis (eg,Â odds ratio [OR] = 5.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52 to 23.12, for top vs bottom quartile, for <5â€‰years between blood draw and cancer diagnosis), but associations remained statistically significantly higher even when cases were diagnosed over 10â€‰years after blood collection. Statistically significant differences in DNA methylation levels were also observed in the gastric secretion pathway using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis.Changes in DNA methylation in peripheral blood may mark alterations in metabolic or immune pathways that play a role in pancreatic cancer. Identifying new biological pathways in carcinogenesis of pancreatic cancer using epigenome-wide association studies approach could provide new opportunities for improving treatment and prevention.Â© The Author(s) 2020.

In this study, we performed simulations and empirical analyses to evaluate the performance of the SLCMA when applied to genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm). Using simulations, we compared five statistical inference tests used with SLCMA (n=700), assessing the family-wise error rate, statistical power, and confidence interval coverage to determine whether inference based on these tests was valid in the presence of substantial multiple testing and small effects, two hallmark challenges of inference from omics data. In the empirical analyses, we evaluated the time-dependent relationship of childhood abuse with genome-wide DNAm (n=703). In simulations, selective inference and max-|t|-test performed best: both controlled family-wise error rate and yielded moderate statistical power. Empirical analyses using SLCMA revealed time-dependent effects of childhood abuse on DNAm. Our findings show that SLCMA, applied and interpreted appropriately, can be used in high-throughput settings to examine time-dependent effects underlying exposure-outcome relationships over the life course. We provide recommendations for applying the SLCMA in omics settings and encourage researchers to move beyond analyses of exposed versus unexposed.Â© The Author(s) 2020.

DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes can capture inflammatory processes and gene expression changes underlying TOD. We investigated the association between epigenome-wide DNA methylation and five measures of TOD (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), left ventricular mass index (LVMI), relative wall thickness (RWT), and white matter hyperintensity (WMH)) in 961 African Americans from hypertensive sibships. A multivariate (multi-trait) model of eGFR, UACR, LVMI, and RWT identified seven CpGs associated with at least one of the traits (cg21134922, cg04816311 nearC7orf50, cg09155024, cg10254690 nearOAT, cg07660512, cg12661888 nearIFT43, and cg02264946 nearCATSPERD) at FDR q <Â 0.1. Adjusting for blood pressure, body mass index, and type 2 diabetes attenuated the association for four CpGs. DNA methylation was associated withcis-gene expression for some CpGs, butÂ no significant mediation by gene expression was detected. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested causality between three CpGs and eGFR (cg04816311, cg10254690, and cg07660512). We also assessed whether the identified CpGsÂ were associated with TOD in 614 African Americans in the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) study. Out of three CpGs available for replication, cg04816311 was significantly associated with eGFR (pÂ =Â 0.0003), LVMI (pÂ =Â 0.0003), and RWT (pÂ =Â 0.002).

One of the proposed underlying mechanism linking smoking to disease is via epigenetic modifications, which could affect the expression of disease-associated genes. Here, we conducted a three-way association study to identify the relationship between smoking-related changes in DNA methylation and gene expression and their associations with cardio-metabolic traits.We selected 2549 CpG sites and 443 gene expression probes associated with current versus never smokers, from the largest epigenome-wide association study and transcriptome-wide association study to date. We examined three-way associations, including CpG versus gene expression, cardio-metabolic trait versus CpG, and cardio-metabolic trait versus gene expression, in the Rotterdam study. Subsequently, we replicated our findings in The Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) study. After correction for multiple testing, we identified both cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) associations in blood. Specifically, we found 1224 smoking-related CpGs associated with at least one of the 443 gene expression probes, and 200 smoking-related gene expression probes to be associated with at least one of the 2549 CpGs. Out of these, 109 CpGs and 27 genes were associated with at least one cardio-metabolic trait in the Rotterdam Study. We were able to replicate the associations with cardio-metabolic traits of 26 CpGs and 19 genes in the KORA study. Furthermore, we identified a three-way association of triglycerides with two CpGs and two genes (GZMA; CLDND1), and BMI with six CpGs and two genes (PID1; LRRN3). Finally, our results revealed the mediation effect of cg03636183 (F2RL3), cg06096336 (PSMD1), cg13708645 (KDM2B), and cg17287155 (AHRR) within the association between smoking and LRRN3 expression.Our study indicates that smoking-related changes in DNA methylation and gene expression are associated with cardio-metabolic risk factors. These findings may provide additional insights into the molecular mechanisms linking smoking to the development of CVD.",

Evidences showed that DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with mortality in non-HIV populations. Here, we established a panel of DNAm biomarkers that can predict mortality risk among PLWH.Methods: 1,081 HIV-positive participants from the Veterans Ageing Cohort Study (VACS) were divided into training (NÂ =Â 460), validation (NÂ =Â 114), and testing (NÂ =Â 507) sets. VACS index was used as a measure of mortality risk among PLWH. Model training and fine-tuning were conducted using the ensemble method in the training and validation sets and prediction performance was assessed in the testing set. The survival analysis comparing the predicted high and low mortality risk groups and theÂ Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the predictive CpG sites were performed.Results: We selected a panel of 393 CpGs for the ensemble prediction model that showed excellent performance in predicting high mortality risk with an auROC of 0.809 (95%CI: 0.767,0.851) and a balanced accuracy of 0.653 (95%CI: 0.611, 0.693) in the testing set. The high mortality risk group was significantly associated with 10-year mortality (hazard ratioÂ =Â 1.79, p =Â 4E-05) compared with low risk group. These 393 CpGs were located in 280 genes enriched in immune and inflammation response pathways.Conclusions: We identified a panel of DNAm features associated with mortality risk in PLWH.

No,20201123,dnam age,33109080,Blood-based epigenetic estimators of chronological age in human adults using DNA methylation data from the Illumina MethylationEPIC array.,BMC Genomics,"Epigenetic clocks have been recognized for their precise prediction of chronological age, age-related diseases, and all-cause mortality. Existing epigenetic clocks are based on CpGs from the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450â€‰K) which has now been replaced by the latest platform, Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC). Thus, it remains unclear to what extent EPIC contributes to increased precision and accuracy in the prediction of chronological age.We developed three blood-based epigenetic clocks for human adults using EPIC-based DNA methylation (DNAm) data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) public repository: 1) an Adult Blood-based EPIC Clock (ABEC) trained on DNAm data from MoBa (nâ€‰=â€‰1592, age-span: 19 to 59â€‰years), 2) an extended ABEC (eABEC) trained on DNAm data from MoBa and GEO (nâ€‰=â€‰2227, age-span: 18 to 88â€‰years), and 3) a common ABEC (cABEC) trained on the same training set as eABEC but restricted to CpGs common to 450â€‰K and EPIC. Our clocks showed high precision (Pearson correlation between chronological and epigenetic age (r)â€‰>â€‰0.94) in independent cohorts, including GSE111165 (nâ€‰=â€‰15), GSE115278 (nâ€‰=â€‰108), GSE132203 (nâ€‰=â€‰795), and the Epigenetics in Pregnancy (EPIPREG) study of the STORK Groruddalen Cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰470). This high precision is unlikely due to the use of EPIC, but rather due to the large sample size of the training set.Our ABECs predicted adults' chronological age precisely in independent cohorts. As EPIC is now the dominant platform for measuring DNAm, these clocks will be useful in further predictions of chronological age, age-related diseases, and mortality.",
No,20201123,single cell,33098772,Chromatin Potential Identified by Shared Single-Cell Profiling of RNA and Chromatin.,Cell,"Cell differentiation and function are regulated across multiple layers of gene regulation, including modulation of gene expression by changes in chromatin accessibility. However, differentiation is an asynchronous process precluding a temporal understanding of regulatory events leading to cell fate commitment. Here we developed simultaneous high-throughput ATAC and RNA expression with sequencing (SHARE-seq), a highly scalable approach for measurement of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in the same single cell, applicable to different tissues. Using 34,774 joint profiles from mouse skin, we develop a computational strategy to identify cis-regulatory interactions and define domains of regulatory chromatin (DORCs) that significantly overlap with super-enhancers. During lineage commitment, chromatin accessibility at DORCs precedes gene expression, suggesting that changes in chromatin accessibility may prime cells for lineage commitment. We computationally infer chromatin potential as a quantitative measure of chromatin lineage-priming and use it to predict cell fate outcomes. SHARE-seq is an extensible platform to study regulatory circuitry across diverse cells in tissues.Copyright Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
Yes,20201123,ewas,33076993,Serious neonatal morbidities are associated with differences in DNA methylation among very preterm infants.,Clin Epigenetics,"Infants born very preterm are more likely to experience neonatal morbidities compared to their term peers. Variations in DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with these morbidities may yield novel information about the processes impacted by these morbidities.This study included 532 infants bornâ€‰<â€‰30Â weeks gestation, participating in the Neonatal Neurobehavior and Outcomes in Very Preterm Infants study. We used a neonatal morbidity risk score, which was an additive index of the number of morbidities experienced during the NICU stay, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), severe brain injury, serious neonatal infections, and severe retinopathy of prematurity. DNA was collected from buccal cells at discharge from the NICU, and DNAm was measured using the Illumina MethylationEPIC. We tested for differential methylation in association with the neonatal morbidity risk score then tested for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and overrepresentation of biological pathways.We identified ten differentially methylated CpGs (Î± Bonferroni-adjusted for 706,278 tests) that were associated with increasing neonatal morbidity risk scores at three intergenic regions and at HPS4, SRRD, FGFR1OP, TNS3, TMEM266, LRRC3B, ZNF780A, and TENM2. These mostly followed dose-response patterns, for 8 CpGs increasing DNAm associated with increased numbers of morbidities, while for 2 CpGs the risk score was associated with decreasing DNAm. BPD was the most substantial contributor to differential methylation. We also identified seven potential DMRs and over-representation of genes involved in Wnt signaling; however, these results were not significant after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing.Neonatal DNAm, within genes involved in fibroblast growth factor activities, cellular invasion and migration, and neuronal signaling and development, are sensitive to the neonatal health complications of prematurity. We hypothesize that these epigenetic features may be representative of an integrated marker of neonatal health and development and are promising candidates to integrate with clinical information for studying developmental impairments in childhood.",

However, most of these variants do not alter coding sequences, making it difficult to assign their function. Here, we present a multi-omic epigenetic atlas of the adult human brain through profiling of single-cell chromatin accessibility landscapes and three-dimensional chromatin interactions of diverse adult brain regions across a cohort of cognitively healthy individuals. We developed a machine-learning classifier to integrate this multi-omic framework and predict dozens of functional SNPs for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, nominating target genes and cell types for previously orphaned loci from genome-wide association studies. Moreover, we dissected the complex inverted haplotype of the MAPT (encoding tau) Parkinson's disease risk locus, identifying putative ectopic regulatory interactions in neurons that may mediate this disease association. This work expands understanding of inherited variation and provides a roadmap for the epigenomic dissection of causal regulatory variation in disease.",

However, the safety issue regarding ARTs has drawn growing attention with accumulating observations of rising health risks, and underlying epigenetic mechanisms are largely uncharacterized.In order to clarify epigenetic risks attributable to ARTs, we profiled DNA methylome on 137 umbilicalÂ cordÂ blood (UCB) and 158 parental peripheral blood (PPB) samples, histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac) on 33 UCB samples and transcriptome on 32 UCB samples by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), respectively.We revealed that H3K4me3 was the most profoundly impacted by ICSI and freeze-thawing operation compared with the other three types of histone modifications. IVF-ET seemed to introduce less disturbance into infant epigenomes than IVF-FET or ICSI-ET did. ARTs also decreased the similarity of DNA methylome within twin pairs, and we confirmed that ART per se would introduce conservative changes locally through removal of parental effect. Importantly, those unique and common alterations induced by different ART procedures were highly enriched in the processes related to nervous system, cardiovascular system and glycolipid metabolism etc., which was in accordance with those findings in previous epidemiology studies and suggested some unexplored health issues, including in the immune system and skeletal system.Different ART procedures can induce local and functional epigenetic abnormalities, especially for DNA methylation and H3K4me3, providing an epigenetic basis for the potential long-term health risks in ART-conceived offspring.This study was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81,730,038; 81,521,002), National Key Research and Development Program (2018YFC1004000; 2017YFA0103801; 2017YFA0105001) and Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA16020703).

Cord blood leukocyte DNA methylation was profiled using the Infinium EPIC bead array and empirical Bayes modeling identified differential DNA methylation related to maternal lipid groups.Results:M3-saturated lysophosphatidylcholine was associated with 45 differentially methylated loci and M3-saturated lysophosphatidylethanolamine was associated with 18 differentially methylated loci. Biological pathways enriched among differentially methylated loci by M3 saturated lysophosphatidylcholines were related to cell proliferation and growth.Conclusion:The maternal lipidome may be influential in establishing the infant epigenome.,

No study on both IVF and ICSI and genome-wide neonatal DNAm has been performed.This was a cross-sectional study comprising 87 infants conceived with IVF or ICSI and 70 conceived following medically unassisted conception. The requirement for inclusion in the study was an understanding of the Swedish language and exclusion was the use of donor gametes.Participants were from the UppstART study, which was recruited from fertility and reproductive health clinics, and the Born into Life cohort, which is recruited from the larger LifeGene study. We measured DNAm from DNA extracted from cord blood collected at birth using a micro-array (450k array). Group differences in DNAm at individual CpG dinucleotides (CpGs) were determined using robust linear models and post-hoc Tukey's tests.We found no association of ART conception with global methylation levels, imprinted loci and meta-stable epialleles. In contrast, we identify 19 CpGs at which DNAm was associated with being conceived via ART (effect estimates: 0.5-4.9%, PFDR < 0.05), but no difference was found between IVF and ICSI. The associated CpGs map to genes related to brain function/development or genes connected to the plethora of conditions linked to subfertility, but functional annotation did not point to any likely functional consequences.We measured DNAm in cord blood and not at later ages or in other tissues. Given the number of tests performed, our study power is limited and the findings need to be replicated in an independent study.We find that ART is associated with DNAm differences in cord blood when compared to non-ART samples, but these differences are limited in number and effect size and have unknown functional consequences in adult blood.

We used heel prick DNAm from the F1-generation of Isle of Wight birth cohort (IOWBC-F1) for discovery of CpGs associated with lung function trajectories (Forced Expiratory Volume, Forced Vital Capacity, their ratio, and Forced Expiratory Flow at 25-75%) over the first 26â€…years, stratified by sex. We replicated the findings in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) using cord blood DNAm.Epigenome-wide screening was applied to identify CpGs associated with lung function trajectories in 396 boys, and 390 girls of IOWBC-F1. Replication in ALSPAC focused on lung function at ages 8, 15 and 24â€…years. Statistically significantly replicated CpGs were investigated for consistency in direction of association between cohorts, stability of DNAm over time in IOWBC-F1, relevant biological processes, and for association with gene expression (n=161) in IOWBC F2-generation (IOWBC-F2).Differential DNAm of 8 CpGs on genesGLUL, MYCN, HLX, LHX1, COBL, COL18A1, STRA6,andWNT11involved in developmental processes, were significantly associated with lung function in the same direction in IOWBC-F1 and ALSPAC, and showed stable patterns at birth, age 10 and 18â€…years between high and low lung function trajectories in IOWBC-F1.

However, whether similar DNA methylation patterns are associated with childhood and adolescent body mass index (BMI) is largely unknown. More insight into this relationship at younger ages may have implications for future prevention of obesity and its related traits.We examined whether DNA methylation in cord blood and whole blood in childhood and adolescence was associated with BMI in the age range from 2 to 18â€‰years using both cross-sectional and longitudinal models. We performed meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies including up to 4133 children from 23 studies. We examined the overlap of findings reported in previous studies in children and adults with those in our analyses and calculated enrichment.DNA methylation at three CpGs (cg05937453, cg25212453, and cg10040131), each in a different age range, was associated with BMI at Bonferroni significance, Pâ€‰<â€‰1.06â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7, with a 0.96 standard deviation score (SDS) (standard error (SE) 0.17), 0.32 SDS (SE 0.06), and 0.32 BMI SDS (SE 0.06) higher BMI per 10% increase in methylation, respectively. DNA methylation at nine additional CpGs in the cross-sectional childhood model was associated with BMI at false discovery rate significance. The strength of the associations of DNA methylation at the 187 CpGs previously identified to be associated with adult BMI, increased with advancing age across childhood and adolescence in our analyses. In addition, correlation coefficients between effect estimates for those CpGs in adults and in children and adolescents also increased. Among the top findings for each age range, we observed increasing enrichment for the CpGs that were previously identified in adults (birth Penrichmentâ€‰=â€‰1; childhood Penrichmentâ€‰=â€‰2.00â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4; adolescence Penrichmentâ€‰=â€‰2.10â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7).There were only minimal associations of DNA methylation with childhood and adolescent BMI. With the advancing age of the participants across childhood and adolescence, we observed increasing overlap with altered DNA methylation loci reported in association with adult BMI. These findings may be compatible with the hypothesis that DNA methylation differences are mostly a consequence rather than a cause of obesity.",

While emerging research in humans supports a similar association, studies to date have been limited to candidate gene and cross-sectional approaches, with a focus on extreme deviations in the caregiving environment.Here, we explored the prospective association between typical variation in maternal sensitivity and offspring epigenome-wide DNAm, in a population-based cohort of children (N = 235). Maternal sensitivity was observed when children were 3- and 4-years-old. DNAm, quantified with the Infinium 450 K array, was extracted at age 6 (whole blood). The influence of methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), DNAm at birth (cord blood), and confounders (socioeconomic status, maternal psychopathology) was considered in follow-up analyses.Genome-wide significant associations between maternal sensitivity and offspring DNAm were observed at 13 regions (p < 1.06 Ã— 10-07), but not at single sites. Follow-up analyses indicated that associations at these regions were in part related to genetic factors, confounders, and baseline DNAm levels at birth, as evidenced by the presence of mQTLs at five regions and estimate attenuations. Robust associations with maternal sensitivity were found at four regions, annotated to ZBTB22, TAPBP, ZBTB12, and DOCK4.These findings provide novel leads into the relationship between typical variation in maternal caregiving and offspring DNAm in humans, highlighting robust regions of associations, previously implicated in psychological and developmental problems, immune functioning, and stress responses.",

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of more than 1000 prefrontal cortex brain samples to prioritize the most consistent methylation differences in multiple cohorts. Using a uniform analysis pipeline, we identified 3751 CpGs and 119 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) significantly associated with Braak stage. Our analysis identified differentially methylated genes such as MAMSTR, AGAP2, and AZU1. The most significant DMR identified is located on the MAMSTR gene, which encodes a cofactor that stimulates MEF2C. Notably, MEF2C cooperates with another transcription factor, PU.1, a central hub in theÂ AD gene network. Our enrichment analysis highlighted the potential roles of the immune system and polycomb repressive complex 2 in pathological AD. These results may help facilitate future mechanistic and biomarker discovery studies in AD.",

We also leveraged up to 4Â years of longitudinal DNA methylation data, sampled at approximately 1Â year intervals to model alterations in methylation levels at DMRs to delineate methylation changes associated with aging and disease progression, by linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling for the unchanged diagnosis groups (AD, MCI and control, respectively) and U-shape testing for those with changed diagnosis (converters).When compared with controls, patients with MCI consistently displayed promoter hypomethylation at methylation QTL (mQTL) gene locus PM20D1. This promoter hypomethylation was even more prominent in patients with mild to moderate AD. This is in stark contrast with previously reported hypermethylation in hippocampal and frontal cortex brain tissues in patients with advanced-stage AD at this locus. From longitudinal data, we show that initial promoter hypomethylation of PM20D1 during MCI and early stage AD is reversed to eventual promoter hypermethylation in late stage AD, which helps to complete a fuller picture of methylation dynamics. We also confirm this observation in an independent cohort from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) Study using DNA methylation and gene expression data from brain tissues as neuropathological staging (Braak score) advances.Our results confirm that PM20D1 is an mQTL in AD and demonstrate that it plays a dynamic role at different stages of the disease. Further in-depth study is thus warranted to fully decipher its role in the evolution of AD and potentially explore its utility as a blood-based biomarker for AD.",

Accumulating evidence has implicated abnormal DNA methylation in the development of schizophrenia. However, the mechanisms by which DNA methylation changes alter the risk for schizophrenia remain largely unknown. We recently carried out a DNA methylome study of peripheral blood samples from 469 first-episode patients with schizophrenia and 476 age- and gender-matched healthy controls of Han Chinese origin. Genomic DNA methylation patterns were quantified using an Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We identified multiple differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions between patients and controls. The most significant DMPs were annotated to genes C17orf53, THAP1 and KCNQ4 (KV7.4), with Bonferroni-adjusted P values of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text], respectively. In particular, KCNQ4 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel of the KV7 family, which is linked to neuronal excitability. The genes associated with top-ranked DMPs also included many genes involved in nervous system development, such as LIMK2 and TMOD2. Gene ontology analysis of the differentially methylated genes further identified strong enrichment of neuronal networks, including neuron projection extension, axonogenesis and neuron apoptotic process. Finally, we provided evidence that schizophrenia-associated epigenetic alterations co-localize with genetic susceptibility loci. By focusing on first-episode schizophrenia patients, our investigation lends particularly strong support for an important role of DNA methylation in schizophrenia pathogenesis unconfounded by the effects of long-term antipsychotic medication or disease progression. The observed DNA methylation aberrations in schizophrenia patients could potentially provide a valuable resource for identifying diagnostic biomarkers and developing novel therapeutic targets to benefit schizophrenia patients.",

Here, we describe the results of the largest DNA methylation meta-analysis of PTSD to date. Ten cohorts, military and civilian, contribute blood-derived DNA methylation data from 1,896 PTSD cases and trauma-exposed controls. Four CpG sites within the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) associate with PTSD after adjustment for multiple comparisons, with lower DNA methylation in PTSD cases relative to controls. Although AHRR methylation is known to associate with smoking, the AHRR association with PTSD is most pronounced in non-smokers, suggesting the result was independent of smoking status. Evaluation of metabolomics data reveals that AHRR methylation associated with kynurenine levels, which are lower among subjects with PTSD. This study supports epigenetic differences in those with PTSD and suggests a role for decreased kynurenine as a contributor to immune dysregulation in PTSD.",

Panic disorder (PD) has been linked with changes in leukocytes distributions in several small studies using different methods for immune characterization. Additionally, alterations in the methylation of repetitive DNA elements, such as LINE-1, have been associated with mental disorders. Here, we use peripheral blood DNA methylation data from two studies and an updated DNA methylation deconvolution library to investigate the relation of leukocyte proportions and methylation status of repetitive elements in 133 patients with panic disorder compared with 118 controls.We used DNA methylation data to deconvolute leukocyte cell-type proportions and to infer LINE-1 element methylation comparing PD cases and controls. We also identified differentially methylated CpGs associated with PD using an epigenome-wide association study approach (EWAS), with models adjusting for sex, age, and cell-type proportions. Individuals with PD had a lower proportion of CD8T cells (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78-0.96, P-adjâ€‰=â€‰0.030) when adjusting for age, sex, and study compared with controls. Also, PD cases had significantly lower LINE-1 repetitive element methylation than controls (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The EWAS identified 61 differentially methylated CpGs (58 hypo- and 3 hypermethylated) in PD (Bonferroni adjusted Pâ€‰<â€‰1.33â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7).These results suggest that those with panic disorder have changes to their immune system and dysregulation of repeat elements relative to controls.",

In the current study, we examined the association between alcohol consumption and DNA methylation patterns using three approaches: a conventional epigenome-wide association study (EWAS); a co-twin comparison design, which controls for genetic and environmental influences that twins share; and a regression of age acceleration, defined as a discrepancy between chronological age and DNA methylation age, on alcohol consumption.Participants came from the Finnish Twin Cohorts (FinnTwin12/FinnTwin16; N = 1004; 55% female; average age = 23 years). Individuals reported the number of alcoholic beverages consumed in the past week, and epigenome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in whole-blood using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip.In the EWAS, alcohol consumption was significantly related to methylation at 24 CpG sites. When evaluating whether differences between twin siblings (185 monozygotic pairs) in alcohol consumption predicted differences in DNA methylation, co-twin comparisons replicated four CpG sites from the EWAS and identified 23 additional sites. However, when we examined qualitative differences in drinking patterns between twins (heavy drinker versus light drinker/abstainer or moderate drinker versus abstainer; 44 pairs), methylation patterns did not significantly differ within twin pairs. Finally, individuals who reported higher alcohol consumption also exhibited greater age acceleration, though results were no longer significant after controlling for genetic and environmental influences shared by co-twins.Our analyses offer insight into the associations between epigenetic variation and levels of alcohol consumption in young adulthood.This article is protected by copyright.

Regression models were performed for health outcomes in later life. An epigenome-wide association study for early-life exposure to hunger was performed in a subgroup (nÂ =Â 2221) with whole blood DNA methylation data.Results:Childhood exposure to hunger was associated with CVD and depressive symptoms in later life. Prenatal or infant exposure was strongly associated with depressive symptoms.

Genome-wide DNA methylation derived from buffy coat was profiled in 62 vegans and 142 non-vegetarians. Using linear regression, methylation of CpG sites and genes was categorized or summarized according to various genic/intergenic regions and CpG island-related regions, as well as the promoter. Methylation of genes was measured as the average methylation of available CpG's annotated to the nominated region of the respective gene. A permutation method defining the null distribution adapted from Storey et al. was used to adjust for false discovery. Differences in methylation of several CpG sites and genes were detected at a false discovery rate < 0.05 in region-specific and overall analyses. A vegan diet was associated predominantly with hypomethylation of genes, most notably methyltransferase-like 1 (METTL1). Although a limited number of differentially methylated features were detected in the current study, the false discovery method revealed that a much larger proportion of differentially methylated genes and sites exist, and could be detected with a larger sample size. Our findings suggest modest differences in DNA methylation in vegans and non-vegetarians, with a much greater number of detectable significant differences expected with a larger sample.",

We found that those CpGs that are hypo-methylated in samples with non-lactobacilli (O-type) dominating communities are strongly associated with gastrointestinal differentiation and that a signature consisting of 819 CpGs was able to discriminate lactobacilli-dominating (L-type) from O-type samples with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.77-0.90) in an independent validation set. The performance found in samples with more than 50% epithelial cells was further improved (AUC 0.87) and in women younger than 50Â years of age was even higher (AUC 0.91). In a subset of 96 women, the buccal but not the blood cell DNA showed the same trend as the cervicovaginal samples in discriminating women with L- from O-type cervicovaginal communities.These findings strongly support the view that the epithelial epigenome plays an essential role in hosting specific microbial communities.",

To accumulate knowledge of the pathological mechanisms behind the condition at the methylation level, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of MetS and its components, testing 1187 individuals of European ancestry for approximately 470Â 000 methylation sites throughout the genome. Methylation site cg19693031 in gene TXNIP -previously associated with type 2 diabetes, glucose and lipid metabolism, associated with fasting glucose level (Pâ€‰=â€‰1.80â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8). Cg06500161 in gene ABCG1 associated both with serum triglycerides (Pâ€‰=â€‰5.36â€‰Ã—â€‰10-9) and waist circumference (Pâ€‰=â€‰5.21â€‰Ã—â€‰10-9).

We hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms may be involved in asthma remission.Clinical remission (ClinR) was defined as the absence of asthma symptoms and medication for at least 12Â months, and complete remission (ComR) was defined as ClinR with normal lung function and absence of airway hyperresponsiveness. We analyzed differential DNA methylation of ClinR and ComR comparing to persistent asthma (PersA) in whole blood samples (nâ€‰=â€‰72) and nasal brushing samples (nâ€‰=â€‰97) in a longitudinal cohort of well characterized asthma patients. Significant findings of whole blood DNA methylation were tested for replication in two independent cohorts, Lifelines and Epidemiological study on the Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA).We identified differentially methylated CpG sites associated with ClinR (7 CpG sites) and ComR (129 CpG sites) in whole blood. One CpG (cg13378519, Chr1) associated with ClinR was replicated and annotated to PEX11 (Peroxisomal Biogenesis Factor 11 Beta). The whole blood DNA methylation levels of this CpG were also different between ClinR and healthy subjects. One ComR-associated CpG (cg24788483, Chr10) that annotated to TCF7L2 (Transcription Factor 7 Like 2) was replicated and associated with expression of TCF7L2 gene. One out of seven ClinR-associated CpG sites and 8 out of 129 ComR-associated CpG sites identified from whole blood samples showed nominal significance (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and the same direction of effect in nasal brushes.We identified DNA methylation markers possibly associated with clinical and complete asthma remission in nasal brushes and whole blood, and two CpG sites identified from whole blood can be replicated in independent cohorts and may play a role in peroxisome proliferation and Wnt signaling pathway.",

It is not yet known which DNAm-based biomarkers of age acceleration (BoAA) has the strongest association with age-related endpoints.We collected the blood samples from two independent cohorts: the Normative Ageing Study, and the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg cohort. We measured epigenome-wide DNAm level, and generated five DNAm BoAA at baseline. We used Cox proportional hazards model to analyze the relationships between BoAA and all-cause death. We applied the Fine and Gray competing risk model to estimate the risk of BoAA on myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cancer, accounting for death of other reasons as the competing risks. We used random-effects meta-analyses to pool the individual results, with adjustment for multiple testing.The mean chronological ages in the two cohorts were 74, and 61, respectively. Baseline GrimAgeAccel, and DNAm-related mortality risk score (DNAmRS) both had strong associations with all-cause death, MI, and stroke, independent from chronological age. For example, a one standard deviation (SD) increment in GrimAgeAccel was significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause death [hazard ratio (HR): 2.01; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15, 3.50], higher risk of MI (HR: 1.44; 95% CI, 1.16, 1.79), and elevated risk of stroke (HR: 1.42; 95% CI, 1.06, 1.91).

We identified 651 proteins associated with age (506 over-represented, 145 underrepresented with age). Mediation analysis suggested a role for partialcis-epigenetic control of protein expression with age. Of the age-associated proteins, 33.5% and 45.3%, were associated with mortality and multimorbidity, respectively. There was enrichment of proteins associated with inflammation and extracellular matrix as well as senescence-associated secretory proteins.

However, a subset of TEs exhibit variable methylation levels in genetically identical individuals, and this is associated with epigenetically conferred phenotypic differences, environmental adaptability, and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The evolutionary origins and molecular mechanisms underlying interindividual epigenetic variability remain unknown. Using a repertoire of murine variably methylated intracisternal A-particle (VM-IAP) epialleles as a model, we demonstrate that variable DNA methylation states at TEs are highly susceptible to genetic background effects. Taking a classical genetics approach coupled with genome-wide analysis, we harness these effects and identify a cluster of KRAB zinc finger protein (KZFP) genes that modifies VM-IAPs intransin a sequence-specific manner. Deletion of the cluster results in decreased DNA methylation levels and altered histone modifications at the targeted VM-IAPs. In some cases, these effects are accompanied by dysregulation of neighboring genes. We find that VM-IAPs cluster together phylogenetically and that this is linked to differential KZFP binding, suggestive of an ongoing evolutionary arms race between TEs and this large family of epigenetic regulators. These findings indicate that KZFP divergence and concomitant evolution of DNA binding capabilities are mechanistically linked to methylation variability in mammals, with implications for phenotypic variation and putative paradigms of mammalian epigenetic inheritance.Copyright Â© 2020 the Author(s).

Human pre-implantation embryos are an exception, in which dosage compensation occurs by X-chromosome dampening (XCD). Here, we examined whether XCD extends to human prenatal germ cells given their similarities to naive pluripotent cells. We found that female human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) display reduced X-linked gene expression before entering meiosis. Moreover, in hPGCs, both X chromosomes are active and express the long non-coding RNAs X active coating transcript (XACT) and X inactive specific transcript (XIST)-the master regulator of XCI-which are silenced after entry into meiosis. We find that XACT is a hPGC marker, describe XCD associated with XIST expression in hPGCs and suggest that XCD evolved in humans to regulate X-linked genes in pre-implantation embryos and PGCs. Furthermore, we found a unique mechanism of X-chromosome regulation in human primordial oocytes. Therefore, future studies of human germline development must consider the sexually dimorphic X-chromosome dosage compensation mechanisms in the prenatal germline.",
No,20201214,meqtl,33216750,Rare genetic variation at transcription factor binding sites modulates local DNA methylation profiles.,PLoS Genet,"Although DNA methylation is the best characterized epigenetic mark, the mechanism by which it is targeted to specific regions in the genome remains unclear. Recent studies have revealed that local DNA methylation profiles might be dictated by cis-regulatory DNA sequences that mainly operate via DNA-binding factors. Consistent with this finding, we have recently shown that disruption of CTCF-binding sites by rare single nucleotide variants (SNVs) can underlie cis-linked DNA methylation changes in patients with congenital anomalies. These data raise the hypothesis that rare genetic variation at transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) might contribute to local DNA methylation patterning. In this work, by combining blood genome-wide DNA methylation profiles, whole genome sequencing-derived SNVs from 247 unrelated individuals along with 133 predicted TFBS motifs derived from ENCODE ChIP-Seq data, we observed an association between the disruption of binding sites for multiple TFs by rare SNVs and extreme DNA methylation values at both local and, to a lesser extent, distant CpGs. While the majority of these changes affected only single CpGs, 24% were associated with multiple outlier CpGs within Â±1kb of the disrupted TFBS. Interestingly, disruption of functionally constrained sites within TF motifs lead to larger DNA methylation changes at nearby CpG sites. Altogether, these findings suggest that rare SNVs at TFBS negatively influence TF-DNA binding, which can lead to an altered local DNA methylation profile. Furthermore, subsequent integration of DNA methylation and RNA-Seq profiles from cardiac tissues enabled us to observe an association between rare SNV-directed DNA methylation and outlier expression of nearby genes. In conclusion, our findings not only provide insights into the effect of rare genetic variation at TFBS on shaping local DNA methylation and its consequences on genome regulation, but also provide a rationale to incorporate DNA methylation data to interpret the functional role of rare variants.",

The most utilized method of assessing DNA methylation uses BeadChips, generating an epigenome-wide ""snapshot"" of >450,000 observations (probe measurements) per assay. However, the reliability of each of these measurements is not equal, and little consideration is paid to consequences for research. We correlated repeat measurements of the same DNA samples using the Illumina HumanMethylation450K and the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips in 350 blood DNA samples. Probes that were reliably measured were more heritable and showed consistent associations with environmental exposures, gene expression, and greater cross-tissue concordance. Unreliable probes were less replicable and generated an unknown volume of false negatives. This serves as a lesson for working with DNA methylation data, but the lessons are equally applicable to working with other data: as we advance toward generating increasingly greater volumes of data, failure to document reliability risks harming reproducibility.Â© 2020 The Authors.",

We performed nanopore sequencing of nucleosome occupancy and methylome (nanoNOMe) on four human cell lines (GM12878, MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231). The single-molecule resolution allows footprinting of protein and nucleosome binding, and determination of the combinatorial promoter epigenetic signature on individual molecules. Long-read sequencing makes it possible to robustly assign reads to haplotypes, allowing us to generate a fully phased human epigenome, consisting of chromosome-level allele-specific profiles of CpG methylation and chromatin accessibility.

After a median follow-up of 6.2Â years, 1079 deaths were documented, including 596 from CRC. Associations of the aging algorithms with survival outcomes were evaluated using the Cox regression and survival curves. Harrell's C-statistics were computed to investigate predictive performance.Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of all-cause mortality for patients in the third compared to the first tertile were 1.66 (1.32, 2.09) for the DNAmMRscore, 1.35 (1.14, 1.59) for AgeAccelPheno and 1.65 (1.37, 2.00) for AgeAccelGrim, even after adjustment for age, sex and stage. AgeAccelHorvath and AgeAccelHannum were not associated with all-cause or CRC-specific mortality. In stage-specific analyses, associations were much stronger for patients with early or intermediate stage cancers (stages I, II and III) than for patients with metastatic (stage IV) cancers. Associations were weaker and less often statistically significant for CRC-specific mortality. Adding DNAmMRscore, AgeAccelPheno or AgeAccelGrim to models including age, sex and tumor stage improved predictive performance moderately.DNAmMRscore, AgeAccelPheno and AgeAccelGrim could serve as non-invasive CRC prognostic biomarkers independent of other commonly used markers.

To meet this need, we describe the development of a 5hmC tissue map by characterizing the genomic distributions of 5hmC in 19 human tissues derived from ten organ systems. Subsequent sequencing results enabled the identification of genome-wide 5hmC distributions that uniquely separates samples by tissue type. Further comparison of the 5hmC profiles with transcriptomes and histone modifications revealed that 5hmC is preferentially enriched on tissue-specific gene bodies and enhancers. Taken together, the results provide an extensive 5hmC map across diverse human tissue types that suggests a potential role of 5hmC in tissue-specific development; as well as a resource to facilitate future studies of DNA demethylation in pathogenesis and the development of 5hmC as biomarkers.",
No,20201214,wgbs,33228774,Comparison of methylation capture sequencing and Infinium MethylationEPIC array in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.,Epigenetics Chromatin,"Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have been widely applied to identify methylation CpG sites associated with human disease. To date, the Infinium MethylationEPIC array (EPIC) is commonly used for high-throughput DNA methylation profiling. However, the EPIC array covers only 30% of the human methylome. Methylation Capture bisulfite sequencing (MC-seq) captures target regions of methylome and has advantages of extensive coverage in the methylome at an affordable price.Epigenome-wide DNA methylation in four peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples was profiled by using SureSelectXT Methyl-Seq for MC-seq and EPIC platforms separately. CpG site-based reproducibility of MC-seq was assessed with DNA sample inputs ranging in quantity of high (>â€‰1000Â ng), medium (300-1000Â ng), and low (150Â ng-300Â ng). To compare the performance of MC-seq and the EPIC arrays, we conducted a Pearson correlation and methylation value difference at each CpG site that was detected by both MC-seq and EPIC. We compared the percentage and counts in each CpG island and gene annotation between MC-seq and the EPIC array.After quality control, an average of 3,708,550 CpG sites per sample were detected by MC-seq with DNA quantityâ€‰>â€‰1000Â ng. Reproducibility of DNA methylation inÂ MC-seq-detected CpG sites was high among samples with high, medium, and low DNA inputs (râ€‰>â€‰0.96). The EPIC array captured an average of 846,464 CpG sites per sample. Compared with the EPIC array, MC-seq detected more CpGs in coding regions and CpG islands. Among the 472,540 CpG sites captured by both platforms, methylation of a majority of CpG sites was highly correlated in the same sample (r: 0.98-0.99). However, methylation for a small proportion of CpGs (Nâ€‰=â€‰235) differed significantly between the two platforms, with differences in beta values of greater than 0.5.Our results show that MC-seq is an efficient and reliable platform for methylome profiling with a broader coverage of the methylome than the array-based platform. Although methylation measurements in majority of CpGs are highly correlated, a number of CpG sites show large discrepancy between the two platforms, which warrants further investigation and needs cautious interpretation.",

The majority of PanNETs are non-functional and do not express cell-type specific hormones. In the current study we examine whether tumour DNA methylation (DNAme) profiling combined with genomic data is able to identify cell of origin and to reveal pathways involved in PanNET progression. We analyse genome-wide DNAme data of 125 PanNETs and sorted Î±- and Î²-cells. To confirm cell identity, we investigate ARX and PDX1 expression. Based on epigenetic similarities, PanNETs cluster in Î±-like, Î²-like and intermediate tumours. The epigenetic similarity to Î±-cells progressively decreases in the intermediate tumours, which present unclear differentiation. Specific transcription factor methylation and expression vary in the respective Î±/Î²-tumour groups. Depending on DNAme similarity to Î±/Î²-cells, PanNETs have different mutational spectra, stage of the disease and prognosis, indicating potential means of PanNET progression.",

Epigenetic age acceleration is postulated to be an underlying factor. However, comparative studies of side-specific colonic tissue epigenetic aging are lacking. Here, we performed DNA methylation analysis of matched right and left biopsies of normal colon from 128 individuals. Among African Americans (nâ€‰=â€‰88), the right colon showed accelerated epigenetic aging as compared to individual-matched left colon (1.51â€‰years; 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.62 to 2.40â€‰years; two-sided Pâ€‰=â€‰.001). In contrast, among European Americans (nâ€‰=â€‰40), the right colon shows remarkable age deceleration (1.93â€‰years; 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.65 to 3.21â€‰years; two-sided Pâ€‰=â€‰.004). Further, epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation identifies a unique pattern of hypermethylation in African American right colon. Our study is the first to report such race and side-specific differences in epigenetic aging of normal colon, providing novel insight into the observed younger age-of-onset and relative preponderance of right-side colon neoplasia in African Americans.Â© The Author(s) 2020.

Initially, age-predictors for mice were trained for genome-wide DNA methylation profiles and we have recently described a targeted assay based on pyrosequencing of DNA methylation at only three age-associated genomic regions. Here, we established alternative approaches using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and barcoded bisulfite amplicon sequencing (BBA-seq). At individual CG dinucleotides (CpGs) the correlation of DNA methylation with chronological age was slightly higher for pyrosequencing and ddPCR as compared to BBA-seq. On the other hand, BBA-seq revealed that neighboring CpGs tend to be stochastically modified at murine age-associated regions. Furthermore, the binary sequel of methylated and non-methylated CpGs in individual reads can be used for single-read predictions, which may reflect heterogeneity in epigenetic aging. In comparison to C57BL/6 mice the single-read age-predictions using BBA-seq were also accelerated in the shorter-lived DBA/2 mice, and in C57BL/6 mice with a lifespan quantitative trait locus of DBA/2 mice. Taken together, we describe alternative targeted methods for epigenetic age predictions that provide new perspectives for aging-intervention studies in mice.",

However, previous studies have focused primarily on whole placental tissue, which is a mixture of epigenetically distinct cell populations. Here, we present the first methylome-wide analysis of first trimester (nÂ =â€‰9) and term (nÂ =â€‰19) human placental samples of four cell populations: trophoblasts, Hofbauer cells, endothelial cells, and stromal cells, using the Illumina EPIC methylation array, which quantifies DNAm at >â€‰850,000 CpGs.The most distinct DNAm profiles were those of placental trophoblasts, which are central to many pregnancy-essential functions, and Hofbauer cells, which are a rare fetal-derived macrophage population. Cell-specific DNAm occurs at functionally-relevant genes, including genes associated with placental development and preeclampsia. Known placental-specific methylation marks, such as those associated with genomic imprinting, repetitive element hypomethylation, and placental partially methylated domains, were found to be more pronounced in trophoblasts and often absent in Hofbauer cells. Lastly, we characterize the cell composition and cell-specific DNAm dynamics across gestation.Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of DNAm in human placental cell types from first trimester and term pregnancies. This data will serve as a useful DNAm reference for future placental studies, and we provide access to this data via download from GEO (GSE159526), through interactive exploration from the web browser ( https://robinsonlab.shinyapps.io/Placental_Methylome_Browser/ ), and through the R package planet, which allows estimation of cell composition directly from placental DNAm data.",

Alterations in sperm DNA methylation have been implicated as a potential cause. However, age-dependent modifications of the germ cells' epigenome remain poorly understood. Our objective was to assess the DNA methylation profile of human spermatozoa during aging.We used a high throughput, customized methylC-capture sequencing (MCC-seq) approach to characterize the dynamic DNA methylation in spermatozoa from 94 fertile and infertile men, who were categorized as young, 48 men between 18-38 years or old 46 men between 46-71 years. We identified more than 150,000 age-related CpG sites that are significantly differentially methylated among 2.65 million CpG sites covered. We conducted machine learning using our dataset to predict the methylation age of subjects; the age prediction accuracy based on our assay provided a more accurate prediction than that using the 450Â K chip approach. In addition, we found that there are more hypermethylated (62%) than hypomethylated (38%) CpG sites in sperm of aged men, corresponding to 798Â of total differential methylated regions (DMRs), of which 483 are hypermethylated regions (HyperDMR), and 315 hypomethylated regions (HypoDMR). Moreover, the distribution of age-related hyper- and hypomethylated CpGs in sperm is not random; the CpG sites that were hypermethylated with advanced age were frequently located in the distal region to genes, whereas hypomethylated sites were near to gene transcription start sites (TSS). We identified a high density of age-associated CpG changes in chromosomes 4 and 16, particularly HyperDMRs with localized clusters, the chr4 DMR cluster overlaps PGC1Î± locus, a protein involved in metabolic aging and the chr16 DMR cluster overlaps RBFOX1 locus, a gene implicated in neurodevelopmental disease. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the most affected genes by age were associated with development, neuron projection, differentiation and recognition, and behaviour, suggesting a potential link to the higher risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children of aged fathers.We identified thousands of age-related and sperm-specific epigenetic alterations. These findings provide novel insight in understanding human sperm DNA methylation dynamics during paternal aging, and the subsequently affected genes potentially related to diseases in offspring.",

The proliferation of B cells is known to be associated with both risk and prognosis of IgAN, but the epigenetic mechanism underlying this association is unknown. In this study we carried out the first Epigenome-wide Association Study (EWAS) by using the latest Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip on 184 B cell-specific samples (92 case/control pairs) for Chinese IgAN population. After rigorous data normalization and residual batch effect correction, linear mixed effect model was used to detect methylation CpG sites associated with IgAN adjusting for age, gender and smoking. False discovery rate (FDR) less than 10% was used to account for multiple testing. Weighted gene co-methylation networks were generated to identify gene modules highly correlated with IgAN. A permutation test was performed to account for the potential effect of overfitting. After adjusting clinical covariates and potential technical batch effects, three CpGs corresponding toPCDH17, TERT, WDR82genes and three in the intergenic regions passed the genome-wide significant threshold. Methylation network analysis identified an additional IgAN associated gene module, containing 72 significant CpGs includingGALNT6, IQSEC1, CDC16 and SYS1, involved in the pathway related to tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis of IgAN. These results suggested important DNA methylation and gene targets in CD19+Â B cells for the pathogenesis of IgAN.",

DNA methylation might be involved in the underlying mechanisms and previous epigenome-wide association studies reported associations between lead exposure during pregnancy and cord blood methylation levels. However, it is unclear during which developmental stage lead exposure is most harmful. Cord blood methylation levels were assayed in 420 children from a Mexican pre-birth cohort using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray. Lead concentrations were measured in umbilical cord blood as well as in blood samples from the mothers collected at 2nd and 3rd trimester and delivery using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. In addition, maternal bone lead levels were measured in tibia and patella using X-ray fluorescence. Comprehensive quality control and preprocessing of microarray data was followed by an unbiased restriction to methylation sites with substantial variance. Methylation levels at 202Â 111 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites were regressed on each exposure adjusting for child sex, leukocyte composition, batch variables, gestational age, birthweight-for-gestational-age, maternal age, maternal education and mode of delivery. We find no association between prenatal lead exposure and cord blood methylation. This null result is strengthened by a sensitivity analysis showing that in the same dataset known biomarkers for birthweight-for-gestational-age can be recovered and the fact that phenotypic associations with lead exposure have been described in the same cohort.Â© The Author(s) 2020.

Evidence from animal models suggests that these associations may be partially explained by differential DNA methylation in the newborn with possible long-term consequences. To test this in humans, we meta-analysed the epigenome-wide associations of maternal haemoglobin levels during pregnancy with offspring DNA methylation in 3,967 newborn cord blood and 1,534 child and 1,962 adolescent whole-blood samples derived from ten cohorts. DNA methylation was measured using Illumina Infinium Methylation450K or MethylationEPIC arrays covering 450,000 and 850,000 methylation sites, respectively. There was no statistical support for association of maternal haemoglobin levels with offspring DNA methylation either at individual methylation sites or clustered in regions. For most participants, maternal haemoglobin levels were within the normal range in the current study, whereas adverse perinatal outcomes often arise at the extremes. Thus, this study does not rule out the possibility that associations with offspring DNA methylation might be seen in studies with more extreme maternal haemoglobin levels.",

Allergy is defined as having symptoms from at least one allergic disease (asthma/rhinitis/eczema) and positive serum specific IgE to common aeroallergens. The discovery study included 219 cases and 417 controls at age 4 and 228 cases and 593 controls at age 8 from three birth cohorts, with replication analyses in 325 cases and 1,111 controls. We performed additional analyses on 21 replicated sites in 785 cases and 2,124 controls by allergic symptoms only from eight cohorts, three not previously included in analyses.We identified 80 differentially methylated CpG sites (CpGs) which showed 1-3% methylation difference in the discovery phase, of which 21, including five novel CpGs, passed genome-wide significance after meta-analysis. All 21 CpGs were also significantly differentially methylated with allergic symptoms, and shared between asthma, rhinitis and eczema. The 21 CpGs mapped to relevant genes, including ACOT7, LMAN3 and CLDN23. All 21 CpGs were differently methylated in asthma in isolated eosinophils, and ten were replicated in respiratory epithelium.Reduced whole blood DNA methylation at 21 CpGs was significantly associated with childhood allergy.

This study capitalized on biological diversity observed within the PTSD group observed following epigenome-wide analysis of a well-characterized Discovery cohort (Nâ€‰=â€‰166) consisting of 83 male combat exposed veterans with PTSD, and 83 combat veterans without PTSD in order to identify patterns that might distinguish subtypes. Computational analysis of DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles identified two PTSD biotypes within the PTSD+ group, G1 and G2, associated with 34 clinical features that are associated with PTSD and PTSD comorbidities. The G2 biotype was associated with an increased PTSD risk and had higher polygenic risk scores and a greater methylation compared to the G1 biotype and healthy controls. The findings were validated at a 3-year follow-up (Nâ€‰=â€‰59) of the same individuals as well as in two independent, veteran cohorts (Nâ€‰=â€‰54 and Nâ€‰=â€‰38), and an active duty cohort (Nâ€‰=â€‰133). In some cases, for example Dopamine-PKA-CREB and GABA-PKC-CREB signaling pathways, the biotypes were oppositely dysregulated, suggesting that the biotypes were not simply a function of a dimensional relationship with symptom severity, but may represent distinct biological risk profiles underpinning PTSD. The identification of two novel distinct epigenetic biotypes for PTSD may have future utility in understanding biological and clinical heterogeneity in PTSD and potential applications in risk assessment for active duty military personnel under non-clinician-administered settings, and improvement of PTSD diagnostic markers.",

Differential DNA methylation across the epigenome has been associated with chronic disease risk. Whether diet quality is associated with differential methylation is unknown. This study assessed whether diet quality was associated with differential DNA methylation measured across 445Â 548 loci in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the TwinsUK cohort.The discovery cohort consisted of 4355 women from the WHI. The replication cohort consisted of 571 mono- and dizygotic twins from the TwinsUK cohort. DNA methylation was measured in whole blood using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 Beadchip. Diet quality was assessed using the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010). A meta-analysis, stratified by study cohort, was performed using generalized linear models that regressed methylation on AHEI-2010, adjusting for cell composition, chip number and location, study characteristics, principal components of genetic relatedness, age, smoking status, race/ethnicity and body mass index (BMI). Statistical significance was defined as a false discovery rate < 0.05. Significant sites were tested for replication in the TwinsUK cohort, with significant replication defined by Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 and a consistent direction.Diet quality was significantly associated with differential DNA methylation at 428 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in the discovery cohort.

Prenatal PFAS exposure is associated with adverse health outcomes in children. We hypothesized that DNA methylation changes may result from prenatal PFAS exposure and may be linked to offspring cardio-metabolic phenotype.We estimated associations of prenatal PFAS with DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood. We evaluated associations of methylation at selected sites with neonatal cardio-metabolic indicators.Among 583 mother-infant pairs in a prospective cohort, five PFAS were quantified in maternal serum (median 27 wk of gestation). Umbilical cord blood DNA methylation was evaluated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 array. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were evaluated at a false discovery rate(FDR)<0.05and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using comb-p (Å idÃ¡k-adjustedp<0.05). We estimated associations between methylation at candidate DMPs and DMR sites and the following outcomes: newborn weight, adiposity, and cord blood glucose, insulin, lipids, and leptin.Maternal serum PFAS concentrations were below the median for females in the U.S. general population. Moderate to high pairwise correlations were observed between PFAS concentrations (Ï=0.28-0.76). Methylation at one DMP (cg18587484), annotated to the geneTJAP1, was associated with perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) atFDR<â€‰0.05. Comb-p detected between 4 and 15 DMRs for each PFAS. Associated genes, some common across multiple PFAS, were implicated in growth (RPTOR), lipid homeostasis (PON1,PON3,CIDEB,NR1H2), inflammation and immune activity (RASL11B,RNF39), among other functions. There was suggestive evidence that two PFAS-associated loci (cg09093485, cg09637273) were associated with cord blood triglycerides and birth weight, respectively (FDR<â€‰0.1).DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood was associated with maternal serum PFAS concentrations during pregnancy, suggesting potential associations with offspring growth, metabolism, and immune function.

This study aimed to strengthen causal inference regarding the impact of adolescent victimization on the epigenome by controlling for genetic variation, age, gender, and shared environmental exposures. We conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association analyses (EWAS) on DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of 118 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs from the Environmental Risk study with and without severe adolescent victimization generated using buccal DNA collected at ages 5, 10 and 18, and the Illumina EPIC array. Additionally, we performed cross-sectional EWAS on age-18 blood and buccal DNA from the same individuals to elucidate tissue-specific signatures of severe adolescent victimization.

Prior studies focused on breastfeeding effects on DNA methylation (DNAm), ignoring other feeding modes. In this analysis of the Isle of Wight birth cohort, feeding modes were categorized as exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), exclusive formula feeding (EFF), and mixed feeding based on whether the respective feeding mode lasted for at least 3 months. In addition, in the past, infant feeding modes were assessed using DNAm at one time point in childhood, not changes of DNAm. In this paper, methylation differences (delta DNAm) were calculated by subtracting residual methylation values at birth from age 10 years (adjusting for cell types and season of blood collection at both ages). These deltas were estimated for all methylation sites where cytosine was followed by guanine (cytosine guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites). Then, we performed an epigenome-wide association study contrasting EBF, EFF, and mixed feeding with delta DNAm that represents changes in methylation from birth to 10 years. A total of 87 CpGs (EBF: 27 CpGs, EFF: 48 CpGs, mixed: 12 CpGs) were identified using separate linear regression models adjusting for confounders and multiple testing. The sum of all changes in methylation from birth to age 10 years was significantly lower in the EFF group. Correspondingly, the number of CpGs with a methylation decline was 4.7% higher reflecting 13,683 CpGs. Lower methylation related to exclusive formula feeding and its adverse potential for the child's development needs future research to reduce adverse health effects.",

For individuals infected with both Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the risk of active TB is 10% or more annually. Previously, we identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) a region on chromosome 5 associated with resistance to TB, which included epigenetic marks that could influence gene regulation. We hypothesized that HIV-infected individuals exposed to Mtb, who remain disease free, carry epigenetic changes that strongly protect them from active TB.We conducted a methylome-wide study in HIV-infected, TB-exposed cohorts from Uganda and Tanzania and integrated data from our GWAS.We identified 3 regions of interest that included markers that were differentially methylated between TB cases and LTBI controls: chromosome 1 (RNF220, p=4x10 -5), chromosome 2 (between COPS8 and COL6A3, p=2.7x10 -5), and chromosome 5 (CEP72, p=1.3x10 -5). These methylation results co-localized with associated SNPs, methylation QTLs, and methylation x SNP interaction effects. These markers were in regions with regulatory markers for cells involved in TB immunity and/or lung.Epigenetic regulation is a potential biologic factor underlying resistance to TB in immunocompromised individuals that can act in conjunction with genetic variants.Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Mendelian randomization and replication analyses showed same direction of effect between HbA1c and DNAm at cg21645848, but did not reach statistical significance.Conclusion:We found that higher maternal glycemia reflected by HbA1c is associated with cord blood DNAm atURGCP, a gene related with inflammatory pathways.",

Inconsistent findings in genetic studies on lung function trajectories, the importance of DNA methylation (DNA-M), and the critical role of adolescence in lung function development motivated the present study of pre-adolescent DNA-M with lung function trajectories. This study investigated epigenome-wide associations of DNA-M at cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide sites (CpGs) at childhood with lung function trajectories from childhood to young adulthood.DNA-M was measured in peripheral blood at age 10Â years in the Isle of Wight (IOW) birth cohort. Spirometry was conducted at ages 10, 18, and 26Â years. A training/testing-based method was used to screen CpGs. Multivariable logistic regressions were applied to assess the association of DNA-M with lung function trajectories from pre-adolescence to adulthood. To detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among CpGs, DMR enrichment analysis was conducted. Findings were further tested in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Pathway analyses were performed on the mapped genes of the identified CpGs and DMRs. Biological relevance of the identified CpGs was assessed with gene expression. All analyses were stratified by sex.High and low trajectories of FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC in each sex were identified. At PBonferroniâ€‰<â€‰0.05, DNA-M at 96 distinct CpGs (41 in males) showed associations with FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC trajectories in IOW cohort. These 95 CpGs (cg24000797 was disqualified) were further tested in ALSPAC; 44 CpGs (19 in males) of these 95 showed the same directions of association as in the IOW cohort; and three CpGs (two in males) were replicated. DNA-M at two and four CpGs showed significant associations with the corresponding gene expression in males and females, respectively. At PFDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05, 23 and 10 DMRs were identified in males and females, respectively. Pathways were identified; some of those were linked to lung function and chronic obstructive lung diseases.The identified CpGs at pre-adolescence have the potential to serve as candidate markers for lung function trajectory prediction and chronic lung diseases.",

Maternal nutrient levels during pregnancy affect development, and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is important for processing the nutrient folate.We hypothesize that supplement intake before pregnancy and maternal genotype are associated with DNA methylation in newborns.In the pregnancy cohort, Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), health history, and genotype information was obtained (n = 249 families). Cord blood DNA methylation (n = 130) was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450k array and global DNA methylation levels were computed over 455,698 sites. Supplement use preconception and during pregnancy were surveyed at visits during pregnancy. We evaluated associations between maternal preconception supplement intake and global DNA methylation or DNA methylation density distributions of newborn cord blood, stratified by the presence of a variant maternalMTHFRC677T allele.Maternal preconceptional multivitamin intake was associated with cord blood methylation, dependent on maternalMTHFRgenotype (interaction termp= 0.013). For mothers without theMTHFRvariant allele, multivitamin intake was associated with 0.96% (95% CI: 0.09, 1.83) higher global cord blood methylation (p= 0.04) and was also associated with the cumulative density distribution of methylation (p= 0.03). For mothers with at least one variant allele, multivitamin intake had a null -0.06% (95% CI: -0.45, 0.33) association with global cord blood DNA methylation, and was not associated with the cumulative density distribution (p= 0.37).We observed that cord blood DNA methylation was associated with maternal supplement exposure preconception and maternal genotype. Genetic context should be considered when assessing DNA methylation effects of modifiable risk factors around the time of pregnancy.",

However, analysis of such data often suffers from detecting the outliers of the samples, which subsequently affects the extraction of the true biological signals involved in the disease. To address this critical issue, we developed a novel framework for identifying methylation signatures using consecutive adaptation of a well-known outlier detection algorithm, density based clustering of applications with reducing noise (DBSCAN) followed by hierarchical clustering. We applied the framework to two representative neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (DS), using DNA methylation datasets from public sources (Gene Expression Omnibus, GEO accession ID: GSE74486). We first applied DBSCAN algorithm to eliminate outliers, and then used Limma statistical method to determine differentially methylated genes. Next, hierarchical clustering technique was applied to detect gene modules. Our analysis identified a methylation signature comprising 21 genes for AD and a methylation signature comprising 89 genes for DS, respectively. Our evaluation indicated that these two signatures could lead to high classification accuracy values (92% and 70%) for these two diseases. In summary, this framework will be useful to better detect outlier-free genetic and epigenetic signatures in various complex diseases and their developmental stages.",

Particularly for young and healthy monozygotic twins, DNA methylation divergence, if any, may be restricted to stochastic processes occurring post-twinning during embryonic development and early life. However, to what extent such stochastic mechanisms can systematically provide a stable source of inter-individual epigenetic variation remains uncertain until now.We enriched for inter-individual stochastic variation by using an equivalence testing-based statistical approach on whole blood methylation microarray data from healthy adolescent monozygotic twins. As a result, we identified 333 CpGs displaying similarly large methylation variation between monozygotic co-twins and unrelated individuals. Although their methylation variation surpasses measurement error and is stable in a short timescale, susceptibility to aging is apparent in the long term. Additionally, 46% of these CpGs were replicated in adipose tissue. The identified sites are significantly enriched at the clustered protocadherin loci, known for stochastic methylation in developing neurons. We also confirmed an enrichment in monozygotic twin DNA methylation discordance at these loci in whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from blood and adipose tissue.We have isolated a component of stochastic methylation variation, distinct from genetic influence, measurement error, and epigenetic drift. Biomarkers enriched in this component may serve in the future as the basis for universal epigenetic fingerprinting, relevant for instance in the discrimination of monozygotic twin individuals in forensic applications, currently impossible with standard DNA profiling.",

However, little is known about aging, lifestyle and genetic factors influencing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abundance. In this study, mtDNA abundance was estimated from the weighted intensities of probes mapping to the MT genome in 295,150 participants from the UK Biobank. We found that the abundance of mtDNA was significantly elevated in women compared to men, was negatively correlated with advanced age, higher smoking exposure, greater body-mass index, higher frailty index as well as elevated red and white blood cell count and lower mortality. In addition, several biochemistry markers in blood-related to cholesterol metabolism, ion homeostasis and kidney function were found to be significantly associated with mtDNA abundance. By performing a genome-wide association study, we identified 50 independent regions genome-wide significantly associated with mtDNA abundance which harbour multiple genes involved in the immune system, cancer as well as mitochondrial function. Using mixed effects models, we estimated the SNP-heritability of mtDNA abundance to be around 8%. To investigate the consequence of altered mtDNA abundance, we performed a phenome-wide association study and found that mtDNA abundance is involved in risk for leukaemia, hematologic diseases as well as hypertension. Thus, estimating mtDNA abundance from genotyping arrays has the potential to provide novel insights into age- and disease-relevant processes, particularly those related to immunity and established mitochondrial functions.",

The cause of PTB is multifactorial, and the development of generalizable biological models may enable early detection and guide therapeutic studies.To investigate the ability of transcriptomics and proteomics profiling of plasma and metabolomics analysis of urine to identify early biological measurements associated with PTB.This diagnostic/prognostic study analyzed plasma and urine samples collected from May 2014 to June 2017 from pregnant women in 5 biorepository cohorts in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs; ie, Matlab, Bangladesh; Lusaka, Zambia; Sylhet, Bangladesh; Karachi, Pakistan; and Pemba, Tanzania). These cohorts were established to study maternal and fetal outcomes and were supported by the Alliance for Maternal and Newborn Health Improvement and the Global Alliance to Prevent Prematurity and Stillbirth biorepositories. Data were analyzed from December 2018 to July 2019.Blood and urine specimens that were collected early during pregnancy (median sampling time of 13.6 weeks of gestation, according to ultrasonography) were processed, stored, and shipped to the laboratories under uniform protocols. Plasma samples were assayed for targeted measurement of proteins and untargeted cell-free ribonucleic acid profiling; urine samples were assayed for metabolites.The PTB phenotype was defined as the delivery of a live infant before completing 37 weeks of gestation.Of the 81 pregnant women included in this study, 39 had PTBs (48.1%) and 42 had term pregnancies (51.9%) (mean [SD] age of 24.8 [5.3] years). Univariate analysis demonstrated functional biological differences across the 5 cohorts. A cohort-adjusted machine learning algorithm was applied to each biological data set, and then a higher-level machine learning modeling combined the results into a final integrative model. The integrated model was more accurate, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.72-0.91) compared with the models derived for each independent biological modality (transcriptomics AUROC, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.61-0.83]; metabolomics AUROC, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.47-0.72]; and proteomics AUROC, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.64-0.85]). Primary features associated with PTB included an inflammatory module as well as a metabolomic module measured in urine associated with the glutamine and glutamate metabolism and valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis pathways.This study found that, in LMICs and high PTB settings, major biological adaptations during term pregnancy follow a generalizable model and the predictive accuracy for PTB was augmented by combining various omics data sets, suggesting that PTB is a condition that manifests within multiple biological systems. These data sets, with machine learning partnerships, may be a key step in developing valuable predictive tests and intervention candidates for preventing PTB.",

There is increasing evidence for a key role of the placenta in prenatal developmental programming, suggesting that the placenta may, in part, contribute to origins of neurodevelopmental outcomes.We examined associations between placental transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles and assessed their ability to predict intellectual and social impairment at age 10Â years in 379 children from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn (ELGAN) cohort. Assessment of intellectual ability (IQ) and social function was completed with the Differential Ability Scales-II and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), respectively. Examining IQ and SRS allows for studying ASD risk beyond the diagnostic criteria, as IQ and SRS are continuous measures strongly correlated with ASD. Genome-wide mRNA, CpG methylation and miRNA were assayeds with the Illumina Hiseq 2500, HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole Transcriptome Assay, and Illumina EPIC/850Â K array, respectively. We conducted genome-wide differential analyses of placental mRNA, miRNA, and CpG methylation data. These molecular features were then integrated for a predictive analysis of IQ and SRS outcomes using kernel aggregation regression. We lastly examined associations between ASD and the multi-omic-predicted component of IQ and SRS.Genes with important roles in neurodevelopment and placental tissue organization were associated with intellectual and social impairment. Kernel aggregations of placental multi-omics strongly predicted intellectual and social function, explaining approximately 8% and 12% of variance in SRS and IQ scores via cross-validation, respectively. Predicted in-sample SRS and IQ showed significant positive and negative associations with ASD case-control status.The ELGAN cohort comprises children born pre-term, and generalization may be affected by unmeasured confounders associated with low gestational age. We conducted external validation of predictive models, though the sample size (N = 49)Â and the scope of the availableÂ out-sample placentalÂ dataset are limited. Further validation of the models is merited.Aggregating information from biomarkers within and among molecular data types improves prediction of complex traits like social and intellectual ability in children born extremely preterm, suggesting that traits within the placenta-brain axis may be omnigenic.",

We tested whether a novel cross-tissue polyepigenetic biomarker indicative ofin uteroexposure to GC is associated with mental and behavioral disorders and their severity in children, possibly mediating the associations between maternal prenatal depressive and anxiety symptoms and these child outcomes.Children (nÂ =Â 814) from the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction (PREDO) study were followed-up from birth to age 7.1-10.7 years. A weighted polyepigenetic GC exposure score was calculated based on the methylation profile of 24 CpGs from umbilical cord blood. Child diagnosis of mental and behavioral disorder (nÂ =Â 99) and its severity, defined as the number of days the child had received treatment (all 99 had received outpatient treatment and 8 had been additionally in inpatient treatment) for mental or behavioral disorder as the primary diagnosis, came from the Care Register for Health Care. Mothers (nÂ =Â 408) reported on child total behavior problems at child's age of 2.3-5.8 years and their own depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy (nÂ =Â 583).The fetal polyepigenetic GC exposure score at birth was not associated with child hazard of mental and behavioral disorder (HRÂ =Â 0.82, 95% CI 0.54; 1.24, pÂ =Â 0.35) or total behavior problems (unstandardized betaÂ =Â -0.10, 95% CI -0.31; 0.10, pÂ =Â 0.33). However, for one standard deviation decrease in the polyepigenetic score, the child had spent 2.94 (95%CI 1.59; 5.45, pÂ <Â 0.001) more days in inpatient or outpatient treatment with any mental and behavioral disorder as the primary diagnosis. Criteria for mediation tests were not met.These findings suggest that fetal polyepigenetic GC exposure score at birth was not associated with any mental or behavioral disorder diagnosis or mother-rated total behavior problems, but it may contribute to identifying children at birth who are at risk for more severe mental or behavioral disorders.Â© 2020 The Authors.",

We have applied the principles of Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate whether brain-derived gene expression (nâ€‰=â€‰1194) may be responsible for mediating the effect of genetic variants on eight cognitive and psychological outcomes (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, depression, intelligence, insomnia, neuroticism and schizophrenia). Transcriptome-wide analyses identified 83 genes associated with at least one outcome (PBonferroniâ€‰<â€‰6.72â€‰Ã—â€‰10-6), with multiple-trait colocalization also implicating changes to brain-derived DNA methylation at nine of these loci. Comparing effects between outcomes identified evidence of enrichment which may reflect putative causal relationships, such as an inverse relationship between genetic liability towards schizophrenia risk and cognitive ability in later life. Repeating these analyses in whole blood (nâ€‰=â€‰31â€‰684), we replicated 58.2% of brain-derived effects (based on Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Finally, we undertook phenome-wide evaluations at associated loci to investigate pleiotropic effects with 700 complex traits. This highlighted pleiotropic loci such as FURIN (initially implicated in schizophrenia risk (Pâ€‰=â€‰1.05â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7)) which had evidence of an effect on 28 other outcomes, as well as genes which may have a more specific role in disease pathogenesis (e.g. SLC12A5 which only provided evidence of an effect on depression (Pâ€‰=â€‰7.13â€‰Ã—â€‰10-10)). Our results support the utility of whole blood as a valuable proxy for informing initial target identification but also suggest that gene discovery in a tissue-specific manner may be more informative. Finally, non-pleiotropic loci highlighted by our study may be of use for therapeutic translational endeavours.Â© The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.",

We studied the association between genome-wide DNA-methylation and post-conception age in fetal-lung (n=78, 42 exposed to in-utero-smoke (IUS)) tissue and chronological age in adult-lung tissue (n=160, 114 with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) using multi-variate linear regression models with covariate adjustment and tested for effect modification by phenotypes. Overlapping age-associations were evaluated for functional and tissue-specific enrichment using the Genotype-Tissue-Expression (GTEx) project. We identified 244 age-associated differentially methylated positions and 878 regions overlapping between fetal and adult-lung tissues. Hyper-methylated CpGs (96%) were enriched in transcription factor activity (FDR adjusted P=2x10-33) and implicated in developmental processes including embryonic organ morphogenesis, neurogenesis and growth delay. Hypo-methylated CpGs (2%) were enriched in oxido-reductase activity and VEGFA-VEGFR2 Signaling. Twenty-one age-by-sex and eleven age-by-pack-years interactions were statistically significant (FDR<0.05) in adult-lung tissue. DNA methylation in transcription factors during development in fetal lung recapitulates in adult-lung tissue with aging. These findings reveal molecular mechanisms and pathways that may link disrupted development in early-life and age-associated lung diseases.",

We have therefore performed a series of epigenome-wide association studies in 5019 blood samples collected at multiple time-points from birth to late adolescence from 2348 participants of two large independent cohorts. DNAm profiles of autosomal CpG sites (CpGs) were generated using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Change over time was widespread, observed at over one-half (53%) of CpGs. In most cases DNAm was decreasing (36% of CpGs). Inter-individual variation in linear trajectories was similarly widespread (27% of CpGs). Evidence for nonlinear change and inter-individual variation in nonlinear trajectories was somewhat less common (11% and 8% of CpGs, respectively). Very little inter-individual variation in change was explained by sex differences (0.4% of CpGs) even though sex-specific DNAm was observed at 5% of CpGs. DNAm trajectories were distributed non-randomly across the genome. For example, CpGs with decreasing DNAm were enriched in gene bodies and enhancers and were annotated to genes enriched in immune-developmental functions. By contrast, CpGs with increasing DNAm were enriched in promoter regions and annotated to genes enriched in neurodevelopmental functions. These findings depict a methylome undergoing widespread and often nonlinear change throughout childhood. They support a developmental role for DNA methylation that extends beyond birth into late adolescence and has implications for understanding life-long health and disease.

The purpose of this study was to examine the association between high BP in pregnancy, epigenomics, and later BP in African American women in the InterGEN Study (nÂ =Â 250).In cross-sectional analyses, regression and linear mixed-effects models were employed to examine the effects of high BP in pregnancy on: (a) epigenetic associations (DNA methylation) and (b) BP 3-5Â years after birth. The 850K Illumina EPIC BeadChip was used for evaluating epigenome-wide DNA methylation. High BP in pregnancy, preeclampsia, or eclampsia was self-reported by women, and BP was measured 3-5Â years after birth, per JNC-7 guidelines. DNA methylation and clinical BP were the main outcomes.Mean age of enrolled women was 31.2Â years, 21.8% were smokers, 58% had some college or higher education, 46.6% reported an annual income <$15Â 000, and 13.6% reported high BP in pregnancy. After adjustment for obesity, smoking, and age, women with a history of high BP in pregnancy had significantly higher BP than those who did not report this complication (5.39Â Â±Â 2.4Â mmÂ Hg, PÂ =Â .030). Epigenome-wide analysis revealed no significant sites after multiple testing correction.We observed a small, but clinically significant, increase in BP in women who reported high BP in pregnancy 3-5Â years after that pregnancy.

The processes responsible for reduced lung function in PLWH are largely unknown. We performed an epigenome-wide association study to investigate whether blood DNA methylation is associated with impaired lung function in PLWH.Using blood DNA methylation profiles from 161 PLWH, we tested the effect of methylation on FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio and FEV1decline over a median of 5 years. We evaluated the global methylation of PLWH with airflow obstruction by testing the differential methylation of transposable elements Alu and LINE-1, a well-described marker of epigenetic ageing.Airflow obstruction as defined by a FEV1/FVC<0.70 was associated with 1393 differentially methylated positions (DMPs), while 4676 were associated with airflow obstruction based on the FEV1/FVC<lower limit of normal. These DMPs were enriched for biological pathways associated with chronic viral infections. The airflow obstruction group was globally hypomethylated compared with those without airflow obstruction. 103 and 7112 DMPs were associated with FEV1and FEV1/FVC, respectively. No positions were associated with FEV1decline.A large number of DMPs were associated with airflow obstruction and lung function in a unique cohort of PLWH. Airflow obstruction in even relatively young PLWH is associated with global hypomethylation, suggesting advanced epigenetic ageing compared with those with normal lung function. The disturbance of the epigenetic regulation of key genes not previously identified in non-HIV COPD cohorts could explain the unique risk of COPD in PLWH.Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

This study aimed to understand RA-specific signatures in CD4+T cells using multi-omics data, interpreting inter-omics relationships in shaping the RA transcriptomic landscape.We profiled genome-wide variants, gene expression and DNA methylation in CD4+T cells from 82 patients with RA and 40 healthy controls using high-throughput technologies. We investigated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differential methylated regions (DMRs) in RA and localised quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for expression and methylation. We then integrated these based on individual-level correlations to inspect DEG-regulating sources and investigated the potential regulatory roles of RA-risk variants by a partitioned-heritability enrichment analysis with RA genome-wide association summary statistics.A large number of RA-specific DEGs were identified (n=2575), highlighting T cell differentiation and activation pathways. RA-specific DMRs, preferentially located in T cell regulatory regions, were correlated with the expression levels of 548 DEGs mostly in the same topologically associating domains. In addition, expressional variances in 771 and 83 DEGs were partially explained by expression QTLs for DEGs and methylation QTLs (meQTLs) for DEG-correlated DMRs, respectively. A large number of RA variants were moderately to strongly correlated with meQTLs. DEG-correlated DMRs, enriched with meQTLs, had strongly enriched heritability of RA.Our findings revealed that the methylomic changes, driven by RA heritability-explaining variants, shape the differential expression of a substantial fraction of DEGs in CD4+T cells in patients with RA, reinforcing the importance of a multidimensional approach in disease-relevant tissues.Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

DNA methylation is a hypothesised mechanism linking early life exposures and subsequent disease. However, epigenetic changes associated with high early weight gain have not previously been investigated. Our aim was to investigate the associations between early weight gain, peripheral blood DNA methylation, and subsequent overweight/obese. Data from the UK Avon Longitudinal study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort were used to estimate associations between early postnatal weight gain and epigenome-wide DNA CpG site methylation (Illumina 450Â K Methylation Beadchip) in blood in childhood (nâ€‰=â€‰125) and late adolescence (nâ€‰=â€‰96). High weight gain in the first year (a change in weight z-scoresâ€‰>â€‰0.67), both unconditional (rapid weight gain) and conditional on birthweight (rapid thrive), was related to individual CpG site methylation and across regions using the meffil pipeline, with and without adjustment for cell type proportions, and with 5% false discovery rate correction. Variation in methylation at high weight gain-associated CpG sites was then examined with regard to body composition measures in childhood and adolescence. Replication of the differentially methylated CpG sites was sought using whole-blood DNA samples from 104 children from the UK Southampton Women's Survey.Rapid infant weight gain was associated with small (+â€‰1% change) increases in childhood methylation (age 7) for two distinct CpG sites (cg01379158 (NT5M) and cg11531579 (CHFR)). Childhood methylation at one of these CpGs (cg11531579) was also higher in those who experienced rapid weight gain and were subsequently overweight/obese in adolescence (age 17). Rapid weight gain was not associated with differential DNA methylation in adolescence. Childhood methylation at the cg11531579 site was also suggestively associated with rapid weight gain in the replication cohort.This study identified associations between rapid weight gain in infancy and small increases in childhood methylation at two CpG sites, one of which was replicated and was also associated with subsequent overweight/obese. It will be important to determine whether loci are markers of early rapid weight gain across different, larger populations. The mechanistic relevance of these differentially methylated sites requires further investigation.",

However, the dynamic regulation of genome-wide DNA methylation in skeletal muscle development remains largely unknown. Here, we generated the first single-base resolution DNA methylome and transcriptome maps of porcine skeletal muscle across 27 developmental stages. The overall methylation level decreased from the embryo to the adult, which was highly correlated with the downregulated expression of DNMT1 and an increase in partially methylated domains. Notably, we identified over 40 000 developmentally differentially methylated CpGs (dDMCs) that reconstitute the developmental trajectory of skeletal muscle and associate with muscle developmental genes and transcription factors (TFs). The dDMCs were significantly under-represented in promoter regulatory regions but strongly enriched as enhancer histone markers and in chromatin-accessible regions. Integrative analysis revealed the negative regulation of both promoter and gene body methylation in genes associated with muscle contraction and insulin signaling during skeletal muscle development. Mechanistically, DNA methylation affected the expression of muscle-related genes by modulating the accessibly of upstream myogenesis TF binding, indicating the involvement of the DNA methylation/SP1/IGF2BP3 axis in skeletal myogenesis. Our results highlight the function and regulation of dynamic DNA methylation in skeletal muscle development.Â© The Author(s) 2021.

We investigated whether a lifestyle intervention in pregnant women with obesity is associated with epigenetic variation in cord blood and body composition in the offspring. Genome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed in cord blood from 208 offspring from the TOP-study, which includes pregnant women with obesity randomized to lifestyle interventions comprised of physical activity with or without dietary advice versus controls (standard of care). DNA methylation was altered at 379 sites, annotated to 370 genes, in cord blood from offspring of mothers following a lifestyle intervention versus controls (FDR<5%) when using the Houseman reference-free method to correct for cell composition and three of these sites were significant based on Bonferroni correction. These 370 genes are overrepresented in gene ontology terms including response to fatty acids and adipose tissue development. Offspring of mothers included in a lifestyle intervention were born with more lean mass compared to controls. Methylation at 17 sites, annotated to e.g.DISC1,GBX2,HERC2andHUWE1, partially mediates the effect of the lifestyle intervention on lean mass in the offspring (FDR<5%). Moreover, 22 methylation sites were associated with offspring BMI z-scores during the first 3 years of life (p<0.05). Overall, lifestyle interventions in pregnant women with obesity are associated with epigenetic changes in offspring, potentially influencing the offspring's lean mass and early growth.Â© 2021 by the American Diabetes Association.",

Here, we report the first large meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of aggressive behavior (Nâ€‰=â€‰15,324 participants). In peripheral blood samples of 14,434 participants from 18 cohorts with mean ages ranging from 7 to 68 years, 13 methylation sites were significantly associated with aggression (alphaâ€‰=â€‰1.2â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7; Bonferroni correction). In cord blood samples of 2425 children from five cohorts with aggression assessed at mean ages ranging from 4 to 7 years, 83% of these sites showed the same direction of association with childhood aggression (râ€‰=â€‰0.74, pâ€‰=â€‰0.006) but no epigenome-wide significant sites were found. Top-sites (48 at a false discovery rate of 5% in the peripheral blood meta-analysis or in a combined meta-analysis of peripheral blood and cord blood) have been associated with chemical exposures, smoking, cognition, metabolic traits, and genetic variation (mQTLs). Three genes whose expression levels were associated with top-sites were previously linked to schizophrenia and general risk tolerance. At six CpGs, DNA methylation variation in blood mirrors variation in the brain. On average 44% (rangeâ€‰=â€‰3-82%) of the aggression-methylation association was explained by current and former smoking and BMI. These findings point at loci that are sensitive to chemical exposures with potential implications for neuronal functions. We hope these results to be a starting point for studies leading to applications as peripheral biomarkers and to reveal causal relationships with aggression and related traits.",

Altered foetal DNA methylation (DNAm) has been proposed as a potential underlying mechanism. In the current study, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the associations between maternal anxiety, measured prospectively during pregnancy, and genome-wide DNAm from umbilical cord blood. Sixteen non-overlapping cohorts from 12 independent longitudinal studies of the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics Consortium participated, resulting in a combined dataset of 7243 mother-child dyads. We examined prenatal anxiety in relation to genome-wide DNAm and differentially methylated regions. We observed no association between the general symptoms of anxiety during pregnancy or pregnancy-related anxiety, and DNAm at any of the CpG sites, after multiple-testing correction. Furthermore, we identify no differentially methylated regions associated with maternal anxiety. At the cohort-level, of the 21 associations observed in individual cohorts, none replicated consistently in the other cohorts. In conclusion, contrary to some previous studies proposing cord blood DNAm as a promising potential mechanism explaining the link between maternal anxiety during pregnancy and adverse outcomes in offspring, we found no consistent evidence for any robust associations between maternal anxiety and DNAm in cord blood. Larger studies and analysis of DNAm in other tissues may be needed to establish subtle or subgroup-specific associations between maternal anxiety and the foetal epigenome.",
Yes,20210125,ewas,33414392,A genome-wide methylation study reveals X chromosome and childhood trauma methylation alterations associated with borderline personality disorder.,Transl Psychiatry,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe and highly prevalent psychiatric disorder, more common in females than in males and with notable differences in presentation between genders. Recent studies have shown that epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation may modulate geneâ€‰Ã—â€‰environment interactions and impact on neurodevelopment. We conducted an epigenome wide study (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450k beadchip) in a group of BPD patients with (Nâ€‰=â€‰49) and without (Nâ€‰=â€‰47) childhood traumas and in a control group (Nâ€‰=â€‰44). Results were confirmed in a replication cohort (Nâ€‰=â€‰293 BPD patients and Nâ€‰=â€‰114 controls) using EpiTYPER assays. Differentially methylated CpG sites were observed in several genes and intragenic regions in the X chromosome (PQBP1, ZNF41, RPL10, cg07810091 and cg24395855) and in chromosome 6 (TAP2). BPD patients showed significantly lower methylation levels in these CpG sites than healthy controls. These differences seemed to be increased by the existence of childhood trauma. Comparisons between BPD patients with childhood trauma and patients and controls without revealed significant differences in four genes (POU5F1, GGT6, TNFRSF13C and FAM113B), none of them in the X chromosome. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed that epigenetic alterations were more frequently found in genes controlling oestrogen regulation, neurogenesis and cell differentiation. These results suggest that epigenetic alterations in the X chromosome and oestrogen-regulation genes may contribute to the development of BPD and explain the differences in presentation between genders. Furthermore, childhood trauma events may modulate the magnitude of the epigenetic alterations contributing to BPD.",

However, DNA methylation and the lipid compositions and lipid concentrations of lipoprotein sizes have been scarcely studied. Here, we present an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) (Nâ€‰=â€‰5414 total) of mostly lipid-related metabolic measures, including a fine profiling of lipoproteins. As lipoproteins are the main players in the different stages of lipid metabolism, examination of epigenetic markers of detailed lipoprotein features might improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of metabolic disturbances.We conducted an EWAS of leukocyte DNA methylation and 226 metabolic measurements determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the population-based KORA F4 study (Nâ€‰=â€‰1662) and replicated the results in the LOLIPOP, NFBC1966, and YFS cohorts (Nâ€‰=â€‰3752). Follow-up analyses in the discovery cohort included investigations into gene transcripts, metabolic-measure ratios for pathway analysis, and disease endpoints. We identified 161 associations (pÂ valueâ€‰<â€‰4.7â€‰Ã—â€‰10-10), covering 16 CpG sites at 11 loci and 57 metabolic measures. Identified metabolic measures were primarily medium and small lipoproteins, and fatty acids. For apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, the associations mainly involved triglyceride composition and concentrations of cholesterol esters, triglycerides, free cholesterol, and phospholipids. All associations for HDL lipoproteins involved triglyceride measures only. Associated metabolic measure ratios, proxies of enzymatic activity, highlight amino acid, glucose, and lipid pathways as being potentially epigenetically implicated. Five CpG sites in four genes were associated with differential expression of transcripts in blood or adipose tissue. CpG sites in ABCG1 and PHGDH showed associations with metabolic measures, gene transcription,Â and metabolic measure ratios and were additionally linked to obesity or previous myocardial infarction, extending previously reported observations.Our study provides evidence of a link between DNA methylation and the lipid compositions and lipid concentrations of different lipoprotein size subclasses, thus offering in-depth insights into well-known associations of DNA methylation with total serum lipids. The results support detailed profiling of lipid metabolism to improve the molecular understanding of dyslipidemia and related disease mechanisms.",

We also assessed associations by time since blood draw and by cancer subtype, and we investigated potential nonlinearity.We observed relatively strong associations of age-adjustedPhenoAgewith risk of colorectal, kidney, lung, mature B-cell, and urothelial cancers (RR per SD was approximately 1.2-1.3). Similar findings were obtained for age-adjustedGrimAge, but the association with lung cancer risk was much larger (RR per SDâ€‰=â€‰1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]â€‰=â€‰1.44 to 2.30), after adjustment for smoking status, pack-years, starting age, time since quitting, and other cancer risk factors. Most associations appeared linear, larger than for the first-generation measures, and were virtually unchanged after adjustment for a large set of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and anthropometric variables. For cancer overall, the comprehensively adjusted rate ratio per SD was 1.13 (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.07 to 1.19) forPhenoAgeand 1.12 (95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.05 to 1.20) forGrimAgeand appeared larger within 5â€‰years of blood draw (RRâ€‰=â€‰1.29, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.15 to 1.44 and 1.19, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰1.06 to 1.33, respectively).The methylation-based measuresPhenoAgeandGrimAgemay provide insights into the relationship between biological aging and cancer and be useful to predict cancer risk, particularly for lung cancer.Â© The Author(s) 2020.

However, there is a need for a more thorough understanding of how quantitative measures of smoking exposure relate to differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in whole-blood among ever smokers. This study analysed microarray-based gene expression profiles from whole-blood samples according to smoking status and quantitative measures of smoking exposure among cancer-free women (nâ€‰=â€‰1708) in the Norwegian Women and Cancer postgenome cohort. When compared with never smokers and former smokers, current smokers had 911 and 1082 DEGs, respectively and their biological functions could indicate systemic impacts of smoking. LRRN3 was associated with smoking status with the lowest FDR-adjusted p-value. When never smokers and all former smokers were compared, no DEGs were observed, but LRRN3 was differentially expressed when never smokers were compared with former smokers who quit smoking â‰¤â€‰10Â years ago. Further, LRRN3 was positively associated with smoking intensity, pack-years, and comprehensive smoking index score among current smokers; and negatively associated with time since cessation among former smokers. Consequently, LRRN3 expression in whole-blood is a molecular signal of smoking exposure that could supplant self-reported smoking data in further research targeting blood-based markers related to the health effects of smoking.",

In this study, multiple saliva omics from an individual were monitored over three periods (100 timepoints) involving: (1) hourly sampling over 24 h without intervention, (2) hourly sampling over 24 h including immune system activation using the standard 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, (3) daily sampling for 33 days profiling the post-vaccination response. At each timepoint total saliva transcriptome and proteome, and small RNA from salivary extracellular vesicles were profiled, including mRNA, miRNA, piRNA and bacterial RNA. The two 24-h periods were used in a paired analysis to remove daily variation and reveal vaccination responses. Over 18,000 omics longitudinal series had statistically significant temporal trends compared to a healthy baseline. Various immune response and regulation pathways were activated following vaccination, including interferon and cytokine signaling, and MHC antigen presentation. Immune response timeframes were concordant with innate and adaptive immunity development, and coincided with vaccination and reported fever. Overall, mRNA results appeared more specific and sensitive (timewise) to vaccination compared to other omics. The results suggest saliva omics can be consistently assessed for non-invasive personalized monitoring and immune response diagnostics.",

Hippocampal volumes and brain hyperintensities in late life have been associated with early life circumstances. Epigenetic imprinting may underpin these associations. Methylation was measured at 982 sites in 13 imprinted locations in blood samples from a longitudinal cohort by bisulphite amplicon sequencing. Hippocampal volumes and hyperintensities were determined at age 64y and 72y using MRI. Hyperintensities were determined in white matter, grey matter and infratentorial regions. Permutation methods were used to adjust for multiple testing. At 64y, H19/IGF2 and NESPAS methylation predicted hippocampal volumes. PEG3 predicted hyperintensities in hippocampal grey matter, and white matter. GNASXL predicted grey matter hyperintensities. Changes with age were predicted for hippocampal volume (MEST1, KvDMR, L3MBTL, GNASXL), white matter (MEST1, PEG3) and hippocampal grey matter hyperintensities (MCTS2, GNASXL, NESPAS, L3MBTL, MCTS2, SNRPN, MEST1). Including childhood cognitive ability, years in education, or socioeconomic status as additional explanatory variables in regression analyses did not change the overall findings. Imprinting methylation in multiple genes predicts brain structures, and their change over time. These findings are potentially relevant to the development of novel tests of brain structure and function across the life-course, strategies to improve cognitive outcomes, and our understanding of early influences on brain development and function.",

However, the significance of cfDNA clinical utility remains uncertain in patients with brain tumors, primarily because of the limited sensitivity cfDNA has to detect real tumor-specific somatic mutations. This unresolved challenge has prevented accurate follow-up of glioma patients with non-invasive approaches.Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of tumor tissue and serum cell-free DNA of glioma patients.Here, we developed a non-invasive approach to profile the DNA methylation status in the serum of patients with gliomas and identified a cfDNA-derived methylation signature that is associated with the presence of gliomas and related immune features. By testing the signature in an independent discovery and validation cohorts, we developed and verified a score metric (the ""glioma epigenetic liquid biopsy score"" or GeLB) that optimally distinguished patients with or without glioma (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 97.78%). Furthermore, we found that changes in GeLB score reflected clinicopathological changes during surveillance (e.g., progression, pseudoprogression or response to standard or experimental treatment).Our results suggest that the GeLB score can be used as a complementary approach to diagnose and follow up patients with glioma.Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Improved understanding of the underlying genes and mechanisms at these loci will be key to understanding the pathogenesis of PD.To investigate what genes and genomic processes underlie the risk of sporadic PD.This genetic association study used the bioinformatic tools Coloc and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to integrate PD case-control GWAS data published in 2017 with expression data (from Braineac, the Genotype-Tissue Expression [GTEx], and CommonMind) and methylation data (derived from UK Parkinson brain samples) to uncover putative gene expression and splicing mechanisms associated with PD GWAS signals. Candidate genes were further characterized using cell-type specificity, weighted gene coexpression networks, and weighted protein-protein interaction networks.It was hypothesized a priori that some genes underlying PD loci would alter PD risk through changes to expression, splicing, or methylation. Candidate genes are presented whose change in expression, splicing, or methylation are associated with risk of PD as well as the functional pathways and cell types in which these genes have an important role.Gene-level analysis of expression revealed 5 genes (WDR6 [OMIM 606031], CD38 [OMIM 107270], GPNMB [OMIM 604368], RAB29 [OMIM 603949], and TMEM163 [OMIM 618978]) that replicated using both Coloc and TWAS analyses in both the GTEx and Braineac expression data sets. A further 6 genes (ZRANB3 [OMIM 615655], PCGF3 [OMIM 617543], NEK1 [OMIM 604588], NUPL2 [NCBI 11097], GALC [OMIM 606890], and CTSB [OMIM 116810]) showed evidence of disease-associated splicing effects. Cell-type specificity analysis revealed that gene expression was overall more prevalent in glial cell types compared with neurons. The weighted gene coexpression performed on the GTEx data set showed that NUPL2 is a key gene in 3 modules implicated in catabolic processes associated with protein ubiquitination and in the ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process in the nucleus accumbens, caudate, and putamen. TMEM163 and ZRANB3 were both important in modules in the frontal cortex and caudate, respectively, indicating regulation of signaling and cell communication. Protein interactor analysis and simulations using random networks demonstrated that the candidate genes interact significantly more with known mendelian PD and parkinsonism proteins than would be expected by chance.Together, these results suggest that several candidate genes and pathways are associated with the findings observed in PD GWAS studies.",

However, it is unclear whether different biological clocks reflect similar aging processes and determinants. In ~3000 subjects, we examined whether five biological clocks (telomere length, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic clocks) were interrelated and associated to somatic and mental health determinants. Correlations between biological aging indicators were small (allr< 0.2), indicating little overlap. The most consistent associations of advanced biological aging were found for male sex, higher body mass index (BMI), metabolic syndrome, smoking, and depression. As compared to the individual clocks, a composite index of all five clocks showed most pronounced associations with health determinants. The large effect sizes of the composite index and the low correlation between biological aging indicators suggest that one's biological age is best reflected by combining aging measures from multiple cellular levels.Â© 2021, Jansen et al.",

Identifying readers of these epigenetic marks is a critical step towards understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here, we present an all-to-all approach, dubbed digital affinity profiling via proximity ligation (DAPPL), to simultaneously profile human TF-DNA interactions using mixtures of random DNA libraries carrying different epigenetic modifications (i.e., 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine) on CpG dinucleotides. Many proteins that recognize consensus sequences carrying these modifications in symmetric and/or hemi-modified forms are identified. We further demonstrate that the modifications in different sequence contexts could either enhance or suppress TF binding activity. Moreover, many modifications can affect TF binding specificity. Furthermore, symmetric modifications show a stronger effect in either enhancing or suppressing TF-DNA interactions than hemi-modifications. Finally, in vivo evidence suggests that USF1 and USF2 might regulate transcription via hydroxymethylcytosine-binding activity in weak enhancers in human embryonic stem cells.",

The resulting 828 million measurements of transcription factor-DNA interactions enable estimation of the relative affinity of these transcription factors to each variant in vitro and evaluation of the current methods to predict the effects of noncoding variants on transcription factor binding. We show that the position weight matrices of most transcription factors lack sufficient predictive power, whereas the support vector machine combined with the gapped k-mer representation show much improved performance, when assessed on results from independent SNP-SELEX experiments involving a new set of 61,020 sequence variants.

Physiological and genetic adaptations have been documented in populations with a history of living at high altitude. However, the role of epigenetic gene regulation, including DNA methylation, in high-altitude adaptation is not well understood. We performed an epigenome-wide DNA methylation association study based on whole blood from 113 Peruvian Quechua with differential lifetime exposures to high altitude (>2,500) and recruited based on a migrant study design. We identified two significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and 62 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with high-altitude developmental and lifelong exposure statuses. DMPs and DMRs were found in genes associated with hypoxia-inducible factor pathway, red blood cell production, blood pressure, and others. DMPs and DMRs associated with fractional exhaled nitric oxide also were identified. We found a significant association between EPAS1 methylation and EPAS1 SNP genotypes, suggesting that local genetic variation influences patterns of methylation. Our findings demonstrate that DNA methylation is associated with early developmental and lifelong high-altitude exposures among Peruvian Quechua as well as altitude-adaptive phenotypes. Together these findings suggest that epigenetic mechanisms might be involved in adaptive developmental plasticity to high altitude. Moreover, we show that local genetic variation is associated with DNA methylation levels, suggesting that methylation associated SNPs could be a potential avenue for research on genetic adaptation to hypoxia in Andeans.Â© The Author(s) 2020.

However, measurements obtained from these arrays may be affected by technical artefacts that result in spurious associations if left unchecked. Cross-reactivity represents one of the major challenges, meaning that probes may map to multiple regions in the genome. Although several studies have reported on this issue, few studies have empirically examined the impact of cross-reactivity in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). In this paper, we report on cross-reactivity issues that we discovered in a large EWAS on the presence of theC9orf72repeat expansion in ALS patients. Specifically, we found that that the majority of the significant probes inadvertently cross-hybridized to theC9orf72locus. Importantly, these probes were not flagged as cross-reactive in previous studies, leading to novel insights into the extent to which cross-reactivity can impact EWAS. Our findings are particularly relevant for epigenetic studies into diseases associated with repeat expansions and other types of structural variation. More generally however, considering that most spurious associations were not excluded based on pre-defined sets of cross-reactive probes, we believe that the presented data-driven flag and consider approach is relevant for any type of EWAS.Â© The Author(s) 2020.

Validation by pyrosequencing confirmed these associations and showed thatMSI2,SLC25A10, andRAPH1methylation was positively associated with serum leptin.Â These wereÂ Â also associated with the early environment;MSI2methylation (Î²Â =Â 0.81, p =Â 0.0004) was associated with pregnancy maternal smoking,SLC25A10(CpG2 Î²Â =Â 0.12, p =Â 0.002) with pre- and early pregnancy BMI, andRAPH1(Î²Â =Â -1.49, p =Â 0.036) with gestational weight gain. Adjusting for perinatal factors, methylation of the dmCpGs withinMSI2, RAPH1,andSLC25A10independently predicted BMI, accounting for 24% of variance.MSI2methylation was additionally associated with BMI over time (17 years old Î²Â =Â 0.026, p =Â 0.0025; 20 years old Î²Â =Â 0.027, p =Â 0.0029) and between generations (mother Î²Â =Â 0.044, p =Â 7.5e-04). Overall findings suggest that DNA methylation inMSI2,RAPH1, andSLC25A10in blood may be robust markers, mediatingÂ through early life factors.",

We perform an epigenome-wide association study on neonatal bloodspots comparing 196 newborns with Down syndrome and 439 newborns without Down syndrome, adjusting for cell-type heterogeneity, which identifies 652 epigenome-wide significant CpGs (Pâ€‰<â€‰7.67â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8) and 1,052 differentially methylated regions. Differential methylation at promoter/enhancer regions correlates with gene expression changes in Down syndrome versus non-Down syndrome fetal liver hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001). The top two differentially methylated regions overlap RUNX1 and FLI1, both important regulators of megakaryopoiesis and hematopoietic development, with significant hypermethylation at promoter regions of these two genes. Excluding Down syndrome newborns harboring preleukemic GATA1 mutations (Nâ€‰=â€‰30), identified by targeted sequencing, has minimal impact on the epigenome-wide association study results. Down syndrome has profound, genome-wide effects on DNA methylation in hematopoietic cells in early life, which may contribute to the high frequency of hematological problems, including leukemia, in children with Down syndrome.",

Multiple genetic and environmental factors are known to contribute to its pathogenesis. One of the main environmental risk factors is early life adversity (ELA). Evidence is emerging that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation might play an important role in the biological mechanisms underlying SAD and ELA. To investigate the relationship between ELA, DNA methylation, and SAD, we performed an epigenome-wide association study for SAD and ELA examining DNA from whole blood of a cohort of 143 individuals using DNA methylation arrays. We identified two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with SAD located within the genes SLC43A2 and TNXB. As this was the first epigenome-wide association study for SAD, it is worth noting that both genes have previously been associated with panic disorder. Further, we identified two DMRs associated with ELA within the SLC17A3 promoter region and the SIAH3 gene and several DMRs that were associated with the interaction of SAD and ELA. Of these, the regions within C2CD2L and MRPL28 showed the largest difference in DNA methylation. Lastly, we found that two DMRs were associated with both the severity of social anxiety and ELA, however, neither of them was found to mediate the contribution of ELA to SAD later in life. Future studies are needed to replicate our findings in independent cohorts and to investigate the biological pathways underlying these effects.",

Current statistical methods used in EWAS are dominated by models based on multiple assumptions, for example, linear relationship between molecular profiles and phenotype, normal distribution for the methylation data and phenotype. In this study, we applied an assumption-free method, the generalized correlation coefficient (GCC), and compare it to linear models, namely the linear mixed model and kinship model. We use DNA methylation associated with a cognitive score in 400 and 206 twins as discovery and replication samples respectively. DNA methylation associated with cognitive function using GCC, linear mixed model, and kinship model, identified 65 CpGs (pÂ <Â 1e-04) from discovery sample displaying both nonlinear and linear correlations. Replication analysis successfully replicated 9 of these top CpGs. When combining results of GCC and linear models to cover diverse patterns of relationships, we identified genes like KLHDC4, PAPSS2, and MRPS18B as well as pathways including focal adhesion, axon guidance, and some neurological signaling. Genomic region-based analysis found 15 methylated regions harboring 11 genes, with three verified in gene expression analysis, also the 11 genes were related to top functional clusters including neurohypophyseal hormone and maternal aggressive behaviors. The GCC approach detects valuable methylation sites missed by traditional linear models. A combination of methylation markers from GCC and linear models enriched biological pathways sensible in neurological function that could implicate cognitive performance and cognitive aging.Â© 2020 The Authors.

DNA methylation has been proposed as a mediating mechanism, but very few studies have explored this possibility in humans.In the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) consortium, we conducted a meta-analysis of coordinated epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of paternal prenatal body mass index (BMI) (with and without adjustment for maternal BMI) in relation to DNA methylation in offspring blood at birth (13 data sets; total nâ€‰=â€‰4894) and in childhood (6 data sets; total nâ€‰=â€‰1982).We found little evidence of an association at either time point: at all CpGs, the false-discovery-rate-adjusted P-values were >0.05. In secondary sex-stratified analyses, we found just four CpGs for which there was robust evidence of an association in female offspring. To compare our findings to those of other studies, we conducted a systematic review, which identified seven studies, including five candidate gene studies showing associations between paternal BMI/obesity and offspring or sperm DNA methylation at imprinted regions. However, in our own study, we found very little evidence of enrichment for imprinted genes.Our findings do not support the hypothesis that paternal BMI around the time of pregnancy is associated with offspring-blood DNA methylation, even at imprinted regions.Â© The Author(s) 2021.

We conducted an epigenome-wide association study to identify associations between prenatal lead exposure and cord blood DNA methylation in Korean infants.Cord blood samples were assayed with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip kits, and maternal blood lead levels during early and late pregnancy, as well as cord blood lead level, were measured. The association between CpG methylation and lead level was analyzed using the limma package, with adjusting for infant sex, maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, and estimated leukocyte composition.Among 364 blood samples (182 males and 182 females), those for which maternal and cord blood lead concentrations during early and later pregnancy was known were used for analysis. Maternal lead concentration in blood during early pregnancy was significantly associated with the methylation status of specific positions. After data stratification by infant sex, we found that, in males, the level of maternal blood lead was associated with 18 CpG sites during early pregnancy, and with one CpG site near the NBAS gene, during late pregnancy. In female samples, there was no significant association between DNA methylation and lead concentrations.Prenatal lead exposure was associated with altered, gender-specific patterns of DNA methylation in Korean infants.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, whether DNA methylation contributes to the association between Cu and ACS is unclear.We measured methylation level atâ€‰>â€‰485,000 cytosine-phosphoguanine sites (CpGs) of blood leukocytes using Human Methylation 450 Bead Chip and conducted a genome-wide meta-analysis of plasma Cu in a total of 1243 Chinese individuals. For plasma Cu-related CpGs, we evaluated their associations with the expression of nearby genes as well as major cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, we examined their longitudinal associations with incident ACS in the nested case-control study.We identified four novel Cu-associated CpGs (cg20995564, cg18608055, cg26470501 and cg05825244) within a 5% false discovery rate (FDR). DNA methylation level of cg18608055, cg26470501, and cg05825244 also showed significant correlations with expressions of SBNO2, BCL3, and EBF4 gene, respectively. Higher DNA methylation level at cg05825244 locus was associated with lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and higher C-reactive protein level. Furthermore, we demonstrated that higher cg05825244 methylation level was associated with increased risk of ACS (odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% CI 1.02-1.48; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03).We identified novel DNA methylation alterations associated with plasma Cu in Chinese populations and linked these loci to risk of ACS, providing new insights into the regulation of gene expression by Cu-related DNA methylation and suggesting a role for DNA methylation in the association between copper and ACS.",

Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), we examined prospective associations between DNA methylation (DNAm: nbirth = 804, nage 7 = 877) and trajectories of social communication deficits at age 8-17 years. Methylomic variation at three loci across the genome (false discovery rate = 0.048) differentiated children following high (n = 80) versus low (n = 724) trajectories of social communication deficits. This differential DNAm was specific to the neonatal period and not observed at 7 years of age. Associations between DNAm and trajectory membership remained robust after controlling for co-occurring mental health problems (i.e., hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems). The three loci identified at birth were not replicated in the Generation R Study. However, to the best of our knowledge, ALSPAC is the only study to date that is prospective enough to examine DNAm in relation to longitudinal trajectories of social communication deficits from childhood to adolescence. Although the present findings might point to potentially novel sites that differentiate between a high versus low trajectory of social communication deficits, the results should be considered tentative until further replicated.",

Recent studies have advanced knowledge of their genetic architecture. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), may be important in pituitary-thyroid axis regulation and action, but data are limited.To identify novel associations between fT3, fT4, and TSH and differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in the genome in subjects from 2 Australian cohorts.We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of thyroid function parameters and DNAm using participants from: Brisbane Systems Genetics Study (median age 14.2 years, nâ€…=â€…563) and the Raine Study (median age 17.0 years, nâ€…=â€…863). Plasma fT3, fT4, and TSH were measured by immunoassay. DNAm levels in blood were assessed using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays. Analyses employed generalized linear mixed models to test association between DNAm and thyroid function parameters. Data from the 2 cohorts were meta-analyzed.We identified 2 DMPs with epigenome-wide significant (Pâ€…<â€…2.4E-7) associations with TSH and 6 with fT3, including cg00049440 in KLF9 (Pâ€…=â€…2.88E-10) and cg04173586 in DOT1L (Pâ€…=â€…2.09E-16), both genes known to be induced by fT3.

Studies in perinatal tissues indicate that variability of DNAm at birth is best explained by the joint effects of genotype and prenatal environment. Here, we extend these analyses to postnatal stressors. We investigated the contribution of CA, cis genotype (G), and their additive (Gâ€‰+â€‰CA) and interactive (Gâ€‰Ã—â€‰CA) effects to DNAm variability in blood or saliva from five independent cohorts with a total sample size of 1074 ranging in age from childhood to late adulthood. Of these, 541 were exposed to CA, which was assessed retrospectively using self-reports or verified through social services and registries. For the majority of sites (over 50%) in the adult cohorts, variability in DNAm was best explained by Gâ€‰+â€‰CA or Gâ€‰Ã—â€‰CA but almost never by CA alone. Across ages and tissues, 1672 DNAm sites showed consistency of the best model in all five cohorts, with Gâ€‰Ã—â€‰CA interactions explaining most variance. The consistent Gâ€‰Ã—â€‰CA sites mapped to genes enriched in brain-specific transcripts and Gene Ontology terms related to development and synaptic function. Interaction of CA with genotypes showed the strongest contribution to DNAm variability, with stable effects across cohorts in functionally relevant genes.

We analyzed whether DNA methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is associated with IgE sensitization at 5 years of age (5Y). DNA methylation was measured in 288 PBMC samples from 74 mother/child pairs from the birth cohort ALADDIN (Assessment of Lifestyle and Allergic Disease During INfancy) using the HumanMethylation450BeadChip (Illumina). PBMCs were obtained from the mothers during pregnancy and from their children in cord blood, at 2 years and 5Y. DNA methylation levels at each time point were compared between children with and without IgE sensitization to allergens at 5Y. For replication, CpG sites associated with IgE sensitization in ALADDIN were evaluated in whole blood DNA of 256 children, 4 years old, from the BAMSE (Swedish abbreviation for Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiology) cohort. We found 34 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with IgE sensitization to airborne allergens and 38 DMRs associated with sensitization to food allergens in children at 5Y (Sidakpâ‰¤ 0.05). Genes associated with airborne sensitization were enriched in the pathway of endocytosis, while genes associated with food sensitization were enriched in focal adhesion, the bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, and leukocyte migration. Furthermore, 25 DMRs in maternal PBMCs were associated with IgE sensitization to airborne allergens in their children at 5Y, which were functionally annotated to the mTOR (mammalian Target of Rapamycin) signaling pathway. This study supports that DNA methylation is associated with IgE sensitization early in life and revealed new candidate genes for atopy. Moreover, our study provides evidence that maternal DNA methylation levels are associated with IgE sensitization in the child supporting early in utero effects on atopy predisposition.",

Little is known about the mechanisms linking early life experiences to the functioning of the immune system in adulthood. To address this, we explore the relationship across social-to-biological layers of early life social exposures on levels of adulthood inflammation and the mediating role of gene regulatory mechanisms, epigenetic and transcriptomic profiling from blood, in 2,329 individuals from two European cohort studies. Consistently across both studies, we find transcriptional activity explains a substantive proportion (78% and 26%) of the estimated effect of early life disadvantaged social exposures on levels of adulthood inflammation. Furthermore, we show that mechanisms other than cis DNA methylation may regulate those transcriptional fingerprints. These results further our understanding of social-to-biological transitions by pinpointing the role of gene regulation that cannot fully be explained by differential cis DNA methylation.",

Smoking leaves a strong signature on the blood methylome as shown in multiple studies using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Here, we explore novel blood methylation smoking signals on the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip (EPIC) array, which also targets novel CpG-sites in enhancers.A smoking-methylation meta-analysis was carried out using EPIC DNA methylation profiles in 1407 blood samples from four UK population-based cohorts, including the MRC National Survey for Health and Development (NSHD) or 1946 British birth cohort, the National Child Development Study (NCDS) or 1958 birth cohort, the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), and the TwinsUK cohort (TwinsUK). The overall discovery sample included 269 current, 497 former, and 643 never smokers. Replication was pursued in 3425 trans-ethnic samples, including 2325 American Indian individuals participating in the Strong Heart Study (SHS) in 1989-1991 and 1100 African-American participants in the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy Study (GENOA).Altogether 952 CpG-sites in 500 genes were differentially methylated between smokers and never smokers after Bonferroni correction. There were 526 novel smoking-associated CpG-sites only profiled by the EPIC array, of which 486 (92%) replicated in a meta-analysis of the American Indian and African-American samples. Novel CpG sites mapped both to genes containing previously identified smoking-methylation signals and to 80 novel genes not previously linked to smoking, with the strongest novel signal in SLAMF7. Comparison of former versus never smokers identified that 37 of these sites were persistently differentially methylated after cessation, where 16 represented novel signals only profiled by the EPIC array. We observed a depletion of smoking-associated signals in CpGÂ islands and an enrichment in enhancer regions, consistent with previous results.This study identified novel smoking-associated signals as possible biomarkers of exposure to smoking and may help improve our understanding of smoking-related disease risk.",
No ,20210308,dnam age,33656257,BiT age: A transcriptome-based aging clock near the theoretical limit of accuracy.,Aging Cell,"Aging clocks dissociate biological from chronological age. The estimation of biological age is important for identifying gerontogenes and assessing environmental, nutritional, or therapeutic impacts on the aging process. Recently, methylation markers were shown to allow estimation of biological age based on age-dependent somatic epigenetic alterations. However, DNA methylation is absent in some species such as Caenorhabditis elegans and it remains unclear whether and how the epigenetic clocks affect gene expression. Aging clocks based on transcriptomes have suffered from considerable variation in the data and relatively low accuracy. Here, we devised an approach that uses temporal scaling and binarization of C. elegans transcriptomes to define a gene set that predicts biological age with an accuracy that is close to the theoretical limit. Our model accurately predicts the longevity effects of diverse strains, treatments, and conditions. The involved genes support a role of specific transcription factors as well as innate immunity and neuronal signaling in the regulation of the aging process. We show that this binarized transcriptomic aging (BiT age) clock can also be applied to human age prediction with high accuracy. The BiT age clock could therefore find wide application in genetic, nutritional, environmental, and therapeutic interventions in the aging process.Â© 2021 The Authors.

We apply this method to depict a single-cell multiomics map of mouse preimplantation development. We find that genome-wide DNA methylation remodeling facilitates the reconstruction of genetic lineages in early embryos. Further, we construct a zygotic genome activation (ZGA)-associated regulatory network and reveal coordination among multiple epigenetic layers, transcription factors and repeat elements that instruct proper ZGA.

Using a twin study design, we examined whether DNAm age acceleration is related to cognitive decline measured longitudinally in persons without a clinical diagnosis of dementia.We studied 266 paired male twins (133 pairs) with a mean age of 56 years at baseline. Of these, 114 paired twins returned for a follow-up after an average of 11.5 years. We obtained six indices of DNAm age acceleration based on epigenome-wide data from peripheral blood lymphocytes. At both baseline and follow-up, we administered a battery of cognitive measures and constructed two composite scores, one for executive function and one for memory function. We fitted multivariable mixed regression models to examine the association of DNAm age acceleration markers with cognitive function within pairs.In cross sectional analyses at baseline, there was no association between DNAm age acceleration and cognitive function scores. In longitudinal analyses, however, comparing twins within pairs, each additional year of age acceleration using the Horvath's method was associated with a 3% decline (95% CI, 1% to 5%) in the composite executive function score and a 2.5% decline (95% CI, 0.01% to 4.9%) in the memory function score. These results did not attenuate after adjusting for education and other risk factors.Middle-aged men who had older DNAm age relative to their brothers of the same demographic age, showed a faster rate of cognitive decline in the subsequent 11.5 years.

In the cross-sectional across-birth cohort study, the earlier-born septuagenarian (1917-1923) and centenarian women (1895) had a higher degree of skewness than the respective recent age-matched birth cohorts, which indicates that the women in the more recent cohorts, after the age of 70, had not only changed degree of skewness with age, they had also undergone less age-related hematopoietic sub-clone expansion.

We also analyzed differential variability and conducted bioinformatic analyses to assess for potential biological mechanisms.Over a follow-up of up to 28Â years (mean 15), we identified 41 lymphatic-hematopoietic and 394 solid cancer cases. A total of 126 CpGs for lymphatic-hematopoietic cancers, 396 for solid cancers, and 414 for overall cancers were selected as predictors by the elastic-net model. For lymphatic-hematopoietic cancers, the predictive ability (C index) increased from 0.58 to 0.87 when adding these 126 CpGs to the risk factor model in the discovery set. The association was replicated with hazard ratios in the same direction in 28 CpGs in the Framingham Heart Study. When considering the association of variability, rather than mean differences, we found 432 differentially variable regions for lymphatic-hematopoietic cancers.This study suggests that differential methylation and differential variability in blood DNA methylation are associated with lymphatic-hematopoietic cancer risk.

Psychosis cases were characterized by significant differences in measures of blood cell proportions and elevated smoking exposure derived from the DNA methylation data, with the largest differences seen in treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients. We implemented a stringent pipeline to meta-analyze epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results across datasets, identifying 95 DMPs associated with psychosis and 1,048 DMPs associated with schizophrenia, with evidence of colocalization to regions nominated by genetic association studies of disease. Many schizophrenia-associated DNA methylation differences were only present in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, potentially reflecting exposure to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine.

Yes,20210308,ewas,33622391,DNA methylation of blood cells is associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes in a meta-analysis of four European cohorts.,Clin Epigenetics,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease with well-known genetic and environmental risk factors contributing to its prevalence. Epigenetic mechanisms related to changes in DNA methylation (DNAm), may also contribute to T2D risk, but larger studies are required to discover novel markers, and to confirm existing ones.We performed a large meta-analysis of individual epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of prevalent T2D conducted in four European studies using peripheral blood DNAm. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMR) was also undertaken, based on the meta-analysis results. We found three novel CpGs associated with prevalent T2D in Europeans at cg00144180 (HDAC4), cg16765088 (near SYNM) and cg24704287 (near MIR23A) and confirmed three CpGs previously identified (mapping to TXNIP, ABCG1 and CPT1A). We also identified 77 T2D associated DMRs, most of them hypomethylated in T2D cases versus controls. In adjusted regressions among diabetic-free participants in ALSPAC, we found that all six CpGs identified in the meta-EWAS were associated with white cell-types. We estimated that these six CpGs captured 11% of the variation in T2D, which was similar to the variation explained by the model including only the common risk factors of BMI, sex, age and smoking (R2â€‰=â€‰10.6%).This study identifies novel loci associated with T2D in Europeans. We also demonstrate associations of the same loci with other traits. Future studies should investigate if our findings are generalizable in non-European populations, and potential roles of these epigenetic markers in T2D etiology or in determining long term consequences of T2D.",

Prostate cancer (PCa) is characterized by variable clinical manifestations and frequently unpredictable outcomes. We performed an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to identify the genomic regions that regulate gene expression in PCa and identified a relationship between DNA methylation and clinical information. Using multi-level information published in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we performed eQTL-based analyses on DNA methylation and gene expression. To better interpret these data, we correlated loci and clinical indexes to identify the important loci for both PCa development and progression. Our data demonstrated that although only a small proportion of genes are regulated via DNA methylation in PCa, these genes are enriched in important cancer-related groups. In addition, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis identified the locations of CpG sites and genes within at-risk loci, including the 19q13.2-q13.43 and 16q22.2-q23.1 loci. Further, an epigenetic association study of clinical indexes detected risk loci and pyrosequencing for site validation. Although DNA methylation-regulated genes across PCa samples are a small proportion, the associated genes play important roles in PCa carcinogenesis.",

Increasingly, DNA-methylation is examined using genome-wide techniques, with recent public efforts yielding immense data sets of diverse malignancies representing the vast majority of human cancer related disease burden. Whereas mutation events may group preferentially or in high frequency with a given histology, mutations are poor classifiers of tumour type. Here we examine the hypothesis that cancer-specific DNA-methylation reflects the tissue of origin or carcinogenic risk factor, and these methylation abnormalities may be used to faithfully classify tumours according to histology. We present an analysis of 7427 tumours representing 19 human malignancies and 708 normal samples demonstrating that specific tumour changes in methylation can correctly determine site of origin and tumour histology with 86% overall accuracy. Examination of misclassified tumours reveals underlying shared biology as the source of misclassifications, including common cell of origin or risk factors.",

Integration of molecular data types across multiple patient cohorts may advance current genetic approaches for improved sub-classification and understanding of the biology of the disease. Here we analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in 649 AML patients using Illumina arrays and identified a configuration of 13 subtypes (termed 'epitypes') using unbiased clustering. Integration of genetic data revealed that most epitypes were associated with a certain recurrent mutation (or combination) in a majority of patients, yet other epitypes were largely independent. Epitypes demonstrated developmental blockage at discrete stages of myeloid differentiation, revealing epitypes that retain arrested hematopoietic stem cell-like phenotypes. Detailed analyses of DNA methylation patterns identified unique patterns of aberrant hyper- and hypomethylation among epitypes, with variable involvement of transcription factors influencing promoter, enhancer, and repressed regions. Patients in epitypes with stem cell-like methylation features showed inferior overall survival along with upregulated stem cell gene expression signatures. We further identified a DNA methylation signature involving STAT motifs associated withFLT3-ITD mutations. Finally, DNA methylation signatures were stable at relapse for the large majority of patients, and rare epitype switching accompanied loss of the dominant epitype mutations and reversion to stem cell-like methylation patterns. These results demonstrate that DNA methylation-based classification integrates important molecular features of AML to reveal the diverse pathogenic and biological aspects of the disease.Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",

We examined whether expression levels of genes directly or indirectly involved in DNA methylation and demethylation may be associated with response of cancer cell lines to chemotherapy treatment with a variety of antitumor agents.We analyzed 72 genes encoding epigenetic factors directly or indirectly involved in DNA methylation and demethylation processes. We examined association of their pretreatment expression levels with methylation beta-values of individual DNA methylation probes, DNA methylation averaged within gene regions, and average epigenome-wide methylation levels. We analyzed data from 645 cancer cell lines and 23 cancer types from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer datasets. We observed numerous correlations between expression of genes encoding epigenetic factors and response to chemotherapeutic agents. Expression of genes encoding a variety of epigenetic factors, including KDM2B, DNMT1, EHMT2, SETDB1, EZH2, APOBEC3G, and other genes, was correlated with response to multiple agents. DNA methylation of numerous target probes and gene regions was associated with expression of multiple genes encoding epigenetic factors, underscoring complex regulation of epigenome methylation by multiple intersecting molecular pathways. The genes whose expression was associated with methylation of multiple epigenome targets encode DNA methyltransferases, TET DNA methylcytosine dioxygenases, the methylated DNA-binding protein ZBTB38, KDM2B, SETDB1, and other molecular factors which are involved in diverse epigenetic processes affecting DNA methylation. While baseline DNA methylation of numerous epigenome targets was correlated with cell line response to antitumor agents, the complex relationships between the overlapping effects of each epigenetic factor on methylation of specific targets and the importance of such influences in tumor response to individual agents require further investigation.Expression of multiple genes encoding epigenetic factors is associated with drug response and with DNA methylation of numerous epigenome targets that may affect response to therapeutic agents. Our findings suggest complex and interconnected pathways regulating DNA methylation in the epigenome, which may both directly and indirectly affect response to chemotherapy.",

Objective measures of functional ability include grip strength, gait speed, sit-to-stand time, and 6-min walk distance. Using samples from a weight loss clinical trial in older adults with obesity, we examined the association between changes in physical function and DNA-methylation-based biological age at baseline and 12Â weeks in 16 individuals. Peripheral blood DNA methylation was measured (pre/post) with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array and the Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge DNA methylation age clocks were used. Linear regression models adjusted for chronological age and sex tested the relationship between DNA methylation age and grip strength, gait speed, sit-to-stand, and 6-min walk.Participant mean weight loss was 4.6Â kg, and DNA methylation age decreased 0.8, 1.1, and 0.5Â years using the Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge DNA methylation clocks respectively. Mean grip strength increased 3.2Â kg. Decreased Hannum methylation age was significantly associated with increased grip strength (Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.30, pâ€‰=â€‰0.04), and increased gait speed (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.02, pâ€‰=â€‰0.05), in adjusted models. Similarly, decreased methylation age using the PhenoAge clock was associated with significantly increased gait speed (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.02, pâ€‰=â€‰0.04). A decrease in Horvath DNA methylation age and increase in physical functional ability did not demonstrate a significant association.The observed relationship between increased physical functional ability and decreased biological age using DNA methylation clocks demonstrate the potential utility of DNA methylation clocks to assess interventional approaches to improve health in older obese adults.National Institute on Aging (NIA), NCT03104192.

African Americans have higher burden of CVD morbidity and mortality compared to any other racial group. Identifying biomarkers for clinical risk prediction of CVD offers an opportunity for precision prevention and earlier intervention.Using linear mixed models, we investigated the cross-sectional association between four measures of epigenetic age acceleration (intrinsic (IEAA), extrinsic (EEAA), PhenoAge (PhenoAA), and GrimAge (GrimAA)) and ten cardiometabolic markers of hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia in 1,100 primarily hypertensive African Americans from sibships in the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Arteriopathy (GENOA). We then assessed the association between epigenetic age acceleration and time to self-reported incidentÂ CVD using frailty hazard models and investigated CVD risk prediction improvement compared to models with clinical risk scores (Framingham risk score (FRS) and the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk equation). After adjusting for sex and chronological age, increased epigenetic age acceleration was associated with higher systolic blood pressure (IEAA), higher pulse pressure (EEAA and GrimAA), higher fasting glucose (PhenoAA and GrimAA), higher fasting insulin (EEAA), lower low density cholesterol (GrimAA), and higher triglycerides (GrimAA). A five-year increase in GrimAA was associated with CVD incidence with a hazard ratio of 1.54 (95% CI 1.22-2.01) and remained significant after adjusting for CVD risk factors. The addition of GrimAA to risk score models improved model fit using likelihood ratio tests (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.013 for FRS and Pâ€‰=â€‰0.008 for ASCVD), but did not improve C statistics (Pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). Net reclassification index (NRI) showed small but significant improvement in reassignment of risk categories with the addition of GrimAA to FRS (NRI: 0.055, 95% CI 0.040-0.071) and the ASCVD equation (NRI: 0.029, 95% CI 0.006-0.064).Epigenetic age acceleration measures are associated with traditional CVD risk factors in an African-American cohort with a high prevalence of hypertension.

Here, we use DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles from 712 known-age bats, representing 26 species, to identify epigenetic changes associated with age and longevity. We demonstrate that DNAm accurately predicts chronological age. Across species, longevity is negatively associated with the rate of DNAm change at age-associated sites. Furthermore, analysis of several bat genomes reveals that hypermethylated age- and longevity-associated sites are disproportionately located in promoter regions of key transcription factors (TF) and enriched for histone and chromatin features associated with transcriptional regulation. Predicted TF binding site motifs and enrichment analyses indicate that age-related methylation change is influenced by developmental processes, while longevity-related DNAm change is associated with innate immunity or tumorigenesis genes, suggesting that bat longevity results from augmented immune response and cancer suppression.",

We evaluated the role of multiple factors, including fat deposition, cardiometabolic risk factors and lifestyle weight-loss intervention, on the deviation of mAge from chronological age (mAge deviation) or 18-month change in mAge (âˆ†mAge). In this sub-study of the CENTRAL magnetic resonance imaging weight-loss trial, we evaluated mAge by a validated 240-CpG-based prediction formula at baseline and after 18-month intervention of either low fat (LF) or mediterranean/low carbohydrate (MED/LC) diets.Among 120 CENTRAL participants with abdominal obesity or dyslipidemia, mAge (meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD: 60.3â€‰Â±â€‰7.5Â years) was higher than the chronological age (48.6â€‰Â±â€‰9.3Â years) but strongly correlated (râ€‰=â€‰0.93; pâ€‰=â€‰3.1â€‰Ã—â€‰10-53). Participants in the lowest tertile of mAge deviation from their chronological age had significantly lower waist-circumference, visceral adipose tissue, intrahepatic fat (IHF) content, fasting-glucose and HOMA-IR, as compared with participants in the highest sex-specific residual tertile (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 for all). IHF% remained associated with greater mAge deviation after further adjustments (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.23; pâ€‰=â€‰0.02).

Yet, little is understood about how the environment shapes children's genetic predisposition for these behaviors during this time. The Baylor Infant Twin Study (BITS) is a two phase study, initiated to study obesity risk factors from infancy. Data collection has been completed for Phase 1 in which three sub-studies pilot central measures for Phase 2. A novel infant temperament assessment, based on observations made by trained researchers was piloted inBehavior Observation Pilot Protocol(BOPP) study, a new device for measuring infant feeding parameters (the ""orometer"") in theBaylor Infant Orometer(BIO), and methods for analyzing DNA methylation in twins of unknown chorionicity inEpiTwin.EpiTwin was a cross-sectional study of neonatal twins, while up to three study visits occurred for the other studies, at 4- (BOPP, BIO), 6- (BOPP), and 12- (BOPP, BIO) of age. Measurements for BOPP and BIO included temperament observations, feeding observations, and body composition assessments while EpiTwin focused on collecting samples of hair, urine, nails, and blood for quantifying methylation levels at 10 metastable epialleles. Additional data collected include demographic information, zygosity, chorionicity, and questionnaire-based measures of infant behaviors.Recruitment for all three studies was completed in early 2020. EpiTwin recruited 80 twin pairs (50% monochorionic), 31 twin pairs completed the BOPP protocol, and 68 singleton infants participated in BIO.The psychometric properties of the data from all three studies are being analyzed currently. The resulting findings will inform the development of the full BITS protocol, with the goal of completing assessments at 4-, 6-, 12-, and 14-month of age for 400 twin pairs.Â© 2020 The Authors.

No,20210329,methods,33707472,EMeth: An EM algorithm for cell type decomposition based on DNA methylation data.,Sci Rep,"We introduce a new computational method named EMeth to estimate cell type proportions using DNA methylation data. EMeth is a reference-based method that requires cell type-specific DNA methylation data from relevant cell types. EMeth improves on the existing reference-based methods by detecting the CpGs whose DNA methylation are inconsistent with the deconvolution model and reducing their contributions to cell type decomposition. Another novel feature of EMeth is that it allows a cell type with known proportions but unknown reference and estimates its methylation. This is motivated by the case of studying methylation in tumor cells while bulk tumor samples include tumor cells as well as other cell types such as infiltrating immune cells, and tumor cell proportion can be estimated by copy number data. We demonstrate that EMeth delivers more accurate estimates of cell type proportions than several other methods using simulated data and in silico mixtures. Applications in cancer studies show that the proportions of T regulatory cells estimated by DNA methylation have expected associations with mutation load and survival time, while the estimates from gene expression miss such associations.",
No,20210329,methods,33722199,Correction for both common and rare cell types in blood is important to identify genes that correlate with age.,BMC Genomics,"Aging is a multifactorial process that affects multiple tissues and is characterized by changes in homeostasis over time, leading to increased morbidity. Whole blood gene expression signatures have been associated with aging and have been used to gain information on its biological mechanisms, which are still not fully understood. However, blood is composed of many cell types whose proportions in blood vary with age. As a result, previously observed associations between gene expression levels and aging might be driven by cell type composition rather than intracellular aging mechanisms. To overcome this, previous aging studies already accounted for major cell types, but the possibility that the reported associations are false positives driven by less prevalent cell subtypes remains.Here, we compared the regression model from our previous work to an extended model that corrects for 33 additional white blood cell subtypes. Both models were applied to whole blood gene expression data from 3165 individuals belonging to the general population (age range of 18-81â€‰years). We evaluated that the new model is a better fit for the data and it identified fewer genes associated with aging (625, compared to the 2808 of the initial model; P â‰¤ 2.5â¨¯10-6). Moreover, 511 genes (~â€‰18% of the 2808 genes identified by the initial model) were found using both models, indicating that the other previously reported genes could be proxies for less abundant cell types. In particular, functional enrichment of the genes identified by the new model highlighted pathways and GO terms specifically associated with platelet activity.We conclude that gene expression analyses in blood strongly benefit from correction for both common and rare blood cell types, and recommend using blood-cell count estimates as standard covariates when studying whole blood gene expression.",
No,20210329,methods,33752591,Nonlinear ridge regression improves cell-type-specific differential expression analysis.,BMC Bioinformatics,"Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and differential gene expression analyses are generally performed on tissue samples, which consist of multiple cell types. Cell-type-specific effects of a trait, such as disease, on the omics expression are of interest but difficult or costly to measure experimentally. By measuring omics data for the bulk tissue, cell type composition of a sample can be inferred statistically. Subsequently, cell-type-specific effects are estimated by linear regression that includes terms representing the interaction between the cell type proportions and the trait. This approach involves two issues, scaling and multicollinearity.First, although cell composition is analyzed in linear scale, differential methylation/expression is analyzed suitably in the logit/log scale. To simultaneously analyze two scales, we applied nonlinear regression. Second, we show that the interaction terms are highly collinear, which is obstructive to ordinary regression. To cope with the multicollinearity, we applied ridge regularization. In simulated data, nonlinear ridge regression attained well-balanced sensitivity, specificity and precision. Marginal model attained the lowest precision and highest sensitivity and was the only algorithm to detect weak signal in real data.Nonlinear ridge regression performed cell-type-specific association test on bulk omics data with well-balanced performance. The omicwas package for R implements nonlinear ridge regression for cell-type-specific EWAS, differential gene expression and QTL analyses.

No,20210329,reference,33739972,Assessing the co-variability of DNA methylation across peripheral cells and tissues: Implications for the interpretation of findings in epigenetic epidemiology.,PLoS Genet,"Most epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) quantify DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral tissues such as whole blood to identify positions in the genome where variation is statistically associated with a trait or exposure. As whole blood comprises a mix of cell types, it is unclear whether trait-associated DNAm variation is specific to an individual cellular population. We collected three peripheral tissues (whole blood, buccal epithelial and nasal epithelial cells) from thirty individuals. Whole blood samples were subsequently processed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify five constituent cell-types (monocytes, granulocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells). DNAm was profiled in all eight sample-types from each individual using the Illumina EPIC array. We identified significant differences in both the level and variability of DNAm between different sample types, and DNAm data-derived estimates of age and smoking were found to differ dramatically across sample types from the same individual. We found that for the majority of loci variation in DNAm in individual blood cell types was only weakly predictive of variance in DNAm measured in whole blood, although the proportion of variance explained was greater than that explained by either buccal or nasal epithelial samples. Covariation across sample types was much higher for DNAm sites influenced by genetic factors. Overall, we observe that DNAm variation in whole blood is additively influenced by a combination of the major blood cell types. For a subset of sites, however, variable DNAm detected in whole blood can be attributed to variation in a single blood cell type providing potential mechanistic insight about EWAS findings. Our results suggest that associations between whole blood DNAm and traits or exposures reflect differences in multiple cell types and our data will facilitate the interpretation of findings in epigenetic epidemiology.",

We investigated LINE-1 methylation and methylome profiling using a methylation EPIC array and the targeted methylation sequencing of 154 normal, full-term pregnancies, stratified by birth weight percentiles. LINE-1 methylation showed evidence of a more pronounced hypomethylation in small neonates compared with normal and large for gestational age. Genome-wide methylation, performed in two subsets of pregnancies, showed very similar methylation profiles among cord blood samples while placentae from different pregnancies appeared very variable. A unique methylation profile emerged in each placenta, which could represent the sum of adjustments that the placenta made during the pregnancy to preserve the epigenetic homeostasis of the fetus. Investigations into the 1000 most variable sites between cord blood and the placenta showed that promoters and gene bodies that are hypermethylated in the placenta are associated with blood-specific functions, whereas those that are hypomethylated belong mainly to pathways involved in cancer. These features support the functional analogies between a placenta and cancer. Our results, which provide a comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation profiling in the human placenta, suggest that its peculiar dynamicity can be relevant for understanding placental plasticity in response to the environment.",

We here present the analysis of blood specimens of 3,388 adult individuals, together with phenotype characteristics such as disease history, medication status, lifestyle factors, and body mass index (BMI). The size and heterogeneity of this data challenges analytics in terms of dimension reduction, knowledge mining, feature extraction, and data integration.Methods:Self-organizing maps (SOM)-machine learning was applied to study transcriptional states on a population-wide scale. This method permits a detailed description and visualization of the molecular heterogeneity of transcriptomes and of their association with different phenotypic features.Results:The diversity of transcriptomes is described by personalized SOM-portraits, which specify the samples in terms of modules of co-expressed genes of different functional context. We identified two major blood transcriptome types where type 1 was found more in men, the elderly, and overweight people and it upregulated genes associated with inflammation and increased heme metabolism, while type 2 was predominantly found in women, younger, and normal weight participants and it was associated with activated immune responses, transcriptional, ribosomal, mitochondrial, and telomere-maintenance cell-functions. We find a striking overlap of signatures shared by multiple diseases, aging, and obesity driven by an underlying common pattern, which was associated with the immune response and the increase of inflammatory processes.Conclusions:Machine learning applications for large and heterogeneous omics data provide a holistic view on the diversity of the human blood transcriptome.

DNA methylation is highly influenced by environmental factors such as cigarette smoking, which is causally related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. To date, there have been few large-scale, combined analyses of DNA methylation and gene expression and their interrelations with lung diseases.We performed an epigenome-wide association study of whole blood gene expression inâ€‰~â€‰6000 individuals from four cohorts. We discovered and replicated numerous CpGs associated with the expression of cis genes within 500Â kb of each CpG, with 148 to 1,741 cis CpG-transcript pairs identified across cohorts. We found that the closer a CpG resided to a transcription start site, the larger its effect size, and that 36% of cis CpG-transcript pairs share the same causal genetic variant. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed that hypomethylation and lower expression of CHRNA5, which encodes a smoking-related nicotinic receptor, are causally linked to increased risk of COPD and lung cancer. This putatively causal relationship was further validated in lung tissue data.Our results provide a large and comprehensive association study of whole blood DNA methylation with gene expression. Expression platform differences rather than population differences are critical to the replication of cis CpG-transcript pairs. The low reproducibility of trans CpG-transcript pairs suggests that DNA methylation regulates nearby rather than remote gene expression. The putatively causal roles of methylation and expression of CHRNA5 in relation to COPD and lung cancer provide evidence for a mechanistic link between patterns of smoking-related epigenetic variation and lung diseases, and highlight potential therapeutic targets for lung diseases and smoking cessation.",

In a meta-analysis of three cohorts, which included the top CpGs associated with stress/violence measures in EVA-PR, 12 CpGs (in STARD3NL, SLC35F4, TSR3, CDC42SE2, KLHL25, PLCB1, BUD13, OR2B3, GALR1, TMEM196, TEAD4, and ANAPC13) were associated with atopic asthma at FDR-pâ€‰<â€‰.05.Pending confirmation in longitudinal studies, our findings suggest that nasal epithelial methylation markers associated with measures of ETV and chronic stress may be linked to atopic asthma in children and adolescents.Â© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

However, little is known about the epigenetic factors that influence impaired gas exchange at the lung.To identify the epigenetic signatures of the diffusing capacity of the lung measured by carbon monoxide uptake (the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO)).An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed on diffusing capacity, measured by carbon monoxide uptake (DLCO) and per alveolar volume (VA) (asDLCO/VA), using the single-breath technique in 2674 individuals from two population-based cohort studies. These were the Rotterdam Study (RS, the ""discovery panel"") and the Framingham Heart Study (FHS, the ""replication panel""). We assessed the clinical relevance of our findings by investigating the identified sites in whole blood and by lung tissue specific gene expression.We identified and replicated two CpG sites (cg05575921 and cg05951221) that were significantly associated withDLCO/VAand one (cg05575921) suggestively associated withDLCO. Furthermore, we found a positive association between aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) gene (cg05575921) hypomethylation and gene expression of exocyst complex component 3 (EXOC3) in whole blood. We confirmed that the expression ofEXOC3in lung tissue is positively associated withDLCO/VAandDLCO.We report on epigenome-wide associations with diffusing capacity in the general population. Our results suggest EXOC3 to be an excellent candidate, through which smoking-induced hypomethylation ofAHRRmight affect pulmonary gas exchange.Copyright Â©ERS 2021.",

Our aim was to look-up cord blood birthweight-associated CpG sites identified by the PACE Consortium in infant saliva, and to explore saliva-specific DNA methylation signatures of birthweight.DNA methylation was assessed using Infinium HumanMethylation450K array in 135 saliva samples collected from children of the NINFEA birth cohort at an average age of 10.8 (range 7-17) months. The association analyses between birthweight and DNA methylation variations were carried out using robust linear regression models both in the exploratory EWAS analyses and in the look-up of the PACE findings in infant saliva.None of the cord blood birthweight-associated CpGs identified by the PACE Consortium was associated with birthweight when analysed in infant saliva. In saliva EWAS analyses, considering a false discovery rate p-valuesâ€‰<â€‰0.05, birthweight as continuous variable was associated with DNA methylation in 44 CpG sites; being born small for gestational age (SGA, lower 10thpercentile of birthweight for gestational age according to WHO reference charts) was associated with DNA methylation in 44 CpGs, with only one overlapping CpG between the two analyses. Despite no overlap with PACE results at the CpG level, two of the top saliva birthweight CpGs mapped at genes associated with birthweight with the same direction of the effect also in the PACE Consortium (MACROD1 and RPTOR).Our study provides an indication of the birthweight and SGA epigenetic salivary signatures in children around 10Â months of age. DNA methylation signatures in cord blood may not be comparable with saliva DNA methylation signatures at about 10Â months of age, suggesting that the birthweight epigenetic marks are likely time and tissue specific.",

We sought to identify novel smoking-related DNA methylation sites in blood, with repeated measurements, and to appraise the putative role of DNA methylation in the pathway between smoking and lung cancer development.We derived a nested case-control study from the TrÃ¸ndelag Health Study (HUNT), including 140 incident patients who developed lung cancer during 2009-13 and 140 controls. We profiled 850â€‰K DNA methylation sites (Illumina Infinium EPIC array) in DNA extracted from blood that was collected in HUNT2 (1995-97) and HUNT3 (2006-08) for the same individuals. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) were performed for a detailed smoking phenotype and for lung cancer. Two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to assess the potential causal effect of smoking on DNA methylation as well as of DNA methylation (13 sites as putative mediators) on risk of lung cancer.The EWAS for smoking in HUNT2 identified associations at 76 DNA methylation sites (Pâ€‰<â€‰5â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8), including 16 novel sites. Smoking was associated with DNA hypomethylation in a dose-response relationship among 83% of the 76 sites, which was confirmed by analyses using repeated measurements from blood that was collected at 11â€‰years apart for the same individuals. Two-step MR analyses showed evidence for a causal effect of smoking on DNA methylation but no evidence for a causal link between DNA methylation and the risk of lung cancer.DNA methylation modifications in blood did not seem to represent a causal pathway linking smoking and the lung cancer risk.Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Current evidence, however, is mostly limited to candidate gene analysis in whole blood. To clarify the association between opioid abuse and DNA methylation, we conducted an epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in brain samples of individuals who died from acute opioid intoxication and group-matched controls.Tissue samples were extracted from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 153 deceased individuals (Mage= 35.42; 62 % male; 77 % European ancestry). The study included 72 opioid samples, 53 psychiatric controls, and 28 normal controls. The epigenome-wide analysis was implemented using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip; analyses adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, negative control principal components, ancestry principal components, cellular composition, and surrogate variables. Horvath's epigenetic age and Levine's PhenoAge were calculated, and gene set enrichment analyses were performed.Although no CpG sites survived false-discovery rate correction for multiple testing, 13 sites surpassed a relaxed significance threshold (p < 1.0 Ã— 10-5). One of these sites was located within Netrin-1, a gene implicated in kappa opioid receptor activity. There was an association between opioid use and accelerated PhenoAge (b = 2.24, se = 1.11, p = .045). Gene set enrichment analyses revealed enrichment of differential methylation in GO and KEGG pathways broadly related to substance use.Netrin-1 may be associated with opioid overdose, and future research with larger samples across stages of opioid use will elucidate the complex genomics of opioid abuse.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Maternal smoking also has been linked to altered fetal DNA methylation (DNAm). However, what remains largely unexplored is whether these DNAm alterations are merely markers of smoking exposure or if they also have implications for health outcomes. This study tested the hypothesis that fetal DNAm mediates the effect of maternal smoking on newborn birthweight.This study included mother-newborn pairs from a US predominantly urban, low-income multi-ethnic birth cohort. DNAm in cord blood were determined using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. After standard quality control and normalization procedures, an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of maternal smoking was performed using linear regression models, controlling for maternal age, education, race, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, alcohol consumption, gestational age, maternal pregestational/gestational diabetes, child sex, cord blood cell compositions and batch effects. To quantify the degree to which cord DNAm mediates the smoking-birthweight association, the VanderWeele-Vansteelandt approach for single mediator and structural equational model for multiple mediators were used, adjusting for pertinent covariates.The study included 954 mother-newborn pairs. Among mothers, 165 (17.3%) ever smoked before or during pregnancy. Newborns with smoking exposure had on average 258Â g lower birthweight than newborns without exposure (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Using a false discovery rate (FDR)â€‰<â€‰0.05 as the significance cutoff, the EWAS identified 38 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with maternal smoking. Of those, 17 CpG sites were mapped to previously reported genes: GFI1, AHRR, CYP1A1, and CNTNAP2; 8 of those, located in the first three genes, were Bonferroni significantly associated with newborn birthweight and mediated the smoking-birthweight association. The combined mediation effect of the three genes explained 67.8% of the smoking-birthweight association.Our study not only lends further support that maternal smoking alters fetal DNAm inÂ a multiethnic population, but also suggests that fetal DNAm substantially mediates the maternal smoking-birthweight association. Our findings, if further validated, indicate that DNAm modification is likely an important pathway by which maternal smoking impairs fetal growth and, perhaps, even long-term health outcomes.",

Children of mothers with mental health problems are at higher risk of developmental problems, possibly through epigenetic mechanisms together with other factors such as genetic and environmental. We investigated DNA methylation in cord blood in relation to PND, taking into consideration a history of depression, co-morbidity with anxiety and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) use, and stratified by sex of the child. Mothers (Nâ€‰=â€‰373) prospectively filled out web-based questionnaires regarding mood symptoms and SSRI use throughout pregnancy. Cord blood was collected at birth and DNA methylation was measured using Illumina MethylationEPIC array at 850 000 CpG sites throughout the genome. Differentially methylated regions were identified usingÂ Kruskal-Wallis test, and Benjamini-HochbergÂ adjusted p-valuesâ€‰<â€‰0.05 were considered significant.No differential DNA methylation was associated with PND alone; however, differential DNA methylation was observed in children exposed to comorbid PND with anxiety symptoms compared with healthy controls in ABCF1 (log twofold change -â€‰0.2), but not after stratification by sex of the child. DNA methylation in children exposed to PND without SSRI treatment and healthy controls both differed in comparison with SSRI exposed children at several sites and regions, among which hypomethylation was observed in CpGs in the promoter region of CRBN (log2 fold change -â€‰0.57), involved in brain development, and hypermethylation in MDFIC (log2 fold change 0.45), associated with the glucocorticoid stress response.Although it is not possible to assess if these methylation differences are due to SSRI treatment itself or to more severe depression, our findings add on to existing knowledge that there might be different biological consequences for the child depending on whether maternal PND was treated with SSRIs or not.",
No,20210416,epigenetics,33844406,The interplay between DNA and histone methylation: molecular mechanisms and disease implications.,EMBO Rep,"Methylation of cytosine in CpG dinucleotides and histone lysine and arginine residues is a chromatin modification that critically contributes to the regulation of genome integrity, replication, and accessibility. A strong correlation exists between the genome-wide distribution of DNA and histone methylation, suggesting an intimate relationship between these epigenetic marks. Indeed, accumulating literature reveals complex mechanisms underlying the molecular crosstalk between DNA and histone methylation. These in vitro and in vivo discoveries are further supported by the finding that genes encoding DNA- and histone-modifying enzymes are often mutated in overlapping human diseases. Here, we summarize recent advances in understanding how DNA and histone methylation cooperate to maintain the cellular epigenomic landscape. We will also discuss the potential implication of these insights for understanding the etiology of, and developing biomarkers and therapies for, human congenital disorders and cancers that are driven by chromatin abnormalities.Â© 2021 The Authors.",

Variation in cognitive trajectory is only partially explained by traditional neuropathologies. We sought to identify novel genes associated with cognitive trajectory using DNA methylation profiles from human postmortem brain.We performed a brain epigenome-wide association study of cognitive trajectory in 636 participants from the ROS (Religious Orders Study) and MAP (Rush Memory and Aging Project) using DNA methylation profiles of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. To maximize our power to detect epigenetic associations, we used the recently developed Gene Association with Multiple Traits test to analyze the 5 measured cognitive domains simultaneously.We found an epigenome-wide association for differential methylation of sites in the CLDN5 locus and cognitive trajectory (pÂ = 9.96Â Ã— 10-7) that was robust to adjustment for cell type proportions (pÂ = 8.52Â Ã— 10-7). This association was primarily driven by association with declines in episodic (pÂ = 4.65Â Ã— 10-6) and working (pÂ = 2.54Â Ã— 10-7) memory. This association between methylation in CLDN5 and cognitive decline was significant even in participants with no or little signs of amyloid-Î² and neurofibrillary tangle pathology.Differential methylation of CLDN5, a gene that encodes an important protein of the blood-brain barrier, is associated with cognitive trajectory beyond traditional Alzheimer's disease pathologies. The association between CLDN5 methylation and cognitive trajectory in people with low pathology suggests an early role for CLDN5 and blood-brain barrier dysfunction in cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.Copyright Â© 2021 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Here, we present CRISPRoff-a programmable epigenetic memory writer consisting of a single dead Cas9 fusion protein that establishes DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications. Transient CRISPRoff expression initiates highly specific DNA methylation and gene repression that is maintained through cell division and differentiation of stem cells to neurons. Pairing CRISPRoff with genome-wide screens and analysis of chromatin marks establishes rules for heritable gene silencing. We identify single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) capable of silencing the large majority of genes including those lacking canonical CpG islands (CGIs) and reveal a wide targeting window extending beyond annotated CGIs. The broad ability of CRISPRoff to initiate heritable gene silencing even outside of CGIs expands the canonical model of methylation-based silencing and enables diverse applications including genome-wide screens, multiplexed cell engineering, enhancer silencing, and mechanistic exploration of epigenetic inheritance.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is limited research on the underlying mechanisms. To elucidate the pathophysiology and a possible causal pathway from treatment exposures to cardiometabolic conditions, we conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to identify the DNA methylation (DNAm) sites associated with cancer treatment exposures and examined whether treatment-associated DNAm sites mediate associations between specific treatments and cardiometabolic conditions.We included 2052 survivors (median age 33.7â€‰years) of European ancestry from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study, a retrospective hospital-based study with prospective clinical follow-up. Cumulative doses of chemotherapy and region-specific radiation were abstracted from medical records. Seven cardiometabolic conditions were clinically assessed. DNAm profile was measured using MethylationEPIC BeadChip with blood-derived DNA.By performing multiple treatment-specific EWAS, we identified 935 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites mapped to 538 genes/regions associated with one or more cancer treatments at the epigenome-wide significance level (pâ€‰<â€‰9â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8). Among the treatment-associated CpGs, 8 were associated with obesity, 63 with hypercholesterolemia, and 17 with hypertriglyceridemia (false discovery rate-adjusted pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). We observed substantial mediation by methylation at four independent CpGs (cg06963130, cg21922478, cg22976567, cg07403981) for the association between abdominal field radiotherapy (abdominal-RT) and risk of hypercholesterolemia (70.3%) and by methylation at three CpGs (cg19634849, cg13552692, cg09853238) for the association between abdominal-RT and hypertriglyceridemia (54.6%). In addition, three CpGs (cg26572901, cg12715065, cg21163477) partially mediated the association between brain-RT and obesity with a 32.9% mediation effect, and two CpGs mediated the association between corticosteroids and obesity (cg22351187, 14.2%) and between brain-RT and hypertriglyceridemia (cg13360224, 10.5%). Notably, several mediator CpGs reside in the proximity of well-established dyslipidemia genes: cg21922478 (ITGA1) and cg22976567 (LMNA).In childhood cancer survivors, cancer treatment exposures are associated with DNAm patterns present decades following the exposure. Treatment-associated DNAm sites may mediate the causal pathway from specific treatment exposures to certain cardiometabolic conditions, suggesting the utility of DNAm sites as risk predictors and potential mechanistic targets for future intervention studies.",

We conducted an epigenome-wide study of DNA methylation in CD14+Â monocytes and long-term ambient air pollution exposure in adults participating in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). We also assessed the association between differentially methylated signals andcis-gene expression. Using spatiotemporal models, one-year average concentrations of outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and oxides of nitrogen (NOX) were estimated at participants' homes. We assessed DNA methylation and gene expression using Illumina 450k and HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips, respectively (nÂ =Â 1,207). We used bump hunting and site-specific approaches to identify differentially methylated signals (false discovery rate of 0.05) and used linear models to assess associations between differentially methylated signals andcis-gene expression. Four differentially methylated regions (DMRs) located on chromosomes 5, 6, 7, and 16 (within or nearSDHAP3, ZFP57, HOXA5, andPRM1, respectively) were associated with PM2.5. The DMRs on chromosomes 5 and 6 also associated with NOX. The DMR on chromosome 5 had the smallest p-value for both PM2.5(pÂ =Â 1.4Ã—10-6) and NOX(pÂ =Â 7.7Ã—10-6). Three differentially methylated CpGs were identified for PM2.5, and cg05926640 (nearTOMM20) had the smallest p-value (pÂ =Â 5.6Ã—10-8).

Given the limitations of current diagnostic methods, the development of fast and accurate tests for the diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections would improve patient management and treatment, as well as contribute to reducing antibiotic misuse in clinical settings. In this scenario, analysis of host transcriptomics constitutes a promising target to develop new diagnostic tests based on the host-specific response to infections. We carried out a multi-cohort meta-analysis of blood transcriptomic data available in public databases, including 11 different studies and 1209 samples from virus- (n= 695) and bacteria- (n= 514) infected patients. We applied a Parallel Regularized Regression Model Search (PReMS) on a set of previously reported genes that distinguished viral from bacterial infection to find a minimum gene expression bio-signature. This strategy allowed us to detect three genes, namelyBAFT,ISG15andDNMT1, that clearly differentiate groups of infection with high accuracy (training set: area under the curve (AUC) 0.86 (sensitivity: 0.81; specificity: 0.87); testing set: AUC 0.87 (sensitivity: 0.82; specificity: 0.86)).BAFTandISG15are involved in processes related to immune response, whileDNMT1is related to the preservation of methylation patterns, and its expression is modulated by pathogen infections. We successfully tested this three-transcript signature in the 11 independent studies, demonstrating its high performance under different scenarios. The main advantage of this three-gene signature is the low number of genes needed to differentiate both groups of patient categories.",

Here, we sought to identify neonatal methylation changes associated with birthweight, at both the individual CpG and genomic regional level, and whether the birthweight-associated methylation signatures were associated with specific maternal factors. Using the Illumina Human MethylationEPIC array we assessed DNA methylation in the cord blood of 557 and 483 infants from the UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial and Southampton Women's Survey, respectively.

DNA methylation (DNAm) provides a way to explore this overlap and heterogeneity as it is determined by the combined effects of genetic variation and the environment. In this study, we aim to identify shared blood DNAm differences between controls and people with Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.We use a mixed-linear model method (MOMENT) that accounts for the effect of (un)known confounders, to test for the association of each DNAm site with each disorder. While only three probes are found to be genome-wide significant in each MOMENT association analysis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease (and none with Alzheimer's disease), a fixed-effects meta-analysis of the three disorders results in 12 genome-wide significant differentially methylated positions. Predicted immune cell-type proportions are disrupted across all neurodegenerative disorders. Protein inflammatory markers are correlated with profile sum-scores derived from disease-associated immune cell-type proportions in a healthy aging cohort. In contrast, they are not correlated with MOMENT DNAm-derived profile sum-scores, calculated using effect sizes of the 12 differentially methylated positions as weights.We identify shared differentially methylated positions in whole blood between neurodegenerative disorders that point to shared pathogenic mechanisms. These shared differentially methylated positions may reflect causes or consequences of disease, but they are unlikely to reflect cell-type proportion differences.",

However, it is unknown whether DNAm at pre-adolescence is associated with BMI status transition from pre- to post-adolescence. In the Isle of Wight (IoW) birth cohort, genome-wide DNA methylation in whole blood was measured using Illumina Infinium Human450 and EPIC BeadChip arrays in nâ€‰=â€‰325 subjects, and pre- to post-adolescence BMI transition was classified into four groups: (1) normal to normal, (2) normal to overweight or obese, (3) overweight or obese to normal, and (4) persistent overweight or obese. We used recursive random forest to screen genome-wide Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites with DNAm potentially associated with BMI transition for each gender, and the association of BMI status transition with DNAm at an earlier age was assessed via logistic regressions. To evaluate gender specificity, interactions between DNAm and gender were included in the model. Findings in the IoW cohort were further tested in an independent cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).In total, 174 candidate CpGs were selected including CpGs from screening and CpGs previously associated correctionally with BMI in children and adults. Of these 174 CpGs, pre-adolescent DNAm of 38 CpGs in the IoW cohort was associated with BMI status transition, including 30 CpGs showing gender-specific associations. Thirteen CpGs showed consistent associations between the IoW cohort and the ALSPAC cohort (11 of which were gender-specific).Pre-adolescence DNAm is associated with the change in BMI status from pre- to post-adolescence and such associations are likely to be gender-specific.",

Since sex chromosomes play an important role in aging, a Y-chromosome-based age predictor would allow studying male-specific aging effects and would also be useful in forensics. Here, we used blood-based DNA methylation microarray data of 1,057 males from six cohorts aged 15-87 and identified 75 Y-CpGs with an interquartile range of â‰¥0.1. Of these, 22 and six were significantly hyper- and hypomethylated with age (p(cor)<0.05, Bonferroni), respectively. Amongst several machine learning algorithms, a model based on support vector machines with radial kernel performed best in male-specific age prediction. We achieved a mean absolute deviation (MAD) between true and predicted age of 7.54 years (cor=0.81, validation) when using all 75 Y-CpGs, and a MAD of 8.46 years (cor=0.73, validation) based on the most predictive 19 Y-CpGs. The accuracies of both age predictors did not worsen with increased age, in contrast to autosomal CpG-based age predictors that are known to predict age with reduced accuracy in the elderly. Overall, we introduce the first-of-its-kind male-specific epigenetic age predictor for future applications in aging research and forensics.",

Our aim was to integrate DNA methylation and gene expression data in an effort to identify biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease risk in a community-based population. We accessed data from the Framingham Offspring Study, a cohort study with data on DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip; Illumina) and gene expression (Human Exon 1.0 ST Array; Affymetrix). Using the MOFA2 R package, we integrated these data to identify biomarkers related to the risk of presenting a cardiovascular event.Four independent latent factors (9, 19, 21-only in women-and 27), driven by DNA methylation, were associated with cardiovascular disease independently of classical risk factors and cell-type counts. In a sensitivity analysis, we also identified factor 21 as associated with CVD in women. Factors 9, 21 and 27 were also associated with coronary heart disease risk. Moreover, in a replication effort in an independent study three of the genes included in factor 27 were also present in a factor identified to be associated with myocardial infarction (CDC42BPB, MAN2A2 and RPTOR). Factor 9 was related to age and cell-type proportions; factor 19 was related to age and B cells count; factor 21 pointed to human immunodeficiency virus infection-related pathways and inflammation; and factor 27 was related to lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption, smoking and body mass index. Inclusion of factor 21 (only in women) improved the discriminative and reclassification capacity of the Framingham classical risk function and factor 27 improved its discrimination.Unsupervised multi-omics data integration methods have the potential to provide insights into the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases.

Moreover, two of these factors improved the predictive capacity of a classical risk function.",
No,20210416,epigenetics,33795684,Evolution of DNA methylation in the human brain.,Nat Commun,"DNA methylation is a critical regulatory mechanism implicated in development, learning, memory, and disease in the human brain. Here we have elucidated DNA methylation changes during recent human brain evolution. We demonstrate dynamic evolutionary trajectories of DNA methylation in cell-type and cytosine-context specific manner. Specifically, DNA methylation in non-CG context, namely CH methylation, has increased (hypermethylation) in neuronal gene bodies during human brain evolution, contributing to human-specific down-regulation of genes and co-expression modules. The effects of CH hypermethylation is particularly pronounced in early development and neuronal subtypes. In contrast, DNA methylation in CG context shows pronounced reduction (hypomethylation) in human brains, notably in cis-regulatory regions, leading to upregulation of downstream genes. We show that the majority of differential CG methylation between neurons and oligodendrocytes originated before the divergence of hominoids and catarrhine monkeys, and harbors strong signal for genetic risk for schizophrenia. Remarkably, a substantial portion of differential CG methylation between neurons and oligodendrocytes emerged in the human lineage since the divergence from the chimpanzee lineage and carries significant genetic risk for schizophrenia. Therefore, recent epigenetic evolution of human cortex has shaped the cellular regulatory landscape and contributed to the increased vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diseases.",

This study aimed to assess gene expression in prospective blood samples from the Norwegian Women and Cancer cohort focusing on time to lung cancer diagnosis and metastatic cancer using a nested case-control design. We employed several approaches to statistically analyze the data and the methods indicated that the case-control differences were subtle but most distinguishable in metastatic case-control pairs in the period 0-3Â years prior to diagnosis. The genes of interest along with estimated blood cell populations could indicate disruption of immunological processes in blood. The genes identified from approaches focusing on alterations with time to diagnosis were distinct from those focusing on the case-control differences. Our results support that explorative analyses of prospective blood samples could indicate circulating signals of disease-related processes.,

Only a few university hospital centers currently use epigenetic biomarkers at the bedside. Moreover, the overall concept of precision medicine is not widely recognized in routine medical practice and the reductionist approach remains predominant in treating patients affected by major diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. By its' very nature, epigenetics is integrative of genetic networks. The study of epigenetic biomarkers has led to the identification of numerous drugs with an increasingly significant role in clinical therapy especially of cancer patients. Here, we provide an overview of clinical epigenetics within the context of network analysis. We illustrate achievements to date and discuss how we can move from traditional medicine into the era of network medicine (NM), where pathway-informed molecular diagnostics will allow treatment selection following the paradigm of precision medicine.",

In humans, VNTRs have been implicated in both Mendelian and complex disorders, but are largely ignored by genomic pipelines due to the complexity of genotyping and the computational expense. We describe adVNTR-NN, a method that uses shallow neural networks to genotype a VNTR in 18â€‰seconds on 55X whole genome data, while maintaining high accuracy. We use adVNTR-NN to genotype 10,264 VNTRs in 652 GTEx individuals. Associating VNTR length with gene expression in 46 tissues, we identify 163 ""eVNTRs"". Of the 22 eVNTRs in blood where independent data is available, 21 (95%) are replicated in terms of significance and direction of association. 49% of the eVNTR loci show a strong and likely causal impact on the expression of genes and 80% have maximum effect size at least 0.3. The impacted genes are involved in diseases including Alzheimer's, obesity and familial cancers, highlighting the importance of VNTRs for understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases.",

Many of the underlying causal variants may affect enhancers2,3, but we lack accurate maps of enhancers and their target genes to interpret such variants. We recently developed the activity-by-contact (ABC) model to predict which enhancers regulate which genes and validated the model using CRISPR perturbations in several cell types4. Here we apply this ABC model to create enhancer-geneÂ maps in 131 human cell types and tissues, and use these maps to interpret the functions of GWAS variants. Across 72 diseases and complex traits, ABC links 5,036 GWAS signals to 2,249 unique genes, including a class of 577 genes that appear to influence multiple phenotypes through variants in enhancers that act in different cell types. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causal variants are enriched in predicted enhancers by more than 20-fold in particular cell types such as dendritic cells, and ABC achieves higher precision than other regulatory methods at connecting noncoding variants to target genes. These variant-to-function maps reveal an enhancer that contains an IBD risk variant and that regulates the expression of PPIF to alter the membrane potential of mitochondria in macrophages. Our study reveals principles of genome regulation, identifies genes that affect IBD and provides a resource and generalizable strategy to connect risk variants of common diseases to their molecular and cellular functions.",

We validated this approach by showing that, in pregnant women, circulating DNA carrying fetal-specific alleles was entirely placenta-derived. In lung transplant recipients, we showed that, at 72 hr after transplantation, the lung contributed only a median of 17% to the plasma DNA carrying donor-specific alleles, and hematopoietic cells contributed a median of 78%. In hepatocellular cancer patients, the liver was identified as the predominant source of plasma DNA carrying tumor-specific mutations. In a pregnant woman with lymphoma, plasma DNA molecules carrying cancer mutations and fetal-specific alleles were accurately shown to be derived from the lymphocytes and placenta, respectively. Analysis of tissue origin for plasma DNA carrying genetic variants is potentially useful for noninvasive prenatal testing, transplantation monitoring, and cancer screening.",

But the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to examine whether cesarean delivery on maternal request without any medical indications (CDMR) impacts DNA methylation status in the umbilical cord blood of the infant.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Shanghai, China. A total of 70 CDMR and 70 vaginal deliveries (VD) were recruited in 2012. The cord blood DNA methylation status was measured in 30 CDMR and 30 VD newborns using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450â€‰K BeadChip. To validate the results, the cord blood DNA methylation status was measured in another 40 CDMR and 40 VD newborns using targeted bisulfite sequencing assay. A total of 497 CpG sites from 40 genes were included in the analysis.A total of 165 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) exhibited differences in DNA methylation by 10% or more between the CDMR and VD groups, many of which were related to the development of the immune system. Based on the targeted bisulfite sequencing assay, 16 genes (16/22, 72.7%) had higher methylation level in the CDMR group than the VD group. Among them, 5 genes were related to the immune system. After considering the estimation of cell type proportions, there was few significant differences in DNA methylation between CDMR and VD groups.The DMPs identified between CDMR and VD groups might be largely explained by the cell type proportions. Further studies are needed to examine DNA methylation in each cell type separately.",

Toll-like receptors allow epithelial cells to identify microbe associated molecular patterns. However, the mechanisms that mitigate biological noise in single cells to ensure quantitatively appropriate responses remain unclear. Here we address this question using single cell and single molecule approaches in mammary epithelial cells and primary organoids. We find that epithelial tissues respond to bacterial microbe associated molecular patterns by activating a subset of cells in an all-or-nothing (i.e. digital) manner. The maximum fraction of responsive cells is regulated by a bimodal epigenetic switch that licenses the TLR2 promoter for transcription across multiple generations. This mechanism confers a flexible memory of inflammatory events as well as unique spatio-temporal control of epithelial tissue-level immune responses. We propose that epigenetic licensing in individual cells allows for long-term, quantitative fine-tuning of population-level responses.",

We estimated a meta-OR for PD of 1.89 per unit DNAm tibia-lead increase (95% CI 1.59, 2.24; pâ€‰=â€‰8.1E-13).

Here we use complementary long-read sequencing technologies to complete the linear assembly of human chromosome 8. Our assembly resolves the sequence of five previously long-standing gaps, including a 2.08-Mb centromeric Î±-satellite array, a 644-kb copy number polymorphism in the Î²-defensin geneÂ cluster that is important for disease risk, and an 863-kb variable number tandem repeat at chromosome 8q21.2 that can function as a neocentromere. We show that the centromeric Î±-satellite array is generally methylated except for a 73-kb hypomethylated region of diverse higher-order Î±-satellites enriched with CENP-A nucleosomes, consistent with the location of the kinetochore. In addition, we confirm the overall organization and methylation pattern of the centromere in a diploid human genome. Using a dual long-read sequencing approach, we complete high-quality draft assemblies of the orthologous centromere from chromosome 8 in chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque to reconstruct its evolutionary history. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses show that the higher-order Î±-satellite structure evolved in the great ape ancestor with a layered symmetry, in which more ancient higher-order repeats locate peripherally to monomeric Î±-satellites. We estimate that the mutation rate of centromeric satellite DNA is accelerated by more than 2.2-fold compared to the unique portionsÂ of the genome, and this acceleration extends into the flanking sequence.",

However, identifying causal mechanisms of epigenetic origin has been challenging. New opportunities have risen from recent findings in intra-individual and cyclical epigenetic variation, which includes circadian epigenetic oscillations. Cytosine modifications display deterministic temporal rhythms, which may drive ageing and complex disease. Temporality in the epigenome, or the 'chrono' dimension, may help the integration of epigenetic, environmental and genetic disease studies, and reconcile several disparities stemming from the arbitrarily delimited research fields. The ultimate goal of chrono-epigenetics is to predict disease risk, age of onset and disease dynamics from within individual-specific temporal dynamics of epigenomes.",

Phenotypically, the ageing process is associated with a wide variety of features at the molecular, cellular and physiological level-for example, genomic and epigenomic alterations, loss of proteostasis, declining overall cellular and subcellular function and deregulation of signalling systems. However, the relative importance, mechanistic interrelationships and hierarchical order of these features of ageing have not been clarified. Here we synthesize accumulating evidence that DNA damage affects most, if not all, aspects of the ageing phenotype, making it a potentially unifying cause of ageing. Targeting DNA damage and its mechanistic links with the ageing phenotype will provide a logical rationale for developing unified interventions to counteract age-related dysfunction and disease.",

However, so far, only few studies have examined epigenetic aging in newborns-especially regarding different gestational or perinatal tissues. In this study, we investigated which birth- and pregnancy-related variables are most important in predicting gestational epigenetic age acceleration or deceleration (i.e., the deviation between gestational epigenetic age estimated from the DNA methylome and chronological gestational age) in chorionic villus, placenta and cord blood tissues from two independent study cohorts (ITU, nâ€‰=â€‰639 and PREDO, nâ€‰=â€‰966). We further characterized the correspondence of epigenetic age deviations between these tissues.Among the most predictive factors of epigenetic age deviations in single tissues were child sex, birth length, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal mental disorders until childbirth, delivery mode and parity. However, the specific factors related to epigenetic age deviation and the direction of association differed across tissues. In individuals with samples available from more than one tissue, relative epigenetic age deviations were not correlated across tissues.Gestational epigenetic age acceleration or deceleration was not related to more favorable or unfavorable factors in one direction in the investigated tissues, and the relative epigenetic age differed between tissues of the same person. This indicates that epigenetic age deviations associate with distinct, tissue specific, factors during the gestational and perinatal period. Our findings suggest that the epigenetic age of the newborn should be seen as a characteristic of a specific tissue, and less as a general characteristic of the child itself.",

However, the importance of DNA methylation in ageing remains unclear. The study of subtelomeric regions could give promising insights into this issue. Previously reported associations between susceptibility to age-related diseases and epigenetic instability at subtelomeres suggest that the DNA methylation profile of subtelomeres undergoes remodelling during ageing. In the present work, this hypothesis has been tested in the context of the European large-scale project MARK-AGE. In this cross-sectional study, we profiled the DNA methylation of chromosomes 5 and 21 subtelomeres, in more than 2000 age-stratified women and men recruited in eight European countries. The study included individuals from the general population as well as the offspring of nonagenarians and Down syndrome subjects, who served as putative models of delayed and accelerated ageing, respectively. Significant linear changes of subtelomeric DNA methylation with increasing age were detected in the general population, indicating that subtelomeric DNA methylation changes are typical signs of ageing. Data also show that, compared to the general population, the dynamics of age-related DNA methylation changes are attenuated in the offspring ofÂ centenarian, while they accelerate in Down syndrome individuals. This result suggests that subtelomeric DNA methylation changes reflect the rate of ageing progression. We next attempted to trace the age-related changes of subtelomeric methylation back to the influence of diverse variables associated with methylation variations in the population, including demographics, dietary/health habits and clinical parameters. Results indicate that the effects of age on subtelomeric DNA methylation are mostly independent of all other variables evaluated.",

However, within populations, biological aging rates vary. Understanding sources of variation in this process is central to understanding the biodemography of natural populations. We constructed a DNA methylation-based age predictor for an intensively studied wild baboon population in Kenya. Consistent with findings in humans, the resulting 'epigenetic clock' closely tracks chronological age, but individuals are predicted to be somewhat older or younger than their known ages. Surprisingly, these deviations are not explained by the strongest predictors of lifespan in this population, early adversity and social integration. Instead, they are best predicted by male dominance rank: high-ranking males are predicted to be older than their true ages, and epigenetic age tracks changes in rank over time. Our results argue that achieving high rank for male baboons - the best predictor of reproductive success - imposes costs consistent with a 'live fast, die young' life-history strategy.Â© 2021, Anderson et al.",

DNA methylation at birth has proven to be an accurate predictor of gestational age. Previous predictors of epigenetic gestational age were based on DNA methylation data from the Illumina HumanMethylation 27Â K or 450Â K array, which have subsequently been replaced by the Illumina MethylationEPIC 850Â K array (EPIC). Our aims here were to build an epigenetic gestational age clock specific for the EPIC array and to evaluate its precision and accuracy using the embryo transfer date of newborns from the largest EPIC-derived dataset to date on assisted reproductive technologies (ART).We built an epigenetic gestational age clock using Lasso regression trained on 755 randomly selected non-ART newborns from the Norwegian Study of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (START)-a substudy of the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). For the ART-conceived newborns, the START dataset had detailed information on the embryo transfer date and the specific ART procedure used for conception. The predicted gestational age was compared to clinically estimated gestational age in 200 non-ART and 838 ART newborns using MM-type robust regression. The performance of the clock was compared to previously published gestational age clocks in an independent replication sample of 148 newborns from the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restrictions (PREDO) study-a prospective pregnancy cohort of Finnish women.Our new epigenetic gestational age clock showed higher precision and accuracy in predicting gestational age than previous gestational age clocks (R2â€‰=â€‰0.724, median absolute deviation (MAD)â€‰=â€‰3.14Â days). Restricting the analysis to CpGs shared between 450Â K and EPIC did not reduce the precision of the clock. Furthermore, validating the clock on ART newborns with known embryo transfer date confirmed that DNA methylation is an accurate predictor of gestational age (R2â€‰=â€‰0.767, MADâ€‰=â€‰3.7Â days).We present the first EPIC-based predictor of gestational age and demonstrate its robustness and precision in ART and non-ART newborns. As more datasets are being generated on the EPIC platform, this clock will be valuable in studies using gestational age to assess neonatal development.",

Much research on human-specific changes in gene expression and epigenetic marks has focused on the prefrontal cortex, a brain structure distinguished by its role in executive functions. The cerebellum shows expansion in great apes and is gaining increasing attention for its role in motor skills and cognitive processing, including language. However, relatively few molecular studies of the cerebellum in a comparative evolutionary context have been conducted. Here, we identify human-specific methylation in the lateral cerebellum relative to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in a comparative study with chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Specifically, we profiled genome-wide methylation levels in the three species for each of the two brain structures and identified human-specific differentially methylated genomic regions unique to each structure. We further identified which differentially methylated regions (DMRs) overlap likely regulatory elements and determined whether associated genes show corresponding species differences in gene expression. We found greater human-specific methylation in the cerebellum than the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with differentially methylated regions overlapping genes involved in several conditions or processes relevant to human neurobiology, including synaptic plasticity, lipid metabolism, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and neurodevelopment, including developmental disorders. Moreover, our results show some overlap with those of previous studies focused on the neocortex, indicating that such results may be common to multiple brain structures. These findings further our understanding of the cerebellum in human brain evolution.",

However, epigenome-scale studies on the longitudinal association of cord blood DNAm with IgE over time are lacking. Our study aimed to examine the association of DNAm at birth with childhood serum IgE levels during early life. Genome-scale DNAm and total serum IgE measured at birth, 5, 8, and 11â€‰years of children in the Taiwan Maternal and Infant Cohort Study were included in the study in the discovery stage. Linear mixed models were implemented to assess the association between cord blood DNAm at ~310K 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites with repeated IgE measurements, adjusting for cord blood IgE. Identified statistically significant CpGs (at a false discovery rate, FDR, of 0.05) were further tested in an independent replication cohort, the Isle of Wight (IoW) birth cohort. We mapped replicated CpGs to genes and conducted gene ontology analysis using ToppFun to identify significantly enriched pathways and biological processes of the genes. Cord blood DNAm of 273 CpG sites were significantly (FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.05) associated with IgE levels longitudinally. Among the identified CpGs available in both cohorts (184 CpGs), 92 CpGs (50%) were replicated in the IoW in terms of consistency in direction of associations between DNA methylation and IgE levels later in life, and 16 of the 92 CpGs showed statistically significant associations (Pâ€‰<â€‰.05). Gene ontology analysis identified 4 pathways (FDRâ€‰=â€‰0.05).

Blood leukocyte DNAm was determined for 90 DNA samples using the Illumina MethylationEPIC chip. An epigenome-wide association study was performed to assess the relationship between Pb and DNAm.Individuals from Cerro de Pasco had higher Pb than individuals from Lima (p-valueÂ =Â 2.00E-16). Males had higher Pb than females (p-valueÂ =Â 2.36E-04). Pb was positively associated with hemoglobin (p-valueÂ =Â 8.60E-04). In Cerro de Pasco, blood Pb decreased with the distance from the mine (p-valueÂ =Â 0.04), and association with soil Pb was approaching significance (p-valueÂ =Â 0.08).

This study aimed to investigate the role of DNA methylation in the relationship between BMI and NSCLC.We carried out a genome-wide DNA methylation study of BMI in peripheral blood among 2266 Chinese participants by using Illumina Methylation arrays. For the BMI-related DNA methylation changes, their associations with NSCLC risk were further analyzed and their mediation effects on BMI-NSCLC association were also evaluated.The methylation levels of four CpGs (cg12593793, cg17061862, cg11024682, and cg06500161, annotated to LMNA, ZNF143, SREBF1, and ABCG1, respectively) were found to be significantly associated with BMI. Methylation levels of cg12593793, cg11024682, and cg06500161 were observed to be inversely associated with NSCLC risk [OR (95%CI) =0.22 (0.16, 0.31), 0.39 (0.30, 0.50), and 0.66 (0.53, 0.82), respectively]. Additionally, cg11024682 in SREBF1 and cg06500161 in ABCG1 mediated 45.3% and 19.5% of the association between BMI and decreased NSCLC risk, respectively.In this study, we identified four DNA methylation sites associated with BMI in the Chinese populations at the genome-wide significant level. We also found that the BMI-related methylations of SREBF1 and ABCG1 could mediate about a quintile-to-half of the effect of BMI on reduced NSCLC risk, which adds a potential mechanism underlying this association.Â© 2021 The Authors.

Decreased eGFR is more common among US Hispanics and African Americans. The causes for this are poorly understood. We aimed to identify trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with eGFR using an agnostic, genome-wide approach.The study included up to 5428 participants from multi-ethnic studies for discovery and 8109 participants for replication. We tested the associations between whole blood DNAm and eGFR using beta values from Illumina 450K or EPIC arrays. Ethnicity-stratified analyses were performed using linear mixed models adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and study-specific and technical variables. Summary results were meta-analyzed within and across ethnicities. Findings were assessed using integrative epigenomics methods and pathway analyses.We identified 93 DMPs associated with eGFR at an FDR of 0.05 and replicated 13 and 1 DMPs across independent samples in trans-ethnic and African American meta-analyses, respectively. The study also validated 6 previously published DMPs. Identified DMPs showed significant overlap enrichment with DNase I hypersensitive sites in kidney tissue, sites associated with the expression of proximal genes, and transcription factor motifs and pathways associated with kidney tissue and kidney development.We uncovered trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific DMPs associated with eGFR, including DMPs enriched in regulatory elements in kidney tissue and pathways related to kidney development.

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that regulates gene transcription and is known to be involved in AD. We performed the first large-scale sex-specific meta-analysis of DNA methylation differences in AD neuropathology, by re-analyzing four recent epigenome-wide association studies totaling more than 1000 postmortem prefrontal cortex brain samples using a uniform analytical pipeline. For each cohort, we employed two complementary analytical strategies, a sex-stratified analysis that examined methylation-Braak stage associations in male and female samples separately, and a sex-by-Braak stage interaction analysis that compared the magnitude of these associations between different sexes. Our analysis uncovered 14 novel CpGs, mapped to genes such as TMEM39A and TNXB that are associated with the AD Braak stage in a sex-specific manner. TMEM39A is known to be involved in inflammation, dysregulated type I interferon responses, and other immune processes. TNXB encodes tenascin proteins, which are extracellular matrix glycoproteins demonstrated to modulate synaptic plasticity in the brain. Moreover, for many previously implicated genes in AD neuropathology, such as MBP and AZU1, our analysis provided the new insights that they were predominately driven by effects in only one sex. These sex-specific DNA methylation differences were enriched in divergent biological processes such as integrin activation in females and complement activation in males. Our study implicated multiple new loci and biological processes that affected AD neuropathology in a sex-specific manner.",

The effect of ART on DNA methylation levels of 231 adolescents mean age 15.96â€‰Â±â€‰1.59â€‰years (52.8% male) was compared to 1188 naturally conceived counterparts, 17.25â€‰Â±â€‰0.58â€‰years (50.9% male) from the Raine Study.DNA methylation profiles from a subset of 231 adolescents (13-19.9â€‰years) from the GUHS, generated using the Infinium Methylation Epic Bead Chip (EPIC) array were compared to 1188 profiles from the Raine Study previously measured using the Illumina 450K array. We conducted epigenome-wide association approach (EWAS) and tested for an association between the cohorts applying Firth's bias reduced logistic regression against the outcome of ART versus naturally conceived offspring. Additionally, within the GUHS cohort, we investigated differences in methylation status in fresh versus frozen embryo transfers, cause of infertility as well as IVF versus ICSI conceived offspring. Following the EWAS analysis we investigated nominally significant probes using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify enriched biological pathways. Finally, within GUHS we compared four estimates (Horvath, Hanuum, PhenoAge [Levine], and skin Horvath) of epigenetic age and their correlation with chronological age.Between the two cohorts, we did not identify any DNA methylation probes that reached a Bonferroni corrected P-value < 1.24E-0.7. When comparing IVF versus ICSI conceived adolescents within the GUHS cohort, after adjustment for participant age, sex, maternal smoking, multiple births, and batch effect, three methylation probes (cg15016734, cg26744878 and cg20233073) reached a Bonferroni correction of 6.31E-08. After correcting for cell count heterogeneity, two of the aforementioned probes remained significant and an additional two probes (cg 0331628 and cg 20235051) were identified. A general trend towards hypomethylation in the ICSI offspring was observed. All four measures of epigenetic age were highly correlated with chronological age and showed no evidence of accelerated epigenetic aging within their whole blood.The small sample size coupled with the use of whole blood, where epigenetic differences may occur in other tissue. This was corrected by the utilized statistical method that accounts for imbalanced sample size between groups and adjusting for cell count heterogeneity. Only a small portion of the methylome was analysed and rare individual differences may be missed.Our findings provide further reassurance that the effects of the ART manipulations occurring during early embryogenesis, existing in the neonatal period are indeed of a transient nature and do not persist into adolescence. However, we have not excluded that alternative epigenetic mechanisms may be at play.This project was supported by NHMRC project Grant no. 1042269 and R.J.H. received funding support from Ferring Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd.

We used linear models to detect differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with migration. We performed multiple post hoc analyses to validate our findings.Results:We identified 13 DMPs associated with migration (delta-beta values: 0.2-4.5%). Seven DMPs inCPLX2,EIF4E3,MEF2D,TLX3,ST8SIA1,ANGandCHRM3were independent of extrinsic genomic influences in public databases. Two DMPs inNLRC5were associated with duration of stay in Europe among migrants. All DMPs were biologically linked to migration-related factors.Conclusion:Our findings provide the first insights into DNAm differences between migrants and non-migrants.",

We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of leukocyte DNA methylation in relation to level and change in cognitive abilities, from midlife through late life in 535 Swedish twins.Methylation levels were measured with the Infinium Human Methylation 450Â K or Infinium MethylationEPIC array, and all sites passing quality control on both arrays were selected for analysis (nâ€‰=â€‰250,816). Empirical Bayes estimates of individual intercept (age 65), linear, and quadratic change were obtained from latent growth curve models of cognitive traits and used as outcomes in linear regression models. Significant sites (pâ€‰<â€‰2.4â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7) were followed up in between-within twin pair models adjusting for familial confounding and full-growth modeling. We identified six significant associations between DNA methylation and level of cognitive abilities at age 65: cg18064256 (PPP1R13L) with processing speed and spatial ability; cg04549090 (NRXN3) with spatial ability; cg09988380 (POGZ), cg25651129 (-), and cg08011941 (ENTPD8) with working memory. The genes are involved in neuroinflammation, neuropsychiatric disorders, and ATP metabolism. Within-pair associations were approximately half that of between-pair associations across all sites. In full-growth curve models, associations between DNA methylation and cognitive level at age 65 were of small effect sizes, and associations between DNA methylation and longitudinal change in cognitive abilities of very small effect sizes.Leukocyte DNA methylation was associated with level, but not change in cognitive abilities. The associations were substantially attenuated in within-pair analyses, indicating they are influenced in part by genetic factors.",

We aimed to identify differentially methylated loci associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and assess their validity as predictive and causal biomarkers.We designed a case-control, two-stage, epigenome-wide association study on AMI (ndiscoveryâ€‰=â€‰391, nvalidationâ€‰=â€‰204). DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We performed a fixed-effects meta-analysis of the two samples. 34 CpGs were associated with AMI. Only 12 of them were available in two independent cohort studies (nâ€‰~â€‰1800 and nâ€‰~â€‰2500) with incident coronary and cardiovascular disease (CHD and CVD, respectively). The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used in those two studies. Four of the 12 CpGs were validated in association with incident CHD: AHRR-mapping cg05575921, PTCD2-mapping cg25769469, intergenic cg21566642 and MPO-mapping cg04988978. We then assessed whether methylation risk scores based on those CpGs improved the predictive capacity of the Framingham risk function, but they did not. Finally, we aimed to study the causality of those associations using a Mendelian randomization approach but only one of the CpGs had a genetic influence and therefore the results were not conclusive.We have identified 34 CpGs related to AMI. These loci highlight the relevance of smoking, lipid metabolism, and inflammation in the biological mechanisms related to AMI. Four were additionally associated with incident CHD and CVD but did not provide additional predictive information.",

In particular, epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, may connect phthalate exposure with health outcomes. Here, we evaluated the association of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) exposure in utero with cord blood epigenome-wide DNA methylation in 203 mother-child pairs enrolled in the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health, using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Epigenome-wide association analysis demonstrated the predominant positive associations between the levels of the primary metabolite of DEHP, mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), in maternal blood and DNA methylation levels in cord blood. The genes annotated to the CpGs positively associated with MEHP levels were enriched for pathways related to metabolism, the endocrine system, and signal transduction. Among them, methylation levels of CpGs involved in metabolism were inversely associated with the offspring's ponderal index (PI). Further, clustering and mediation analyses suggested that multiple increased methylation changes may jointly mediate the association of DEHP exposure in utero with the offspring's PI at birth. Although further studies are required to assess the impact of these changes, this study suggests that differential DNA methylation may link phthalate exposure in utero to fetal growth and further imply that DNA methylation has predictive value for the offspring's obesity.Copyright Â© 2021.

Since DNA methylation has been implicated in the regulation of viral infections and the immune system, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify candidate loci regulated by this epigenetic mark that could be involved in the onset of COVID-19 in patients without comorbidities.Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 407 confirmed COVID-19 patients â‰¤ 61 years of age and without comorbidities, 194 (47.7%) of whom had mild symptomatology that did not involve hospitalization and 213 (52.3%) had a severe clinical course that required respiratory support. The set of cases was divided into discovery (nÂ =Â 207) and validation (nÂ =Â 200) cohorts, balanced for age and sex of individuals. We analysed the DNA methylation status of 850,000 CpG sites in these patients.The DNA methylation status of 44 CpG sites was associated with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Of these loci, 23 (52.3%) were located in 20 annotated coding genes. These genes, such as the inflammasome component Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the Major Histocompatibility Complex, class I C (HLA-C) candidates, were mainly involved in the response of interferon to viral infection. We used the EWAS-identified sites to establish a DNA methylation signature (EPICOVID) that is associated with the severity of the disease.We identified DNA methylation sites as epigenetic susceptibility loci for respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients.

Yes,20210510,ewas,33862401,Residential surrounding greenness and DNA methylation: An epigenome-wide association study.,Environ Int,"DNA methylation is a potential biological mechanism through which residential greenness affects health, but little is known about its association with greenness and whether the association could be modified by genetic background. We aimed to evaluate the association between surrounding greenness and genome-wide DNA methylation and potential gene-greenness interaction effects on DNA methylation.We measured blood-derived DNA methylation using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (Illumina) for 479 Australian women, including 66 monozygotic, 66 dizygotic twin pairs, and 215 sisters of these twins. Surrounding greenness was represented by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) within 300, 500, 1000 or 2000Â m surrounding participants' home addresses. For each cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG), the associations between its methylation level and NDVI or EVI were evaluated by generalized estimating equations, after adjusting for age, education, marital status, area-level socioeconomic status, smoking behavior, cell-type proportions, and familial clustering. We used comb-p and DMRcate to identify significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs). For each significant CpG, we evaluated the interaction effects of greenness and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) withinÂ Â±1Â Mb window on its methylation level.We found associations between surrounding greenness and blood DNA methylation for one CpG (cg04720477, mapped to the promoter region of CNP gene) with false discovery rate [FDR]Â <Â 0.05, and for another 9 CpGs with 0.05Â â‰¤Â FDRÂ <Â 0.10. For two of these CpGs, we found 33 SNPs significantly (FDRÂ <Â 0.05) modified the greenness-methylation association. There were 35 significant DMRs related to surrounding greenness that were identified by both comb-p (Sidak p-valueÂ <Â 0.01) and DMRcate (FDRÂ <Â 0.01). Those CpGs and DMRs were mapped to genes related to many human diseases, such as mental health disorders and neoplasms as well as nutritional and metabolic diseases.Surrounding greenness was associated with blood DNA methylation of many loci across human genome, and this association could be modified by genetic variations.Copyright Â© 2021 The Author(s).

No,20210510,dnam age,33926538,"Associations of circulating folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations in early pregnancy and cord blood with epigenetic gestational age: the Generation R Study.",Clin Epigenetics,"Circulating folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations during fetal development have been associated with health outcomes in childhood. Changes in fetal DNA methylation may be an underlying mechanism. This may be reflected in altered epigenetic aging of the fetus, as compared to chronological aging. The difference between gestational age derived in clinical practice and gestational age predicted from neonatal DNA methylation data is referred to as gestational age acceleration. Differences in circulating folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations during fetal development may be associated with gestational age acceleration.Up to 1346 newborns participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study, had both cord blood DNA methylation data available and information on plasma folate, serum total and active B12 and plasma homocysteine concentrations, measured in early pregnancy and/or in cord blood. A subgroup of 380 newborns had mothers with optimal pregnancy dating based on a regular menstrual cycle and a known date of last menstrual period. For comparison, gestational age acceleration was calculated based the method of both Bohlin and Knight. In the total study population, which was more similar to Bohlin's training population, one standard deviation score (SDS) higher maternal plasma homocysteine concentrations was nominally associated with positive gestational age acceleration [0.07Â weeks, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02, 0.13] by Bohlin's method. In the subgroup with pregnancy dating based on last menstrual period, the method that was also used in Knight's training population, one SDS higher cord serum total and active B12 concentrations were nominally associated with negative gestational age acceleration [(-â€‰0.16Â weeks, 95% CI -â€‰0.30, -â€‰0.02) and (-â€‰0.15Â weeks, 95% CI -â€‰0.29, -â€‰0.01), respectively] by Knight's method.We found some evidence to support associations of higher maternal plasma homocysteine concentrations with positive gestational age acceleration, suggesting faster epigenetic than clinical gestational aging. Cord serum vitamin B12 concentrations may be associated with negative gestational age acceleration, indicating slower epigenetic than clinical gestational aging. Future studies could examine whether altered fetal epigenetic aging underlies the associations of circulating homocysteine and vitamin B12 blood concentrations during fetal development with long-term health outcomes.",

No,20210510,methods,33926513,Estimands in epigenome-wide association studies.,Clin Epigenetics,"In DNA methylation analyses like epigenome-wide association studies, effects in differentially methylated CpG sites are assessed. Two kinds of outcomes can be used for statistical analysis: Beta-values and M-values. M-values follow a normal distribution and help to detect differentially methylated CpG sites. As biological effect measures, differences of M-values are more or less meaningless. Beta-values are of more interest since they can be interpreted directly as differences in percentage of DNA methylation at a given CpG site, but they have poor statistical properties. Different frameworks are proposed for reporting estimands in DNA methylation analysis, relying on Beta-values, M-values, or both.We present and discuss four possible approaches of achieving estimands in DNA methylation analysis. In addition, we present the usage of M-values or Beta-values in the context of bioinformatical pipelines, which often demand a predefined outcome. We show the dependencies between the differences in M-values to differences in Beta-values in two data simulations: a analysis with and without confounder effect. Without present confounder effects, M-values can be used for the statistical analysis and Beta-values statistics for the reporting. If confounder effects exist, we demonstrate the deviations and correct the effects by the intercept method. Finally, we demonstrate the theoretical problem on two large human genome-wide DNA methylation datasets to verify the results.The usage of M-values in the analysis of DNA methylation data will produce effect estimates, which cannot be biologically interpreted. The parallel usage of Beta-value statistics ignores possible confounder effects and can therefore not be recommended. Hence, if the differences in Beta-values are the focus of the study, the intercept method is recommendable. Hyper- or hypomethylated CpG sites must then be carefully evaluated. If an exploratory analysis of possible CpG sites is the aim of the study, M-values can be used for inference.",x

PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases were systematically searched for available studies on the association between air pollution and DNA methylation published up to March 9, 2021. Three DNA methylation approaches were considered: global methylation, candidate-gene, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Meta-analysis was used to summarize the combined estimates for the association between air pollutants and global DNA methylation levels. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochran Q test and quantified with the I2statistic. In total, 38 articles were included in this study: 16 using global methylation, 18 using candidate genes, and 11 using EWAS, with 7 studies using more than one approach. Meta-analysis revealed an imprecise but inverse association between exposure to PM2.5and global DNA methylation (for each 10-Î¼g/m3PM2.5, combined estimate: 0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.97 - 0.19). The candidate-gene results were consistent for the ERCC3 and SOX2 genes, suggesting hypermethylation in ERCC3 associated with benzene and that in SOX2 associated with PM2.5exposure. EWAS identified 201 CpG sites and 148 differentially methylated regions that showed differential methylation associated with air pollution. Among the 307 genes investigated in 11 EWAS, a locus in nucleoredoxin gene was found to be positively associated with PM2.5in two studies. Current meta-analysis indicates that PM2.5is imprecisely and inversely associated with DNA methylation. The candidate-gene results consistently suggest hypermethylation in ERCC3 associated with benzene exposure and that in SOX2 associated with PM2.5exposure. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) network analyses revealed that these genes were associated with African trypanosomiasis, Malaria, Antifolate resistance, Graft-versus-host disease, and so on. More evidence is needed to clarify the association between air pollution and DNA methylation.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",x

We collectively analyzed 35 360 Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K DNAm array samples published on the Gene Expression Omnibus. We learned a controlled vocabulary of sample labels by applying regular expressions to metadata and used existing models to predict various sample properties including epigenetic age. We found approximately two-thirds of samples were from blood, one-quarter were from brain and one-third were from cancer patients. About 19% of samples failed at least one of Illumina's 17 prescribed quality assessments; signal distributions across samples suggest modifying manufacturer-recommended thresholds for failure would make these assessments more informative. We further analyzed DNAm variances in seven tissues (adipose, nasal, blood, brain, buccal, sperm and liver) and characterized specific probes distinguishing them. Finally, we compiled DNAm array data and metadata, including our learned and predicted sample labels, into database files accessible via the recountmethylation R/Bioconductor companion package.

No,20210607,aging,33813140,Clinical biomarkers and associations with healthspan and lifespan: Evidence from observational and genetic data,EBioMedicine,"Background: Biomarker-disease relationships are extensively investigated. However, associations between common clinical biomarkers and healthspan, the disease-free lifespan, are largely unknown. We aimed to explore the predictive values of ten biomarkers on healthspan and lifespan, and to identify putative causal mechanisms.

Methods: Using data from 12,098 Swedish individuals aged 47-94 years, we examined both serum concentrations and genetically predicted levels of ten glycemic, lipid-, inflammatory, and hematological biomarkers. During a follow-up period of up to 16 years, 3681 incident cases of any chronic disease (i.e., end of healthspan) and 2674 deaths (i.e., end of lifespan) were documented. Cox regression models were applied to estimate the associations of a one standard deviation increase in biomarkers with healthspan and lifespan.

Findings: Seven out of ten serum biomarkers were significantly associated with risks of any chronic disease and death; elevated glycemic biomarkers and high-density lipoprotein-related biomarkers showed the strongest detrimental (hazard ratio [HR] 1·29 [95% CI 1·24-1·34]) and protective effects (HR 0·92 [95% CI 0·89-0·96]), respectively. Genetic predisposition to elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG) was associated with increased risks of any chronic disease (HR 1·05 [95% CI 1·02-1·09]); genetically determined higher C-reactive protein correlated with lower death risks (HR 0·91 [95% CI 0·87-0·95]). Notably, the genetically proxied FBG-healthspan association was largely explained by serum FBG concentration.

Interpretation: Circulating concentrations of glycemic, lipid-, and inflammatory biomarkers are predictive of healthspan and lifespan. Glucose control is a putative causal mechanism and a potential intervention target for healthspan maintenance.",

There is substantial individual variability in the aging process between men and women. In general, women live longer than men, consistent with lower biological ages as assessed by molecular biomarkers, but there is a paradox. Women are frailer and have worse health at the end of life, while men still perform better in physical function examinations. Moreover, many age-related diseases show sex-specific patterns. In this review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge on sexual dimorphism in human studies, with support from animal research, on biological aging and illnesses. We also attempt to place it in the context of the theories of aging, as well as discuss the explanations for the sex differences, for example, the sex-chromosome linked mechanisms and hormonally driven differences.Â© 2021, HÃ¤gg and JylhÃ¤vÃ¤.",
No,20210607,dnam age,34001218,Blood and skeletal muscle ageing determined by epigenetic clocks and their associations with physical activity and functioning.,Clin Epigenetics,"The aim of this study was to investigate the correspondence of different biological ageing estimates (i.e. epigenetic age) in blood and muscle tissue and their associations with physical activity (PA), physical function and body composition. Two independent cohorts (Nâ€‰=â€‰139 and Nâ€‰=â€‰47) were included, whose age span covered adulthood (23-69Â years). Whole blood and m. vastus lateralis samples were collected, and DNA methylation was analysed. Four different DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) estimates were calculated using genome-wide methylation data and publicly available online tools. A novel muscle-specific methylation age was estimated using the R-package 'MEAT'. PA was measured with questionnaires and accelerometers. Several tests were conducted to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength. Body composition was estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. DNAmAge estimates from blood and muscle were highly correlated with chronological age, but different age acceleration estimates were weakly associated with each other. The monozygotic twin within-pair similarity of ageing pace was higher in blood (râ€‰=â€‰0.617-0.824) than in muscle (râ€‰=â€‰0.523-0.585). Associations of age acceleration estimates with PA, physical function and body composition were weak in both tissues and mostly explained by smoking and sex. The muscle-specific epigenetic clock MEAT was developed to predict chronological age, which may explain why it did not associate with functional phenotypes. The Horvath's clock and GrimAge were weakly associated with PA and related phenotypes, suggesting that higher PA would be linked to accelerated biological ageing in muscle. This may, however, be more reflective of the low capacity of epigenetic clock algorithms to measure functional muscle ageing than of actual age acceleration. Based on our results, the investigated epigenetic clocks have rather low value in estimating muscle ageing with respect to the physiological adaptations that typically occur due to ageing or PA. Thus, further development of methods is needed to gain insight into muscle tissue-specific ageing and the underlying biological pathways.",

We studied a simpler model system, budding yeast, that lacks DNA methylation machinery making it a perfect model system to study the intrinsic role of DNA methylation in chromatin structure and function. We expressed the murine DNA methyltransferases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed the correlation between DNA methylation, nucleosome positioning, gene expression and 3D genome organization. Despite lacking the machinery for positioning and reading methylation marks, induced DNA methylation follows a conserved pattern with low methylation levels at the 5' end of the gene increasing gradually toward the 3' end, with concentration of methylated DNA in linkers and nucleosome free regions, and with actively expressed genes showing low and high levels of methylation at transcription start and terminating sites respectively, mimicking the patterns seen in mammals. We also see that DNA methylation increases chromatin condensation in peri-centromeric regions, decreases overall DNA flexibility, and favors the heterochromatin state. Taken together, these results demonstrate that methylation intrinsically modulates chromatin structure and function even in the absence of cellular machinery evolved to recognize and process the methylation signal.",

We performed a genome-wide analysis of circulating blood DNA CpG methylation using the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip on 124 blood samples from hospitalized COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients and compared these data with previously reported data from 39 healthy individuals collected before the pandemic. Prospective outcome measures such as COVID-19-GRAM risk-score and mortality were combined with methylation data.Global mean methylation levels did not differ between COVID-19 patients and healthy pre-pandemic controls. About 75% of acute illness-associated differentially methylated regions were located near gene promoter regions and were hypo-methylated in comparison with healthy pre-pandemic controls. Gene ontology analyses revealed terms associated with the immune response to viral infections and leukocyte activation; and disease ontology analyses revealed a predominance of autoimmune disorders. Among COVID-19-positive patients, worse outcomes were associated with a prevailing hyper-methylated status. Recursive feature elimination identified 77 differentially methylated positions predictive of COVID-19 severity measured by the GRAM-risk score.Our data contribute to the awareness that DNA methylation may influence the expression of genes that regulate COVID-19 progression and represent a targetable process in that setting.",

We compared DNA methylation levels with case/control status to identify novel genomic regions, both single CpG sites and differentially methylated regions (DMRs), while controlling for known DNA methylation changes associated with smoking using a previously described pack-years-based smoking methylation score. Stratification analyses were conducted over time from blood draw to diagnosis, histology, and smoking status.We identified 16 single CpG sites and 40 DMRs significantly associated with lung cancer risk (qÂ <Â 0.05). The identified genomic regions were associated with genes including H19, HOXA3/HOXA4, RUNX3, BRICD5, PLXNB2, and RP13.

Intake of these beverages is consistently linked to, among others, reduced risk of diabetes and liver diseases; however, the mechanisms of action remain elusive. Epigenetics is suggested as a mechanism mediating the effects of dietary and lifestyle factors on disease onset. Here we report the results from epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) on coffee and tea consumption in 15,789 participants of European and African-American ancestries from 15 cohorts. EWAS meta-analysis of coffee consumption reveals 11 CpGs surpassing the epigenome-wide significance threshold (P-value <1.1Ã—10-7), which annotated to the AHRR, F2RL3, FLJ43663, HDAC4, GFI1 and PHGDH genes. Among them, cg14476101 is significantly associated with expression of the PHGDH and risk of fatty liver disease. Knockdown of PHGDH expression in liver cells shows a correlation with expression levels of genes associated with circulating lipids, suggesting a role of PHGDH in hepatic-lipid metabolism. EWAS meta-analysis on tea consumption reveals no significant association, only two CpGs annotated to CACNA1A and PRDM16 genes show suggestive association (P-value <5.0Ã—10-6). These findings indicate that coffee-associated changes in DNA methylation levels may explain the mechanism of action of coffee consumption in conferring risk of diseases.",

Our aim was to identify DNA methylation sites associated with the risk of CVD and further investigate their potential predictive value in CVD development for high-risk subjects.We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify CpGs related to CVD development in a Chinese population.We adopted a nested case-control design based on data from China PEACE Million Persons Project. A total of 83 cases who developed CVD events during follow-up and 83 controls who were matched with cases by age, sex, BMI, ethnicity, medications treatment and behavior risk factors were included in the discovery stage. Genome-wide DNA methylation from whole blood was detected using Infinium Human Methylation EPIC Beadchip (850Â K). For significant CpGs [FDR(false discovery rate)â€‰<â€‰0.005], we further validated in an independent cohort including 38 cases and 38 controls.In discovery set, we identified 8 significant CpGs (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.005) associated with the risk of CVD after adjustment for cell components, demographic and cardiac risk factors and the first 5 principal components. Two of these identified CpGs (cg06901278 and cg09306458 in UACA) were replicated in another independent set (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Enrichment analysis in 787 individual genes from 1036 CpGs in discovery set revealed a significant enrichment for anatomical structure homeostasis as well as regulation of vesicle-mediated transport. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the model combined 8 CVD-related CpGs with baseline characteristics showed much better predictive effect for CVD occurrence compared with the model with baseline characteristics only [AUC (area under the curve)â€‰=â€‰0.967, 95% CI (0.942â€‰-â€‰0.991); AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.621, 95% CI (0.536â€‰-â€‰0.706); pâ€‰=â€‰9.716E-15].Our study identified the novel CpGs associated with CVD development and revealed their additional predictive power in the risk of CVD for high-risk subjects.",

However, it is unknown to what extent epigenetic mechanisms are associated with PTSD and its neurobiology in youth.In this study we combined a methylome-wide association study and structural neuroimaging measures in a Dutch cohort of youth with PTSD (ages 8-18 years). We aimed to replicate findings in a similar independent American cohort.We found significant methylome-wide associations for pediatric PTSD (FDR p <0.05) compared to non-PTSD control groups (traumatized and non-traumatized youth). Methylation differences on 9 genes were replicated, including genes related to glucocorticoid functioning. In both cohorts, methylation on OLFM3 gene was further associated with anterior hippocampal volume.These findings point to molecular pathways involved in inflammation, stress response, and neuroplasticity as potential contributors to neural abnormalities and provide potentially unique biomarkers and treatment targets for pediatric PTSD.Copyright Â© 2021.

Here, we present an analysis of sex differences in autosomal DNAme in the uncomplicated term placenta (n = 343) using the Illumina 450K array.At a false discovery rate < 0.05 and a mean sex difference in DNAme beta value of > 0.10, we identified 162 autosomal CpG sites that were differentially methylated by sex and replicated in an independent cohort of samples (n = 293). Several of these differentially methylated CpG sites were part of larger correlated regions of sex differential DNAme. Although global DNAme levels did not differ by sex, the majority of significantly differentially methylated CpGs were more highly methylated in male placentae, the opposite of what is seen in differential methylation analyses of somatic tissues. Patterns of autosomal DNAme at these 162 CpGs were significantly associated with maternal age (in males) and newborn birthweight standard deviation (in females).Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of sex differences in autosomal DNAme in the term human placenta. We report a list of high-confidence autosomal sex-associated differentially methylated CpGs and identify several key features of these loci that suggest their relevance to sex differences observed in normative and complicated pregnancies.",

Since DNA methylation has been implicated in the regulation of viral infections and the immune system, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify candidate loci regulated by this epigenetic mark that could be involved in the onset of COVID-19 in patients without comorbidities.

Methods: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 407 confirmed COVID-19 patients ? 61 years of age and without comorbidities, 194 (47.7%) of whom had mild symptomatology that did not involve hospitalization and 213 (52.3%) had a severe clinical course that required respiratory support. The set of cases was divided into discovery (n = 207) and validation (n = 200) cohorts, balanced for age and sex of individuals. We analysed the DNA methylation status of 850,000 CpG sites in these patients.

Findings: The DNA methylation status of 44 CpG sites was associated with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Of these loci, 23 (52.3%) were located in 20 annotated coding genes. These genes, such as the inflammasome component Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the Major Histocompatibility Complex, class I C (HLA-C) candidates, were mainly involved in the response of interferon to viral infection. We used the EWAS-identified sites to establish a DNA methylation signature (EPICOVID) that is associated with the severity of the disease.

Interpretation: We identified DNA methylation sites as epigenetic susceptibility loci for respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. These candidate biomarkers, combined with other clinical, cellular and genetic factors, could be useful in the clinical stratification and management of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2.",

Identifying trans-eQTLs is challenging because of small effect sizes, tissue specificity, and a severe multiple-testing burden. Tejaas predicts trans-eQTLs by performing L2-regularized ""reverse"" multiple regression of each SNP on all genes, aggregating evidence from many small trans-effects while being unaffected by the strong expression correlations. Combined with a novel unsupervised k-nearest neighbor method to remove confounders, Tejaas predicts 18851 unique trans-eQTLs across 49 tissues from GTEx. They are enriched in open chromatin, enhancers, and other regulatory regions. Many overlap with disease-associated SNPs, pointing to tissue-specific transcriptional regulation mechanisms.",

Although accuracy and efficiency are common goals in many modeling tasks, model interpretability is especially important to these studies towards understanding the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently gained popularity in various types of genomic and epigenomic studies due to their capabilities in utilizing large-scale high-throughput bioinformatics data and achieving high accuracy in predictions and classifications. However, DNNs are often challenged by their potential to explain the predictions due to their black-box nature. In this review, we present current development in the model interpretation of DNNs, focusing on their applications in genomics and epigenomics. We first describe state-of-the-art DNN interpretation methods in representative machine learning fields. We then summarize the DNN interpretation methods in recent studies on genomics and epigenomics, focusing on current data- and computing-intensive topics such as sequence motif identification, genetic variations, gene expression, chromatin interactions and non-coding RNAs. We also present the biological discoveries that resulted from these interpretation methods. We finally discuss the advantages and limitations of current interpretation approaches in the context of genomic and epigenomic studies.

We integrated genotype, gene expression, alternative splicing and DNA methylation profiles of up to 430 human kidneys to characterize the effects of BP index variants from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on renal transcriptome and epigenome. We uncovered kidney targets for 479 (58.3%) BP-GWAS variants and paired 49 BP-GWAS kidney genes with 210 licensed drugs. Our colocalization and Mendelian randomization analyses identified 179 unique kidney genes with evidence of putatively causal effects on BP.

However, the molecular determinants of interindividual differences in baseline (intrinsic) VO2max, and of increases of VO2max in response to exercise training (Î”VO2max), are largely unknown. Here, we measure ~5,000 plasma proteins using an affinity-based platform in over 650 sedentary adults before and after a 20-week endurance-exercise intervention and identify 147 proteins and 102 proteins whose plasma levels are associated with baseline VO2max and Î”VO2max, respectively. Addition of a protein biomarker score derived from these proteins to a score based on clinical traits improves the prediction of an individual's Î”VO2max. We validate findings in a separate exercise cohort, further link 21 proteins to incident all-cause mortality in a community-based cohort and reproduce the specificity of ~75% of our key findings using antibody-based assays.

The pathogenesis of MetS is not entirely clear and the use of molecular level data could help uncover common pathogenic pathways behind the observed clustering.Using a highly multiplexed aptamer-based affinity proteomics platform, we examined associations between plasma proteins and prevalent and incident MetS in the KORA cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰998) and replicated our results for prevalent MetS in the HUNT3 study (nâ€‰=â€‰923). We applied logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and physical activity. We used the bootstrap ranking algorithm of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to select a predictive model from the incident MetS associated proteins and used area under the curve (AUC) to assess its performance. Finally, we investigated the causal effect of the replicated proteins on MetS using two-sample Mendelian randomization.Prevalent MetS was associated with 116 proteins, of which 53 replicated in HUNT. These included previously reported proteins like leptin, and new proteins like NTR domain-containing protein 2 and endoplasmic reticulum protein 29. Incident MetS was associated with 14 proteins in KORA, of which 13 overlap the prevalent MetS associated proteins with soluble advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptor (sRAGE) being unique to incident MetS. The LASSO selected an eight-protein predictive model with an (AUCâ€‰=â€‰0.75; 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰0.71-0.79) in KORA.

We analyze several thousand plasma proteins longitudinally in 306 COVID-19 patients and 78 symptomatic controls, uncovering immune and non-immune proteins linked to COVID-19. Deconvolution of our plasma proteome data using published scRNA-seq datasets reveals contributions from circulating immune and tissue cells. Sixteen percent of patients display reduced inflammation yet comparably poor outcomes. Comparison of patients who died to severely ill survivors identifies dynamic immune-cell-derived and tissue-associated proteins associated with survival, including exocrine pancreatic proteases. Using derived tissue-specific and cell-type-specific intracellular death signatures, cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, and our data, we infer whether organ damage resulted from direct or indirect effects of infection.

Translating these risk variants into mechanistic insights requires detailed maps of gene regulation in disease-relevant cell types2. Here we combined two approaches: a genome-wide association study of type 1 diabetes (T1D) using 520,580 samples, and the identification of candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in pancreas and peripheral blood mononuclear cells using single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC-seq) of 131,554 nuclei. Risk variants for T1D were enriched in cCREs that were active in T cells and other cell types, including acinar and ductal cells of the exocrine pancreas. Risk variants at multiple T1D signals overlapped with exocrine-specific cCREs that were linked to genes with exocrine-specific expression. At the CFTR locus, theÂ T1D risk variant rs7795896 mapped to a ductal-specific cCRE that regulated CFTR; the risk allele reduced transcription factor binding, enhancer activity and CFTR expression in ductal cells. These findings support a role for the exocrine pancreas in the pathogenesis of T1D and highlight the power of large-scale genome-wide association studies and single-cell epigenomics for understanding the cellular origins of complex disease.",

Many of these loci are enriched in cis-regulatory elements (CREs) but not linked to cardiometabolic risk factors nor to candidate causal genes, complicating their functional interpretation. Objective: Single nucleus chromatin accessibility profiling of the human atherosclerotic lesions was used to investigate cell type-specific patterns of CREs, to understand transcription factors establishing cell identity and to interpret CAD-relevant, non-coding genetic variation. Methods and Results: We used single nucleus ATAC-seq to generate DNA accessibility maps in > 7,000 cells derived from human atherosclerotic lesions. We identified five major lesional cell types including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocyte/macrophages, NK/T-cells and B-cells and further investigated subtype characteristics of macrophages and smooth muscle cells transitioning into fibromyocytes. We demonstrated that CAD associated genetic variants are particularly enriched in endothelial and smooth muscle cell-specific open chromatin. Using single cell co-accessibility and cis-eQTL information, we prioritized putative target genes and candidate regulatory elements for ~30% of all known CAD loci. Finally, we performed genome-wide experimental fine-mapping of the CAD GWAS variants using epigenetic QTL analysis in primary human aortic endothelial cells and STARR-Seq massively parallel reporter assay in smooth muscle cells. This analysis identified potential causal SNP(s) and the associated target gene for over 30 CAD loci. We present several examples where the chromatin accessibility and gene expression could be assigned to one cell type predicting the cell type of action for CAD loci. Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential of applying snATAC-seq to human tissues in revealing relative contributions of distinct cell types to diseases and in identifying genes likely to be influenced by non-coding GWAS variants.",
No,20210628,dnam age,34162876,Environmental enrichment preserves a young DNA methylation landscape in the aged mouse hippocampus.,Nat Commun,"The decline of brain function during aging is associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation. Lifestyle interventions can improve brain function during aging, but their influence on age-related epigenetic changes is unknown. Using genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing, we here show that experiencing a stimulus-rich environment counteracts age-related DNA methylation changes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of mice. Specifically, environmental enrichment prevented the aging-induced CpG hypomethylation at target sites of the methyl-CpG-binding protein Mecp2, which is critical to neuronal function. The genes at which environmental enrichment counteracted aging effects have described roles in neuronal plasticity, neuronal cell communication and adult hippocampal neurogenesis and are dysregulated with age-related cognitive decline in the human brain. Our results highlight the stimulating effects of environmental enrichment on hippocampal plasticity at the level of DNA methylation and give molecular insights into the specific aspects of brain aging that can be counteracted by lifestyle interventions.",

It has been suggested that these clocks are useable markers of biological aging and premature mortality. Because genetic factors explain variations in both epigenetic aging and mortality, this association could also be explained by shared genetic factors. We investigated the influence of genetic and lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, chronic diseases, body mass index) and education on the association of accelerated epigenetic aging with mortality using a longitudinal twin design. Utilizing a publicly available online tool, we calculated the epigenetic age using two epigenetic clocks, Horvath DNAmAge and DNAm GrimAge, in 413 Finnish twin sisters, aged 63-76Â years, at the beginning of the 18-year mortality follow-up. Epigenetic age acceleration was calculated as the residuals from a linear regression model of epigenetic age estimated on chronological age (AAHorvath, AAGrimAge, respectively). Cox proportional hazard models were conducted for individuals and twin pairs.The results of the individual-based analyses showed an increased mortality hazard ratio (HR) of 1.31 (CI95: 1.13-1.53) per one standard deviation (SD) increase in AAGrimAge. The results indicated no significant associations of AAHorvathwith mortality. Pairwise mortality analyses showed an HR of 1.50 (CI95: 1.02-2.20) per 1 SD increase in AAGrimAge. However, after adjusting for smoking, the HR attenuated substantially and was statistically non-significant (1.29; CI95: 0.84-1.99). Similarly, in multivariable adjusted models the HR (1.42-1.49) was non-significant. In AAHorvath, the non-significant HRs were lower among monozygotic pairs in comparison to dizygotic pairs, while in AAGrimAgethere were no systematic differences by zygosity. Further, the pairwise analysis in quartiles showed that the increased within pair difference in AAGrimAgewas associated with a higher all-cause mortality risk.In conclusion, the findings suggest that DNAm GrimAge is a strong predictor of mortality independent of genetic influences. Smoking, which is known to alter DNAm levels and is built into the DNAm GrimAge algorithm, attenuated the association between epigenetic aging and mortality risk.",

Several studies have linked DNAmAA to morbidity and mortality, yet its relationship with kidney function has not been assessed. We evaluated the associations between seven DNAm aging and lifespan predictors (as well as GrimAge components) and five kidney traits (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [uACR], serum urate, microalbuminuria and chronic kidney disease [CKD]) in up to 9688 European, African American and Hispanic/Latino individuals from seven population-based studies.We identified 23 significant associations in our large trans-ethnic meta-analysis (pâ€‰<â€‰1.43E-03 and consistent direction of effect across studies). Age acceleration measured by the Extrinsic and PhenoAge estimators, as well as Zhang's 10-CpG epigenetic mortality risk score (MRS), were associated with all parameters of poor kidney health (lower eGFR, prevalent CKD, higher uACR, microalbuminuria and higher serum urate). Six of these associations were independently observed in European and African American populations. MRS in particular was consistently associated with eGFR (Î²â€‰=â€‰â€‰-â€‰0.12, 95% CIâ€‰=â€‰[-â€‰0.16,â€‰-â€‰0.08] change in log-transformed eGFR per unit increase in MRS, pâ€‰=â€‰4.39E-08), prevalent CKD (odds ratio (OR)â€‰=â€‰1.78 [1.47, 2.16], p = 2.71E-09) and higher serum urate levels (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.12 [0.07, 0.16], pâ€‰=â€‰2.08E-06). The ""first-generation"" clocks (Hannum, Horvath) and GrimAge showed different patterns of association with the kidney traits. Three of the DNAm-estimated components of GrimAge, namely adrenomedullin, plasminogen-activation inhibition 1 and pack years, were positively associated with higher uACR, serum urate and microalbuminuria.DNAmAge acceleration and DNAm mortality predictors estimated in whole blood were associated with multiple kidney traits, including eGFR and CKD, in this multi-ethnic study. Epigenetic biomarkers which reflect the systemic effects of age-related mechanisms such as immunosenescence, inflammaging and oxidative stress may have important mechanistic or prognostic roles in kidney disease. Our study highlights new findings linking kidney disease to biological aging, and opportunities warranting future investigation into DNA methylation biomarkers for prognostic or risk stratification in kidney disease.",

To simplify the analysis, we used a log-linear mortality estimate from the CBC variables as a single quantitative measure of theÂ aging process, henceforth referred to as dynamic organism state indicator (DOSI). We observed, that the age-dependent population DOSI distribution broadening could be explained by a progressive loss of physiological resilience measured by the DOSI auto-correlation time. Extrapolation of this trend suggested that DOSI recovery time and variance would simultaneously diverge at a critical point of 120â€‰-â€‰150 years of age corresponding to a complete loss of resilience. The observation was immediately confirmed by the independent analysis of correlation properties of intraday physical activity levels fluctuations collected by wearable devices. We conclude that the criticality resulting in the end of life is an intrinsic biological property of an organism that is independent of stress factors and signifies a fundamental or absolute limit of human lifespan.",

The objective of this study was to identify methylation differences in NETs and consider how the differentially methylated genes may impact patient survival. Genome-wide methylation and chromosomal copy number variation (CNV) of NETs from the small intestine and appendix were measured. Tumors were divided into three molecular subtypes according to CNV results: chromosome 18 loss (18LOH), Multiple CNV, and No CNV. Comparison of 18LOH tumors with MultiCNV and NoCNV tumors identified 901 differentially methylated genes. Genes from the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways are statistically overrepresented in the differentially methylated genes. One of the highlighted genes from the GPCR pathway is somatostatin (SST), a clinical target for NETs. Patient survival based on low versus high methylation in all samples identified four significant genes (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) OR2S2, SMILR, RNU6-653P, and AC010543.1. Within the 18LOH molecular subtype tumors, survival differences were identified in high versus low methylation of 24 genes. The most significant is TRHR (pâ€‰<â€‰0.01), a GPCR with multiple FDA-approved drugs. By separating NETs into different molecular subtypes based on chromosomal changes, we find that multiple GPCRs and their ligands appear to be regulated through methylation and correlated with survival. These results suggest opportunities for better treatment strategies for NETs based on molecular features.",

Here, we studied MT-CN variation in blood-derived DNA from 19184 Finnish individuals using a combination of genome (N = 4163) and exome sequencing (N = 19034) data as well as imputed genotypes (N = 17718).We identified two loci significantly associated with MT-CN variation: a common variant at the MYB-HBS1L locus (P = 1.6 Ã— 10-8), which has previously been associated with numerous hematological parameters; and a burden of rare variants in the TMBIM1 gene (P = 3.0 Ã— 10-8), which has been reported to protect against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We also found that MT-CN is strongly associated with insulin levels (P = 2.0 Ã— 10-21) and other metabolic syndrome (metS)-related traits. Using a Mendelian randomization framework, we show evidence that MT-CN measured in blood is causally related to insulin levels. We then applied an MT-CN polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from Finnish data to the UK Biobank, where the association between the PRS and metS traits was replicated. Adjusting for cell counts largely eliminated these signals, suggesting that MT-CN affects metS via cell-type composition.These results suggest that measurements of MT-CN in blood-derived DNA partially reflect differences in cell-type composition and that these differences are causally linked to insulin and related traits.",

Due to the lack of accurate markers of disease progression, many women with detected DCIS are currently overtreated. To distinguish those DCIS cases who are likely to require therapy from those who should be left untreated, there is a need for robust and predictive biomarkers extracted from molecular or genetic profiles. We developed a supervised machine learning approach that implements multi-omics feature selection and model regularization for the identification of biomarker combinations that could be used to distinguish low-risk DCIS lesions from those with a higher likelihood of progression. To investigate the genetic heterogeneity of disease progression, we applied this approach to 40 pure DCIS and 259 invasive breast cancer (IBC) samples profiled with genome-wide transcriptomics, DNA methylation, and DNA copy number variation. Feature selection using the multi-omics Lasso-regularized algorithm identified both known genes involved in breast cancer development, as well as novel markers for early detection. Even though the gene expression-based model features led to the highest classification accuracy alone, methylation data provided a complementary source of features and improved especially the sensitivity of correctly classifying DCIS cases. We also identified a number of repeatedly misclassified DCIS cases when using either the expression or methylation markers. A small panel of 10 gene markers was able to distinguish DCIS and IBC cases with high accuracy in nested cross-validation (AU-ROC = 0.99). The marker panel was not specific to any of the established breast cancer subtypes, suggesting that the 10-gene signature may provide a subtype-agnostic and cost-effective approach for breast cancer detection and patient stratification. We further confirmed high accuracy of the 10-gene signature in an external validation cohort (AU-ROC = 0.95), profiled using distinct transcriptomic assay, hence demonstrating robustness of the risk signature.Copyright Â© 2021 Xu, Lien, Bergholtz, Fleischer, Djerroudi, Vincent-Salomon, SÃ¸rlie and Aittokallio.",

This study leveraged imputed gene expression in TRD to perform a drug repurposing analysis. Among those with MDD, we defined TRD as having at least two antidepressant switches according to primary care records in UK Biobank (UKB). We performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of TRD (nâ€‰=â€‰2165) vs healthy controls (nâ€‰=â€‰11,188) using FUSION and gene expression levels from 21 tissues. We identified compounds with opposite gene expression signatures (ConnectivityMap data) compared to our TWAS results using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Spearman and Pearson correlation. As symptom patterns are routinely assessed in clinical practice and could be used to provide targeted treatments, we identified MDD subtypes associated with TRD in UKB and analysed them using the same pipeline described for TRD. Anxious MDD (nâ€‰=â€‰14,954) and MDD with weight gain (nâ€‰=â€‰4697) were associated with TRD. In the TWAS, two genes were significantly dysregulated (TMEM106B and ATP2A1 for anxious and weight gain MDD, respectively). A muscarinic receptor antagonist was identified as top candidate for repurposing in TRD; inhibition of heat shock protein 90 was the main mechanism of action identified for anxious MDD, while modulators of metabolism such as troglitazone showed promising results for MDD with weight gain. This was the first TWAS of TRD and associated MDD subtypes. Our results shed light on possible pharmacological approaches in individuals with difficult-to-treat depression.",

Conditioning on sample availability can cause selection bias if sample availability is nonrandom. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) is purported to reduce this bias. We evaluated IPW in an epigenome-wide analysis testing the association between DNA methylation (261,435 probes) and age in healthy adolescent subjects (nâ€‰=â€‰114). We simulated age and sex to be correlated with sample selection and then evaluated four conditions: complete population/no selection bias (all subjects), naÃ¯ve selection bias (no adjustment), and IPW selection bias (selection bias with IPW adjustment). Assuming the complete population condition represented the ""truth,"" we compared each condition to the complete population condition. Bias or difference in associations between age and methylation was reduced in the IPW condition versus the naÃ¯ve condition. However, genomic inflation and type 1 error were higher in the IPW condition relative to the naÃ¯ve condition. Postadjustment using bacon, type 1 error and inflation were similar across all conditions. Power was higher under the IPW condition compared with the naÃ¯ve condition before and after inflation adjustment. IPW methods can reduce bias in genome-wide analyses. Genomic inflation is a potential concern that can be minimized using methods that adjust for inflation.Â© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",

A key target of genetic and prenatal environmental factors is the epigenome of the placenta, an organ that is implicated in fetal growth and diseases in later life. This study had two aims: 1) to identify and functionally characterize placental variably methylated regions (VMRs), which are regions in the epigenome with high interindividual methylation variability; 2) to investigate the contributions of fetal genetic loci and 12 prenatal environmental factors (maternal psychosocial-, cardiometabolic-, demographic-, and obstetric- related) on methylation at each VMR. Akaike's information criterion was used to select the best model out of four models (prenatal environment only, genotype only, additive effect of genotype and prenatal environment [Gâ€‰+â€‰E], and their interaction effect [GxE]). We identified 5850 VMRs in placenta. Methylation at 70% of VMRs was best explained by GxE followed by genotype only (17.7%), and Gâ€‰+â€‰E (12.3%). Prenatal environment alone best explained only 0.03% of VMRs. We observed that 95.4% of GxE models and 93.9% of Gâ€‰+â€‰E models included maternal age, parity, delivery mode, maternal depression, or gestational weight gain. VMR methylation sites and their regulatory genetic variants were enriched (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) for genomic regions that have known links with regulatory functions and complex traits. This study provided a genome-wide catalog of VMRs in placenta and highlighted that variation in placental DNA methylation at loci with regulatory and trait relevance is best elucidated by integrating genetic and prenatal environmental factors, and rarely by environmental factors alone.Published by Oxford University Press 2021.",

We assessed two hypotheses. First, we tested for shared maternal and offspring epigenetic effects resulting from GDM exposure. Second, we tested whether GDM exposure and maternal methylation had an epigenetic effect on the offspring.We did not find any epigenetic marks (differentially methylated CpG probes) with shared and consistent effects between mothers and offspring. After including maternal methylation in the model, we identified a single significant (false discovery rate 1.38 Ã— 10-2) CpG at the cg22790973 probe (TFCP2)associated with GDM. We identified seven additional FDR-significant interactions of maternal methylation and GDM status, with the strongest association at the same cg22790973 probe (TFCP2), as well as cg03456133, cg24440941 (H3C6), cg20002843 (LOC127841), cg19107264, and cg11493553 located within theUBE3Cgene and cg17065901 inFAM13A,both susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes and BMI, and cg23355087 within theDLGAP2gene, known to be involved in insulin resistance during pregnancy.Our study reveals the potential complexity of the epigenetic transmission between mothers with GDM and their offspring, likely determined by not only GDM exposure but also other factors indicated by maternal epigenetic status, such as maternal metabolic history.Â© 2021 by the American Diabetes Association.",

However, the role of epigenetic signatures in setting newborn TL and early life telomere dynamics is unknown. In the present study, based on 247 participating newborns from the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort, whole-genome DNA methylation, profiled on the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip microarray, and TL were measured in cord blood. In a follow-up visit at a mean age of 4.58 years, leukocyte TL was evaluated. We combined an epigenome-wide association study and a statistical learning method with re-sampling to select CpGs and their two-way interactions to model baseline (cord blood) TL and early-life telomere attrition rate, where distinct epigenetic signatures were identified for the two outcomes. In addition, a stronger epigenetic regulation was suggested in setting newborn TL than that of telomere dynamics in early life: 47 CpGs and 7 between-CpG interactions explained 76% of the variance in baseline TLs, while 72% of the total variance in telomere attrition rate was explained by 31 CpGs and 5 interactions. Functional enrichment analysis based on the selected CpGs in the two models revealed GLUT4 translocation and immune cell signaling pathways, respectively. These CpGs and interactions, as well as the cellular pathways, are potential novel targets of further investigation of telomere biology and aging.",

While epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as a means of embedding this environmental risk factor, little is known about its timing and trajectory, especially in very young children. It is also not clear whether additional environmental adversities, often experienced by these children, converge on similar DNAm changes. Here, we calculated a cumulative adversity score, which additionally to CM includes socioeconomic status (SES), other life events, parental psychopathology and epigenetic biomarkers of prenatal smoking and alcohol consumption. We investigated the effects of CM alone as well as the adversity score on longitudinal DNAm trajectories in the Berlin Longitudinal Child Study. This is a cohort of 173 children aged 3-5 years at baseline of whom 86 were exposed to CM. These children were followed-up for 2 years with extensive psychometric and biological assessments as well as saliva collection at 5 time points providing genome-wide DNAm levels. Overall, only a few DNAm patterns were stable over this timeframe, but less than 10 DNAm regions showed significant changes. At baseline, neither CM nor the adversity score associated with DNAm changes. However, in 6 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), CM and the adversity score significantly moderated DNAm trajectories over time. A number of these DMRs have previously been associated with adverse prenatal exposures. In our study, children exposed to CM also presented with epigenetic signatures indicative of increased prenatal exposure to tobacco and alcohol, as compared to non-CM exposed children. These epigenetic signatures of prenatal exposure strongly correlate with DNAm regions associated with CM and the adversity score. Finally, weighted correlation network analysis revealed a module of CpGs exclusively associated with CM. While our study identifies DNAm loci specifically associated with CM, especially within long non-coding RNAs, the majority of associations were found with the adversity score with convergent association with indicators of adverse prenatal exposures. This study highlights the importance of mapping not only of the epigenome but also the exposome and extending the observational timeframe to well before birth.Â© 2021 The Authors.",

Mammographic density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer. However, no studies to date have identified an epigenetic signature of mammographic density. We performed an epigenome-wide association study of mammographic density.Methods:White blood cell DNA methylation was measured for 385 postmenopausal women using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Differential methylation was assessed using genome-wide, probe-level, and regional analyses. We implemented a resampling-based approach to improve the stability of our findings.Results:On average, women with elevated mammographic density exhibited DNA hypermethylation within CpG islands and gene promoters compared to women with lower mammographic density. We identified 250 CpG sites for which DNA methylation was significantly associated with mammographic density. The top sites were located within genes associated with cancer, includingHDLBP, TGFB2, CCT4, andPAX8, and were more likely to be located in regulatory regions of the genome. We also identified differential DNA methylation in 37 regions, including within the promoters ofPAX8andPF4, a gene involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. Overall, our results paint a picture of epigenetic dysregulation associated with mammographic density.Conclusion:Mammographic density is associated with differential DNA methylation throughout the genome, including within genes associated with cancer. Our results suggest the potential involvement of several genes in the biological mechanisms behind differences in breast density between women. Further studies are warranted to explore these potential mechanisms and potential links to breast cancer risk.",

We investigated whether DNA methylation patterns differ between high- vs. low-MBD women who developed BC during an 8.9-year median follow-up in the Florence section of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.We analysed 96 pairs of women with BC arising on high- vs. low-MBD breasts (BI-RADS category III-IV vs. I). DNA methylation was determined on pre-diagnostic blood samples using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip assay. The statistical analysis was conducted by performing an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), by searching differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in gene promoters (followed by functional enrichment and gene annotation analysis); and through a ""candidate pathways"" approach focusing on pre-defined inflammation-related pathways.In EWAS, no single CpG site was differentially methylated between high- and low-MBD women after correction for multiple testing. A total of 140 DMRs were identified, of which 131 were hyper- and 9 hypo-methylated amongst high-MBD women. These DMRs encompassed an annotation cluster of 35 genes coding for proteins implicated in transcription regulation and DNA binding. The ""apoptosis signalling"" was the only inflammation-related candidate pathway differentially methylated between high- and low-MBD women.Pre-diagnostic methylation patterns differ between high- vs. low-MBD women who subsequently develop BC, particularly, in genes involved in the regulation of DNA transcription and cell apoptosis.

We also performed subset analyses at CRP levels â‰¤10â€‰mg/L and replication analyses on candidate probes. Finally, we assessed for biological relevance of our findings in public databases. We subsequently identified 14 novel DMPs associated with CRP. In post-hoc evaluations, we found that DMPs in PC, BTG4 and PADI1 showed trends of associations with estimated CVD risk, we identified a separate DMP in MORC2 that was associated with CRP levels â‰¤10â€‰mg/L, and we successfully replicated 65 (24%) of previously reported DMPs.

We identified 60 studies that report associations between DNA methylation (DNAm) and human brain structure/function. Forty-three studies measured candidate loci DNAm; seventeen measured epigenome-wide DNAm. MRI features included region-of-interest and whole-brain structural, diffusion and functional imaging features. The studies report DNAm-MRI associations for: neurodevelopment and neurodevelopmental disorders; major depression and suicidality; alcohol use disorder; schizophrenia and psychosis; ageing, stroke, ataxia and neurodegeneration; post-traumatic stress disorder; and socio-emotional processing. Consistency between MRI features and differential DNAm is modest. Sources of bias: variable inclusion of comparator groups; different surrogate tissues used; variation in DNAm measurement methods; lack of control for genotype and cell-type composition; and variations in image processing. Knowledge of MRI features associated with differential DNAm may improve understanding of the role of DNAm in brain health and disease, but caution is required because conventions for linking DNAm and MRI data are not established, and clinical and methodological heterogeneity in existing literature is substantial.",

A few studies of small sample sizes have revealed associations between blood DNA methylation and neuropsychopathology, however, large-scale epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) are needed to investigate the utility of DNA methylation profiling as a peripheral marker for the brain. Here, in an analysis of eleven international cohorts, totalling 3337 individuals, we report epigenome-wide meta-analyses of blood DNA methylation with volumes of the hippocampus, thalamus and nucleus accumbens (NAcc)-three subcortical regions selected for their associations with disease and heritability and volumetric variability. Analyses of individual CpGs revealed genome-wide significant associations with hippocampal volume at two loci. No significant associations were found for analyses of thalamus and nucleus accumbens volumes. Cluster-based analyses revealed additional differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with hippocampal volume. DNA methylation at these loci affected expression of proximal genes involved in learning and memory, stem cell maintenance and differentiation, fatty acid metabolism and type-2 diabetes.

As these samples contain a mix of white blood cells and buccal epithelial cells that can vary within a population, this cellular heterogeneity may confound EWAS. This has been addressed by including cellular heterogeneity obtained through cytology at the time of collection or by using cellular deconvolution algorithms built on epigenetic data from specific cell types. However, to our knowledge, the two methods have not yet been compared. Here we show that the two methods are highly correlated in saliva and buccal samples (RÂ =Â 0.84, P <Â 0.0001) by comparing data generated from cytological staining and Infinium MethylationEPIC arrays and the EpiDISH deconvolution algorithm from buccal and saliva samples collected from twenty adults. In addition, by using an expanded dataset from both sample types, we confirmed our previous finding that age has strong, non-linear negative correlation with epithelial cell proportion in both sample types.

However, it is unknown how well they capture age-associated processes, particularly given that pluripotent cells are only present during the earliest stages of mammalian development. Epigenetic clocks utilize coordinated age-associated changes in DNA methylation to make predictions that correlate strongly with chronological age. It has been shown that the induction of pluripotency rejuvenates predicted epigenetic age. As existing clocks are not optimized for the study of brain development, we developed the fetal brain clock (FBC), a bespoke epigenetic clock trained in human prenatal brain samples in order to investigate more precisely the epigenetic age of iPSCs and iPSC-neurons. The FBC was tested in two independent validation cohorts across a total of 194 samples, confirming that the FBC outperforms other established epigenetic clocks in fetal brain cohorts. We applied the FBC to DNA methylation data from iPSCs and embryonic stem cells and their derived neuronal precursor cells and neurons, finding that these cell types are epigenetically characterized as having an early fetal age. Furthermore, while differentiation from iPSCs to neurons significantly increases epigenetic age, iPSC-neurons are still predicted as being fetal. Together our findings reiterate the need to better understand the limitations of existing epigenetic clocks for answering biological research questions and highlight a limitation of iPSC-neurons as a cellular model of age-related diseases.",

This is in part due to the incomplete information that we have on transcription factors, their DNA-binding motifs and which genomic binding sites are functional in any given cell type3-5. In addition, there are orphan motifs without known binders, such as the CGCG element, which is associated with highly expressed genes across human tissues and enriched near the transcription start site of a subset of CGI promoters6-8. Here we combine single-molecule footprinting with interaction proteomics to identify BTG3-associated nuclear protein (BANP) as the transcription factor that binds this element in the mouse and human genome. We show that BANP is a strong CGI activator that controls essential metabolic genes in pluripotent stem and terminally differentiated neuronal cells. BANP binding is repelled by DNA methylation of its motif in vitro and in vivo, which epigenetically restricts most binding to CGIs and accounts for differential binding at aberrantly methylated CGI promoters in cancer cells. Upon binding to an unmethylated motif, BANP opens chromatin and phases nucleosomes. These findings establish BANP as a critical activator of a set of essential genes and suggest a model in which the activity of CGI promoters relies on methylation-sensitive transcription factors that are capable of chromatin opening.",

Here, we sought to identify DNA methylation changes associated with ageing in the Y and X chromosomes, by utilizing datasets available in data repositories, comprising in total of 1240 males and 1191 females, aged 14-92Â years.In total, we identified 46 age-associated CpG sites in the male Y, 1327 age-associated CpG sites in the male X, and 325 age-associated CpG sites in the female X. The X chromosomal age-associated CpGs showed significant overlap between females and males, with 122 CpGs identified as age-associated in both sexes. Age-associated X chromosomal CpGs in both sexes were enriched in CpG islands and depleted from gene bodies and showed no strong trend towards hypermethylation nor hypomethylation. In contrast, the Y chromosomal age-associated CpGs were enriched in gene bodies, and showed a clear trend towards hypermethylation with age.Significant overlap in X chromosomal age-associated CpGs identified in males and females and their shared features suggest that despite the uneven chromosomal dosage, differences in ageing-associated DNA methylation changes in the X chromosome are unlikely to be a major contributor of sex dimorphism in ageing. While age-associated CpGs showed good replication across datasets in the present study, only a limited set of previously reported age-associated CpGs were replicated. One contributor to the limited overlap are differences in the age range of individuals included in each data set.

Approximately one-third of 5hmC peaks are tissue-specific differentially-hydroxymethylated regions (tsDhMRs), which are deposited in regions that potentially regulate the expression of nearby tissue-specific functional genes. In addition, tsDhMRs are enriched with tissue-specific transcription factors and may rewire tissue-specific gene expression networks. Moreover, tsDhMRs are associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified by genome-wide association studies and are linked to tissue-specific phenotypes and diseases. Collectively, our results show the tissue-specific 5hmC landscape of the human genome and demonstrate that 5hmC serves as a fundamental regulatory element affecting tissue-specific gene expression programs and functions.Â© 2021.

No,20210726,methods,34256818,2dFDR: a new approach to confounder adjustment substantially increases detection power in omics association studies.,Genome Biol,"One challenge facing omics association studies is the loss of statistical power when adjusting for confounders and multiple testing. The traditional statistical procedure involves fitting a confounder-adjusted regression model for each omics feature, followed by multiple testing correction. Here we show that the traditional procedure is not optimal and present a new approach, 2dFDR, a two-dimensional false discovery rate control procedure, for powerful confounder adjustment in multiple testing. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that 2dFDR is more powerful than the traditional procedure, and in the presence of strong confounding and weak signals, the power improvement could be more than 100%.Â© 2021.

The proportion of six major leukocyte subtypes can be estimated using epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) data from stored blood samples. Whether the composition of circulating leukocytes can be used as a prognostic factor is unclear. DNAm-based leukocyte proportions were obtained from a prospective cohort of 2206 CRC patients. Multivariate Cox regression models and survival curves were applied to assess associations between leukocyte composition and survival outcomes. A higher proportion of lymphocytes, including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells, was associated with better survival, while a higher proportion of neutrophils was associated with poorer survival. CD4+ T cells outperformed other leukocytes in estimating the patients' prognosis. Comparing the highest quantile to the lowest quantile of CD4+ T cells, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of all-cause and CRC-specific mortality were 0.59 (0.48, 0.72) and 0.59 (0.45, 0.77), respectively. Furthermore, the association of CD4+ T cells and prognosis was stronger among patients with early or intermediate CRC or patients with colon cancer. In conclusion, the composition of circulating leukocytes estimated from DNAm, particularly the proportions of CD4+ T cells, could be used as promising independent predictors of CRC survival.",

Moreover, major depression is associated with poor outcomes following mTBI; however, the underlying biological mechanisms of this are largely unknown. Recently, genomic and epigenetic factors have been increasingly implicated in the recovery following TBI.This study leveraged DNA methylation within the major depression pathway, along with demographic and behavior measures (features used in the clinical model) to predict post-concussive symptom burden and quality of life four-month post-injury in a cohort of 110 pediatric mTBI patients and 87 age-matched healthy controls. The results demonstrated that including DNA methylation markers in the major depression pathway improved the prediction accuracy for quality of life but not persistent post-concussive symptom burden. Specifically, the prediction accuracy (i.e., the correlation between the predicted value and observed value) of quality of life was improved from 0.59 (pâ€‰=â€‰1.20â€‰Ã—â€‰10-3) (clinical model) to 0.71 (pâ€‰=â€‰3.89â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5); the identified cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites were mainly in the open sea regions and the mapped genes were related to TBI in several molecular studies. Moreover, depression symptoms were a strong predictor (with large weights) for both post-concussive symptom burden and pediatric quality of life.This study emphasized that both molecular and behavioral manifestations of depression symptoms played a prominent role in predicting the recovery process following pediatric mTBI, suggesting the urgent need to further study TBI-caused depression symptoms for better recovery outcome.Â© 2021.

However, the role of DNA methylation in CVD etiology remains unclear.We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on CVD in a longitudinal sample of Swedish twins (535 individuals). We selected CpGs reaching the Bonferroni-corrected significance level (2Â [Formula: see text]Â 10-7) or the top-ranked 20 CpGs with the lowest P values if they did not reach this significance level in EWAS analysis associated with non-stroke CVD, overall stroke, and ischemic stroke, respectively. We further applied a bivariate autoregressive latent trajectory model with structured residuals (ALT-SR) to evaluate the cross-lagged effect between DNA methylation of these CpGs and cardiometabolic traits (blood lipids, blood pressure, and body mass index). Furthermore, mediation analysis was performed to evaluate whether the cross-lagged effects had causal impacts on CVD. In the EWAS models, none of the CpGs we selected reached the Bonferroni-corrected significance level. The ALT-SR model showed that DNA methylation levels were more likely to predict the subsequent level of cardiometabolic traits rather than the other way around (numbers of significant cross-lagged paths of methylationâ€‰â†’â€‰trait/traitâ€‰â†’â€‰methylation were 84/4, 45/6, 66/1 for the identified three CpG sets, respectively). Finally, we demonstrated significant indirect effects from DNA methylation on CVD mediated by cardiometabolic traits.We present evidence for a directional association from DNA methylation on cardiometabolic traits and CVD, rather than the opposite, highlighting the role of epigenetics in CVD development.",

Although neonatal DNA methylation (DNAm) has been found to prospectively associate with a range of psychological traits in childhood, its potential role in prosocial development has yet to be investigated. This study investigated prospective associations between cord blood DNAm at birth and low prosocial behavior within and across four longitudinal birth cohorts from the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium. We examined (a) developmental trajectories of ""chronic-low"" versus ""typical"" prosocial behavior across childhood in a case-control design (NÂ =Â 2,095), and (b) continuous ""low prosocial"" scores at comparable cross-cohort time-points (NÂ =Â 2,121). Meta-analyses were performed to examine differentially methylated positions and regions. At the cohort-specific level, three CpGs were found to associate with chronic low prosocial behavior; however, none of these associations was replicated in another cohort. Meta-analysis revealed no epigenome-wide significant CpGs or regions. Overall, we found no evidence for associations between DNAm patterns at birth and low prosocial behavior across childhood. Findings highlight the importance of employing multi-cohort approaches to replicate epigenetic associations and reduce the risk of false positive discoveries.Â© 2021 The Authors.

However, an important limitation of conventional EWAS is that profiles of epigenetic variability are often obtained in samples of mixed cell types. Here, we aim to assess whether changes in cord blood DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) exposure and early childhood growth markers occur in a cell type-specific manner.We analyzed 275 cord blood samples collected at delivery from a prospective pre-birth cohort with genome-wide DNAm profiled by the Illumina MethylationEPIC array. We estimated proportions of seven common cell types in each sample using a cord blood-specific DNAm reference panel. Leveraging a recently developed approach named CellDMC, we performed cell type-specific EWAS to identify CpG loci significantly associated with GDM, or 3-year-old body mass index (BMI) z-score. A total of 1410 CpG loci displayed significant cell type-specific differences in methylation level between 23 GDM cases and 252 controls with a false discovery rateâ€‰<â€‰0.05. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis indicated that LDL transportation emerged from CpG specifically identified from B-cells DNAm analyses and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway emerged from CpG specifically identified from natural killer cells DNAm analyses. In addition, we identified four and six loci associated with 3-year-old BMI z-score that were specific to CD8+â€‰T-cells and monocytes, respectively. By performing genome-wide permutation tests, we validated that most of our detected signals had low false positive rates.Compared to conventional EWAS adjusting for the effects of cell type heterogeneity, the proposed approach based on cell type-specific EWAS could provide additional biologically meaningful associations between CpG methylation, prenatal maternal GDM or 3-year-old BMI. With careful validation, these findings may provide new insights into the pathogenesis, programming, and consequences of related childhood metabolic dysregulation. Therefore, we propose that cell type-specific analyses are worth cautious explorations.",

We identify 148, 35, and 4 novel associations among Europeans, African Americans, and Hispanics, respectively, and an additional 186 novel associations through a trans-ethnic meta-analysis. We observe a high concordance in the direction of effects across racial/ethnic groups, a high correlation of effect sizes between high-density lipoprotein and triglycerides, a modest overlap of associations with epigenome-wide association studies of other cardio-metabolic traits, and a largely non-overlap with lipid loci identified to date through genome-wide association studies. Thirty CpGs reached significance in at least 2 racial/ethnic groups including 7 that showed association with the expression of an annotated gene. CpGs annotated to CPT1A showed evidence of being influenced by triglycerides levels. DNA methylation levels of circulating leukocytes show robust and consistent association with blood lipid levels across multiple racial/ethnic groups.",

We conducted a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) to identify differentially methylated sites (DMSs) of T2D and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in a Korean population.We performed an MWAS in 232 participants with T2D and 197 non-diabetic controls with Illumina EPIC bead chip using peripheral blood leukocytes. T2D group was subdivided into 87 DKD cases and 80 non-DKD controls. Additional 819 individuals from two population-based cohorts were used to investigate the association of identified DMSs with quantitative metabolic phenotypes. Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was applied to evaluate the causal effect of metabolic phenotypes on identified DMSs.We identified eight DMSs (each at BMP8A, NBPF20, STX18, ZNF365, CPT1A, and TRIM37, and two at TXNIP) which were significantly associated with the risk of T2D (P < 9.0Ã—10 -8), including three that were previously known (DMSs in TXNIP and CPT1A). We also identified three DMSs (in COMMD1, TMOD1, and FHOD1) associated with DKD. With our limited sample size, we were not able to observe a significant overlap between DMSs of T2D and DKD. DMSs in TXNIP and CTP1A were associated with fasting glucose and HbA1c. In MR analysis, fasting glucose was causally associated with DMS in CPT1A.In an East Asian population, we identified eight DMSs, including five novel CpG loci, associated with T2D and three DMSs associated with DKD at methylome-wide statistical significance.Â© The Author(s) 2021.

The role of DNA methylation in the relationship between PAHs exposure and decreased HRV is largely unknown. This study aims to explore epigenome-wide DNA methylation changes associated with PAHs exposure and further evaluate their associations with HRV alternations among non-current smokers. We measured 10 mono-hydroxylated PAHs (OH-PAHs) in urine and DNA methylation levels in blood leukocytes among participants from three panels of Chinese non-current smokers (152 in WHZH, 99 in SY, and 53 in COW). We conducted linear regression analyses between DNA methylation and OH-PAHs metabolites with adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, drinking, blood cell counts, and surrogate variables in each panel separately, and combined the results by using inverse-variance weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis to obtain estimates of effect size. The median value of total OH-PAHs ranged from 0.92Â Ã—Â 10-2in SY panel (62.6% men) to 13.82Â Ã—Â 10-2Â Î¼mol/mmol creatinine in COW panel (43.4% men). The results showed that methylation levels of cg18223625 (COL20A1) and cg07805771 (SLC16A1) were significantly or marginally significantly associated with urinary 2-hydroxynaphthalene [Î²(SE)Â =Â 0.431(0.074) and 0.354(0.068), FDRÂ =Â 0.016 and 0.056, respectively], while methylation level of cg09235308 (PLEC1) was positively associated with urinary total OH-PAHs [Î²(SE)Â =Â 0.478(0.079), FDRÂ =Â 0.004]. Hypermethylations of cg18223625, cg07805771, and cg09235308 were inversely associated with HRV indices among the WHZH and COW non-current smokers. However, we did not observe significant epigenome-wide associations for the other 9 urinary OH-PAHs. These findings provide new evidence that PAHs exposure is linked to differential DNA methylation, which may help better understand the influences of PAHs exposure on HRV alternations.Copyright Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

No,20210920,epigenetics,34489442,The concurrence of DNA methylation and demethylation is associated with transcription regulation.,Nat Commun,"The mammalian DNA methylome is formed by two antagonizing processes, methylation by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and demethylation by ten-eleven translocation (TET) dioxygenases. Although the dynamics of either methylation or demethylation have been intensively studied in the past decade, the direct effects of their interaction on gene expression remain elusive. Here, we quantify the concurrence of DNA methylation and demethylation by the percentage of unmethylated CpGs within a partially methylated read from bisulfite sequencing. After verifying 'methylation concurrence' by its strong association with the co-localization of DNMT and TET enzymes, we observe that methylation concurrence is strongly correlated with gene expression. Notably, elevated methylation concurrence in tumors is associated with the repression of 40~60% of tumor suppressor genes, which cannot be explained by promoter hypermethylation alone. Furthermore, methylation concurrence can be used to stratify large undermethylated regions with negligible differences in average methylation into two subgroups with distinct chromatin accessibility and gene regulation patterns. Together, methylation concurrence represents a unique methylation metric important for transcription regulation and is distinct from conventional metrics, such as average methylation and methylation variation.Â© 2021.

Longitudinal studies, coupled with the use of liquid biopsies, offer a potentially new and minimally invasive platform to study the dynamics of tumour progression. Our aim was to investigate the dynamics of personal DNA methylomic profiles of metastatic PCa (mPCa) patients, during disease progression and therapy administration.Forty-eight plasma samples from 9 mPCa patients were collected, longitudinally, over 13-21Â months. After circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolation, DNA methylation was profiled using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. The top 5% most variable probes across time, within each individual, were utilised to study dynamic methylation patterns during disease progression and therapeutic response. Statistical testing was carried out to identify differentially methylated genes (DMGs) in cfDNA, which were subsequently validated in two independent mPCa (cfDNA and FFPE tissue) cohorts. Individual cfDNA global methylation patterns were temporally stable throughout the disease course. However, a proportion of CpG sites presented a dynamic temporal pattern that was consistent with clinical events, including different therapies, and were prominently associated with genes linked to immune response pathways. Additionally, study of the tumour fraction of cfDNA identifiedâ€‰>â€‰2000 DMGs with dynamic methylation patterns.Longitudinal assessment of cfDNA methylation in mPCa patients unveiled dynamic patterns associated with disease progression and therapy administration, thus highlighting the potential of using liquid biopsies to study PCa evolution at a methylomic level.Â© 2021.

Updates in technology over time create challenges for data harmonization within and between studies, many of which obtained data from the older 450K and newer EPIC platforms. The pre-processing pipeline for DNA methylation is not trivial, and influences the downstream analyses. Incorporating different platforms adds a new level of technical variability that has not yet been taken into account by recommended pipelines. Our study evaluated the performance of various tools on different versions of platform data harmonization at each step of pre-processing pipeline, including quality control (QC), normalization, batch effect adjustment, and genomic inflation. We illustrate our novel approach using 450K and EPIC data from the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) prospective cohort.We found normalization and probe filtering had the biggest effect on data harmonization. Employing a meta-analysis was an effective and easily executable method for accounting for platform variability. Correcting for genomic inflation also helped with harmonization. We present guidelines for studies seeking to harmonize data from the 450K and EPIC platforms, which includes the use of technical replicates for evaluating numerous pre-processing steps, and employing a meta-analysis.Â© 2021.

In the present study, we describe results of DNAm quantitative trait locus (mQTL) analyses on 32,851 participants, identifying genetic variants associated with DNAm at 420,509 DNAm sites in blood. We present a database of >270,000 independent mQTLs, of which 8.5% comprise long-range (trans) associations. Identified mQTL associations explain 15-17% of the additive genetic variance of DNAm. We show that the genetic architecture of DNAm levels is highly polygenic. Using shared genetic control between distal DNAm sites, we constructed networks, identifying 405 discrete genomic communities enriched for genomic annotations and complex traits. Shared genetic variants are associated with both DNAm levels and complex diseases, but only in a minority of cases do these associations reflect causal relationships from DNAm to trait or vice versa, indicating a more complex genotype-phenotype map than previously anticipated.Â© 2021.

Starting with transcriptome analyses, single-cell techniques have extended to multi-omics approaches and now enable the simultaneous measurement of data modalities and spatial cellular context. Data are now available for millions of cells, for whole-genome measurements and for multiple modalities. Although analyses of such multimodal datasets have the potential to provide new insights into biological processes that cannot be inferred with a single mode of assay, the integration of very large, complex, multimodal data into biological models and mechanisms represents a considerable challenge. An understanding of the principles of data integration and visualization methods is required to determine what methods are best applied to a particular single-cell dataset. Each class of method has advantages and pitfalls in terms of its ability to achieve various biological goals, including cell-type classification, regulatory network modelling and biological process inference. In choosing a data integration strategy, consideration must be given to whether the multi-omics data are matched (that is, measured on the same cell) or unmatched (that is, measured on different cells) and, more importantly, the overall modelling and visualization goals of the integrated analysis.Â© 2021.

We found that somatic mutation accumulations and clonal expansions were widespread, although to variable extents, in morphologically normal human tissues. Somatic copy number alterations were rarely detected, except for in tissues from the oesophagus and cardia. Endogenous mutational processes with the SBS1 and SBS5 mutational signatures are ubiquitous among normal tissues, although they exhibit different relative activities. Exogenous mutational processes operate in multiple tissues from the same donor. We reconstructed the spatial somatic clonal architecture with sub-millimetre resolution. In the oesophagus and cardia, macroscopic somatic clones that expanded to hundreds of micrometres were frequently seen, whereas in tissues such as the colon, rectum and duodenum, somatic clones were microscopic in size and evolved independently, possibly restricted by local tissue microstructures.

Here we compare the mutational landscape in 29 cell types from the soma and germline using multiple samples from the same individuals. Two ubiquitous mutational signatures, SBS1 and SBS5/40, accounted for the majority of acquired mutations in most cell types, but their absolute and relative contributions varied substantially. SBS18, which potentially reflects oxidative damage2, and several additional signatures attributed to exogenous and endogenous exposures contributed mutations to subsets of cell types. The rate of mutation was lowest in spermatogonia, the stem cells from which sperm are generated and from which most genetic variation in the human population is thought to originate. This was due to low rates of ubiquitous mutational processes and may be partially attributable to a low rate of cell division in basal spermatogonia. These results highlight similarities and differences in the maintenance of the germline and soma.Â© 2021. Crown.",

Here, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)Â profiles of 1538 breast tumors and 244 normal breast tissues from the METABRIC cohort are reported, facilitating detailed analysis of DNA methylation within a rich context of genomic, transcriptional, and clinical data. Tumor methylation from immune and stromal signatures are deconvoluted leading to the discovery of a tumor replication-linked clock with genome-wide methylation loss in non-CpG island sites. Unexpectedly, methylation in most tumor CpG islands follows two replication-independent processes of gain (MG) or loss (ML) that we term epigenomic instability. Epigenomic instability is correlated with tumor grade and stage, TP53 mutations and poorer prognosis. After controlling for these global trans-acting trends, as well as for X-linked dosage compensation effects, cis-specific methylation and expression correlations are uncovered at hundreds of promoters and over a thousand distal elements. Some of these targeted known tumor suppressors and oncogenes. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that global epigenetic instability can erode cancer methylomes and expose them to localized methylation aberrations in-cis resulting in transcriptional changes seen in tumors.Â© 2021.

No,20210920,ewas,34401410,Placental DNA methylation marks are associated with maternal depressive symptoms during early pregnancy.,Neurobiol Stress,"Maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy are a significant risk factor for adverse developmental and health outcomes of the offspring. The molecular mechanisms mediating the long-term effects of this exposure are not well understood. Previous studies have found association between prenatal exposure to maternal psychological distress and placental DNA methylation of candidate genes, which can influence placental barrier function and development of the fetus. Our objective in this study was to determine epigenome wide association of maternal depressive symptoms in early pregnancy with the placental DNA methylation. For this purpose we examined DNA methylomes of 92 placental samples by using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. The placental samples were collected after deliveries of 39 girls and 59 boys, whose mothers had Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score ranging from 0 to 19Â at gestational week 14. According to our results maternal depressive symptoms are associated with DNA methylation of 2833 CpG sites, which are particularly over-represented in genic enhancers. The genes overlapping or nearest to these sites are functionally enriched for development of neurons and show expression enrichment in several regions of developing brain. The genomic regions harboring the DNA methylation marks are enriched for single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with mental disease trait class. Potential cellular signaling cascades mediating the effects include inflammatory and hormonal pathways. As a conclusion our results suggest that maternal depressive symptoms during early pregnancy are associated with DNA methylation marks in placenta in genes, which are important for the development and long-term health of the brain. Whether similar marks can be detected in exposed children remains to be elucidated in further studies.Â© 2021 The Authors.",

Disease modules are popular concepts for interpreting genome-wide studies in medicine but have so far not been systematically evaluated and may lead to corroborating multi-omic modules.We assessed eight module identification methods in 57 previously published expression and methylation studies of 19 diseases using GWAS enrichment analysis. Next, we applied the same strategy for multi-omic integration of 20 datasets of multiple sclerosis (MS), and further validated the resulting module using both GWAS and risk-factor-associated genes from several independent cohorts. Our benchmark of modules showed that in immune-associated diseases modules inferred from clique-based methods were the most enriched for GWAS genes. The multi-omic case study using MS data revealed the robust identification of a module of 220 genes. Strikingly, most genes of the module were differentially methylated upon the action of one or several environmental risk factors in MS (nÂ =â€‰217, PÂ =â€‰10-â€‰47) and were also independently validated for association with five different risk factors of MS, which further stressed the high genetic and epigenetic relevance of the module for MS.We believe our analysis provides a workflow for selecting modules and our benchmark study may help further improvement of disease module methods. Moreover, we also stress that our methodology is generally applicable for combining and assessing the performance of multi-omic approaches for complex diseases.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

In addition, the effects of DNA methylation and gene expression on Alzheimer's dementia are not well understood. A network summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis was performed integrating cis- DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) /cis- gene expression QTL (eQTL) data in the brain and blood, as well as GWAS summarized data for Alzheimer's dementia to evaluate the pleiotropic associations of DNA methylation and gene expression with Alzheimer's dementia and to explore the complex mechanisms underpinning Alzheimer's dementia. After correction for multiple testing (false discovery rate [FDR]P<Â 0.05) and filtering using the heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) test (PHEIDI>0.01), we identified dozens of DNA methylation sites and genes showing pleiotropic associations with Alzheimer's dementia. We found 22 and 16 potentially causal pathways of Alzheimer's dementia (i.e., SNPâ†’DNA methylationâ†’Gene expressionâ†’Alzheimer's dementia) in the brain and blood, respectively. Approximately two-thirds of the identified DNA methylation sites had an influence on gene expression and the expression of almost all the identified genes was regulated by DNA methylation. Our network SMR analysis provided evidence supporting the pleiotropic association of some novel DNA methylation sites and genes with Alzheimer's dementia and revealed possible causal pathways underlying the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's dementia. Our findings shed light on the role of DNA methylation in gene expression and in the development of Alzheimer's dementia.",

We studied associations between prenatal urinary biomarker concentrations of synthetic phenols and placental DNA methylation. Our study involved 202 mother-son pairs from the French EDEN cohort. Nine phenols were measured in spot urine samples collected between 22 and 29 gestational weeks. We performed DNA methylation analysis of the fetal side of placental tissues using the IlluminaHM450 BeadChips. We evaluated methylation changes of individual CpGs in an adjusted epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We performed mediation analysis to test whether placental tissue heterogeneity mediated the association between urinary phenol concentrations and DNA methylation. We identified 46 significant DMRs (â‰¥5 CpGs) associated with triclosan (37 DMRs), 2,4-dichlorophenol (3), benzophenone-3 (3), methyl- (2) and propylparaben (1). All but 2 DMRs were positively associated with phenol concentrations. Out of the 46 identified DMRs, 7 (6 for triclosan) encompassed imprinted genes (APC, FOXG1, GNAS, GNASAS, MIR886, PEG10, SGCE), which represented a significant enrichment. Other identified DMRs encompassed genes encoding proteins responsible for cell signaling, transmembrane transport, cell adhesion, inflammatory, apoptotic and immunological response, genes encoding transcription factors, histones, tumor suppressors, genes involved in tumorigenesis and several cancer risk biomarkers. Mediation analysis suggested that placental cell heterogeneity may partly explain these associations. This is the first study describing the genome-wide modifications of placental DNA methylation associated with pregnancy exposure to synthetic phenols or their precursors. Our results suggest that cell heterogeneity might mediate the effects of triclosan exposure on placental DNA methylation. Additionally, the enrichment of imprinted genes within the DMRs suggests mechanisms by which certain exposures, mainly to triclosan, could affect fetal development.Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors.

Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may contribute. Individual pesticides may be associated with specific DNA methylation patterns but no epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) has evaluated methylation in relation to individual pesticides.We conducted an EWAS of DNA methylation in relation to several pesticide active ingredients.The Agricultural Lung Health Study is a case-control study of asthma, nested within the Agricultural Health Study. We analyzed blood DNA methylation measured using Illumina's EPIC array in 1,170 male farmers of European ancestry. For pesticides still on the market at blood collection (2009-2013), we evaluated nine active ingredients for which at least 30 participants reported past and current (within the last 12 months) use, as well as seven banned organochlorines with at least 30 participants reporting past use. We used robust linear regression to compare methylation at individual C-phosphate-G sites (CpGs) among users of a specific pesticide to never users.Using family-wise error rate (p<9Ã—10-8) or false-discovery rate (FDR<0.05), we identified 162 differentially methylated CpGs across 8 of 9 currently marketed active ingredients (acetochlor, atrazine, dicamba, glyphosate, malathion, metolachlor, mesotrione, and picloram) and one banned organochlorine (heptachlor). Differentially methylated CpGs were unique to each active ingredient, and a dose-response relationship with lifetime days of use was observed for most. Significant CpGs were enriched for transcription motifs and 28% of CpGs were associated with whole bloodcis-gene expression, supporting functional effects of findings. We corroborated a previously reported association between dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (banned in the United States in 1972) and epigenetic age acceleration.We identified differential methylation for several active ingredients in male farmers of European ancestry. These may serve as biomarkers of chronic exposure and could inform mechanisms of long-term health outcomes from pesticide exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8928.",

We conducted the first prospective epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in relation to incident CHD in the Asian population.Methods:We did a nested case-control study comprising incident CHD cases and 1:1 matched controls who were identified from the 10-year follow-up of the China Kadoorie Biobank. Methylation level of baseline blood leukocyte DNA was measured by Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. We performed the single cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site association analysis and network approach to identify CHD-associated CpG sites and co-methylation gene module.Results:After quality control, 982 participants (mean age 50.1 years) were retained. Methylation level at 25 CpG sites across the genome was associated with incident CHD (genome-wide false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05 or module-specific FDR <0.01). One SD increase in methylation level of identified CpGs was associated with differences in CHD risk, ranging from a 47% decrease to a 118% increase. Mediation analyses revealed 28.5% of the excessed CHD risk associated with smoking was mediated by methylation level at the promoter region ofANKS1Agene (P for mediation effect = 0.036). Methylation level at the promoter region ofSNX30was associated with blood pressure and subsequent risk of CHD, with the mediating proportion to be 7.7% (P = 0.003) via systolic blood pressure and 6.4% (P = 0.006) via diastolic blood pressure. Network analysis revealed a co-methylation module associated with CHD.Conclusions:We identified novel blood methylation alterations associated with incident CHD in the Asian population and provided evidence of the possible role of epigenetic regulations in the smoking- and BP-related pathways to CHD risk.Funding:This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (81390544 and 91846303).

Neonates born to women in higher risk subgroups had differential DNAm at 2 CpG sites. Higher cumulative prenatal risk was associated with methylation at 15 CpG sites, 12 of which were located in genes previously linked to physical and mental health and neurodevelopment.We observed associations between prenatal risk factors and DNAm in very preterm infants using both person-centered and cumulative risk approaches.

Little is known about the physiologic mechanisms underlying this risk. To date, no studies have evaluated if differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) among women who experience preterm birth are short-term or if they persist and are associated with subsequent cardiovascular sequelae or other health disorders. The purpose of this study was to examine long-term epigenetic effects of preterm birth in African American mothers (nâ€‰=â€‰182) from the InterGEN Study (2014-2019). In this study, we determine if differences in DNAm exist between women who reported a preterm birth in the last 3-5â€‰years compared to those who had full-term births by using two different approaches: epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide co-methylation analyses.Though no significant CpG sites were identified using the EWAS approach, we did identify significant modules of co-methylation associated with preterm birth. Co-methylation analyses showed correlations with preterm birth in gene ontology and KEGG pathways. Functional annotation analysis revealed enrichment for pathways related to central nervous system and sensory perception. No association was observed between DNAm age and preterm birth, though larger samples are needed to confirm this further.We identified differentially methylated gene networks associated with preterm birth in African American women 3-5â€‰years after birth, including pathways related to neurogenesis and sensory processing. More research is needed to understand better these associations and replicate them in an independent cohort. Further study should be done in this area to elucidate mechanisms linking preterm birth and later epigenomic changes that may contribute to the development of health disorders and maternal mood and well-being.Â© 2021.

Children were followed until age 6 for asthma evaluation. DNA methylation in cells obtained by nasal brushes at age 6 was measured by Illumina MethylationEPIC array.RSV immunoprophylaxis in infancy had a significant impact on global methylation patterns in nasal cells at age 6. The first principal component (PC) related to the immunoprophylaxis intervention was enriched for the pathway ""detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory perception of smell"" and ""T cell differentiation.""Â Subsequent analysis of these PCs indicated an effect of RSV immunoprophylaxis on cell type composition of nasal brushed cells.

Some micronutrients (B vitamins, choline, betaine, methionine) implicated in one-carbon metabolism (OCM) are essential for major epigenetic processes that take place in early pregnancy. However, few studies have evaluated the implication of the micronutrients in placental DNA methylation. We investigated whether intake of OCM nutrients in the year before pregnancy was associated with placental DNA methylation in the EDEN mother-child cohort. Maternal dietary intake was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire. Three dietary patterns, 'varied and balanced diet,' 'vegetarian tendency,' and 'bread and starchy food,' were used to characterize maternal OCM dietary intake. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to measure placental DNA methylation of 573 women included in the analyses. We evaluated the association of dietary patterns with global DNA methylation. Then, we conducted an agnostic epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and investigated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with each dietary pattern. We found no significant association between the three dietary patterns and global DNA methylation or individual CpG sites. DMR analyses highlighted associations between the 'varied and balanced' or 'vegetarian tendency' pattern and DMRs located at genes previously implicated in functions essential for embryonic development, such as neurodevelopment. The 'bread and starchy food' pattern was associated with regions related to genes whose functions involve various metabolic and cell synthesis-related processes. In mainly well-nourished French women without major deficiencies, OCM intake before pregnancy was not associated with major variation in DNA methylation.",

We hypothesize that age-related variation in the DNA methylome could reflect cumulative environmental modulation to the epigenome which could impact epigenomic instability and survival differentially by sex. To test the hypothesis, we performed sex-stratified epigenome-wide association studies on age-related intra-pair DNA methylation discordance in 492 twins aged 56-80Â years. We identified 3084 CpGs showing increased methylation variability with age (FDRÂ <Â 0.05, 7 CpGs with pÂ <Â 1e-07) in male twins but no significant site found in female twins. The results were replicated in an independent cohort of 292 twins aged 30-74Â years with 37% of the discovery CpGs successfully replicated in male twins. Functional annotation showed that genes linked to the identified CpGs were significantly enriched in signaling pathways, neurological functions, extracellular matrix assembly, and cancer. We further explored the implication of discovery CpGs on individual survival in an old cohort of 224 twins (220 deceased). In total, 264 CpGs displayed significant association with risk of death in male twins. In female twins, 175 of the male discovery CpGs also showed non-random correlation with mortality. Intra-pair comparison showed that majority of the discovery CpGs have higher methylation in the longer-lived twins suggesting that loss of DNA methylation during aging contributes to increased risk of death which is more pronounced in male twins. In conclusion, age-related epigenomic instability in the DNA methylome is more evident in males than in females and could impact individual survival and contribute to sex difference in human lifespan.Â© 2021 The Authors.

Although mechanisms are poorly understood, epigenetic regulation of gene expression may play a role.To identify DNA methylation (DNAm) changes associated with PBDE serum levels and test the association of these biomarkers with breast cancer risk.We studied 397 healthy women (controls) and 133 women diagnosed with breast cancer (cases) between ages 40 and 58Â years who participated in the California Teachers Study. PBDE levels were measured in blood. Infinium Human Methylation EPIC Bead Chips were used to measure DNAm. Using multivariable linear regression models, differentially methylated CpG sites (DMSs) and regions (DMRs) associated with serum PBDE levels were identified using controls. For top-ranked DMSs and DMRs, targeted next-generation bisulfite sequencing was used to measure DNAm for 133 invasive breast cancer cases and 301 age-matched controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between DMSs and DMRs and breast cancer risk.We identified 15 DMSs and 10 DMRs statistically significantly associated with PBDE levels (FDRÂ <Â 0.05). Methylation changes in a DMS at BMP8B and DMRs at TP53 and A2M-AS1 were statistically significantly (FDRÂ <Â 0.05) associated with breast cancer risk.We show for the first time that serum PBDE levels are associated with differential methylation and that PBDE-associated DNAm changes in blood are associated with breast cancer risk.Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors.

In the meta-analysis of all the participants, we discovered 21 mtDNA CN-associated CpG sites (pâ€‰<â€‰1 x 10-7), with a 0.7 to 3.0 standard deviation increase (3 CpGs) or decrease (18 CpGs) in mtDNA CN corresponding to a 1% increase in DNA methylation. Several significant CpGs have been reported to be associated with at least two risk factors (e.g. chronological age or smoking) for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Five genes (PRDM16, NR1H3, XRCC3, POLK, and PDSS2), which harbor nine significant CpGs, are known to be involved in mitochondrial biosynthesis and functions. For example, NR1H3 encodes a transcription factor that is differentially expressed during an adipose tissue transition. The methylation level of cg09548275 in NR1H3 was negatively associated with mtDNA CN (effect sizeâ€‰=â€‰-1.71, pâ€‰=â€‰4 x 10-8) and positively associated with the NR1H3 expression level (effect sizeâ€‰=â€‰0.43, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0003), which indicates that the methylation level in NR1H3 may underlie the relationship between mtDNA CN, the NR1H3 transcription factor, and energy expenditure. In summary, the study results suggest that mtDNA CN variation in whole blood is associated with DNA methylation levels in genes that are involved in a wide range of mitochondrial activities. These findings will help reveal molecular mechanisms between mtDNA CN and CVD.Â© The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

We identify 443 CpGs that are associated with MSDP, of which 142 associated with birth outcomes, 40 associated with gene expression, and 13 CpGs are associated with all three. Only two CpGs have consistent associations from a prior meta-analysis of cord blood DNAm, demonstrating substantial tissue-specific responses to MSDP. The placental MSDP-associated CpGs are enriched for environmental response genes, growth-factor signaling, and inflammation, which play important roles in placental function. We demonstrate links between placental DNAm, MSDP and poor birth outcomes, which may better inform the mechanisms through which MSDP impacts placental function and fetal growth.Â© 2021.

However, whether alterations in the epigenome, in particular cancer-related DNA hypomethylation, affects higher-order levels of genome architecture is still unclear. Here, using Repli-Seq, single-cell Repli-Seq, and Hi-C, we show that genome-wide methylation loss is associated with both concordant loss of replication timing precision and deregulation of 3D genome organization. Notably, we find distinct disruption in 3D genome compartmentalization, striking gains in cell-to-cell replication timing heterogeneity and loss of allelic replication timing in cancer hypomethylation models, potentially through the gene deregulation of DNA replication and genome organization pathways. Finally, we identify ectopic H3K4me3-H3K9me3 domains from across large hypomethylated domains, where late replication is maintained, which we purport serves to protect against catastrophic genome reorganization and aberrant gene transcription. Our results highlight a potential role for the methylome in the maintenance of 3D genome regulation.Copyright Â© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
No,20211004,epigenetics,34526716,UTX condensation underlies its tumour-suppressive activity,Nature,"UTX (also known as KDM6A) encodes a histone H3K27 demethylase and is an important tumour suppressor that is frequently mutated in human cancers1. However, as the demethylase activity of UTX is often dispensable for mediating tumour suppression and developmental regulation2-8, the underlying molecular activity of UTX remains unknown. Here we show that phase separation of UTX underlies its chromatin-regulatory activity in tumour suppression. A core intrinsically disordered region (cIDR) of UTX forms phase-separated liquid condensates, and cIDR loss caused by the most frequent cancer mutation of UTX is mainly responsible for abolishing tumour suppression. Deletion, mutagenesis and replacement assays of the intrinsically disordered region demonstrate a critical role of UTX condensation in tumour suppression and embryonic stem cell differentiation. As shown by reconstitution in vitro and engineered systems in cells, UTX recruits the histone methyltransferase MLL4 (also known as KMT2D) to the same condensates and enriches the H3K4 methylation activity of MLL4. Moreover, UTX regulates genome-wide histone modifications and high-order chromatin interactions in a condensation-dependent manner. We also found that UTY, the Y chromosome homologue of UTX with weaker tumour-suppressive activity, forms condensates with reduced molecular dynamics. These studies demonstrate a crucial biological function of liquid condensates with proper material states in enabling the tumour-suppressive activity of a chromatin regulator.",

We also tested associations between e-cigarette use and methylation scores known to predict smoking and biological ageing. Methylation scores for smoking and biological ageing were similar between vapers and non-smokers. Higher levels of all smoking scores and a biological ageing score (GrimAge) were observed in smokers.

Sexual dimorphism in environmentally induced DNAm dysregulation has been identified and therefore it is important to understand sex-specific DNAm patterns. DNAm at several autosomal sites has been consistently associated with sex in cord blood and placental fetal tissues. However, there is limited research comparing sex-specific DNAm across tissues, particularly differentially methylated regions (DMRs). This study leverages DNAm data measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in cord blood (N = 179), placenta (N = 229), and umbilical artery samples (N = 229) in the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort to identify autosomal DMRs and differentially methylated positions (DMPs).

The clinical presentation of CD varies both according to the individual's sex and level of callous-unemotional (CU) traits, but it remains unclear how genetic and environmental factors interact at the molecular level to produce these differences. Emerging evidence in males implicates methylation of genes associated with socio-affective processes. Here, we combined an epigenome-wide association study with structural neuroimaging in 51 females with CD and 59 typically developing (TD) females to examine DNA methylation in relation to CD, CU traits, and gray matter volume (GMV). We demonstrate an inverse pattern of correlation between CU traits and methylation of a chromosome 1 region in CD females (positive) as compared to TD females (negative). The identified region spans exon 1 of the SLC25A24 gene, central to energy metabolism due to its role in mitochondrial function. Increased SLC25A24 methylation was also related to lower GMV in multiple brain regions in the overall cohort. These included the superior frontal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus, secondary visual cortex and ventral posterior cingulate cortex, which are regions that have previously been implicated in CD and CU traits. While our findings are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger samples, they provide novel evidence that CU traits in females are associated with methylation levels in a fundamentally different way in CD and TD, which in turn may relate to observable variations in GMV across the brain.Â© 2021.

The objective of this study is to use DNA methylation analysis to detect DNA methylation loci linked to obesity phenotypes, i.e. waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI.Two-hundred and ten healthy European participants from the STANISLAS Family Study (SFS), comprising 73 nuclear families, were comprehensively assessed for methylation status using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. An epigenome-wide association study was performed, which identified a CpG site cg16170243 located on chromosome 18q21.2 significantly associated with waist circumference, after adjusting for BMI (Î²â€‰=â€‰2.32, SEâ€‰=â€‰0.41, Padjâ€‰=â€‰0.048). Cg16170243 corresponds to a 50Â bp-length human methylation oligoprobe located within the AC090241.2 gene that overlaps ST8SIA5 gene. No significant association was observed with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (Padjâ€‰>â€‰0.05).A novel association between DNA methylation and WC was identified, which is demonstrating that epigenetic mechanisms may have a significant impact on waist circumference ratio in healthy individuals. Further studies are warranted to address the causal effects of this association.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

This sex bias first emerges during puberty and then persists across the reproductive years. As the cause remains largely elusive, we performed a methylation-wide association study (MWAS) to generate novel hypotheses.We assayed nearly all 28 million possible methylation sites in blood in 595 blood samples from 487 participants aged 9-17. MWASs were performed to identify methylation sites associated with increasing sex differences in depression symptoms as a function of pubertal stage. Epigenetic deconvolution was applied to perform analyses on a cell-type specific level.In monocytes, a substantial number of significant associations were detected after controlling the FDR at 0.05. These results could not be explained by plasma testosterone/estradiol or current/lifetime trauma. Our top results in monocytes were significantly enriched (ratio of 2.48) for genes in the top of a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of depression and neurodevelopment-related Gene Ontology (GO) terms that remained significant after correcting for multiple testing. Focusing on our most robust findings (70 genes overlapping with the GWAS meta-analysis and the significant GO terms), we find genes coding for members of each of the major classes of axon guidance molecules (netrins, slits, semaphorins, ephrins, and cell adhesion molecules). Many of these genes were previously implicated in rodent studies of brain development and depression-like phenotypes, as well as human methylation, gene expression and GWAS studies.Our study suggests that the emergence of sex differences in depression may be related to the differential rewiring of brain circuits between boys and girls during puberty.Â© 2021 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.",

Little is known about the role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of CSU. This study aimed to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation profile in whole blood of patients with CSU.Genome-wide DNA methylation levels in whole blood samples of 95 Chinese Han ethnicity adult CSU patients and 95 ethnicity-, age- and sex-matched healthy controls were analyzed using Illumina 850K methylation chip. The differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were screened out and then functionally annotated by the gene ontology and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes databases.A total of 439 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) (p< 0.01 and |Î”Î²| â‰¥ 0.06) were identified with 380 hypomethylated and 59 hypermethylated. The average global DNA methylation levels of the 439 DMPs in the CSU patients were significantly lower than those in the healthy controls (p< 0.001). The distribution of the 439 DMPs was wide on chromosome 1 to 22 and chromosome X. Chromosome 6 embodied the largest number of DMPs (n= 51) and their annotated genes were predominantly related to autoimmunity. The 304 annotated DMGs were mainly enriched in autoimmune disease- and immune-related pathways. A total of 41 DMPs annotated to 28 DMGs were identified whenp< 0.01 and |Î”Î²| â‰¥ 0.1. Of the 28 DMGs, HLA-DPB2, HLA-DRB1, PPP2R5C, and LTF were associated with autoimmunity. CSU cases with elevated total IgE, positive anti-thyroid peroxidase IgG autoantibodies, positive anti-thyroglobulin IgG autoantibodies, angioedema, UASday > 4, or recurrent CSU showed phenotype-specific DMPs as compared with cases with normal total IgE, negative anti-thyroid peroxidase IgG autoantibodies, negative anti-thyroglobulin IgG autoantibodies, no angioedema, UASday â‰¤ 4, or non-recurrent CSU respectively.This study shows a distinct genome-wide DNA methylation profile in Chinese Han ethnicity adult CSU patients and indicates a role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of CSU. The predominant enrichment of the CSU-associated DMGs in immunological pathways provides supportive evidence for the immunopathogenesis of CSU. Future research on the CSU-associated DMPs and DMGs will help discover potential therapeutic targets for CSU.Copyright Â© 2021 Qi, Zhang, Yang, Tang and Xiao.",

Exposure-associated changes of DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns have been suggested as a possible mediator of this relationship. This study investigated whether prenatal low-dose exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) is associated with altered DNAm patterns across the genome in a Western urban-industrial population. In 142 mother-infant pairs from the Duisburg Birth Cohort Study, PCBs and PCDD/Fs levels were quantified from maternal blood during late pregnancy and associated with DNAm levels in cord blood using the Illumina EPIC beadchip. The epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) identified 32 significantly differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and eight differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with six congeners of PCB and PCDD in females or males (FDRs < 0.05). DMPs and DMRs mapped to genes involved in neurodevelopment, gene regulation, and immune functioning. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) showed 31 co-methylated modules (FDRs < 0.05) associated with one congener of PCDF levels in females. Results of both analytical strategies indicate that prenatal exposure to PCBs and PCDD/Fs is associated with altered DNAm of genes involved in neurodevelopment, gene expression and immune functioning. DNAm and gene expression levels of several of these genes were previously associated with EDC exposure in rodent models. Follow-up studies will clarify whether these epigenetic changes might contribute to the origin for adverse mental and health outcomes.",

The mechanisms underpinning this event have remained a mystery. Because MZ twinning rarely runs in families, the leading hypothesis is that it occurs at random. Here, we show that MZ twinning is strongly associated with a stable DNA methylation signature in adult somatic tissues. This signature spans regions near telomeres and centromeres, Polycomb-repressed regions and heterochromatin, genes involved in cell-adhesion, WNT signaling, cell fate, and putative human metastable epialleles. Our study also demonstrates a never-anticipated corollary: because identical twins keep a lifelong molecular signature, we can retrospectively diagnose if a person was conceived as monozygotic twin.Â© 2021.

Can psychotherapy reorganise these memories through changes in DNA methylation signatures? Using a randomised controlled parallel group design, we examined methylome-wide changes in saliva samples of 84 female former child soldiers from Eastern DR Congo before and six months after Narrative Exposure Therapy. Treatment predicted differentially methylated positions (DMPs) related to ALCAM, RIPOR2, AFAP1 and MOCOS. In addition, treatment associations overlapped at gene level with baseline clinical and social outcomes. Treatment related DMPs are involved in memory formation-the key agent in trauma focused treatments-and enriched for molecular pathways commonly affected by trauma related disorders. Results were partially replicated in an independent sample of 53 female former child soldiers from Northern Uganda.

However, the microarrays' probe design cannot fully consider the vast human genetic diversity, leading to genetic artifacts. Distinguishing genuine from artifactual genetic influence is of particular relevance in the study of DNA methylation heritability and methylation quantitative trait loci. But despite its importance, current strategies to account for genetic artifacts are lagging due to a limited mechanistic understanding on how such artifacts operate.To address this, we develop and benchmark UMtools, an R-package containing novel methods for the quantification and qualification of genetic artifacts based on fluorescence intensity signals. With our approach, we model and validate known SNPs/indels on a genetically controlled dataset of monozygotic twins, and we estimate minor allele frequency from DNA methylation data and empirically detect variants not included in dbSNP. Moreover, we identify examples where genetic artifacts interact with each other or with imprinting, X-inactivation, or tissue-specific regulation. Finally, we propose a novel strategy based on co-methylation that can discern between genetic artifacts and genuine genomic influence.We provide an atlas to navigate through the huge diversity of genetic artifacts encountered on DNA methylation microarrays. Overall, our study sets the ground for a paradigm shift in the study of the genetic component of epigenetic variation in DNA methylation microarrays.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

With the increasing amount and complexity of data, scalability and reproducibility have become essential not just for experiments, but also for computational analysis. However, transforming data into information involves running a large number of tools, optimizing parameters, and integrating dynamically changing reference data. Workflow managers were developed in response to such challenges. They simplify pipeline development, optimize resource usage, handle software installation and versions, and run on different compute platforms, enabling workflow portability and sharing. In this Perspective, we highlight key features of workflow managers, compare commonly used approaches for bioinformatics workflows, and provide a guide for computational and noncomputational users. We outline community-curated pipeline initiatives that enable novice and experienced users to perform complex, best-practice analyses without having to manually assemble workflows. In sum, we illustrate how workflow managers contribute to making computational analysis in biomedical research shareable, scalable, and reproducible.Â© 2021. Springer Nature America, Inc.",

Here, we introduce recent studies of cancerous structural variants (SVs) using long-read sequencing technologies, namely Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencers, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencers, and linked-read methods. By taking advantage of long-read lengths, these technologies have enabled the precise detection of SVs, including long insertions by transposable elements, such as LINE-1. In addition to SV detection, the epigenome status (including DNA methylation and haplotype information) surrounding SV loci has also been unveiled by long-read sequencing technologies, to identify the effects of SVs. Among the various research fields in which long-read sequencing has been applied, cancer genomics has shown the most remarkable advances. In fact, many studies are beginning to shed light on the detection of SVs and the elucidation of their complex structures in various types of cancer. In the particular case of cancers, we summarize the technical limitations of the application of this technology to the analysis of clinical samples. We will introduce recent achievements from this viewpoint. However, a similar approach will be started for other applications in the near future. Therefore, by complementing the current short-read sequencing analysis, long-read sequencing should reveal the complex nature of human genomes in their healthy and disease states, which will open a new opportunity for a better understanding of disease development and for a novel strategy for drug development.Â© 2021 The Authors.",

Moreover, early life stress has been associated with substance use initiation at a younger age, a risk factor for developing substance use disorders. However, no studies to date have investigated whether NR3C1 methylation can predict substance use in young individuals. This study included adolescents 13-14 years of age that reported no history of substance use at baseline, (Nâ€‰=â€‰1041; malesâ€‰=â€‰46%). Participants contributed saliva DNA samples and were followed in middle adolescence as part of KUPOL, a prospective cohort study of 7th-grade students in Sweden. Outcome variables were self-reports of (i) recent use, (ii) lifetime use, and (iii) use duration of (a) alcohol, (b) tobacco products, (c) cannabis, or (d) any substance. Outcomes were measured annually for three consecutive years. The predictor variable was DNA methylation at the exon 1â€‰F locus of NR3C1. Risk and rate ratios were calculated as measures of association, with or without adjustment for internalizing symptoms and parental psychiatric disorders. For a subset of individuals (Nâ€‰=â€‰320), there were also morning and afternoon salivary cortisol measurements available that were analyzed in relation to NR3C1 methylation levels. Baseline NR3C1 hypermethylation associated with future self-reports of recent use and use duration of any substance, before and after adjustment for potential confounders. The overall estimates were attenuated when considering lifetime use. Sex-stratified analyses revealed the strongest association for cigarette use in males. Cortisol analyses revealed associations between NR3C1 methylation and morning cortisol levels. Findings from this study suggest that saliva NR3C1 hypermethylation can predict substance use in middle adolescence. Additional longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm these findings.Â© 2021.

Here we describe the development of a method that improves the read length generated by using the bisulfite-sequencing-based approach. In this method, we combined recently developed enzymatic base conversion, where an unmethylated cytosine (C) should be converted to thymine (T), with nanopore sequencing. After methylation-sensitive base conversion, the sequencing library was constructed using long-range polymerase chain reaction. This type of analysis is possible using a minimum of 1 ng genomic DNA, and an N50 read length of 3.4–7.6 kb is achieved. To analyze the produced data, which contained a substantial number of base mismatches due to sequence conversion and an inaccurate base read of the nanopore sequencing, a new analytical pipeline was constructed. To demonstrate the performance of long-read methylation sequencing, breast cancer cell lines and clinical specimens were subjected to analysis, which revealed the chromosomal methylation context of key cancer-related genes, allele-specific methylated genes, and repetitive or deletion regions. This method should convert the intractable specimens for which the amount of available genomic DNA is limited to the tractable targets.",

Variations in offspring's epigenome can reflect the impact and response to in utero glycemic exposure, and may have different consequences for the child.We examined possible differences in associations of basal glucose status and glucose handling during pregnancy with both clinical covariates and offspring cord tissue DNA methylation.This study included 830 mother-offspring dyads from the GUSTO cohort. The fetal epigenome of umbilical cord tissue was profiled using Illumina HumanMethylation450 arrays. Associations of maternal mid-pregnancy fasting (FPG) and 2h plasma glucose (2hPG) post-75g oral glucose challenge (OGTT) with both maternal clinical phenotypes and offspring epigenome at delivery were investigated separately.Maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI and blood pressure measures were associated with both FPG and 2hPG; while Chinese ethnicity (p=1.9Ã—10 -4), maternal height (p=1.1Ã—10 -4), pregnancy weight gain (p=2.2Ã—10 -3), pre-pregnancy alcohol consumption (p=4.6Ã—10 -4), and tobacco exposure (p=1.9Ã—10 -3) showed significantly opposite associations between the two glucose measures. Most importantly, we observed a dichotomy in the effects of these glycemic indices on the offspring epigenome. Offspring born to mothers with elevated 2hPG showed global hypomethylation. CpGs most associated with the two glucose measures also reflected differences in gene ontologies and had different associations with offspring birthweight.Our findings suggest that two traditionally used glycemic indices for diagnosing gestational diabetes may reflect distinctive pathophysiologies in pregnancy, and have differential impacts on the offspring's DNA methylome.Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Much evidence suggested that alterations in DNA methylations occurred in SCZ patients.To investigate potential inheritable pattern of DNA methylation in SCZ family, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation of peripheral blood samples from 106 Chinese SCZ family trios. Genome-wide DNA methylations were quantified by Agilent 1Â Ã—Â 244Â k Human Methylation Microarray.In this study, we proposed a loci inheritance frequency model that allows characterization of differential methylated regions as SCZ biomarkers.

Epigenetic regulation is considered as a key mediator for this phenomenon but analysis on humans is sparse. The Great Chinese Famine lasting from 1958 to 1961 is a natural string of disasters offering a precious opportunity for elucidating the underlying epigenetic mechanism of the long-term effect of early adversity.Using a high-throughput array platform for DNA methylome profiling, we conducted a case-control epigenome-wide association study on early-life exposure to Chinese famine in 79 adults born during 1959-1961 and compared to 105 unexposed subjects born 1963-1964.The single CpG site analysis of whole epigenome revealed a predominant pattern of decreased DNA methylation levels associated with fetal exposure to famine. Four CpG sites were detected with pÂ <Â 1e-06 (linked to EHMT1, CNR1, UBXN7 and ESM1 genes), 16 CpGs detected with 1e-06Â <Â pÂ <Â 1e-05 and 157 CpGs with 1e-05Â <Â pÂ <Â 1e-04, with a predominant pattern of hypomethylation. Functional annotation to genes and their enriched biological pathways mainly involved neurodevelopment, neuropsychological disorders and metabolism. Multiple sites analysis detected two top-rank differentially methylated regions harboring RNF39 on chromosome 6 and PTPRN2 on chromosome 7, both showing epigenetic association with stress-related conditions.Early-life exposure to famine could mediate DNA methylation regulations that persist into adulthood with broad impacts in the activities of genes and biological pathways.

No,20211018,prediction,34534207,Hierarchy and control of ageing-related methylation networks.,PLoS Comput Biol,"DNA methylation provides one of the most widely studied biomarkers of ageing. Since the methylation of CpG dinucleotides function as switches in cellular mechanisms, it is plausible to assume that by proper adjustment of these switches age may be tuned. Though, adjusting hundreds of CpG methylation levels coherently may never be feasible and changing just a few positions may lead to biologically unstable state. A prominent example of methylation-based age estimators is provided by Horvath's clock, based on 353 CpG dinucleotides, showing a high correlation (not necessarily causation) with chronological age across multiple tissue types. On this small subset of CpG dinucleotides we demonstrate how the adjustment of one methylation level leads to a cascade of changes at other sites. Among the studied subset, we locate the most important CpGs (and related genes) that may have a large influence on the rest of the sub-system. According to our analysis, the structure of this network is way more hierarchical compared to what one would expect based on ensembles of uncorrelated connections. Therefore, only a handful of CpGs is enough to modify the system towards a desired state. When propagation of the change over the network is taken into account, the resulting modification in the predicted age can be significantly larger compared to the effect of isolated CpG perturbations. By adjusting the most influential single CpG site and following the propagation of methylation level changes we can reach up to 5.74 years in virtual age reduction, significantly larger than without taking into account of the network control. Extending our approach to the whole methylation network may identify key nodes that have controller role in the ageing process.",

Here we carry out a comprehensive assessment of the epigenomes of mouse brain cell types by applying single-nucleus DNA methylation sequencing1,2to profile 103,982 nuclei (including 95,815 neurons and 8,167 non-neuronal cells) from 45 regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus, striatum, pallidum and olfactory areas. We identified 161 cell clusters with distinct spatial locations and projection targets. We constructed taxonomies of these epigenetic types, annotated with signature genes, regulatory elements and transcription factors. These features indicate the potential regulatory landscape supporting the assignment of putative cell types and reveal repetitive usage of regulators in excitatory and inhibitory cells for determining subtypes. The DNA methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus varied continuously along spatial gradients. Using this deep dataset, we constructed an artificial neural network model that precisely predicts single neuron cell-type identity and brain area spatial location. Integration of high-resolution DNA methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data3enabled prediction of high-confidence enhancer-gene interactions for all identified cell types, which were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin conformation capture experiments4. By combining multi-omic datasets (DNA methylation, chromatin contacts, and open chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the regulatory genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal diversity and spatial organization throughout the mouse cerebrum.Â© 2021.

While early results are promising, this is a rapidly evolving field with new knowledge emerging in both cancer biology and deep learning. In this review, we provide an overview of emerging deep learning techniques and how they are being applied to oncology. We focus on the deep learning applications for omics data types, including genomic, methylation and transcriptomic data, as well as histopathology-based genomic inference, and provide perspectives on how the different data types can be integrated to develop decision support tools. We provide specific examples of how deep learning may be applied in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment management. We also assess the current limitations and challenges for the application of deep learning in precision oncology, including the lack of phenotypically rich data and the need for more explainable deep learning models. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how current obstacles can be overcome to enable future clinical utilisation of deep learning.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

Microarrays relyÂ on digital assaying the fluorescence signals of arrays. In this study, we retrospectively constructed raw images for 37Â 724 published microarray data, and developed deep learning algorithms to automatically detect systematic defects. We report that an alarming amount of 26.73% of the microarray-based studies are affected by serious imaging defects. By literature mining, we found thatÂ publications associated with these affected microarrays have reported disproportionately more biological discoveries on the genes in the contaminated areas compared to other genes. 28.82% of the gene-level conclusions reported in these publications were based on measurements falling into the contaminated area, indicating severe, systematic problems caused by such contaminations. We provided the identified published, problematic datasets, affected genes and the imputed arrays as well as software tools for scanning such contamination that will become essential to future studies to scrutinize and critically analyze microarray data.Â© The Author(s) 2021.

Multi-omics profiling of human tumors can provide insight into how alterations in chromatin structure are propagated through the pathway of gene expression to result in malignant protein expression. We applied multi-omics profiling of chromatin accessibility, RNA abundance, and protein abundance to 36 human thyroid cancer primary tumors, metastases, and patient-match normal tissue. Through quantification of chromatin accessibility associated with active transcription units and global protein expression, we identify a local chromatin structure that is highly correlated with coordinated RNA and protein expression. In particular, we identify enhancers located within gene-bodies as predictive of correlated RNA and protein expression, that is independent of overall transcriptional activity. To demonstrate the generalizability of these findings we also identify similar results in an independent cohort of human breast cancers. Taken together, these analyses suggest that local enhancers, rather than distal enhancers, are likely most predictive of cancer gene expression phenotypes. This allows for identification of potential targets for cancer therapeutic approaches and reinforces the utility of multi-omics profiling as a methodology to understand human disease.Â© 2021.

Here we show technical noise produces deviations up to 9 years between replicates for six prominent epigenetic clocks, limiting their utility. We present a computational solution to bolster reliability, calculating principal components from CpG-level data as input for biological age prediction. Our retrained principal-component versions of six clocks show agreement between most replicates within 1.5 years, improved detection of clock associations and intervention effects, and reliable longitudinal trajectories in vivo and in vitro. This method entails only one additional step compared to traditional clocks, requires no replicates or prior knowledge of CpG reliabilities for training, and can be applied to any existing or future epigenetic biomarker. The high reliability of principal component-based clocks is critical for applications to personalized medicine, longitudinal tracking, in vitro studies, and clinical trials of aging interventions.

To search for the molecular connections involved, we asked whether global epigenetic changes may offer a clue by surveying the inheritance and reprogramming of parental DNA methylation across metazoans. We focused on gametes and early embryos, where the methylomes are known to evolve divergently between fish and mammals. Here, we find that methylome reprogramming during embryogenesis occurs neither in pre-bilaterians such as cnidarians nor in protostomes such as insects, but clearly presents in deuterostomes such as echinoderms and invertebrate chordates, and then becomes more evident in vertebrates. Functional association analysis suggests that DNA methylation reprogramming is associated with development, reproduction and adaptive immunity for vertebrates, but not for invertebrates. Interestingly, the single HOX cluster of invertebrates maintains unmethylated status in all stages examined. In contrast, the multiple HOX clusters show dramatic dynamics of DNA methylation during vertebrate embryogenesis. Notably, the methylation dynamics of HOX clusters are associated with their spatiotemporal expression in mammals. Our study reveals that DNA methylation reprogramming has evolved dramatically during animal evolution, especially after the evolutionary transitions from invertebrates to vertebrates, and then to mammals.Â© The Author(s) 2019.

We aimed to examine how an individual's risk preference associates with their epigenetic profile.Risk preferences were ascertained by asking participants of the Northern Ireland COhort for the Longitudinal study of Ageing to make a series of choices between two hypothetical income scenarios. From these, four risk preference categories were derived, ranging from risk-averse to risk-seeking. Illumina's Infinium High Density Methylation Assay was used to evaluate the status of 862,927 CpGs.Risk preference and DNA methylation data were obtained for 1,656 individuals. The distribution of single site DNA methylation levels between risk-averse and risk-seeking individuals was assessed whilst adjusting for covariates including age, sex and peripheral white cell counts. In this discovery cohort, 55 CpG sites were identified with significantly different levels of methylation (pâ‰¤x10-5) between risk-averse and risk-seeking individuals when adjusting for the maximum number of covariates. No CpGs were significantly differentially methylated in any of the risk preference groups at an epigenome-wide association level (p<9x10-8) following covariate adjustment.Protein-coding genesNWD1andLRP1were among the genes in which top-ranked dmCpGs were located for all analyses conducted. Mutations in these genes have previously been linked to neurological conditions.Epigenetic modifications have not previously been linked to risk-aversion using a population cohort but may represent important biomarkers of accumulated, complex determinants of this trait. Several striking results from this study support further analysis of DNA methylation as an important link between measurable biomarkers and health behaviours.",

Investigation of greenness-related DNA methylation profiles can contribute to mechanistic understanding of the health benefits of residential greenness.To identify DNA methylation profiles associated with greenness in the immediate surroundings of the residence.We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in 1938 blood samples (982 participants) from the Swiss Cohort Study on Air Pollution and Lung and Heart Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA). We estimated residential greenness based on normalized difference vegetation index at 30Â Ã—Â 30 m cell (green30) and 500Â m buffer (green500) around the residential address. We conducted epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify differentially methylated CpGs and regions, and enrichment tests by comparing to the CpGs that previous EWAS identified as associated with allergy, physical activity, and allostatic load-relevant biomarkers.We identified no genome-wide significant CpGs, but 163 and 56 differentially methylated regions for green30 and green500, respectively. Green30-related DNA methylation profiles showed enrichments in allergy, physical activity, and allostatic load, while green500-related methylation was enriched in allergy and allostatic load.Residential greenness may have health impacts through allergic sensitization, stress coping, or behavioral changes. Exposure to more proximal greenness may be more health-relevant.Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.",

Obesity-related genetic variants have been identified, but these explain little of the variation in BMI. Recent studies reported associations between DNA methylation and obesity, mostly in non-Asian populations.We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) on general adiposity (body mass index, BMI) and abdominal adiposity (waist circumference, WC) in 409 multi-ethnic Asian individuals and replicated BMI and waist-associated DNAÂ methylationÂ CpGs identified in other populations. The cross-lagged panel model and Mendelian randomization were used to assess the temporal relationship between methylation and BMI. The temporal relationship between the identified CpGs and inflammation and metabolic markers was also examined.EWAS identified 116 DNA methylation CpGs independently associated withÂ BMI and eight independently associated with WC at false discovery rate PFDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05 in 409 Asian samples. We replicated 110 BMI-associated CpGs previously reported in Europeans and identified six novel BMI-associated CpGs and two novel WC-associated CpGs. We observed high consistency in association direction ofÂ effect compared to studies in other populations. Causal relationship analyses indicated that BMI was more likely to be the cause of DNA methylation alteration, rather than the consequence. The causal analyses using BMI-associated methylation risk score also suggested that higher levels of the inflammation marker IL-6 were likely the consequence of methylation change.Our study provides evidence of an association between obesity and DNA methylation in multi-ethnic Asians and suggests that obesity can drive methylation change. The results also suggested possible causal influence that obesity-related methylation changes might have on inflammation and lipoprotein levels.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

Here, we report relationships between peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles measured using InfiniumÂ® MethylationEPIC BeadChip and AD progression in participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.The rate of cognitive decline from initial DNA sampling visit to subsequent visits was estimated by the slopes of the modified Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (mPACC; mPACCdigitand mPACCtrailsB) and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) plots using robust linear regression in cognitively normal (CN) participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), respectively. In addition, diagnosis conversion status was assessed using a dichotomized endpoint. Two CpG sites were significantly associated with the slope of mPACC in CN participants (Pâ€‰<â€‰5.79â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8[Bonferroni correction threshold]); cg00386386 was associated with the slope of mPACCdigit, and cg09422696 annotated to RP11-661A12.5 was associated with the slope of CDR-SB. No significant CpG sites associated with diagnosis conversion status were identified. Genes involved in cognition and learning were enriched. A total of 19, 13, and 5 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with the slopes of mPACCtrailsB, mPACCdigit, and CDR-SB, respectively, were identified by both comb-p and DMRcate algorithms; these included DMRs annotated to HOXA4.

Although exposure to prenatal PM2.5 and PM10 has cord blood DNA methylation signatures at birth, signature persistence into childhood and saliva cross-tissue applicability has not been tested. In the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a United States 20-city birth cohort, average residential PM2.5 and PM10 during the three months prior to birth was estimated using air quality monitors with inverse distance weighting. Saliva DNA methylation at ages 9 (n= 749) and 15 (n= 793) was measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450 k BeadArray. Cumulative DNA methylation scores for particulate matter were estimated by weighting participant DNA methylation at each site by independent meta-analysis effect estimates and standardizing the sums. Using a mixed-effects regression analysis, we tested the associations between cumulative DNA methylation scores at ages 9 and 15 and PM exposure during pregnancy, adjusted for child sex, age, race/ethnicity, maternal income-to-needs ratio, nonmartial birth status, and saliva cell-type proportions. Our study sample was 50.5% male, 56.3% non-Hispanic Black, and 19.8% Hispanic, with a median income-to-needs ratio of 1.4. Mean exposure levels for PM2.5 were 27.9 Î¼g/m3/day (standard deviation: 7.0; 23.7% of observations exceeded safety standards) and for PM10 were 15.0 Î¼g/m3/day (standard deviation: 3.1). An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 exposure (10.73 Î¼g/m3/day) was associated with a -0.0287 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM2.5 (95% CI: -0.0732, 0.0158,p= 0.20) across all participants. An interquartile range increase in PM10 exposure (3.20 Î¼g/m3/day) was associated with a -0.1472 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM10 (95% CI: -0.3038, 0.0095,p= 0.06) across all participants. The PM10 findings were driven by the age 15 subset where an interquartile range increase in PM10 exposure was associated with a -0.024 standard deviation lower cumulative DNA methylation score for PM10 (95% CI: -0.043, -0.005,p= 0.012). Findings were robust to adjustment for PM exposure at ages 1 and 3. In utero PM10-associated DNA methylation differences were identified at age 15 in saliva.

For low input samples, a limited number of methods for quantifying DNA methylation genome-wide has been evaluated. Here, we compared a series of input DNA amounts (1-10ng) from two methylome library preparation protocols, enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) and post-bisulfite adaptor tagging (PBAT) adapted from single-cell PBAT. EM-seq takes advantage of enzymatic activity while PBAT relies on conventional bisulfite conversion for detection of DNA methylation. We found that both methods accurately quantified DNA methylation genome-wide. They produced expected distribution patterns around genomic features, high C-T transition efficiency at non-CpG sites and high correlation between input amounts. However, EM-seq performed better in regard to library and sequencing quality, i.e. EM-seq produced larger insert sizes, higher alignment rates and higher library complexity with lower duplication rate compared to PBAT. Moreover, EM-seq demonstrated higher CpG coverage, better CpG site overlap and higher consistency between input series. In summary, our data suggests that EM-seq overall performed better than PBAT in whole genome methylation quantification of low input samples.",

We evaluate the per-read and per-site performance of CpG methylation prediction across different genomic contexts, CpG site coverage, and computational resources consumed by each tool. The seven tools exhibit different performances across the evaluation criteria. We show that the methylation prediction at regions with discordant DNA methylation patterns, intergenic regions, low CG density regions, and repetitive regions show room for improvement across all tools. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 5hmC levels at least partly contribute to the discrepancy between bisulfite and nanopore sequencing. Lastly, we provide an online DNA methylation database ( https://nanome.jax.org ) to display the DNA methylation levels detected by nanopore sequencing and bisulfite sequencing data across different genomic contexts.Our study is the first systematic benchmark of computational methods for detection of mammalian whole-genome DNA modifications in nanopore sequencing.

No,20211101,methods,34651232,A robust mean and variance test with application to high-dimensional phenotypes.,Eur J Epidemiol,"Most studies of continuous health-related outcomes examine differences in mean levels (location) of the outcome by exposure. However, identifying effects on the variability (scale) of an outcome, and combining tests of mean and variability (location-and-scale), could provide additional insights into biological mechanisms. A joint test could improve power for studies of high-dimensional phenotypes, such as epigenome-wide association studies of DNA methylation at CpG sites. One possible cause of heterogeneity of variance is a variable interacting with exposure in its effect on outcome, so a joint test of mean and variability could help in the identification of effect modifiers. Here, we review a scale test, based on the Brown-Forsythe test, for analysing variability of a continuous outcome with respect to both categorical and continuous exposures, and develop a novel joint location-and-scale score (JLSsc) test. These tests were compared to alternatives in simulations and used to test associations of mean and variability of DNA methylation with gender and gestational age using data from the Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomics Studies (ARIES). In simulations, the Brown-Forsythe and JLSsc tests retained correct type I error rates when the outcome was not normally distributed in contrast to the other approaches tested which all had inflated type I error rates. These tests also identifiedâ€‰>â€‰7500 CpG sites for which either mean or variability in cord blood methylation differed according to gender or gestational age. The Brown-Forsythe test and JLSsc are robust tests that can be used to detect associations not solely driven by a mean effect.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

Genetic variants in functional regions of the genome are enriched for complex trait heritability. Here, we introduce a method for polygenic prediction, LDpred-funct, that leverages trait-specific functional priors to increase prediction accuracy. We fit priors using the recently developed baseline-LD model, including coding, conserved, regulatory, and LD-related annotations. We analytically estimate posterior mean causal effect sizes and then use cross-validation to regularize these estimates, improving prediction accuracy for sparse architectures. We applied LDpred-funct to predict 21 highly heritable traits in the UK Biobank (avg N = 373 K as training data). LDpred-funct attained a +4.6% relative improvement in average prediction accuracy (avg prediction R2= 0.144; highest R2= 0.413 for height) compared to SBayesR (the best method that does not incorporate functional information). For height, meta-analyzing training data from UK Biobank and 23andMe cohorts (N = 1107 K) increased prediction R2to 0.431. Our results show that incorporating functional priors improves polygenic prediction accuracy, consistent with the functional architecture of complex traits.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

The role of epigenetics in disease development has been reported in several hereditary disorders, and epigenetic modifications are regarded as one of the earliest and most significant genomic aberrations that arise during carcinogenesis. Liquid biopsy can be employed for the detection of these epigenetic biomarkers. It consists of isolation (pre-analytical) and detection (analytical) phases. The choice of pre-analytical variables comprising cirDNA extraction and bisulfite conversion methods can affect the identification of cirDNA methylation. Indeed, different techniques give a different return of cirDNA, which confirms the importance of pre-analytical procedures in clinical diagnostics. Although novel techniques have been developed for the simplification of methylation analysis, the process remains complex, as the steps of DNA extraction, bisulfite treatment, and methylation detection are each carried out separately. Recent studies have noted the absence of any standard method for the pre-analytical processing of methylated cirDNA. We have therefore conducted a comprehensive and systematic review of the important pre-analytical and analytical variables and the patient-related factors which form the basis of our guidelines for analyzing methylated cirDNA in liquid biopsy.Â© 2021.

However, there is no evidence on how stool miRNA profiles change according to an individual's age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) or how lifestyle habits influence the expression levels of these molecules. We explored the relationship between the stool miRNA levels and common traits (sex, age, BMI, and menopausal status) or lifestyle habits (physical activity, smoking status, coffee, and alcohol consumption) as derived by a self-reported questionnaire, using small RNA-sequencing data of samples from 335 healthy subjects. We detected 151 differentially expressed miRNAs associated with one variable and 52 associated with at least two. Differences in miR-638 levels were associated with age, sex, BMI, and smoking status. The highest number of differentially expressed miRNAs was associated with BMI (nâ€‰=â€‰92) and smoking status (nâ€‰=â€‰84), with several miRNAs shared between them. Functional enrichment analyses revealed the involvement of the miRNA target genes in pathways coherent with the analysed variables.

However, genetic risk factors not covered by GWAS also play pivotal roles in these illnesses. Tandem repeats, which are likely functional but frequently overlooked by GWAS, may account for an important proportion in the ""missing heritability"" of psychiatric disorders. Despite difficulties in characterizing and quantifying tandem repeats in the genome, studies have been carried out in an attempt to describe impact of tandem repeats on gene regulation and human phenotypes. In this review, we have introduced recent research progress regarding the genomic distribution and regulatory mechanisms of tandem repeats. We have also summarized the current knowledge of the genetic architecture and biological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders brought by studies of tandem repeats. These findings suggest that tandem repeats, in candidate psychiatric risk genes or in different levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) with psychiatric GWAS SNPs and haplotypes, may modulate biological phenotypes related to psychiatric disorders (e.g., cognitive function and brain physiology) through regulating alternative splicing, promoter activity, enhancer activity and so on. In addition, many tandem repeats undergo tight natural selection in the human lineage, and likely exert crucial roles in human brain evolution. Taken together, the putative roles of tandem repeats in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders is strongly implicated, and using examples from previous literatures, we wish to call for further attention to tandem repeats in the post-GWAS era of psychiatric disorders.Â© 2021.

However, little is known about associations between race-related stressors and premature biological aging that confer the risk of adverse health outcomes. Even less is known about the mechanisms through which race-related stressors may be associated with accelerated aging. Early evidence suggests psychological processes such as anger, and particularly the internalization of anger, may play a role.In a community sample of predominantly low-income Black adults (n = 219; age = 45.91 [12.33] years; 64% female), the present study examined the association of race-related LSE (as defined by exposure to racial discrimination, trauma, and stressful life events) and epigenetic age acceleration through anger expression.Internalized and externalized anger expression were each significantly associated with LSE and age acceleration. Although LSE was not directly associated with age acceleration (Î”R2 = 0.001, p = .64), we found that greater LSE was indirectly associated with age acceleration through increases in internalized, but not externalized, anger (indirect effect: Î² = 0.03, standard error = 0.02, 95% confidence interval = 0.003 to 0.08; total effect: Î² = 0.02, 95% confidence interval = -0.25 to 0.31).These results suggest race-related LSE may elicit the internalization of anger, which, along with the externalization of anger, may initiate detrimental epigenetic alterations that confer the risk of adverse health outcomes. These findings lay the groundwork for longitudinal studies of the association between race-related stress and racial health disparities.Copyright Â© 2021 by the American Psychosomatic Society.",

Our previous results demonstrated that a subset of gene promoters, termed Epromoters, work as bona fide enhancers and regulate distal gene expression. Here, we hypothesized that Epromoters play a key role in the coordination of rapid gene induction during the inflammatory response. Using a high-throughput reporter assay we explored the function of Epromoters in response to type I interferon. We find that clusters of IFNa-induced genes are frequently associated with Epromoters and that these regulatory elements preferentially recruit the STAT1/2 and IRF transcription factors and distally regulate the activation of interferon-response genes. Consistently, we identified and validated the involvement of Epromoter-containing clusters in the regulation of LPS-stimulated macrophages. Our findings suggest that Epromoters function as a local hub recruiting the key TFs required for coordinated regulation of gene clusters during the inflammatory response.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

Methods based on chromatin conformation capture have mapped chromatin structures in neuronal systems such as in vitro differentiated neurons, neurons isolated through fluorescence-activated cell sorting from cortical tissues pooled from different animals and from dissociated whole hippocampi4-6. However, changes in chromatin organization captured by imaging, such as the relocation of Bdnf away from the nuclear periphery after activation7, are invisible with such approaches8. Here we developed immunoGAM, an extension of genome architecture mapping (GAM)2,9, to map 3D chromatin topology genome-wide in specific brain cell types, without tissue disruption, from single animals. GAM is a ligation-free technology that maps genome topology by sequencing the DNA content from thin (about 220â€‰nm) nuclear cryosections. Chromatin interactions are identified from the increased probability of co-segregation of contacting loci across a collection of nuclear slices. ImmunoGAM expands the scope of GAM to enable the selection of specific cell types using low cell numbers (approximately 1,000â€‰cells) within a complex tissue and avoids tissue dissociation2,10. We report cell-type specialized 3D chromatin structures at multiple genomic scales that relate to patterns of gene expression. We discover extensive 'melting' of long genes when they are highly expressed and/or have high chromatin accessibility. The contacts most specific of neuron subtypes contain genes associated with specialized processes, such as addiction and synaptic plasticity, which harbour putative binding sites for neuronal transcription factors within accessible chromatin regions. Moreover, sensory receptor genes are preferentially found in heterochromatic compartments in brain cells, which establish strong contacts across tens of megabases. Our results demonstrate that highly specific chromatin conformations in brain cells are tightly related to gene regulation mechanisms and specialized functions.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

Epigenetic modifications of the chromatin confer plasticity to the genetic information and give insight into how tissues use the genetic information to adapt to environmental factors. The oral mucosa is particularly exposed to environmental stressors such as a variable microbiota. Likewise, persistent oral inflammation is the most important intrinsic risk factor for the oral inflammatory disease periodontitis and has strong potential to alter DNA-methylation patterns. The aim of the current study was to identify epigenetic changes of the oral masticatory mucosa in response to long-term inflammation that resulted in periodontitis.Genome-wide CpG methylation of both inflamed and clinically uninflamed solid gingival tissue biopsies of 60 periodontitis cases was analyzed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We validated and performed cell-type deconvolution for infiltrated immune cells using the EpiDish algorithm. Effect sizes of DMPs in gingival epithelial and fibroblast cells were estimated and adjusted for confounding factors using our recently developed ""intercept-method"". In the current EWAS, we identified various genes that showed significantly different methylation between periodontitis-inflamed and uninflamed oral mucosa in periodontitis patients. The strongest differences were observed for genes with roles in wound healing (ROBO2, PTP4A3), cell adhesion (LPXN) and innate immune response (CCL26, DNAJC1, BPI). Enrichment analyses implied a role of epigenetic changes for vesicle trafficking gene sets.Our results imply specific adaptations of the oral mucosa to a persistent inflammatory environment that involve wound repair, barrier integrity, and innate immune defense.Â© 2021.

DNA methylation changes may confer risk or protection for PTSD following rape by regulating the expression of genes implicated in pathways affected by PTSD. We aimed to: (1) identify epigenome-wide differences in methylation profiles between rape-exposed women with and without PTSD at 3-months post-rape, in a demographically and ethnically similar group, drawn from a low-income setting; (2) validate and replicate the findings of the epigenome-wide analysis in selected genes (BRSK2 and ADCYAP1); and (3) investigate baseline and longitudinal changes in BRSK2 and ADCYAP1 methylation over six months in relation to change in PTSD symptom scores over 6 months, in the combined discovery/validation and replication samples (nâ€‰=â€‰96). Rape-exposed women (nâ€‰=â€‰852) were recruited from rape clinics in the Rape Impact Cohort Evaluation (RICE) umbrella study. Epigenome-wide differentially methylated CpG sites between rape-exposed women with (nâ€‰=â€‰24) and without (nâ€‰=â€‰24) PTSD at 3-months post-rape were investigated using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip in a discovery cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰48). Validation (nâ€‰=â€‰47) and replication (nâ€‰=â€‰49) of BRSK2 and ADCYAP1 methylation findings were investigated using EpiTYPER technology. Longitudinal change in BRSK2 and ADCYAP1 was also investigated using EpiTYPER technology in the combined sample (nâ€‰=â€‰96). In the discovery sample, after adjustment for multiple comparisons, one differentially methylated CpG site (chr10: 61385771/ cg01700569, pâ€‰=â€‰0.049) and thirty-four differentially methylated regions were associated with PTSD status at 3-months post-rape. Decreased BRSK2 and ADCYAP1 methylation at 3-months and 6-months post-rape were associated with increased PTSD scores at the same time points, but these findings did not remain significant in adjusted models. In conclusion, decreased methylation of BRSK2 may result in abnormal neuronal polarization, synaptic development, vesicle formation, and disrupted neurotransmission in individuals with PTSD. PTSD symptoms may also be mediated by differential methylation of the ADCYAP1 gene which is involved in stress regulation. Replication of these findings is required to determine whether ADCYAP1 and BRSK2 are biomarkers of PTSD and potential therapeutic targets.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

No,20211129,methods,34765918,How many markers are needed to robustly determine a cell's type?,iScience,"Our understanding of cell types has advanced considerably with the publication of single-cell atlases. Marker genes play an essential role for experimental validation and computational analyses such as physiological characterization, annotation, and deconvolution. However, a framework for quantifying marker replicability and selecting replicable markers is currently lacking. Here, using high-quality data from the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), we systematically investigate marker replicability for 85 neuronal cell types. We show that, due to dataset-specific noise, we need to combine 5 datasets to obtain robust differentially expressed (DE) genes, particularly for rare populations and lowly expressed genes. We estimate that 10 to 200 meta-analytic markers provide optimal downstream performance and make available replicable marker lists for the 85 BICCN cell types. Replicable marker lists condense interpretable and generalizable information about cell types, opening avenues for downstream applications, including cell type annotation, selection of gene panels, and bulk data deconvolution.Â© 2021 The Authors.",

A DNA methylation approach in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is attractive for the noninvasive detection of GC. Here, we performed genome-scale cfDNA methylation analysis in patients with GC.We used MCTA-Seq, a genome-scale DNA methylation analysis method, on the plasma samples of patients with GC (n = 89) and control participants (n = 82), as well as 28 pairs of GC and adjacent noncancerous tissues. The capacity of the method for detecting GC and discriminating GC from colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was assessed.We identified 153 cfDNA methylation biomarkers, including DOCK10, CABIN1, and KCNQ5, for detecting GC in blood. A panel of these biomarkers gave a sensitivity of 44%, 59%, 78%, and 100% for stage I, II, III, and IV tumors, respectively, at a specificity of 92%. CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) tumors and NON-CIMP tumors could be distinguished and detected effectively. We also identified several hundreds of cfDNA biomarkers differentially methylated between GC, CRC, and HCC, and showed that MCTA-Seq can discriminate early-stage GC, CRC, and HCC in blood by using a high specificity (approximately 100%) algorithm.Our comprehensive analyses provided valuable data on cfDNA methylation biomarkers of GC and showed the promise of cfDNA methylation for the blood-based noninvasive detection of GC.Â© American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2021.",
No,20211129,prediction,34789321,"Epigenetic modelling of former, current and never smokers.",Clin Epigenetics,"DNA methylation (DNAm) performs excellently in the discrimination of current and former smokers from never smokers, where AUCsâ€‰>â€‰0.9 are regularly reported using a single CpG site (cg05575921; AHRR). However, there is a paucity of DNAm models which attempt to distinguish current, former and never smokers as individual classes. Derivation of a robust DNAm model that accurately distinguishes between current, former and never smokers would be particularly valuable to epidemiological research (as a more accurate smoking definition vs. self-report) and could potentially translate to clinical settings. Therefore, we appraise 4 DNAm models of ternary smoking status (that is, current, former and never smokers): methylation at cg05575921 (AHRR model), weighted scores from 13 CpGs created by Maas et al. (Maas model), weighted scores from a LASSO model of candidate smoking CpGs from the literature (candidate CpG LASSO model), and weighted scores from a LASSO model supplied with genome-wide 450K data (agnostic LASSO model). Discrimination is assessed by AUC, whilst classification accuracy is assessed by accuracy and kappa, derived from confusion matrices.We find that DNAm can classify ternary smoking status with reasonable accuracy, including when applied to external data. Ternary classification using only DNAm far exceeds the classification accuracy of simply assigning all classes as the most prevalent class (63.7% vs. 36.4%). Further, we develop a DNAm classifier which performs well in discriminating current from former smokers (agnostic LASSO model AUC in external validation data: 0.744). Finally, across our DNAm models, we show evidence of enrichment for biological pathways and human phenotype ontologies relevant to smoking, such as haemostasis, molybdenum cofactor synthesis, body fatness and social behaviours, providing evidence of the generalisability of our classifiers.Our findings suggest that DNAm can classify ternary smoking status with close to 65% accuracy. Both the ternary smoking status classifiers and current versus former smoking status classifiers address the present lack of former smoker classification in epigenetic literature; essential if DNAm classifiers are to adequately relate to real-world populations. To improve performance further, additional focus on improving discrimination of current from former smokers is necessary.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

The goal of this study was to create a methylation risk score (MRS) for metabolic syndrome (MetS), demonstrating the utility of MRS across race groups using cross-sectional data from the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN, N = 614 African Americans (AA)) and the Genetics of Lipid Lowering Drugs and Diet Network (GOLDN, N = 995 European Americans (EA)). To demonstrate this, we first selected cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) sites measured on Illumina Methyl450 arrays previously reported to be significantly associated with MetS and/or component conditions in more than one race/ethnic group (CPT1A cg00574958, PHOSPHO1 cg02650017, ABCG1 cg06500161, SREBF1 cg11024682, SOCS3 cg18181703, TXNIP cg19693031). Second, we calculated the parameter estimates for the 6 CpGs in the HyperGEN data (AA) and used the beta estimates as weights to construct a MRS in HyperGEN (AA), which was validated in GOLDN (EA). We performed association analyses using logistic mixed models to test the association between the MRS and MetS, adjusting for covariates. Results showed the MRS was significantly associated with MetS in both populations. In summary, a MRS for MetS was a strong predictor for the condition across two race groups, suggesting MRS may be useful to examine metabolic disease risk or related complications across race/ethnic groups.",
No,20211129,prediction,34732805,The relationship of smoking to cg05575921 methylation in blood and saliva DNA samples from several studies.,Sci Rep,"Numerous studies have shown that cg05575921 methylation decreases in response to smoking. However, secondary to methodological issues, the magnitude and dose dependency of that response is as of yet unclear. This lack of certainty is a barrier to the use of DNA methylation clinically to assess and monitor smoking status. To better define this relationship, we conducted a joint analysis of methylation sensitive PCR digital (MSdPCR) assessments of cg05575921 methylation in whole blood and/or saliva DNA to smoking using samples from 421 smokers and 423 biochemically confirmed non-smokers from 4 previously published studies. We found that cg05575921 methylation manifested a curvilinear dose dependent decrease in response to increasing cigarette consumption. In whole blood DNA, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) of cg05575921 methylation for predicting daily smoking status was 0.98. In saliva DNA, the gross AUC was 0.91 with correction for cellular heterogeneity improving the AUC to 0.94. Methylation status was significantly associated with theÂ Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence score, but with significant sampling heterogeneity. We conclude that MSdPCR assessments of cg05575921 methylation are a potentially powerful, clinically implementable tool for the assessment and management of smoking.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",
No,20211129,prediction,34702360,Validating biomarkers and models for epigenetic inference of alcohol consumption from blood.,Clin Epigenetics,"Information on long-term alcohol consumption is relevant for medical and public health research, disease therapy, and other areas. Recently, DNA methylation-based inference of alcohol consumption from blood was reported with high accuracy, but these results were based on employing the same dataset for model training and testing, which can lead to accuracy overestimation. Moreover, only subsets of alcohol consumption categories were used, which makes it impossible to extrapolate such models to the general population. By using data from eight population-based European cohorts (Nâ€‰=â€‰4677), we internally and externally validated the previously reported biomarkers and models for epigenetic inference of alcohol consumption from blood and developed new models comprising all data from all categories.By employing data from six European cohorts (Nâ€‰=â€‰2883), we empirically tested the reproducibility of the previously suggested biomarkers and prediction models via ten-fold internal cross-validation. In contrast to previous findings, all seven models based on 144-CpGs yielded lower mean AUCs compared to the models with less CpGs. For instance, the 144-CpG heavy versus non-drinkers model gave an AUC of 0.78â€‰Â±â€‰0.06, while the 5 and 23 CpG models achieved 0.83â€‰Â±â€‰0.05, respectively. The transportability of the models was empirically tested via external validation in three independent European cohorts (Nâ€‰=â€‰1794), revealing high AUC variance between datasets within models. For instance, the 144-CpG heavy versus non-drinkers model yielded AUCs ranging from 0.60 to 0.84 between datasets. The newly developed models that considered data from all categories showed low AUCs but gave low AUC variation in the external validation. For instance, the 144-CpG heavy and at-risk versus light and non-drinkers model achieved AUCs of 0.67â€‰Â±â€‰0.02 in the internal cross-validation and 0.61-0.66 in the external validation datasets.The outcomes of our internal and external validation demonstrate that the previously reported prediction models suffer from both overfitting and accuracy overestimation. Our results show that the previously proposed biomarkers are not yet sufficient for accurate and robust inference of alcohol consumption from blood. Overall, our findings imply that DNA methylation prediction biomarkers and models need to be improved considerably before epigenetic inference of alcohol consumption from blood can be considered for practical applications.Â© 2021.

We employed multiplex bisulfite sequencing (MBS) based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) to measure methylation of 34 CpG sites in PBMC DNA from 654 patients that were divided into a training set (n= 442) and a test set (n= 212). Using the training set, we selected and built a six-CpG-scorer (namely, cg14171514, cg07721852, cg05166871, cg18087306, cg05213896, and cg18772205), applying least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. We performed multivariable analyses of four candidate risk predictors (namely, six-CpG-scorer, age, sex, and AFP level), using 20 times imputation of missing data, non-linearly transformed, and backwards feature selection with logistic regression. The final model's regression coefficients were calculated according to ""Rubin's Rules"". The diagnostic accuracy of the model was internally validated with a 10,000 bootstrap validation dataset and then applied to the test set for validation.The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the model was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.85) and it showed good calibration and decision curve analysis. Using enhanced bootstrap validation, adjusted C-statistics and adjusted Brier score were 0.809 and 0.199, respectively. The model also showed an AUROC value of 0.84 (95% CI 0.79-0.88) of diagnosis for early HCC in the test set.Our model based on the six-CpG-scorer was a reliable diagnosis tool for early HCC from HBVLD. The usage of the MBS method can realize large-scale detection of CpG sites in clinical diagnosis of early HCC and benefit the majority of patients.Copyright Â© 2021 Li, Song, Qin, Li, Jiang, Ren, Zang, Sun, Zhao and Zhang.",

Therefore, it can be expected that a panel of stool-based biomarkers will become a screening method for colorectal cancer (CRC) and adenoma with better sensitivity and specificity, aiming to decrease the incidence and mortality of CRC. In this study, the methylation of secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), hyperplastic polyposis protein 1 (HPP1), Î±-internexin (INA), Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1), tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2), ikaros family zinc finger protein 1 (IKZF1), and spastic paraplegia 20 (SPG20) were detected in stool samples from patients with CRC, adenoma, polyps, and healthy controls, respectively, and these biomarkers were used to establish a logistic regression model for classification. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn to assess the importance of each biomarker. Subsequently, a biomarker or combination of biomarkers was analyzed for early screening of high-risk neoplasm. The data showed that when a single biomarker was used for CRC screening, the sensitivity ranged from 63.9% to 76.8%, the area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0.821 to 0.875, and the accuracy ranged from 77.0% to 84.5%. Finally, the methylation of SFRP1, HPP1, TFPI2, and IKZF1 was selected using a backward stepwise method in the multivariate logistic analysis according to the Akaike Information Criterion.

However, the biological processes that are modulated by recombinant hGH are not well characterized and associated blood serum proteins may constitute new biomarkers for hGH misuse.Thirty-five recreational athletes were enrolled in a study to investigate the time- and dose-dependent response of serum protein levels to recombinant hGH administration. Participants were randomly assigned to 4 groups, receiving 1 of 3 different doses of recombinant hGH or a placebo. Bio samples were collected at 22 time points over a period of 13 weeks, starting 4 weeks before treatment, during 3 weeks of treatment, and at 6 weeks' follow-up. A total of 749 serum samples were analyzed for 1305 protein markers using the SOMAscan proteomics platform.We identified 66 proteins that significantly associated with recombinant hGH administration and dosage, including well known hGH targets, such as IGF1, but also previously unknown hGH-related proteins (eg, protease inhibitors, WFIKKN1, and chemokines, CCL2). Network analysis revealed changes in specific biological pathways, mainly related to the immune system and glucose metabolism.Our analysis suggests that hGH administration affects biological processes more strongly than previously acknowledged. Some of the proteins were dysregulated even after hGH treatment and could potentially be developed into biomarkers for hGH misuse. Moreover, our findings suggest new roles for hGH-associated proteins in the etiology of hGH-related diseases and may indicate new risks that may be associated with hGH misuse.Â© The Author(s) 2021.

A total of 308 samples were included in the study. In the reference cohort, 239 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples were histopathologically classified as MCD, including 12 major subtype pathologies. They were compared to 15 FFPE samples from surgical non-MCD cortices and 11 FFPE samples from post-mortem non-epilepsy controls. We applied three different statistical approaches to decipher the DNA methylation pattern of histopathological MCD entities, i.e., pairwise comparison, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms. Our deep learning model, which represented a shallow neuronal network, achieved the highest level of accuracy. A test cohort of 43 independent surgical samples from different epilepsy centers was used to test the precision of our DNA methylation-based MCD classifier. All samples from the test cohort were accurately assigned to their disease classes by the algorithm. These data demonstrate DNA methylation-based MCD classification suitability across major histopathological entities amenable to epilepsy surgery and age groups and will help establish an integrated diagnostic classification scheme for epilepsy-associated MCD.Â© 2021.

In this project, we analyzed associations between prenatal depression and DNAm from cord blood from participants of the South African Drakenstein Child Health Study. We examined DNAm in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of 248 mother-child pairs. DNAm was measured using the Infinium MethylationEPIC (Nâ€‰=â€‰145) and the Infinium HumanMethylation450 (Nâ€‰=â€‰103) arrays. Prenatal depression scores, obtained with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), were analyzed as continuous and dichotomized variables. We used linear robust models to estimate associations between depression and newborn DNAm, adjusted for measured (smoking status, household income, sex, preterm birth, cell type proportions, and genetic principal components) and unmeasured confounding using Cate and Bacon algorithms. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for multiple testing. DMRcate and dmrff were used to test for differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Differential DNAm was significantly associated with BDI-II variables, in cg16473797 (Î” betaâ€‰=â€‰-1.10E-02, pâ€‰=â€‰6.87E-08), cg23262030 (Î” beta per BDI-II total IQRâ€‰=â€‰1.47E-03, pâ€‰=â€‰1.18E-07), and cg04859497 (Î” betaâ€‰=â€‰-6.42E-02, pâ€‰=â€‰1.06E-09). Five DMRs were associated with at least two depression variables. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings and investigate their biological impact.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of global brain imaging phenotypes have the potential to reveal the mechanisms of brain health and disease and can lead to better predictive analytics through the development of risk scores.We perform an EWAS of global brain volumes in Generation Scotland using peripherally measured whole blood DNA methylation (DNAm) from two assessments, (i) at baseline recruitment, ~6Â years prior to MRI assessment (NÂ =Â 672) and (ii) concurrent with MRI assessment (N=565). Four CpGs at baseline were associated with global cerebral white matter, total grey matter, and whole-brain volume (Bonferroni pâ‰¤7.41Ã—10-8, Î²range= -1.46x10-6to 9.59Â Ã—Â 10-7). These CpGs were annotated to genes implicated in brain-related traits, including psychiatric disorders, development, and ageing. We did not find significant associations in the meta-analysis of the EWAS of the two sets concurrent with imaging at the corrected level.These findings reveal global brain structural changes associated with DNAm measured ~6Â years previously, indicating a potential role of early DNAm modifications in brain structure. Although concurrent DNAm was not associated with global brain structure, the nominally significant findings identified here present a rationale for future investigation of associations between DNA methylation and structural brain phenotypes in larger population-based samples.",

Various tissues display sex differences in DNA methylation; however, this has not yet been explored in skeletal muscle, despite skeletal muscle being among the tissues with the most transcriptomic sex differences. For the first time, we investigated the effect of sex on autosomal DNA methylation in human skeletal muscle across three independent cohorts (Gene SMART, FUSION, and GSE38291) using a meta-analysis approach, totalling 369 human muscle samples (222 males and 147 females), and integrated this with known sex-biased transcriptomics. We found 10,240 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.005, 94% of which were hypomethylated in males, and gene set enrichment analysis revealed that differentially methylated genes were involved in muscle contraction and substrate metabolism. We then investigated biological factors underlying DNA methylation sex differences and found that circulating hormones were not associated with differential methylation at sex-biased DNA methylation loci; however, these sex-specific loci were enriched for binding sites of hormone-related transcription factors (with top TFs including androgen (AR), estrogen (ESR1), and glucocorticoid (NR3C1) receptors). Fibre type proportions were associated with differential methylation across the genome, as well as across 16% of sex-biased DNA methylation loci (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.005). Integration of DNA methylomic results with transcriptomic data from the GTEx database and the FUSION cohort revealed 326 autosomal genes that display sex differences at both the epigenome and transcriptome levels. Importantly, transcriptional sex-biased genes were overrepresented among epigenetic sex-biased genes (p valueâ€‰=â€‰4.6e-13), suggesting differential DNA methylation and gene expression between male and female muscle are functionally linked. Finally, we validated expression of three genes with large effect sizes (FOXO3A, ALDH1A1, and GGT7) in the Gene SMART cohort with qPCR. GGT7, involved in antioxidant metabolism, displays male-biased expression as well as lower methylation in males across the three cohorts. In conclusion, we uncovered 8420 genes that exhibit DNA methylation differences between males and females in human skeletal muscle that may modulate mechanisms controlling muscle metabolism and health.Â© 2021.

We examined the role of DNA methylation on the association between PA and CVD.The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort Exam 5 data with 1065 participants free of CVD were used for final analysis. The quartile categorical total PA variable was created by activity intensity (METs/week). During a median follow-up of 4.0â€‰years, 69 participants developed CVD. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to provide genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in purified human monocytes (CD14+). We identified 23 candidate DNA methylation loci to be associated with both PA and CVD. We used the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to test the complex relationships among multiple variables and the roles of mediators. Three of the 23 identified loci (corresponding to genes VPS13D, PIK3CD and VPS45) remained as significant mediators in the final SEM model along with other covariates. Bridged by the three genes, the 2nd PA quartile (Î²â€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.959; 95%CI: -â€‰1.554 to -â€‰0.449) and the 3rd PA quartile (Î²â€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.944; 95%CI: -â€‰1.628 to -â€‰0.413) showed the greatest inverse associations with CVD development, while the 4th PA quartile had a relatively weaker inverse association (Î²â€‰=â€‰-â€‰0.355; 95%CI: -â€‰0.713 to -â€‰0.124).The current study is among the first to simultaneously examine the relationships among PA, DNA methylation, and CVD in a large cohort with long-term exposure. We identified three DNA methylation loci bridged the association between PA and CVD. The function of the identified genes warrants further investigation in the pathogenesis of CVD.Â© 2021.

However, EWAS of PM2.5elements (PEs), reflecting different emission sources, are very limited.We performed EWAS of short- and intermediate-term exposure to PM2.5and 13 PEs. We hypothesized that significant changes in DNAm may vary by PM2.5mass and its elements.We repeatedly collected blood samples in the Normative Aging Study and measured leukocyte DNA methylation (DNAm) with the Illumina HumanMethylation450K BeadChip. We collected daily PM2.5and 13 PEs at a fixed central site. To estimate the associations between each PE and DNAm at individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, we incorporated a distributed-lag (0-27 d) term in the setting of median regression with subject-specific intercept and examined cumulative lag associations. We also accounted for selection bias due to loss to follow-up and mortality prior to enrollment. Significantly differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were identified using Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. We further conducted regional and pathway analyses to identify significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and pathways.We included 695 men with 1,266 visits between 1999 and 2013. The subjects had a mean age of 75Â years. The significant DMPs, DMRs, and pathways varied by to PM2.5total mass and PEs. For example, PM2.5total mass was associated with 2,717 DMPs and 10,470 DMRs whereas Pb was associated with 3,173 DMPs and 637 DMRs. The identified pathways by PM2.5mass were mostly involved in mood disorders, neuroplasticity, immunity, and inflammation, whereas the pathways associated with motor vehicles (BC, Cu, Pb, and Zn) were related with cardiovascular disease and cancer (e.g., ""PPARs signaling"").PM2.5and PE were associated with methylation changes at multiple probes and along multiple pathways, in ways that varied by particle components.Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors.

To profile the activity of gene regulatory elements in diverse cell types and tissues in the human body, we applied single-cell chromatin accessibility assays to 30 adult human tissue types from multiple donors. We integrated these datasets with previous single-cell chromatin accessibility data from 15 fetal tissue types to reveal the status of open chromatin for âˆ¼1.2 million candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in 222 distinct cell types comprised of >1.3 million nuclei. We used these chromatin accessibility maps to delineate cell-type-specificity of fetal and adult human cCREs and to systematically interpret the noncoding variants associated with complex human traits and diseases. This rich resource provides a foundation for the analysis of gene regulatory programs in human cell types across tissues, life stages, and organ systems.Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors.

The Grail Paradigm.,Diagnostics (Basel),"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a new pan-cancer tumor marker with important applications for patient prognosis, monitoring progression, and assessing the success of the therapeutic response. Another important goal is an early cancer diagnosis. There is currently a debate if ctDNA can be used for early cancer detection due to the small tumor burden and low mutant allele fraction (MAF). We compare our previous calculations on the size of detectable cancers by ctDNA analysis with the latest experimental data from Grail's clinical trial. Current ctDNA-based diagnostic methods could predictably detect tumors of sizes greater than 10-15 mm in diameter. When tumors are of this size or smaller, their MAF is about 0.01% (one tumor DNA molecule admixed with 10,000 normal DNA molecules). The use of 10 mL of blood (4 mL of plasma) will likely contain less than a complete cancer genome, thus rendering the diagnosis of cancer impossible. Grail's new data confirm the low sensitivity for early cancer detection (<30% for Stage I-II tumors, <20% for Stage I tumors), but specificity was high at 99.5%. According to these latest data, the sensitivity of the Grail test is less than 20% in Stage I disease, casting doubt if this test could become a viable pan-cancer clinical screening tool.",

However, none Asian ancestry studies have been included in this or previous meta-analyses. I performed a GWAS on blood DNA methylation (DNAm) levels of 2309 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants. Owing to the fact that the sample size of an individual GWAS of DNAm data is still not large, I adopted the ""prioritized subset analysis"" (PSA) method to boost the power of a GWAS. The four epigenetic clocks and the two epigenetic surrogate markers were investigated, respectively. I replicated 21 out of the 137 aging-associated genetic loci by applying the PSA method to the TWB DNAm data. Moreover, I identified five novel loci, including rs117530284 that was associated with the ""epigenetic age acceleration"" (EAA) according to Lu et al.'s GrimAge (called ""GrimEAA""). Considering 16 covariates (sex, BMI, smoking status, drinking status, regular exercise, educational attainment, and the first 10 ancestry principal components), each ""A"" allele of rs117530284 in the IBA57 gene was found to be associated with a 1.5943-year GrimEAA (95% C.I. = [1.0748, 2.1138]). IBA57 is a protein coding gene and is associated with multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndromes. A decline in mitochondrial activity and quality is associated with aging and many age-related diseases. This is one of the first DNAm GWAS for individuals of Asian ancestry.Â© The Author(s) 2021.

No,20220131,dnam age,34980250,Epigenetic biomarkers of ageing are predictive of mortality risk in a longitudinal clinical cohort of individuals diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer.,Clin Epigenetics,"Epigenetic clocks are biomarkers of ageing derived from DNA methylation levels at a subset of CpG sites. The difference between age predicted by these clocks and chronological age, termed ""epigenetic age acceleration"", has been shown to predict age-related disease and mortality. We aimed to assess the prognostic value of epigenetic age acceleration and a DNA methylation-based mortality risk score with all-cause mortality in a prospective clinical cohort of individuals with head and neck cancer: Head and Neck 5000. We investigated two markers of intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAAHorvath and IEAAHannum), one marker of extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA), one optimised to predict physiological dysregulation (AgeAccelPheno), one optimised to predict lifespan (AgeAccelGrim) and a DNA methylation-based predictor of mortality (ZhangScore). Cox regression models were first used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of epigenetic age acceleration with all-cause mortality in people with oropharyngeal cancer (nâ€‰=â€‰408; 105 deaths). The added prognostic value of epigenetic markers compared to a clinical model including age, sex, TNM stage and HPV status was then evaluated.IEAAHannum and AgeAccelGrim were associated with mortality risk after adjustment for clinical and lifestyle factors (HRs per standard deviation [SD] increase in age accelerationâ€‰=â€‰1.30 [95% CI 1.07, 1.57; pâ€‰=â€‰0.007] and 1.40 [95% CI 1.06, 1.83; pâ€‰=â€‰0.016], respectively). There was weak evidence that the addition of AgeAccelGrim to the clinical model improved 3-year mortality prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.80 vs. 0.77; p value for differenceâ€‰=â€‰0.069).In the setting of a large, clinical cohort of individuals with head and neck cancer, our study demonstrates the potential of epigenetic markers of ageing to enhance survival prediction in people with oropharyngeal cancer, beyond established prognostic factors. Our findings have potential uses in both clinical and non-clinical contexts: to aid treatment planning and improve patient stratification.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

We aimed to compare and validate the predictive ability of these scores and frailty in relation to mortality in a population-based cohort from Germany.DNA methylation in whole blood was measured by the Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip kit (EPIC, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in two random subsets of the ESTHER cohort study (nÂ =Â 741 and nÂ =Â 1030). AgeAccelPheno, AgeAccelGrim, and a revised MRscore to adapt EPIC, the MRscore with 8 CpGs (MRscore-8CpGs), were calculated. Frailty was assessed by a frailty index (FI).During 17 years of follow-up, 458 deaths were observed. All DNAm algorithms and FI were positively correlated with each other. AgeAccelPheno, AgeAccelGrim, MRscore, and FI showed independent associations with all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (95% CI) per SD increaseÂ =Â 1Â·32 (1Â·19-1Â·46), 1Â·47 (1Â·32-1Â·64), 1Â·73 (1Â·49-2Â·01), and 1Â·31 (1Â·20-1Â·43), respectively]. Harrell's C-statistic was 0Â·710 for a model predicting mortality by age, sex, and leukocyte composition and increased to 0Â·759 in a model including MRscore-8CpGs and FI. The predictive performance was further improved (Harrell's C-statisticÂ =Â 0Â·766) when additionally including AgeAccelPheno and AgeAccelGrim into the model.The combination of a DNA methylation score based on 8 CpGs only and an easy to ascertain frailty index may strongly enhance mortality prediction beyond age and sex.The ESTHER study was funded by grants from the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg state Ministry of Science, Research and Arts (Stuttgart, Germany), the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Berlin, Germany), the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (Berlin, Germany), and the Saarland State Ministry of Health, Social Affairs, Women and the Family (SaarbrÃ¼cken, Germany).

Interventions delaying aging in animal models are well established; however, most lack validation in humans. The length of human lifespan makes it impractical to perform survival analysis. Instead, aging biomarkers, such as DNA methylation (DNAm) clocks, have been developed to monitor biological age. Herein we report a retrospective analysis of DNA methylation age in 42 individuals taking RejuvantÂ®, an alpha-ketoglutarate based formulation, for an average period of 7 months. DNAm testing was performed at baseline and by the end of treatment with RejuvantÂ® supplementation. Remarkably, individuals showed an average decrease in biological aging of 8 years (p-value=6.538x10-12). Furthermore, the supplementation with RejuvantÂ® is robust to individual differences, as indicated by the fact that a large majority of participants decreased their biological age. Moreover, we found that RejuvantÂ® is of additional benefit to chronologically and biologically older individuals. While continued testing, particularly in a placebo-controlled design, is required, the nearly 8-year reversal in the biological age of individuals taking RejuvantÂ® for 4 to 10 months is noteworthy, making the natural product cocktail an intriguing candidate to affect human aging.",

We distilled this two-decade Pace of Aging into a single-time-point DNA-methylation blood-test using elastic-net regression and a DNA-methylation dataset restricted to exclude probes with low test-retest reliability. We evaluated the resulting measure, named DunedinPACE, in five additional datasets.

Results: DunedinPACE showed high test-retest reliability, was associated with morbidity, disability, and mortality, and indicated faster aging in young adults with childhood adversity.

However, characterising epigenetic influences could further inform disease predictions. Here, we leverage epigenome-wide data to study links between the DNAm signatures of the circulating proteome and incident diseases. Using data from four cohorts, we trained and tested epigenetic scores (EpiScores) for 953 plasma proteins, identifying 109 scores that explained between 1% and 58% of the variance in protein levels after adjusting for known protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) genetic effects. By projecting these EpiScores into an independent sample, (Generation Scotland; n=9,537) and relating them to incident morbidities over a follow-up of 14 years, we uncovered 137 EpiScore - disease associations. These associations were largely independent of immune cell proportions, common lifestyle and health factors and biological aging. Notably, we found that our diabetes-associated EpiScores highlighted previous top biomarker associations from proteome-wide assessments of diabetes. These EpiScores for protein levels can therefore be a valuable resource for disease prediction and risk stratification.Â© 2022, Gadd et al.",
No,20220131,epigenetics,35031073,Functional genomics analysis identifies T and NK cell activation as a driver of epigenetic clock progression.,Genome Biol,"Epigenetic clocks use DNA methylation (DNAm) levels of specific sets of CpG dinucleotides to accurately predict individual chronological age. A popular application of these clocks is to explore whether the deviation of predicted age from chronological age is associated with disease phenotypes, where this deviation is interpreted as a potential biomarker of biological age. This wide application, however, contrasts with the limited insight in the processes that may drive the running of epigenetic clocks.We perform a functional genomics analysis on four epigenetic clocks, including Hannum's blood predictor and Horvath's multi-tissue predictor, using blood DNA methylome and transcriptome data from 3132 individuals. The four clocks result in similar predictions of individual chronological age, and their constituting CpGs are correlated in DNAm level and are enriched for similar histone modifications and chromatin states. Interestingly, DNAm levels of CpGs from the clocks are commonly associated with gene expression in trans. The gene sets involved are highly overlapping and enriched for T cell processes. Further analysis of the transcriptome and methylome of sorted blood cell types identifies differences in DNAm between naive and activated T and NK cells as a probable contributor to the clocks. Indeed, within the same donor, the four epigenetic clocks predict naive cells to be up to 40 years younger than activated cells.The ability of epigenetic clocks to predict chronological age involves their ability to detect changes in proportions of naive and activated immune blood cells, an established feature of immuno-senescence. This finding may contribute to the interpretation of associations between clock-derived measures and age-related health outcomes.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Methylation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been studied using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), but recent evidence has uncovered technical issues which introduce a potential bias during methylation quantification. Here, we validate the technical concerns of WGBS, and develop and assess the accuracy of a new protocol for mtDNA nucleotide variant-specific methylation using single-molecule Oxford Nanopore Sequencing (ONS). Our approach circumvents confounders by enriching for full-length molecules over nuclear DNA. Variant calling analysis against showed that 99.5% of homoplasmic mtDNA variants can be reliably identified providing there is adequate sequencing depth. We show that some of the mtDNA methylation signal detected by ONS is due to sequence-specific false positives introduced by the technique. The residual signal was observed across several human primary and cancer cell lines and multiple human tissues, but was always below the error threshold modelled using negative controls. We conclude that there is no evidence for CpG methylation in human mtDNA, thus resolving previous controversies. Additionally, we developed a reliable protocol to study epigenetic modifications of mtDNA at single-molecule and single-base resolution, with potential applications beyond CpG methylation.Â© The Author(s) 2021.

We identify endogenous fluctuating CpG (fCpG) sites using standard methylation arrays and develop a mathematical model to quantitatively measure human adult stem cell dynamics from these data. Small intestinal crypts were inferred to contain slightly more stem cells than the colon, with slower stem cell replacement in the small intestine. Germline APC mutation increased the number of replacements per crypt. In blood, we measured rapid expansion of acute leukemia and slower growth of chronic disease. Thus, the patterns of human somatic cell birth and death are measurable with fluctuating methylation clocks (FMCs).Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Computational approaches such as ChromHMM have been applied to discover and annotate chromatin states defined by combinatorial and spatial patterns of chromatin marks within the same cell type. An alternative ""stacked modeling"" approach was previously suggested, where chromatin states are defined jointly from datasets of multiple cell types to produce a single universal genome annotation based on all datasets. Despite its potential benefits for applications that are not specific to one cell type, such an approach was previously applied only for small-scale specialized purposes. Large-scale applications of stacked modeling have previously posed scalability challenges.Using a version of ChromHMM enhanced for large-scale applications, we apply the stacked modeling approach to produce a universal chromatin state annotation of the human genome using over 1000 datasets from more than 100 cell types, with the learned model denoted as the full-stack model. The full-stack model states show distinct enrichments for external genomic annotations, which we use in characterizing each state. Compared to per-cell-type annotations, the full-stack annotations directly differentiate constitutive from cell type-specific activity and is more predictive of locations of external genomic annotations.The full-stack ChromHMM model provides a universal chromatin state annotation of the genome and a unified global view of over 1000 datasets.

We investigated DNA methylation in neonates born to mothers with E-GDM using cord blood samples.Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using an Illumina EPIC array to compare methylation rates of 754â€‰255 autosomal sites in cord blood samples from term neonates born to 162 mothers with GDM (E-GDM: n=84, L-GDM: n=78) and 60 normal glucose tolerance (normal OGTT) pregnancies. GDM was diagnosed based on Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria modified with International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group criteria. In this study, all GDM mothers underwent dietary management, while self-monitoring of blood glucose and insulin administration was initiated when dietary modification did not achieve glycemic control.There were no significant differences in genome-wide DNA methylation of cord blood samples between the GDM (E-GDM and L-GDM) groups and normal OGTT group or between the E-GDM and normal OGTT groups, L-GDM and normal OGTT groups, and E-GDM and L-GDM groups.This is the first report to determine the DNA methylation patterns in neonates born to mothers with E-GDM. Neonates born to mothers with GDM, who were diagnosed based on Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology criteria, may not differ in DNA methylation compared with those born to normal OGTT mothers.Â© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

There is evidence that risks differ by ethnicity, yet the biological or environmental differences underlying these differences are not known. DNA methylation is one type of epigenetic regulation that is altered in cancers. In this pilot study, we profiled DNA methylation with the Infinium MethylationEPIC in blood leukocytes from 31 Hispanic white and 163 non-Hispanic white firefighters. We compared DNA methylation (1) at 12 xenobiotic metabolizing genes and (2) at all loci on the array (>740â€‰000), adjusting for confounders. Five of the xenobiotic metabolizing genes were differentially methylated at a rawP-value <.05 when comparing the 2 ethnic groups, yet were not statistically significant at a 5% false discovery rate (q-value <.05). In the epigenome-wide analysis, 76 loci exhibited DNA methylation differences atqâ€‰<â€‰.05. Among these, 3 CpG sites in the promoter region of the biotransformation geneSULT1C2had lower methylation in Hispanic compared to non-Hispanic firefighters. Other differentially methylated loci included genes that have been implicated in carcinogenesis in published studies (FOXK2, GYLTL1B, ZBTB16, ARHGEF10, and more). In this pilot study, we report differential DNA methylation between Hispanic and non-Hispanic firefighters in xenobiotic metabolism genes and other genes with functions related to cancer. Epigenetic susceptibility by ethnicity merits further study as this may alter risk for cancers linked to toxic exposures.Â© The Author(s) 2021.",

Moreover, genetic ancestry has been associated with lung function in Latinos. However, no epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of lung function has been performed in this population. Here, we aimed to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with lung function in pediatric asthma among Latinos.We conducted an EWAS in whole blood from 250 Puerto Rican and 148 Mexican American children and young adults with asthma. A total of five CpGs exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold of pâ€‰=â€‰1.17â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7in the combined analyses from Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans: cg06035600 (MAP3K6, pâ€‰=â€‰6.13â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8) showed significant association with pre-bronchodilator Tiffeneau-Pinelli index, the probes cg00914963 (TBC1D16, pâ€‰=â€‰1.04â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7), cg16405908 (MRGPRE, pâ€‰=â€‰2.05â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8), and cg07428101 (MUC2, pâ€‰=â€‰5.02â€‰Ã—â€‰10-9) were associated with post-bronchodilator forced vital capacity (FVC), and cg20515679 (KCNJ6) with post-bronchodilator Tiffeneau-Pinelli index (pâ€‰=â€‰1.13â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8). However, these markers did not show significant associations in publicly available data from Europeans (pâ€‰>â€‰0.05). A methylation quantitative trait loci analysis revealed that methylation levels at these CpG sites were regulated by genetic variation in Latinos and the Biobank-based Integrative Omics Studies (BIOS) consortium. Additionally, two differentially methylated regions in REXOC and AURKC were associated with pre-bronchodilator Tiffeneau-Pinelli index (adjusted pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans. Moreover, we replicated some of the previous differentially methylated signals associated with lung function in non-Latino populations.We replicated previous associations of epigenetic markers with lung function in whole blood and identified novel population-specific associations shared among Latino subgroups.Â© 2022.

We analyzed DNA methylation levels in placental tissue (fetal side) collected at delivery. We first investigated changes in global DNA methylation of repetitive elements Alu and LINE-1. We then performed an adjusted epigenome-wide association study using IlluminaHM450 BeadChips and identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with phthalate exposure.Monobenzyl phthalate concentration was inversely associated with placental methylation of Alu repeats. Moreover, all phthalate biomarkers except for monocarboxy-iso-octyl phthalate and mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate were associated with at least one DMR. All but three DMRs showed increased DNA methylation with increased phthalate exposure. The largest identified DMR (22 CpGs) was positively associated with monocarboxy-iso-nonyl phthalate and encompassed heat shock proteins (HSPA1A, HSPA1L). The remaining DMRs encompassed transcription factors and nucleotide exchange factors, among other genes.This is the first description of genome-wide modifications of placental DNA methylation in association with pregnancy exposure to phthalates. Our results suggest epigenetic mechanisms by which exposure to these compounds could affect fetal development. Of interest, four identified DMRs had been previously associated with maternal smoking, which may suggest particular sensitivity of these genomic regions to the effect of environmental contaminants.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors.

Local epigenetic changes, particularly in DNA methylation, may influence gene expression and thus host response/secondary injury after TBI. It remains unknown whether DNA methylation in the central nervous system is associated with cerebral edema severity or intracranial hypertension post TBI. We sought to identify epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns associated with these forms of secondary injury after TBI.We obtained genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of DNA extracted from ventricular cerebrospinal fluid samples at three different postinjury time points from a prospective cohort of patients with severe TBI (nâ€‰=â€‰89 patients, 254 samples). Cerebral edema and intracranial pressure (ICP) measures were clustered to generate composite end points of cerebral edema and ICP severity. We performed an unbiased epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to test associations between DNA methylation at 419,895 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and cerebral edema/ICP severity categories. Given inflated p values, we conducted permutation tests for top CpG sites to filter out potential false discoveries.Our data-driven hierarchical clustering across six cerebral edema and ICP measures identified two groups differing significantly in ICP based on the EWAS-identified CpG site cg22111818 in RGMA (Repulsive guidance molecule A, permutation pâ€‰=â€‰4.20â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8). At 3-4Â days post TBI, patients with severe intracranial hypertension had significantly lower levels of methylation at cg22111818.We report a novel potential relationship between intracranial hypertension after TBI and an acute, nonsustained reduction in DNA methylation at cg22111818 in the RGMA gene. To our knowledge, this is the largest EWAS in severe TBI. Our findings are further strengthened by previous findingsÂ that RGMA modulates axonal repair in other central nervous system disorders, but a role in intracranial hypertension or TBI has not been previously identified. Additional work is warranted to validate and extend these findings, including assessment of its possible role in risk stratification, identification of novel druggable targets, and ultimately our ability to personalize therapy in TBI.Â© 2022.

To provide insight into the molecular regulation of S100Î² and its potential causal associations with Alzheimer's disease, we carried out genome- and epigenome-wide association studies (GWAS/EWAS) of serum S100Î² levels in older adults and performed Mendelian randomisation with Alzheimer's disease.Methods:GWAS (N=769, mean age 72.5 years, sd = 0.7) and EWAS (N=722, mean age 72.5 years, sd = 0.7) of S100Î² levels were performed in participants from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. Conditional and joint analysis (COJO) was used to identify independent loci. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses were performed for lead loci that had genome-wide significant associations with S100Î². Bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomisation was used to test for causal associations between S100Î² and Alzheimer's disease. Colocalisation between S100Î² and Alzheimer's disease GWAS loci was also examined.Results:We identified 154 SNPs from chromosome 21 that associated (P<5x10-8) with S100Î² protein levels. The lead variant was located in theS100Î²gene (rs8128872, P=5.0x10-17). We found evidence that two independent causal variants existed for both transcription ofS100Î²and S100Î² protein levels in our eQTL analyses.No CpG sites were associated with S100Î² levels at the epigenome-wide significant level (P<3.6x10-8); the lead probe was cg06833709 (P=5.8x10-6), which mapped to theLGI1gene. There was no evidence of a causal association between S100Î² levels and Alzheimer's disease or vice versa and no evidence for colocalisation betweenS100Î²and Alzheimer's disease loci.Conclusions:These data provide insight into the molecular regulators of S100Î² levels. This context may aid in understanding the role of S100Î² in brain inflammation and neurological disease.Copyright: Â© 2021 A Gadd D et al.",

However, long-term effects on lung function in humans are largely unknown.We investigated the associations of Ascaris exposure with lung function, asthma, and DNA methylation.Serum Ascaris IgG antibodies were measured in 671 adults aged 18 to 47 years (46% women) from Aarhus, Bergen, and Tartu RHINESSA study centers. Seropositivity was defined as IgG above the 90th percentile. Linear and logistic regressions were used to analyze Ascaris seropositivity as associated with lung function and asthma, adjusted for age, height, and smoking and clustered by center. DNA methylation in blood was profiled by a commercial methylation assay.Ascaris seropositivity was associated with lower FEV1(-247 mL; 95% CI, -460, -34) and higher odds for asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 5.84; 95% CI, 1.67, 20.37) among men but not women, also after further adjusting for house dust mite sensitivity, consistent across study centers. At a genome-wide level, Ascaris exposure was associated with 23 differentially methylated sites in men and 3 in women. We identified hypermethylation of the MYBPC1 gene, which can regulate airway muscle contraction. We also identified genes linked to asthma pathogenesis such as CRHR1 and GRK1, as well as a differentially methylated region in the PRSS22 gene linked to nematode infection.Ascaris exposure was associated with substantially lower lung function and increased asthma risk among men. Seropositive participants had sex-specific differences in DNA methylation compared to the unexposed, thus suggesting that exposure may lead to sex-specific epigenetic changes associated with lung pathology.Copyright Â© 2021 The Authors.

To screen cytosine-phosphate-guanine site (CpGs) potentially associated with asthma acquisition, at the genome scale, we examined differentially methylated regions (DMR) using dmrff R package and individual CpG sites using linear regression on such associations. For CpGs that passed screening, we examined their enrichment in biological pathways using their mapping genes and tested their associations with asthma acquisitions using logistic regressions. Findings in IOWBC were tested in an independent cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.In total, 2636 unique CpGs passed screening, based on which we identified one biological pathway linked to asthma acquisition during adolescence in females (FDR adjusted p-valueÂ =Â .003 in IOWBC). Via logistic regressions, for females, four CpGs were shown to be associated with asthma acquisition during adolescence, and another four CpGs with asthma acquisition in young adulthood (FDR adjusted p-valueÂ <Â .05 in IOWBC) and these eight CpGs were replicated in ALSPAC (all p-valuesÂ <Â .05). DNAm at all the identified CpGs was shown to be temporally consistent, and at six of the CpGs was associated with expressions of adjacent or mapping genes in females (all p-valuesÂ <Â .05). For males, 622 CpGs were identified in IOWBC (FDRÂ =Â 0.01), but these were not tested in ALSPAC due to small sample sizes.Eight CpGs on LHX5, IL22RA2, SOX11, CBX4, ACPT, CFAP46, MUC4, and ATP1B2Â genes have the potential to serve as candidate epigenetic biomarkers in newborns for asthma acquisition in females during adolescence or young adulthood.Â© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

Identification of epigenetic changes that associate with PTSD is therefore a crucial step in deciphering mechanisms of risk and resilience. In this study, our goal is to identify epigenetic signatures associated with PTSD symptom severity (PTSS) and changes in PTSS over time, using whole blood DNA methylation (DNAm) data (MethylationEPIC BeadChip) of military personnel prior to and following combat deployment. A total of 429 subjects (858 samples across 2 time points) from three male military cohorts were included in the analyses. We conducted two different meta-analyses to answer two different scientific questions: one to identify a DNAm profile of PTSS using a random effects model including both time points for each subject, and the other to identify a DNAm profile of change in PTSS conditioned on pre-deployment DNAm. Four CpGs near four genes (F2R, CNPY2, BAIAP2L1, and TBXAS1) and 88 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were associated with PTSS. Change in PTSS after deployment was associated with 15 DMRs, of those 2 DMRs near OTUD5 and ELF4 were also associated with PTSS. Notably, three PTSS-associated CpGs near F2R, BAIAP2L1 and TBXAS1 also showed nominal evidence of association with change in PTSS. This study, which identifies PTSD-associated changes in genes involved in oxidative stress and immune system, provides novel evidence that epigenetic differences are associated with PTSS.Â© 2021.

African American men have higher incidence and mortality rates of PCa than other racial groups in U.S. The goal of this study was to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and genes between clinically defined aggressive and nonaggressive PCa in African Americans. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling in leukocyte DNA from 280 African American PCa patients using Illumina MethylationEPIC array that contains about 860K CpG sties. There was a slight increase of overall methylation level (mean Î² value) with the increasing Gleason scores (GS = 6, GS = 7, GS â‰¥ 8, P for trend = 0.002). There were 78 differentially methylated CpG sites with P < 10-4and 9 sites with P < 10-5in the trend test. We also found 77 differentially methylated regions/genes (DMRs), including 10 homeobox genes and six zinc finger protein genes. A gene ontology (GO) molecular pathway enrichment analysis of these 77 DMRs found that the main enriched pathway was DNA-binding transcriptional factor activity. A few representative DMRs include HOXD8, SOX11, ZNF-471, and ZNF-577.

Using extensive DNA methylation data from the ALSPAC child cohort, we characterized the genome-wide landscape of DNA methylation variations associated with the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and assessed whether these variations mediate the association between exclusive breastfeeding and BMI over different epochs of child growth.Exclusive breastfeeding elicits more substantial DNA methylation variations during infancy than at other periods of child growth. At the genome-wide level, 13 CpG sites in girls (miR-21, SNAPC3, ATP6V0A1, DHX15/PPARGC1A, LINC00398/ALOX5AP, FAM238C, NATP/NAT2, CUX1, TRAPPC9, OSBPL1A, ZNF185, FAM84A, PDPK1) and 2 CpG sites in boys (IL16 and NREP), mediate the association between exclusive breastfeeding and longitudinal BMI. We found enrichment of CpG sites located within miRNAs and key pathways (AMPK signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway, endocytosis). Overall DNA methylation variation corresponding to 3 to 5Â months of exclusive breastfeeding was associated with slower BMI growth the first 6Â years of life compared to no breastfeeding and in a dose-response manner with exclusive breastfeeding duration.Our study confirmed the early postnatal period as a critical developmental period associated with substantial DNA methylation variations, which in turn could mitigate the development of overweight and obesity from infancy to early childhood. Since an accelerated growth during these developmental periods has been linked to the development of sustained obesity later in life, exclusive breastfeeding could have a major role in preventing the risks of overweight/obesity and children and adults through DNA methylation mechanisms occurring early in life.Â© 2021.

Few ASD studies have considered prospective designs with DNA methylation measured in multiple tissues and tested overlap with ASD genetic risk loci.Objectives:To estimate associations between DNA methylation in maternal blood, cord blood, and placenta and later diagnosis of ASD, and to evaluate enrichment of ASD-associated DNA methylation for known ASD-associated genes.Methods:In the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI), an ASD-enriched risk birth cohort, genome-scale maternal blood (earlyn= 140 and laten= 75 pregnancy), infant cord blood (n= 133), and placenta (maternaln= 106 and fetaln= 107 compartments) DNA methylation was assessed on the Illumina 450k HumanMethylation array and compared to ASD diagnosis at 36 months of age. Differences in site-specific and global methylation were tested with ASD, as well as enrichment of single site associations for ASD risk genes (n= 881) from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) database.Results:No individual DNA methylation site was associated with ASD at genome-wide significance, however, individual DNA methylation sites nominally associated with ASD (P< 0.05) in each tissue were highly enriched for SFARI genes (cord bloodP= 7.9 Ã— 10-29, maternal blood early pregnancyP= 6.1 Ã— 10-27, maternal blood late pregnancyP= 2.8 Ã— 10-16, maternal placentaP= 5.6 Ã— 10-15, fetal placentaP= 1.3 Ã— 10-20).

Here, we undertook the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in patients with MFS aiming at identifying DNA methylation loci associated with MFS phenotypes that may shed light on the disease process.The Illumina 450Â k DNA-methylation array was used on stored peripheral whole-blood samples of 190 patients with MFS originally included in the COMPARE trial. An unbiased genome-wide approach was used, and methylation of CpG-sites across the entire genome was evaluated. Additionally, we investigated CpG-sites across the FBN1-locus (15q21.1) more closely, since this is the gene defective in MFS. Differentially Methylated Positions (DMPs) and Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) were identified through regression analysis. Associations between methylation levels and aortic diameters and presence or absence of 21 clinical features of MFS at baseline were analyzed. Moreover, associations between aortic diameter change, and the occurrence of clinical events (death any cause, type-A or -B dissection/rupture, or aortic surgery) and methylation levels were analyzed.We identified 28 DMPs that are significantly associated with aortic diameters in patients with MFS. Seven of these DMPs (25%) could be allocated to a gene that was previously associated with cardiovascular diseases (HDAC4, IGF2BP3, CASZ1, SDK1, PCDHGA1, DIO3, PTPRN2). Moreover, we identified seven DMPs that were significantly associated with aortic diameter change and five DMP's that associated with clinical events. No significant associations at pâ€‰<â€‰10-8or pâ€‰<â€‰10-6were found with any of the non-cardiovascular phenotypic MFS features. Investigating DMRs, clusters were seen mostly on X- and Y, and chromosome 18-22. The remaining DMRs indicated involvement of a large family of protocadherins on chromosome 5, which were not reported in MFS before.This EWAS in patients with MFS has identified a number of methylation loci significantly associated with aortic diameters, aortic dilatation rate and aortic events. Our findings add to the slowly growing literature on the regulation of gene expression in MFS patients.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

We performed an epigenome-wide association study of neurodevelopmental delay using DNAm from cord blood.

The 100 replicated, epigenome-wide significant (pâ€‰<â€‰1.1E-7) CpGs explain 11.6% of the serum urate variance. At SLC2A9, the serum urate locus with the largest effect in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), five CpGs are associated with SLC2A9 gene expression. Four CpGs at SLC2A9 have significant causal effects on serum urate levels and/or gout, and two of these partly mediate the effects of urate-associated GWAS variants. In other genes, including SLC7A11 and PHGDH, 17 urate-associated CpGs are associated with conditions defining metabolic syndrome, suggesting that these CpGs may represent a blood DNA methylation signature of cardiometabolic risk factors.

The underlying mechanisms contributing to the development of AUD are largely unknown; however, growing evidence suggests that alcohol consumption is strongly associated with alterations in DNA methylation. Identification of alcohol-associated methylomic variation might provide novel insights into pathophysiology and novel treatment targets for AUD. Here we performed the largest single-cohort epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of alcohol consumption to date (Nâ€‰=â€‰8161) and cross-validated findings in AUD populations with relevant endophenotypes, as well as alcohol-related animal models. Results showed 2504 CpGs significantly associated with alcohol consumption (Bonferroni p value < 6.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8) with the five leading probes located in SLC7A11 (pâ€‰=â€‰7.75â€‰Ã—â€‰10-108), JDP2 (pâ€‰=â€‰1.44â€‰Ã—â€‰10-56), GAS5 (pâ€‰=â€‰2.71â€‰Ã—â€‰10-47), TRA2B (pâ€‰=â€‰3.54â€‰Ã—â€‰10-42), and SLC43A1 (pâ€‰=â€‰1.18â€‰Ã—â€‰10-40). Genes annotated to associated CpG sites are implicated in liver and brain function, the cellular response to alcohol and alcohol-associated diseases, including hypertension and Alzheimer's disease. Two-sample Mendelian randomization confirmed the causal relationship of consumption on AUD risk (inverse variance weighted (IVW) pâ€‰=â€‰5.37â€‰Ã—â€‰10-09). A methylation-based predictor of alcohol consumption was able to discriminate AUD cases in two independent cohorts (pâ€‰=â€‰6.32â€‰Ã—â€‰10-38and pâ€‰=â€‰5.41â€‰Ã—â€‰10-14). The top EWAS probe cg06690548, located in the cystine/glutamate transporter SLC7A11, was replicated in an independent cohort of AUD and control participants (Nâ€‰=â€‰615) and showed strong hypomethylation in AUD (pâ€‰<â€‰10-17). Decreased CpG methylation at this probe was consistently associated with clinical measures including increased heavy drinking days (pâ€‰<â€‰10-4), increased liver function enzymes (GGT (pâ€‰=â€‰1.03â€‰Ã—â€‰10-21), ALT (pâ€‰=â€‰1.29â€‰Ã—â€‰10-6), and AST (pâ€‰=â€‰1.97â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8)) in individuals with AUD. Postmortem brain analyses documented increased SLC7A11 expression in the frontal cortex of individuals with AUD and animal models showed marked increased expression in liver, suggesting a mechanism by which alcohol leads to hypomethylation-induced overexpression of SLC7A11. Taken together, our EWAS discovery sample and subsequent validation of the top probe in AUD suggest a strong role of abnormal glutamate signaling mediated by methylomic variation in SLC7A11. Our data are intriguing given the prominent role of glutamate signaling in brain and liver and might provide an important target for therapeutic intervention.Â© 2021.

It is unclear to what extent prenatal exposures influence the risk of CLD. Epigenetic variation in placenta DNA methylation may be associated with differential risk of CLD, and these associations may be dependent upon sex.Data were obtained from a multi-center cohort of infants born extremely preterm (<28 weeks' gestation) and an epigenome-wide approach was used to identify associations between placental DNA methylation and CLD (nâ€‰=â€‰423). Associations were evaluated using robust linear regression adjusting for covariates, with a false discovery rate of 0.05. Analyses stratified by sex were used to assess differences in methylation-CLD associations.CLD was associated with differential methylation at 49 CpG sites representing 46 genes in the placenta. CLD was associated with differential methylation of probes within genes related to pathways involved in fetal lung development, such as p53 signaling and myo-inositol biosynthesis. Associations between CpG methylation and CLD differed by sex.Differential placental methylation within genes with key roles in fetal lung development may reflect complex cell signaling between the placenta and fetus which mediate CLD risk. These pathways appear to be distinct based on fetal sex.In extremely preterm infants, differential methylation of CpG sites within placental genes involved in pathways related to cell signaling, oxidative stress, and trophoblast invasion is associated with chronic lung disease of prematurity. DNA methylation patterns associated with chronic lung disease were distinctly based on fetal sex, suggesting a potential mechanism underlying dimorphic phenotypes. Mechanisms related to fetal hypoxia and placental myo-inositol signaling may play a role in fetal lung programming and the developmental origins of chronic lung disease. Continued research of the relationship between the placental epigenome and chronic lung disease could inform efforts to ameliorate or prevent this condition.Â© 2021.

Despite this, few studies have characterised the association of binge PAE with DNA methylation in offspring.Methods:We investigated the association between binge PAE and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a sex-specific manner in neonatal buccal and placental samples.Results:We identified no differentially methylated CpGs or differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at false discovery rateÂ <0.05. However, using a sum-of-ranks approach, we identified a DMR in each tissue of female offspring. The DMR identified in buccal samples is located near regions with previously-reported associations to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and binge PAE.Conclusion:Our findings warrant further replication and highlight a potential epigenetic link between binge PAE and FASD.",

We measured DNA methylation in peripheral blood collected in infancy (9-15 months of age) in 243 children; and in a subset of 50 children, we also measured methylation in childhood (6-9 years of age) to examine persistence, and at birth (in cord blood) to examine temporality. We performed multivariable linear regression of infant diet on the outcome of methylation using epigenome-wide and candidate site approaches. We identified six novel CpG sites associated with breastfeeding duration using an EWAS approach. One differentially methylated site presented directionally consistent associations with breastfeeding (cg00574958,CPT1A) in infancy and childhood but not at birth. Two differentially methylated sites in infancy (cg19693031,TXNIP; cg23307264,KHSRP) were associated with breastfeeding and were not present at birth; however, these associations did not persist into childhood. Associations between infant diet and methylation in infancy at three sites (cg22369607,AP001525.1; cg2409200,TBCD; cg27173510,PGBD5) were also present at birth, suggesting the influence of exposures other than infant diet. Infant diet exposures are associated with persistent methylation differences inCPT1A, which may be one mechanism behind infant diet's long-term health effects.",

Few studies have investigated epigenetic associations with CMD risk factors in children from low- and middle-income countries. We sought to identify associations between DNA methylation (DNAm) and CMD risk factors in children from India and The Gambia.Using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 850Â K Beadchip array, we interrogated DNAm in 293 Gambian (7-9Â years) and 698 Indian (5-7Â years) children. We identified differentially methylated CpGs (dmCpGs) associated with systolic blood pressure, fasting insulin, triglycerides and LDL-Cholesterol in the Gambian children; and with insulin sensitivity, insulinogenic index and HDL-Cholesterol in the Indian children. There was no overlap of the dmCpGs between the cohorts. Meta-analysis identified dmCpGs associated with insulin secretion and pulse pressure that were different from cohort-specific dmCpGs. Several differentially methylated regions were associated with diastolic blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose, but these did not overlap with the dmCpGs. We identified significant cis-methQTLs at three LDL-Cholesterol-associated dmCpGs in Gambians; however, methylation did not mediate genotype effects on the CMD outcomes.This study identified cardiometabolic biomarkers associated with differential DNAm in Indian and Gambian children. Most associations were cohort specific, potentially reflecting environmental and ethnic differences.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Similarly, metabolic health has also been associated with changes in DNAm. It is unclear how overall metabolic health outside of BMI may modify the relationship between BMI and methylation profiles, and what consequences this may have on downstream cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to identify cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites at which the association between BMI and DNAm could be modified by overall metabolic health.The discovery study population was derived from three Women's Health Initiative (WHI) ancillary studies (nâ€‰=â€‰3977) and two Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) ancillary studies (nâ€‰=â€‰3520). Findings were validated in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰1200). Generalized linear models regressed methylation Î² values on the interaction between BMI and metabolic health Z scoreÂ (BMIâ€‰Ã—â€‰MHZ) adjusted for BMI, MHZ, cell composition, chip number and location, study characteristics, top three ancestry principal components, smoking, age, ethnicity (WHI), and sex (ARIC). Among the 429,566 sites examined, differential associations between BMIâ€‰Ã—â€‰MHZ and DNAm were identified at 22 CpG sites (FDR qâ€‰<â€‰0.05), with one site replicated in MESA (cg18989722, in theÂ TRAPPC9Â gene). Three of the 22 sites were associated with incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in WHI. For each 0.01 unit increase in DNAm Î² value, the risk of incident CHD increased by 9% in one site and decreased by 6-10% in two sites over 25Â years.Differential associations between DNAm and BMI by MHZ were identified at 22 sites, one of which was validated (cg18989722) and three of which were predictive of incident CHD. These sites are located in several genes related to NF-kappa-B signaling, suggesting a potential role for inflammation between DNA methylation and BMI-associated metabolic health.Â© 2021.

Using linear mixed models, we examined the association between previously identified CpGs for coronary artery calcification (CAC) and carotid plaque, both individually and aggregated into methylation risk scores (MRSCACand MRScarotid), and four measures of atherosclerosis (CAC, abdominal aorta calcification (AAC), ankle-brachial index (ABI), and multi-site atherosclerosis based on gender-specific quartiles of the single-site measures). We also examined the association between four epigenetic age acceleration measures (IEAA, EEAA, PhenoAge acceleration, and GrimAge acceleration) and the four atherosclerosis measures. Finally, we characterized the temporal stability of the epigenetic measures using repeated DNA methylation measured 5 years after baseline (Nâ€‰=â€‰193).After adjusting for CVD risk factors, four CpGs (cg05575921(AHRR), cg09935388 (GFI1), cg21161138 (AHRR), and cg18168448 (LRRC52)) were associated with multi-site atherosclerosis (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.1). cg05575921 was also associated with AAC and cg09935388 with ABI. MRSCACwas associated with ABI (Betaâ€‰=â€‰0.016, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006), and MRScarotidwas associated with both AAC (Betaâ€‰=â€‰0.605, equivalent to approximately 1.8-fold increase in the Agatston score of AAC, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.004) and multi-site atherosclerosis (Betaâ€‰=â€‰0.691, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002). A 5-year increase in GrimAge acceleration (~â€‰1 SD) was associated with a 1.6-fold (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.012) increase in the Agatston score of AAC and 0.7 units (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0003) increase in multi-site atherosclerosis, all after adjusting for CVD risk factors. All epigenetic measures were relatively stable over 5 years, with the highest intraclass correlation coefficients observed for MRScarotidand GrimAge acceleration (0.87 and 0.89, respectively).We found evidence of an association between DNA methylation and atherosclerosis at multiple vascular sites in a sample of African-Americans. Further evaluation of these potential biomarkers is warranted to deepen our understanding of the relationship between epigenetics and atherosclerosis.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Maternal environmental exposure not only affects mothers but also their fetuses in utero, which may interrupt their early development. Preterm birth, one of the outcomes of prenatal exposure, is a significant factor in lifelong health risks. To understand the effects of prenatal exposome on preterm birth, we studied the association between maternal and prenatal heavy metal exposure and gestational age, using resources from the MOthers' and Children's Environmental Health (MOCEH) study in South Korea. Additionally, a methylation assay was performed to analyze epigenetic mediation using genomic DNA derived from the cord blood of 384 participants in the MOCEH study. The results suggest that maternal cadmium exposure is associated with a decrease in gestational age through an alteration in DNA methylation at a specific CpG site, cg21010642. The CpG site was annotated to a gene involved in early embryonic development. Therefore, irregular methylation patterns at this site may contribute to premature birth by mediating irregular biological mechanisms.",

Here, we establish a genome-wide map of DNA methylation quantitative trait loci in CD4+T-cells isolated from multiple sclerosis patients. Utilizing this map in a colocalization analysis, we identify 19 loci where the same haplotype drives both multiple sclerosis susceptibility and local DNA methylation. We also identify two distant methylation effects of multiple sclerosis susceptibility loci: a chromosome 16 locus affects PRDM8 methylation (a chromosome 4 region not previously associated with multiple sclerosis), and the aggregate effect of multiple sclerosis-associated variants in the major histocompatibility complex influences DNA methylation near PRKCA (chromosome 17). Overall, we present a new resource for a key cell type in inflammatory disease research and uncover new gene targets for the study of predisposition to multiple sclerosis.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

Many of these disorders exhibit unique genome-wide DNA methylation profiles, known as episignatures. In this study, the methylation profile of a large cohort of individuals with chromatinopathies was analyzed for episignature detection.DNA methylation data was generated on extracted blood samples from 129 affected individuals with the Illumina Infinium EPIC arrays and analyzed using an established bioinformatic pipeline.The DNA methylation profiles matched and confirmed the sequence findings in both the discovery and validation cohorts. Twenty-five affected individuals carrying a variant of uncertain significance, did not show a methylation profile matching any of the known episignatures. Three additional variant of uncertain significance cases with an identified KDM6A variant were re-classified as likely pathogenic (n = 2) or re-assigned as Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (n = 1). Thirty of the 33 Next Generation Sequencing negative cases did not match a defined episignature while three matched Kabuki syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome and BAFopathy respectively.With the expanding clinical utility of the EpiSign assay, DNA methylation analysis should be considered part of the testing cascade for individuals presenting with clinical features of Mendelian chromatinopathy disorders.Copyright Â© 2021 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.

Whilst the mode of action of antidepressants is incompletely understood, many medications are associated with changes in DNA methylation in genes that are plausibly linked to their mechanisms. Studies of DNA methylation may therefore reveal the biological processes underpinning the efficacy and side effects of antidepressants. We performed a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) of self-reported antidepressant use accounting for lifestyle factors and MDD in Generation Scotland (GS:SFHS, Nâ€‰=â€‰6428, EPIC array) and the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR, Nâ€‰=â€‰2449, 450â€‰K array) and ran a meta-analysis of antidepressant use across these two cohorts. We found ten CpG sites significantly associated with self-reported antidepressant use in GS:SFHS, with the top CpG located within a gene previously associated with mental health disorders, ATP6V1B2 (Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.055, pcorrectedâ€‰=â€‰0.005). Other top loci were annotated to genes including CASP10, TMBIM1, MAPKAPK3, and HEBP2, which have previously been implicated in the innate immune response. Next, using penalised regression, we trained a methylation-based score of self-reported antidepressant use in a subset of 3799 GS:SFHS individuals that predicted antidepressant use in a second subset of GS:SFHS (Nâ€‰=â€‰3360, Î²â€‰=â€‰0.377, pâ€‰=â€‰3.12 Ã— 10-11, R2â€‰=â€‰2.12%). In an MWAS analysis of prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, we showed convergent findings with those based on self-report. In NTR, we did not find any CpGs significantly associated with antidepressant use. The meta-analysis identified the two CpGs of the ten above that were common to the two arrays used as being significantly associated with antidepressant use, although the effect was in the opposite direction for one of them. Antidepressants were associated with epigenetic alterations in loci previously associated with mental health disorders and the innate immune system. These changes predicted self-reported antidepressant use in a subset of GS:SFHS and identified processes that may be relevant to our mechanistic understanding of clinically relevant antidepressant drug actions and side effects.Â© 2021.

However, conventional tests are limited in acute pancreatitis (AP) stratification. We aimed to assess AP severity by integrating the informative clinical measurements with cell free DNA (cfDNA) methylation markers.One hundred and seventy-five blood samples were collected from 61 AP patients at multiple time points, plus 24 samples from healthy individuals. Genome-wide cfDNA methylation profiles of all samples were characterized with reduced representative bisulfite sequencing. Clinical blood tests covering 93 biomarkers were performed on AP patients within 24Â h. SAP predication models were built based on cfDNA methylation and conventional blood biomarkers separately and in combination.We identified 565 and 59 cfDNA methylation markers informative for acute pancreatitis and its severity. These markers were used to develop prediction models for AP and SAP with area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.92 and 0.81, respectively. Twelve blood biomarkers were systematically screened for a predictor of SAP with a sensitivity of 87.5% for SAP, and a specificity of 100% in mild acute pancreatitis, significantly higher than existing blood tests. An expanded model integrating 12 conventional blood biomarkers with 59 cfDNA methylation markers further improved the SAP prediction sensitivity to 92.2%.These findings have demonstrated that accurate prediction of SAP by the integration of conventional and novel blood molecular markers, paving the way for early and effective SAP intervention through a non-invasive rapid diagnostic test.Â© 2021.

The components of cigarette smoke are involved in immune and inflammatory processes, which may increase the prevalence of cigarette smoke-related diseases. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms linking smoking and diseases have not been well explored. This study was aimed to depict a global map of DNA methylation and gene expression changes induced by tobacco smoking and to explore the molecular mechanisms between smoking and human diseases through whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq).We performed WGBS on 72 samples (36 smokers and 36 nonsmokers) and RNA-seq on 75 samples (38 smokers and 37 nonsmokers), and cytokine immunoassayÂ onÂ plasma from 22 males (9 smokers and 13 nonsmokers) who were recruited from the city of Jincheng in China. By comparing the data of the two groups, we discovered a genome-wide methylation landscape of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with smoking. Functional enrichment analyses revealed that both smoking-related hyper-DMR genes (DMGs) and hypo-DMGs were related to synapse-related pathways, whereas the hypo-DMGs were specifically related to cancer and addiction. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed by RNA-seq analysis were significantly enriched in the ""immunosuppression"" pathway. Correlation analysis of DMRs with their corresponding gene expression showed that genes affected by tobacco smoking were mostly related to immune system diseases. Finally, by comparing cytokine concentrations betweenÂ smokers and nonsmokers, we found that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was significantly upregulated in smokers.In sum, we found that smoking-induced DMRs have different distribution patterns in hypermethylated and hypomethylated areas between smokers and nonsmokers. We further identified and verified smoking-related DMGs and DEGs through multi-omics integration analysis of DNA methylome and transcriptome data. These findings provide us a comprehensive genomic map of the molecular changes induced by smoking which would enhance our understanding of the harms of smoking and its relationship with diseases.Â© 2021.

However, little is known about how DNA methylation status changes over time under ordinary environmental and clinical conditions. In this study, we revisited the high frequency longitudinal DNA methylation data of two Japanese males (24 time-points within three months) and characterized the longitudinal dynamics.The results showed that the majority of CpGs on Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip probe set were longitudinally stable over the time period of three months. Focusing on dynamic and stable CpGs extracted from datasets, dynamic CpGs were more likely to be reported as epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) markers of various traits, especially those of immune- and inflammatory-related traits; meanwhile, the stable CpGs were enriched in metabolism-related genes and were less likely to be EWAS markers, indicating that the stable CpGs are stable both in the short-term within individuals and under various environmental and clinical conditions.This study indicates that CpGs with different stabilities are involved in different functions and traits, and thus, they are potential indicators that can be applied for clinical epigenetic studies to outline underlying mechanisms.Â© 2021.

While epigenetics continues to be a burgeoning research area in neuroscience, unaddressed issues related to data reproducibility across laboratories remain. Separating meaningful experimental changes from background variability is a challenge in epigenomic studies. Here we show that seemingly minor experimental variations, even under normal baseline conditions, can have a significant impact on epigenome outcome measures and data interpretation. We examined genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of hippocampal tissues from wild-type rats housed in three independent laboratories using nearly identical conditions. Reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq respectively identified 3852 differentially methylated and 1075 differentially expressed genes between laboratories, even in the absence of experimental intervention. Difficult-to-match factors such as animal vendors and a subset of husbandry and tissue extraction procedures produced quantifiable variations between wild-type animals across the three laboratories. Our study demonstrates that seemingly minor experimental variations, even under normal baseline conditions, can have a significant impact on epigenome outcome measures and data interpretation. This is particularly meaningful for neurological studies in animal models, in which baseline parameters between experimental groups are difficult to control. To enhance scientific rigor, we conclude that strict adherence to protocols is necessary for the execution and interpretation of epigenetic studies and that protocol-sensitive epigenetic changes, amongst naive animals, may confound experimental results.Â© 2022.

Analysis of samples with very low DNA inputs, such as formalin fixed (FFPE) biopsy specimens from clinical trials or circulating tumour DNA is challenging at the genome-wide level because of lack of available input. We present the results of low input experiments into the Illumina Infinium HD methylation assay on FFPE specimens and ctDNA samples.For all experiments, the Infinium HD assay for methylation was used. In total, forty-eight FFPE specimens were used at varying concentrations (lowest input 50 ng); eighteen blood derived specimens (lowest input 10 ng) and six matched ctDNA input (lowest input 10 ng)/fresh tumour specimens (lowest input 250 ng) were processed. Downstream analysis was performed in R/Bioconductor for quality control metrics and differential methylation analysis as well as copy number calls.Correlation coefficients for CpG methylation were high at the probe level averaged R2 = 0.99 for blood derived samples and R2 > 0.96 for the FFPE samples. When matched ctDNA/fresh tumour samples were compared, R2 > 0.91 between the two. Results of differential methylation analysis did not vary significantly by DNA input in either the blood or FFPE groups. There were differences seen in the ctDNA group as compared to their paired tumour sample, possibly because of enrichment for tumour material without contaminating normal. Copy number variants observed in the tumour were generally also seen in the paired ctDNA sample with good concordance via DQ plot.The Illumina Infinium HD methylation assay can robustly detect methylation across a range of sample types, including ctDNA, down to an input of 10 ng. It can also reliably detect oncogenic methylation changes and copy number variants in ctDNA. These findings demonstrate that these samples can now be accessed by methylation array technology, allowing analysis of these important sample types.",

Experimental and technical factors introduce appreciable measurement variation, some of which can be mitigated by careful ""preprocessing"" of raw data.Here we describe the ENmix preprocessing pipeline and compare it to a set of seven published alternative pipelines (ChAMP, Illumina, SWAN, Funnorm, Noob, wateRmelon, and RnBeads). We use two large sets of duplicate sample measurements with 450Â K and EPIC arrays, along with mixtures of isogenic methylated and unmethylated cell line DNA to compare raw data and that preprocessed via different pipelines.Our evaluations show that the ENmix pipeline performs the best with significantly higher correlation and lower absolute difference between duplicate pairs, higher intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and smaller deviations from expected methylation level in mixture experiments. In addition to the pipeline function, ENmix software provides an integrated set of functions for reading in raw data files from mouse and human arrays, quality control, data preprocessing, visualization, detection of differentially methylated regions (DMRs), estimation of cell type proportions, and calculation of methylation age clocks. ENmix is computationally efficient, flexible and allows parallel computing. To facilitate further evaluations, we make all datasets and evaluation code publicly available.Careful selection of robust data preprocessing methods is critical for DNA methylation array studies. ENmix outperformed other pipelines in our evaluations to minimize experimental variation and to improve data quality and study power.Â© 2021. The Author(s).",

However, the wide variety of approaches available to interrogate these modifications has created a need for harmonized materials, methods, and rigorous benchmarking to improve genome-wide methylome sequencing applications in clinical and basic research. Here, we present a multi-platform assessment and cross-validated resource for epigenetics research from the FDA's Epigenomics Quality Control Group.Each sample is processed in multiple replicates by three whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) protocols (TruSeq DNA methylation, Accel-NGS MethylSeq, and SPLAT), oxidative bisulfite sequencing (TrueMethyl), enzymatic deamination method (EMSeq), targeted methylation sequencing (Illumina Methyl Capture EPIC), single-molecule long-read nanopore sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and 850k Illumina methylation arrays. After rigorous quality assessment and comparison to Illumina EPIC methylation microarrays and testing on a range of algorithms (Bismark, BitmapperBS, bwa-meth, and BitMapperBS), we find overall high concordance between assays, but also differences in efficiency of read mapping, CpG capture, coverage, and platform performance, and variable performance across 26 microarray normalization algorithms.The data provided herein can guide the use of these DNA reference materials in epigenomics research, as well as provide best practices for experimental design in future studies.

For epigenomics, the application of DL to assist physicians and scientists in human disease-relevant prediction tasks has been relatively unexplored until very recently. In this article, we critically review published studies that employed DL models to predict disease detection, subtype classification, and treatment responses, using epigenomic data. A comprehensive search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and arXiv.org was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Among 1140 initially identified publications, we included 22 articles in our review. DNA methylation and RNA-sequencing data are most frequently used to train the predictive models. The reviewed models achieved a high accuracy ranged from 88.3% to 100.0% for disease detection tasks, from 69.5% to 97.8% for subtype classification tasks, and from 80.0% to 93.0% for treatment response prediction tasks. We generated a workflow to develop a predictive model that encompasses all steps from first defining human disease-related tasks to finally evaluating model performance.

No,20220131,methods,34847877,Predicting environmentally responsive transgenerational differential DNA methylated regions (epimutations) in the genome using a hybrid deep?machine learning approach,BMC Bioinformatics,"Background: Deep learning is an active bioinformatics artificial intelligence field that is useful in solving many biological problems, including predicting altered epigenetics such as DNA methylation regions. Deep learning (DL) can learn an informative representation that addresses the need for defining relevant features. However, deep learning models are computationally expensive, and they require large training datasets to achieve good classification performance.

Results: One approach to addressing these challenges is to use a less complex deep learning network for feature selection and Machine Learning (ML) for classification. In the current study, we introduce a hybrid DL-ML approach that uses a deep neural network for extracting molecular features and a non-DL classifier to predict environmentally responsive transgenerational differential DNA methylated regions (DMRs), termed epimutations, based on the extracted DL-based features. Various environmental toxicant induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance sperm epimutations were used to train the model on the rat genome DNA sequence and use the model to predict transgenerational DMRs (epimutations) across the entire genome.

Conclusion: The approach was also used to predict potential DMRs in the human genome. Experimental results show that the hybrid DL-ML approach outperforms deep learning and traditional machine learning methods.",

We identify 11,165,559 SNP-CpG associations (methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL), Pâ€‰<â€‰10-14), including 467,915 meQTL that operate in trans. The meQTL are enriched for functionally relevant characteristics, including shared chromatin state, High-throuhgput chromosome conformation interaction, and association with gene expression, metabolic variation and clinical traits. We use molecular interaction and colocalization analyses to identify multiple nuclear regulatory pathways linking meQTL loci to phenotypic variation, including UBASH3B (body mass index), NFKBIE (rheumatoid arthritis), MGA (blood pressure) and COMMD7 (white cell counts). For rs6511961 , chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) validates zinc finger protein (ZNF)333 as the likely trans acting effector protein. Finally, we used interaction analyses to identify population- and lineage-specific meQTL, including rs174548 in FADS1, with the strongest effect in CD8+T cells, thus linking fatty acid metabolism with immune dysregulation and asthma.

In a nested, matched case-control study, we estimated methylation-derived NLR (mdNLR) and quantified DNA methylation levels at loci previously linked with circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP). We examined associations between these measures and lung cancer risk and survival.Using conditional logistic regression and further adjusting for BMI, batch effects, and a smoking-based methylation score, we observed a 47% increased risk of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for one standard deviation (SD) increase in mdNLR (nâ€‰=â€‰150 pairs; OR: 1.47, 95% CI 1.08, 2.02). Using a similar model, the estimated CRP Scores were inversely associated with risk of NSCLC (e.g., Score 1 OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.81).

No,20220131,review,34863305,"Epigenome-wide association studies: current knowledge, strategies and recommendations.",Clin Epigenetics,"The aetiology and pathophysiology of complex diseases are driven by the interaction between genetic and environmental factors. The variability in risk and outcomes in these diseases are incompletely explained by genetics or environmental risk factors individually. Therefore, researchers are now exploring the epigenome, a biological interface at which genetics and the environment can interact. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the role of epigenetic mechanisms in complex disease pathophysiology. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASes) investigate the association between a phenotype and epigenetic variants, most commonly DNA methylation. The decreasing cost of measuring epigenome-wide methylation and the increasing accessibility of bioinformatic pipelines have contributed to the rise in EWASes published in recent years. Here, we review the current literature on these EWASes and provide further recommendations and strategies for successfully conducting them. We have constrained our review to studies using methylation data as this is the most studied epigenetic mechanism; microarray-based data as whole-genome bisulphite sequencing remains prohibitively expensive for most laboratories; and blood-based studies due to the non-invasiveness of peripheral blood collection and availability of archived DNA, as well as the accessibility of publicly available blood-cell-based methylation data. Further, we address multiple novel areas of EWAS analysis that have not been covered in previous reviews: (1) longitudinal study designs, (2) the chip analysis methylation pipeline (ChAMP), (3) differentially methylated region (DMR) identification paradigms, (4) methylation quantitative trait loci (methQTL) analysis, (5) methylation age analysis and (6) identifying cell-specific differential methylation from mixed cell data using statistical deconvolution.Â© 2021.

Here we describe a human methylome atlas, based on deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing allowing fragment-level analysis across thousands of unique markers for 39 cell types sorted from 207 healthy tissue samples.

Replicates of the same cell-type are >99.5% identical, demonstrating robustness of cell identity programs to genetic variation and environmental perturbation. Unsupervised clustering of the atlas recapitulates key elements of tissue ontogeny, and identifies methylation patterns retained since gastrulation. Loci uniquely unmethylated in an individual cell type often reside in transcriptional enhancers and contain DNA binding sites for tissue-specific transcriptional regulators. Uniquely hyper-methylated loci are rare and are enriched for CpG islands, polycomb targets, and CTCF binding sites, suggesting a novel role in shaping cell type-specific chromatin looping. The atlas provides an essential resource for interpretation of disease-associated genetic variants, and a wealth of potential tissue-specific biomarkers for use in liquid biopsies.

Summary paragraph DNA methylation, a fundamental epigenetic mark, governs chromatin organization and gene expression1, thus defining the molecular identity of cells and providing a window into developmental processes with wide-ranging physiologic and clinical ramifications. Current DNA methylation datasets have limitations, typically including only a fraction of methylation sites, many from cell lines that underwent massive changes in culture or from tissues containing unspecified mixtures of cells2–6.

We present a human methylome atlas based on deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of 39 sorted, primary cell types and use this dataset to address fundamental questions in developmental biology, physiology and pathology. Biological replicates are >99.5% identical, demonstrating unappreciated robustness to genetic variation and environmental perturbations. Clustering recapitulates key elements of tissue ontogeny, identifying methylation patterns retained since gastrulation. Loci uniquely unmethylated in individual cell types identify novel transcriptional enhancers and are enriched for tissue-specific transcription factors binding motifs. In contrast, loci uniquely hyper-methylated in specific cell types are rare, enriched for CpG islands and polycomb targets, and overlap CTCF binding sites, suggesting a novel role in shaping cell-type-specific chromatin looping. Finally, the atlas facilitates fragment-level deconvolution of tissue and plasma methylomes across thousands of cell-type specific regions to quantify their individual components at unprecedented resolution.

The human cell-type-specific methylation atlas provides an essential resource for studying gene regulation by defining cell-type-specific distal enhancers and regulators of 3D organization, for identifying pathological changes in DNA methylation, and for the interpretation of methylation-based liquid biopsies.",
No,20220131,transgenerational,34983971,Molecular mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.,Nat Rev Genet,"Increasing evidence indicates that non-DNA sequence-based epigenetic information can be inherited across several generations in organisms ranging from yeast to plants to humans. This raises the possibility of heritable 'epimutations' contributing to heritable phenotypic variation and thus to evolution. Recent work has shed light on both the signals that underpin these epimutations, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs, and the mechanisms by which they are transmitted across generations at the molecular level. These mechanisms can vary greatly among species and have a more limited effect in mammals than in plants and other animal species. Nevertheless, common principles are emerging, with transmission occurring either via direct replicative mechanisms or indirect reconstruction of the signal in subsequent generations. As these processes become clearer we continue to improve our understanding of the distinctive features and relative contribution of DNA sequence and epigenetic variation to heritable differences in phenotype.Â© 2022.

Here, using whole-genome sequencing of 1,013 clonal haematopoietic colonies from 12 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, we identified 580,133 somatic mutations to reconstruct haematopoietic phylogenies and determine clonal histories. Driver mutations were estimated to occur early in life, including the in utero period. JAK2V617Fwas estimated to have been acquired by 33 weeks of gestation to 10.8 years of age in 5 patients in whom JAK2V617Fwas the first event. DNMT3A mutations were acquired by 8 weeks of gestation to 7.6 years of age in 4 patients, and a PPM1D mutation was acquired by 5.8 years of age. Additional genomic events occurred before or following JAK2V617Facquisition and as independent clonal expansions. Sequential driver mutation acquisition was separated by decades across life, often outcompeting ancestral clones. The mean latency between JAK2V617Facquisition and diagnosis was 30 years (range 11-54 years). Estimated historical rates of clonal expansion varied substantially (3% to 190% per year), increased with additional driver mutations, and predicted latency to diagnosis. Our study suggests that early driver mutation acquisition and life-long growth and evolution underlie adult myeloproliferative neoplasms, raising opportunities for earlier intervention and a new model for cancer development.Â© 2022.

Previously, studies on the relationship between ageing and DNA methylation have assumed a linear relationship. Here, we show that several markers show a non-linear behaviour. In particular, we observe a tendency for saturation with age, especially in the cerebellum. Further, we show that the relationships between significant methylation changes and ageing are different in different tissues. We suggest a straightforward method of assessing all methylation-age relationships and cluster them according to their relative fold change. Our fold change selection outperforms the most common epigenetic clocks in predicting age for the cerebellum, but not for Blood or the Frontal Cortex. Further, we find that the saturation of methylation observed at older ages for the cerebellum explains why epigenetic clocks consistently underestimate the age there. The findings imply that assuming linear correlations might cause biologically important markers to be missed.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

This study aimed to identify age-related DNA methylation changes on Y chromosome (ChrY). A two-stage study design was conducted in this study. The discovery stage contained 419 Chinese males, including 205 from the Wuhan-Zhuhai cohort panel, 107 from the coke oven workers panel, and 107 from the Shiyan panel. The validation stage contained 587 Chinese males from the Dongfeng-Tongji sub-cohort.

However, screening is invasive, expensive, and associated with significant morbidity making bladder cancer the most expensive cancer to treat per capita.

PM10daily exposure levels, based on maternal residential address, were estimated for different gestational periods using models based on satellite data. Epigenome-wide analysis to identify differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) was conducted, followed by a pathway analysis and replication analysis in an second PiccolipiÃ¹ dataset. Distributed lag models (DLMs) using weekly exposures were used to study the association of PM10exposure across pregnancy with telomere length, as well as with the DMPs that showed robust associations.Gestational PM10exposure was associated with the DNA methylation of more than 250 unique DMPs, most of them identified in early gestation, and 1 DMR. Out of 151 DMPs available in the replication dataset, ten DMPs showed robust associations: eight were associated with exposure during early gestation and 2 with exposure during the whole pregnancy. These exposure windows were supported by the DLM analysis. The PM10exposure between 15th and 20th gestational week seem to be associated with shorter telomeres at birth, while exposure between 24th and 29th was associated with longer telomeres.The early pregnancy period is a potential critical window during which PM10exposure can influence cord blood DNA methylation. The results from the TL analysis were consistent with previous findings and merit further exploration in future studies. The study underlines the importance of considering gestational windows outside of the predefined trimesters that may not always overlap with biologically relevant windows of exposure.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors.

We used the Young Finns Study (nâ€‰=â€‰926) with sequenced mtDNA genotypes as a discovery sample and sought replication in the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health study (nâ€‰=â€‰2317). We identified numerous significant associations in the discovery phase (Pâ€‰<â€‰10-9), but they were not replicated when accounting for multiple testing.

An expression quantitative trait methylation analysis was performed for the identified DNAm sites, pinpointing two statistically significant associations. This study provides evidence of a mitochondrial genetic control of nuclear DNAm with little evidence found for sex- and prediabetes-specific effects.

Therapeutic intervention targeting the iron homeostasis pathway shows promise for mitigating ferroptosis and improving recovery in animal models, but little work has been conducted in humans. DNA methylation (DNAm) plays a key role in gene expression and brain function, plasticity, and injury recovery, making it a potentially useful biomarker of outcomes or therapeutic target for intervention. Therefore, in this longitudinal, observational study, we examined the relationships between trajectories of DNAm in candidate genes related to iron homeostasis and acute (cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia) and long-term (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS, unfavorable = 1-3] and death) patient outcomes after aSAH.Longitudinal, genome-wide DNAm data were generated from DNA extracted from post-aSAH cerebrospinal fluid (n= 260 participants). DNAm trajectories of 637 CpG sites in 36 candidate genes related to iron homeostasis were characterized over 13 days post-aSAH using group-based trajectory analysis, an unsupervised clustering method. Significant associations were identified between inferred DNAm trajectory groups at several CpG sites and acute and long-term outcomes.

Specifically, in comparing the highest cg25713625 DNAm trajectory group with the lowest, we observed significant associations (i.e., based onp-values less than an empirical significance threshold) with unfavorable GOS at 3 and 12 months (OR= 11.7,p= 0.0006 andOR= 15.6,p= 0.0018, respectively) and death at 3 and 12 months (OR= 19.1,p= 0.0093 andOR= 12.8,p= 0.0041, respectively). These results were replicated in an independent sample (n= 100 participants) observing significant associations with GOS at 3 and 12 months (OR= 8.2,p= 0.001 andOR= 6.3,p= 0.0.0047, respectively) and death at 3 months (OR= 2.3,p= 0.008) and a suggestive association (i.e.,p-value < 0.05 not meeting an empirical significance threshold) with death at 12 months (OR= 2.0,p= 0.0272). In both samples, an additive effect of the DNAm trajectory group was observed as the percentage of participants with unfavorable long-term outcomes increased substantially with higher DNAm trajectory groups.Our results support a role for DNAm of cg25713625/STEAP3in recovery following aSAH. Additional research is needed to further explore the role of DNAm of cg25713625/STEAP3as a biomarker of unfavorable outcomes, or therapeutic target to improve outcomes, to translate these findings clinically.",

It is hypothesized that changes in offspring DNA methylation (DNAm) underline these associations.To address this hypothesis, we conducted fixed-effects meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results from eight birth cohorts investigating relationships between cord blood DNAm and fetal exposure to maternal glucose (Nmaximum = 3,503), insulin (Nmaximum = 2,062), and area under the curve of glucose (AUCgluc) following oral glucose tolerance tests (Nmaximum = 1,505). We performed lookup analyses for identified cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) in independent observational cohorts to examine associations between DNAm and cardiometabolic traits as well as tissue-specific gene expression.Greater maternal AUCgluc was associated with lower cord blood DNAm at neighboring CpGs cg26974062 (Î² [SE] = 0.013 [2.1 Ã— 10-3], P value corrected for false discovery rate [PFDR] = 5.1 Ã— 10-3) and cg02988288 (Î² [SE]-0.013 [2.3 Ã— 10-3], PFDR = 0.031) in TXNIP. These associations were attenuated in women with GDM. Lower blood DNAm at these two CpGs near TXNIP was associated with multiple metabolic traits later in life, including type 2 diabetes. TXNIP DNAm in liver biopsies was associated with hepatic expression of TXNIP. We observed little evidence of associations between either maternal glucose or insulin and cord blood DNAm.Maternal hyperglycemia, as reflected by AUCgluc, was associated with lower cord blood DNAm at TXNIP. Associations between DNAm at these CpGs and metabolic traits in subsequent lookup analyses suggest that these may be candidate loci to investigate in future causal and mediation analyses.Â© 2022 by the American Diabetes Association.",

This social epigenomics study included long-term childhood cancer survivors enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort. DNA methylation (DNAm) data were generated using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip, and three social determinants of health (SDOH) factors were assessed: self-reported educational attainment, personal income, and an area deprivation index based on census track data. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed to evaluate the relation between DNAm at each 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) site and each SDOH factor based on multivariable linear regression models stratified by ancestry (European ancestry, n =Â 1,618; African ancestry, n =Â 258). EWAS among survivors of European ancestry identified 130 epigenome-wide significant SDOH-CpG associations (P<Â 9Â Ã—Â 10-8), 25 of which were validated in survivors of African ancestry (P<Â 0.05). Thirteen CpGs were associated with all three SDOH factors and resided at pleiotropic loci in cigarette smoking-related genes (e.g.,CLDND1andCPOX). After accounting for smoking and body mass index, these associations remained significant with attenuated effect sizes. Seven of 13 CpGs were associated with gene expression level based on 57 subsamples with blood RNA sequencing data available. In conclusion, DNAm signatures, many resembling the effect of tobacco use, were associated with SDOH factors among survivors of childhood cancer, thereby suggesting that biologically distal SDOH factors influence health behaviours or related factors, the epigenome, and subsequently survivors' health.",

This study aimed to determine methylation signatures of cortisol levels in children, and whether associations differ based on maternal post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Blood epigenome-wide methylation and fasting cortisol levels were measured in 118 offspring of mothers recruited from the Kosovo Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims. Mothers underwent clinically administered assessment for PTSD using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Correlations between offspring methylation and cortisol levels were examined using epigenome-wide analysis, adjusting for covariates. Subsequent analysis focussed on a priori selected genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress signalling. Methylation at four sites were correlated with cortisol levels (cg15321696, rÂ =Â -0.33, cg18105800, rÂ =Â +0.33, cg00986889, rÂ =Â -0.25, and cg15920527, rÂ =Â -0.27). In adjusted multivariable regression, when stratifying based on prenatal PTSD status, significant associations were only found for children born to mothers with prenatal PTSD (pÂ <Â 0.001). Several sites within HPA axis genes were also associated with cortisol levels in the maternal PTSD group specifically. There is evidence that methylation is associated with cortisol levels, particularly in offspring born to mothers with prenatal PTSD. However, larger studies need to be carried out to independently validate these findings.Â© 2022 The Authors. Stress and Health published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

Because of their persistence, they are able to bioaccumulate with major impacts on human health. It has been hypothesized that the effect of BFRs on human health is mediated by alterations of DNA methylation.The aim of this study was to examine the association between methylation of DNA extracted from peripheral blood and circulating levels of BFRs measured in plasma.We conducted a methylation wide association study on 336 blood samples from a study within the E3N (Etude EpidÃ©miologique auprÃ¨s de femmes de l'Education Nationale) cohort, a long-term longitudinal cohort of French women. DNA methylation at more than 850â€¯000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites was measured with the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation - EPIC BeadChip. Circulating levels of seven BFRs (BDE-28, BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-100, BDE-153, BDE-154 and PBB-153) were measured by gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry in plasma samples. The association between DNA methylation and BFRs plasma levels was assessed through linear mixed-effects models followed by gene-set enrichment analyses (GSEA).We identified 253 CpG sites whose methylation levels were significantly associated with exposure to BFRs after Bonferroni correction. For 50 of these CpGs the p-values were less than 2.2x10-9with the strongest association being between BDE-154 and cg23619365 (4.32x10-13). GSEA of CpG sites associated with exposure to BFRs identified significant enrichment of genes involved in hypoxia, glycolysis and adipogenesis.Exposure to BFRs appears to be related to numerous alterations in DNA methylation. These findings, if replicated in independent studies, provide insights into the biological and health effects of BFRs.Copyright Â© 2022. Published by Elsevier Inc.",

Here, we investigated cancer-related molecular changes detected in tissues from women at high risk for breast cancer prior to disease manifestation. Disease-free breast tissue cores donated by healthy women (Nâ€‰=â€‰146, median ageâ€‰=â€‰39Â years) were processed for both methylome (MethylCap) and transcriptome (Illumina's HiSeq4000) sequencing. Analysis of tissue microarray and primary breast epithelial cells was used to confirm gene expression dysregulation.Transcriptomic analysis identified 69 differentially expressed genes between women at high and those at average risk of breast cancer (Tyrer-Cuzick model) at FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05 and fold changeâ€‰â‰¥â€‰2. Majority of the identified genes were involved in DNA damage checkpoint, cell cycle, and cell adhesion. Two genes, FAM83A and NEK2, were overexpressed in tissue sections (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.01) and primary epithelial cells (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) from high-risk breasts. Moreover, 1698 DNA methylation changes were identified in high-risk breast tissues (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05), partially overlapped with cancer-related signatures, and correlated with transcriptional changes (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05, râ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.5). Finally, among the participants, 35 women donated breast biopsies at two time points, and age-related molecular alterations enhanced in high-risk subjects were identified.Normal breast tissue from women at high risk of breast cancer bears molecular aberrations that may contribute to breast cancer susceptibility. This study is the first molecular characterization of the true normal breast tissues, and provides an opportunity to investigate molecular markers of breast cancer risk, which may lead to new preventive approaches.Â© 2022.

Genetic and epigenetic associations across the genome explain some of the variation in general cognitive abilities in the general population and it is plausible that epigenetic associations might arise from prenatal environmental exposures and/or genetic variation early in life. We investigated the association between cord blood DNA methylation at birth and cognitive skills assessed in children from eight pregnancy cohorts within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium across overall (total Nâ€‰=â€‰2196), verbal (total Nâ€‰=â€‰2206) and non-verbal cognitive scores (total Nâ€‰=â€‰3300). The associations at single CpG sites were weak for all of the cognitive domains investigated. One region near DUSP22 on chromosome 6 was associated with non-verbal cognition in a model adjusted for maternal IQ. We conclude that there is little evidence to support the idea that variation in cord blood DNA methylation at single CpG sites is associated with cognitive skills and further studies are needed to confirm the association at DUSP22.Â© 2022.

Previous epigenomic studies focused mainly on clinically diagnosed individuals. The aim of the study was to assess early DNA methylation changes associated with type 1 diabetes already before the diagnosis or even before the appearance of autoantibodies.Reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) was applied to study DNA methylation in purified CD4+T cell, CD8+T cell and CD4-CD8-cell fractions of 226 peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples longitudinally collected from seven type 1 diabetes-specific autoantibody-positive individuals and control individuals matched for age, sex, HLA risk and place of birth. We also explored correlations between DNA methylation and gene expression using RNA sequencing data from the same samples. Technical validation of RRBS results was performed using pyrosequencing.We identified 79, 56 and 45 differentially methylated regions in CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells and CD4-CD8-cell fractions, respectively, between type 1 diabetes-specific autoantibody-positive individuals and control participants. The analysis of pre-seroconversion samples identified DNA methylation signatures at the very early stage of disease, including differential methylation at the promoter of IRF5 in CD4+T cells. Further, we validated RRBS results using pyrosequencing at the following CpG sites: chr19:18118304 in the promoter of ARRDC2; chr21:47307815 in the intron of PCBP3; and chr14:81128398 in the intergenic region near TRAF3 in CD4+T cells.These preliminary results provide novel insights into cell type-specific differential epigenetic regulation of genes, which may contribute to type 1 diabetes pathogenesis at the very early stage of disease development. Should these findings be validated, they may serve as a potential signature useful for disease prediction and management.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

However, the causality and mechanisms by which alcohol exerts its carcinogenic effect are unclear. We evaluated the association between alcohol consumption and CRC risk by analyzing data from 32 cohort studies and conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine for casual relationship. To explore the effect of alcohol related DNA methylation on CRC risk, we performed an epigenetic MR analysis with data from an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). We additionally performed gene-alcohol interaction analysis nested in the UK Biobank to assess effect modification between alcohol consumption and susceptibility genes. We discovered distinct effects of alcohol on CRC incidence and mortality from the meta-analyses, and genetic predisposition to alcohol drinking was causally associated with an increased CRC risk (ORÂ =Â 1.79, 95% CI: 1.23-2.61) using two-sample MR approaches. In epigenetic MR analysis, two alcohol-related CpG sites (cg05593667 and cg10045354 mapped to COLCA1/COLCA2 gene) were identified causally associated with an increased CRC risk (Pâ€‰<â€‰8.20â€‰Ã—â€‰10-4). Gene-alcohol interaction analysis revealed that carriage of the risk allele of the eQTL (rs3087967) and mQTL (rs11213823) polymorphism of COLCA1/COLCA2 would interact with alcohol consumption to increase CRC risk (PInteractionÂ =Â .027 and PInteractionÂ =Â .016). Our study provides comprehensive evidence to elucidate the role of alcohol in CRC and highlights that the pathogenic effect of alcohol on CRC could be partly attributed to DNA methylation by regulating the expression of COLCA1/COLCA2 gene.Â© 2022 The Authors.

No,20220214,mechanism,35119365,Physiological TLR4 regulation in human fetal membranes as an explicative mechanism of a pathological preterm case.,Elife,"The integrity of human fetal membranes is crucial for harmonious fetal development throughout pregnancy. Their premature rupture is often the consequence of a physiological phenomenon that has been exacerbated. Beyond all the implied biological processes, inflammation is of primary importance and is qualified as 'sterile' at the end of pregnancy. In this study, complementary methylomic and transcriptomic strategies on amnion and choriodecidua explants obtained from the altered (cervix zone) and intact fetal membranes at term and before labour were used. By cross-analysing genome-wide studies strengthened by in vitro experiments, we deciphered how the expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), an actor in pathological fetal membrane rupture, is controlled. Indeed, it is differentially regulated in the altered zone and between both layers by a dual mechanism: (1) the methylation of TLR4 and miRNA promoters and (2) targeting by miRNA (let-7a-2 and miR-125b-1) acting on the 3'-UTR of TLR4. Consequently, this study demonstrates that fine regulation of TLR4 is required for sterile inflammation establishment at the end of pregnancy and that it may be dysregulated in the pathological premature rupture of membranes.Â© 2022, Belville et al.",
No,20220214,methods,35145108,A mammalian methylation array for profiling methylation levels at conserved sequences.,Nat Commun,"Infinium methylation arrays are not available for the vast majority of non-human mammals. Moreover, even if species-specific arrays were available, probe differences between them would confound cross-species comparisons. To address these challenges, we developed the mammalian methylation array, a single custom array that measures up to 36k CpGs per species that are well conserved across many mammalian species. We designed a set of probes that can tolerate specific cross-species mutations. We annotate the array in over 200 species and report CpG island status and chromatin states in select species. Calibration experiments demonstrate the high fidelity in humans, rats, and mice. The mammalian methylation array has several strengths: it applies to all mammalian species even those that have not yet been sequenced, it provides deep coverage of conserved cytosines facilitating the development of epigenetic biomarkers, and it increases the probability that biological insights gained in one species will translate to others.Â© 2022.

Although the available risk assessment methods for HFpEF have achieved some progress, they were based on clinical or genetic features alone. Here, we have developed a deep learning framework, HFmeRisk, using both 5 clinical features and 25 DNA methylation loci to predict the early risk of HFpEF in the Framingham Heart Study Cohort.The framework incorporates Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and Extreme Gradient Boosting-based feature selection, as well as a Factorization-Machine based neural network-based recommender system. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed using the AUC and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. HFmeRisk, including 25 CpGs and 5 clinical features, have achieved the AUC of 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.88-0.92) and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic was 6.17 (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.632), which outperformed models with clinical characteristics or DNA methylation levels alone, published chronic heart failure risk prediction models and other benchmark machine learning models. Out of them, the DNA methylation levels of two CpGs were significantly correlated with the paired transcriptome levels (Râ€‰<â€‰-0.3, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Besides, DNA methylation locus in HFmeRisk were associated with intercellular signaling and interaction, amino acid metabolism, transport and activation and the clinical variables were all related with the mechanism of occurrence of HFpEF. Together, these findings give new evidence into the HFmeRisk model.Our study proposes an early risk assessment framework for HFpEF integrating both clinical and epigenetic features, providing a promising path for clinical decision making.Â© 2022.

The purposes of this study were (1) to validate the results of a previous technical comparison by determining the diagnostic performance of nine methylation markers in urine pellet compared to full void urine, and (2) to validate the diagnostic performance of the optimal marker panel GHSR/MAL from a previous exploratory study in a preclinical setting.Urine samples of 108 patients with bladder cancer and 100 age- and gender-matched controls were prospectively collected for methylation analysis. Urinary methylation levels of the markers FAM19A4, GHSR, MAL, miR-129, miR-935, PHACTR3, PRDM14, SST and ZIC1 were determined with quantitative methylation-specific PCR in urine pellet. Area under the curves (AUCs) were determined for individual markers and the marker panel GHSR/MAL. The diagnostic performance of the marker panel GHSR/MAL was evaluated in the total study population and in different subgroups of patients with bladder cancer using the Chi-square test. The diagnostic accuracy was assessed by leave-one-out cross-validation.All nine urinary methylation markers (FAM19A4, GHSR, MAL, miR-129, miR-935, PHACTR3, PRDM14, SST and ZIC1) showed significantly higher methylation levels in bladder cancer patients than in controls (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Area under the curves (AUCs) of the nine methylation markers tested in urine pellet were similar to AUCs in full void urine of an independent previous cohort. GHSR/MAL reached an AUC of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.94), at 80% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Sensitivity of GHSR/MAL increased with higher tumour grades, higher tumour stages, in primary vs. recurrent tumours, and in males vs. females.This technical validation supports the robustness of DNA methylation analysis in urine pellet and full void urine for the non-invasive detection of bladder cancer. Subsequent preclinical validation confirmed the diagnostic potential of GHSR/MAL. These findings underline the diagnostic potential of the marker panel GHSR/MAL for future bladder cancer diagnostics.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",
No,20220214,prediction,36008412,Methylation risk scores are associated with a collection of phenotypes within electronic health record systems,NPJ Genom Med,"Inference of clinical phenotypes is a fundamental task in precision medicine, and has therefore been heavily investigated in recent years in the context of electronic health records (EHR) using a large arsenal of machine learning techniques, as well as in the context of genetics using polygenic risk scores (PRS). In this work, we considered the epigenetic analog of PRS, methylation risk scores (MRS), a linear combination of methylation states. Since methylation states are influenced by both environmental and genetic factors, we hypothesized that MRS would complement PRS and EHR-based machine-learning methods, improving overall prediction accuracy. To evaluate this hypothesis, we performed the largest assessment of methylation risk scores in clinical datasets to be conducted to date. We measured methylation across a large cohort (n=831) of diverse samples in the UCLA Health biobank, for which both genetic and complete EHR data are available. We constructed MRS for 607 phenotypes spanning diagnoses, clinical lab tests, and medication prescriptions. When added to a baseline set of predictive features, MRS significantly improved the imputation of 139 outcomes, whereas the PRS improved only 22 (median improvement for methylation 10.74%, 141.52%, and 15.46% in medications, labs and diagnosis codes, respectively, whereas genotypes only improved the labs at a median increase of 18.42%). We added significant MRS to state-of-the-art EHR imputation methods that leverage the entire set of medical records, and found that including MRS as a medical feature in the algorithm significantly improves EHR imputation in 37% of lab tests examined (median R2 increase 47.6%). Finally, we replicated several MRS in multiple external studies of methylation (minimum p-value of 2.72 × 10?7) and replicated 22 of 30 tested MRS internally in two separate cohorts of different ethnicity. In summary, our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of MRS in comparison to PRS and EHR imputation on the largest dataset consisting of methylation, genotype, and EHR data. Our publicly available results and weights show promise for methylation risk scores as clinical and scientific tools.",

Gene regulation is highly dynamic and context-dependent. In order to better understand the connection between gene regulation and complex phenotypes, including disease, we need to be able to study gene expression in more cell types, tissues, and states that are relevant to human phenotypes. In particular, we need to characterize gene expression in early development cell types, as mutations that affect developmental processes may be of particular relevance to complex traits. To address this challenge, we propose to use embryoid bodies (EBs), which are organoids that contain a multitude of cell types in dynamic states. EBs provide a system in which one can study dynamic regulatory processes at an unprecedentedly high resolution. To explore the utility of EBs, we systematically explored cellular and gene expression heterogeneity in EBs from multiple individuals. We characterized the various cell types that arise from EBs, the extent to which they recapitulate gene expression in vivo, and the relative contribution of technical and biological factors to variability in gene expression, cell composition, and differentiation efficiency. Our results highlight the utility of EBs as a new model system for mapping dynamic inter-individual regulatory differences in a large variety of cell types.Â© 2022, Rhodes et al.",

Whether discordant tick rates between tissue-specific and general epigenetic clocks play a role in health and disease has not yet been explored.Here we analyze 1941 cervical cytology samples, which contain a mixture of hormone-sensitive cervical epithelial cells and immune cells, and develop the WID general clock (Women's IDentification of risk), an epigenetic clock that is shared by epithelial and immune cells and optimized for cervical samples. We then develop the WID epithelial clock and WID immune clock, which define epithelial- and immune-specific clocks, respectively. We find that the WID-relative-epithelial-age (WID-REA), defined as the difference between the epithelial and general clocks, is significantly reduced in cervical samples from pre-menopausal women with breast cancer (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.28-5.72). We find the same effect in normal breast tissue samples from pre-menopausal women at high risk of breast cancer and show that potential risk reducing anti-progesterone drugs can reverse this. In post-menopausal women, this directionality is reversed. Hormone replacement therapy consistently leads to a significantly lower WID-REA in cancer-free women, but not in post-menopausal women with breast or ovarian cancer.Our findings imply that there are multiple epigenetic clocks, many of which are tissue-specific, and that the differential tick rate between these clocks may be an informative surrogate measure of disease risk.Â© 2022.

DNA methylation measures of biological aging provide tools for testing this hypothesis.Next-generation DNA methylation measures of biological aging developed to predict mortality risk and physiological decline are more predictive of morbidity and mortality than the original epigenetic clocks developed to predict chronological age. These new measures show consistent evidence of more advanced and faster biological aging in people exposed to socioeconomic disadvantage and may be able to record the emergence of socially determined health inequalities as early as childhood. Next-generation DNA methylation measures of biological aging also indicate race/ethnic disparities in biological aging. More research is needed on these measures in samples of non-Western and non-White populations. New DNA methylation measures of biological aging open opportunities for refining inference about the causes of social disparities in health and devising policies to eliminate them. Further refining measures of biological aging by including more diversity in samples used for measurement development is a critical priority for the field.Â© 2022.

No,20220228,early detection,35164838,Novel epigenetic network biomarkers for early detection of esophageal cancer.,Clin Epigenetics,"Early detection of esophageal cancer is critical to improve survival. Whilst studies have identified biomarkers, their interpretation and validity is often confounded by cell-type heterogeneity.Here we applied systems-epigenomic and cell-type deconvolution algorithms to a discovery set encompassing RNA-Seq and DNA methylation data from esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) patients and matched normal-adjacent tissue, in order to identify robust biomarkers, free from the confounding effect posed by cell-type heterogeneity. We identify 12 gene-modules that are epigenetically deregulated in EAC, and are able to validate all 12 modules in 4 independent EAC cohorts. We demonstrate that the epigenetic deregulation is present in the epithelial compartment of EAC-tissue. Using single-cell RNA-Seq data we show that one of these modules, a proto-cadherin module centered around CTNND2, is inactivated in Barrett's Esophagus, a precursor lesion to EAC. By measuring DNA methylation in saliva from EAC cases and controls, we identify a chemokine module centered around CCL20, whose methylation patterns in saliva correlate with EAC status.Given our observations that a CCL20 chemokine network is overactivated in EAC tissue and saliva from EAC patients, and that in independent studies CCL20 has been found to be overactivated in EAC tissue infected with the bacterium F. nucleatum, a bacterium that normally inhabits the oral cavity, our results highlight the possibility of using DNAm measurements in saliva as a proxy for changes occurring in the esophageal epithelium. Both the CTNND2/CCL20 modules represent novel promising network biomarkers for EAC that merit further investigation.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",
No,20220228,epigenetics,35143483,Slow nucleosome dynamics set the transcriptional speed limit and induce RNA polymerase II traffic jams and bursts.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Nucleosomes are recognized as key regulators of transcription. However, the relationship between slow nucleosome unwrapping dynamics and bulk transcriptional properties has not been thoroughly explored. Here, an agent-based model that we call the dynamic defect Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ddTASEP) was constructed to investigate the effects of nucleosome-induced pausing on transcriptional dynamics. Pausing due to slow nucleosome dynamics induced RNAPII convoy formation, which would cooperatively prevent nucleosome rebinding leading to bursts of transcription. The mean first passage time (MFPT) and the variance of first passage time (VFPT) were analytically expressed in terms of the nucleosome rate constants, allowing for the direct quantification of the effects of nucleosome-induced pausing on pioneering polymerase dynamics. The mean first passage elongation rate Î³(hc, ho) is inversely proportional to the MFPT and can be considered to be a new axis of the ddTASEP phase diagram, orthogonal to the classical Î±Î²-plane (where Î± and Î² are the initiation and termination rates). Subsequently, we showed that, for Î² = 1, there is a novel jamming transition in the Î±Î³-plane that separates the ddTASEP dynamics into initiation-limited and nucleosome pausing-limited regions. We propose analytical estimates for the RNAPII density Ï, average elongation rate v, and transcription flux J and verified them numerically.

We investigated whether DNA methylation is associated with antihypertensive responses to a diuretic, a beta-blocker, a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin receptor antagonist. In addition, since we previously showed an SNP at the transcription start site (TSS) of the catecholamine biosynthesis-relatedACY3gene to associate with blood pressure (BP) response to beta-blockers, we specifically analysed the association of methylation sites close to theACY3TSS with BP responses to beta-blockers. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study between leukocyte DNA methylation and BP responses to antihypertensive monotherapies in two hypertensive Finnish cohorts: the GENRES (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03276598; amlodipine 5 mg, bisoprolol 5 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, or losartan 50 mg daily) and the LIFE-Fin studies (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00338260; atenolol 50 mg or losartan 50 mg daily). The monotherapy groups consisted of approximately 200 individuals each. We identified 64 methylation sites to suggestively associate (PÂ <Â 1E-5) with either systolic or diastolic BP responses to a particular study drug in GENRES. These associations did not replicate in LIFE-Fin . Three methylation sites close to theACY3TSS were associated with systolic BP responses to bisoprolol in GENRES but not genome-wide significantly (PÂ <Â 0.05). No robust associations between DNA methylation and BP responses to four different antihypertensive drugs were identified. However, the findings on the methylation sites close to theACY3TSS may support the role ofACY3genetic and epigenetic variation in BP response to bisoprolol.",

We carried out a longitudinal epigenome-wide association study, using data from the Isle of Wight Birth Cohort (IOWBC). To improve statistical power, we first screened CpGs based on associations of DNA methylation (DNAm) at an age of 10 years (pre-adolescence) with asthma acquisition at 10-18 years (during adolescence). A logistic regression with repeated measures was applied to CpGs that passed screening to examine the associations of pre-adolescence DNAm with asthma acquisition from 10-18 years and 18-26 years, with an interaction term to evaluate transition period specificity. Findings were further tested in an independent birth cohort, ALSPAC. In total, 205 CpGs (with 150 being females) showed associations with asthma acquisition (main or interaction effects) at FDR = 0.05 in IOWBC, of which 112 (90 being females) showed consistent associations in the ALSPAC. Genes that the identified CpGs were mapped to, e.g.,AKAP1andENO1, have been shown to be associated with the risk of asthma. Our findings indicated that DNAm at specific CpGs was associated with asthma acquisition. CpGs showing such associations were likely to be different between males and females and, at certain CpGs, were unique to a specific transition period.",

We aimed to assess the association between genotype, DNA methylation patterns, alcohol consumption, and chronic diseases in Korean population. We analyzed 8840 subjects for genotypes and 446 for DNA methylation among the 9351 subjects from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). We further divided both groups into two sub-groups according to the presence/absence of chronic diseases. We selected genes whose methylation varied significantly with alcohol consumption, and visualized genotype and DNA methylation patterns specific to each group. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)rs2074356andrs11066280in HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 4 (HECTD4) to be significantly associated with alcohol consumption in both the presence.

Furthermore, we retrieved differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from four groups based on sex and chronic diseases and compared them by drinking status. In genotype analysis, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) showed a higher proportion in drinker than in non-drinker, but not in DMR analysis. Additionally, we analyzed the enriched Gene Ontology terms and Kyoto Gene and Genome Encyclopedia (KEGG) pathways and visualized the network, heatmap, and upset plot. We show that the pattern of DNA methylation associated with CVD is strongly influenced by alcoholism.

Here, we present a blood-based epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis in 9706 samples passing stringent quality control (6763 patients, 2943 controls). We identified a total of 45 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) annotated to 42 genes, which are enriched for pathways and traits related to metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, and immunity. We then tested 39 DNA methylation-based proxies of putative ALS risk factors and found that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, white blood cell proportions, and alcohol intake were independently associated with ALS. Integration of these results with our latest genome-wide association study showed that cholesterol biosynthesis was potentially causally related to ALS.

Epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the etiology of PTSD, with DNA methylation being the most studied to identify novel molecular biomarkers associated with this disorder. We performed one of the largest single-sample epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of PTSD to date. Our sample included 1135 male European-American U.S. veterans who participated in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study (NHRVS). DNA was collected from saliva samples and the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip was used for the methylation analysis. PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Checklist. An EWAS was conducted using linear regression adjusted for age, cell-type proportions, first 10 principal components, and smoking status. After Bonferroni correction, we identified six genome-wide significant (GWS) CpG sites associated with past-month PTSD and three CpGs with lifetime PTSD (prangeâ€‰=â€‰10-10-10-8). These CpG sites map to genes involved in immune function, transcription regulation, axonal guidance, cell signaling, and protein binding. Among these, SENP7, which is involved in transcription regulation and has been linked to risk-taking behavior and alcohol consumption in genome-wide association studies, replicated in an independent veteran cohort and was downregulated in medial orbitofrontal cortex of PTSD postmortem brain tissue. These findings suggest potential epigenetic biomarkers of PTSD that may help inform the pathophysiology of this disorder in veterans and other trauma-affected populations.Â© 2022.

Improving the prediction of incident type 2 diabetes using epigenetic markers could help tailor prevention efforts to those at the highest risk. The aim of this study was to identify predictive methylation markers for incident type 2 diabetes by combining epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results from five prospective European cohorts.We conducted a meta-analysis of EWASs in blood collected 7-10Â years prior to type 2 diabetes diagnosis. DNA methylation was measured with Illumina Infinium Methylation arrays. A total of 1250 cases and 1950 controls from five longitudinal cohorts were included: Doetinchem, ESTHER, KORA1, KORA2 and EPIC-Norfolk. Associations between DNA methylation and incident type 2 diabetes were examined using robust linear regression with adjustment for potential confounders. Inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis of cohort-level individual CpG EWAS estimates was performed using METAL. The methylGSA R package was used for gene set enrichment analysis. Confirmation of genome-wide significant CpG sites was performed in a cohort of Indian Asians (LOLIPOP, UK).The meta-analysis identified 76 CpG sites that were differentially methylated in individuals with incident type 2 diabetes compared with control individuals (p values <1.1â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7). Sixty-four out of 76 (84.2%) CpG sites were confirmed by directionally consistent effects and p values <0.05 in an independent cohort of Indian Asians. However, on adjustment for baseline BMI only four CpG sites remained genome-wide significant, and addition of the 76 CpG methylation risk score to a prediction model including established predictors of type 2 diabetes (age, sex, BMI and HbA1c) showed no improvement (AUC 0.757 vs 0.753). Gene set enrichment analysis of the full epigenome-wide results clearly showed enrichment of processes linked to insulin signalling, lipid homeostasis and inflammation.By combining results from five European cohorts, and thus significantly increasing study sample size, we identified 76 CpG sites associated with incident type 2 diabetes. Replication of 64 CpGs in an independent cohort of Indian Asians suggests that the association between DNA methylation levels and incident type 2 diabetes is robust and independent of ethnicity. Our data also indicate that BMI partly explains the association between DNA methylation and incident type 2 diabetes. Further studies are required to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms and to determine potential causal roles of the differentially methylated CpG sites in type 2 diabetes development.Â© 2022.

This study focused on DNA methylation profiles in a human cohort, comprising 125 nonsmoking city policemen (sampled twice), living and working in three localities (Prague, Ostrava and Ceske Budejovice) of the Czech Republic, who spent the majority of their working time outdoors. The main characterization of the localities, differing by major sources of air pollution, was defined by the stationary air pollution monitoring of PM2.5, B[a]P and NO2. DNA methylation was analyzed by a genome-wide microarray method. No season-specific DNA methylation pattern was discovered; however, we identified 13,643 differentially methylated CpG loci (DML) for a comparison between the Prague and Ostrava groups. The most significant DML was cg10123377 (log2FC = -1.92,p= 8.30 Ã— 10-4) and loci annotated toRPTOR(total 20 CpG loci). We also found two hypomethylated loci annotated to the DNA repair geneXRCC5.Groups of DML annotated to the same gene were linked to diabetes mellitus (KCNQ1), respiratory diseases (PTPRN2), the dopaminergic system of the brain and neurodegenerative diseases (NR4A2). The most significant possibly affected pathway was Axon guidance, with 86 potentially deregulated genes near DML. The cluster of gene sets that could be affected by DNA methylation in the Ostrava groups mainly includes the neuronal functions and biological processes of cell junctions and adhesion assembly. The study demonstrates that the differences in the type of air pollution between localities can affect a unique change in DNA methylation profiles across the human genome.",

Immunological changes originating during reproduction may help explain some of these relationships.To explore the potential role of the immune system in female CoR, we characterized leukocyte composition and regulatory processes using DNA methylation (DNAm) in a cross-sectional cohort of young (20-22 years old) women differing in reproductive status.Compared to nulliparity, pregnancy was characterized by differential methylation at 828 sites, 96% of which were hypomethylated and enriched for genes associated with T-cell activation, innate immunity, pre-eclampsia and neoplasia. Breastfeeding was associated with differential methylation at 1107 sites (71% hypermethylated), enriched for genes involved in metabolism, immune self-recognition and neurogenesis. There were no significant differences in DNAm between nulliparous and parous women. However, compared to nullipara, pregnant women had lower proportions of B, CD4T, CD8T and natural killer (NK) cells, and higher proportions of granulocytes and monocytes. Monocyte counts were lower and NK counts higher among breastfeeding women, and remained so among parous women.Our findings point to widespread differences in DNAm during pregnancy and lactation. These effects appear largely transient, but may accumulate with gravidity become detectable as women age. Nulliparous and parous women differed in leukocyte composition, consistent with more persistent effects of reproduction on cell type. These findings support transient (leukocyte DNAm) and persistent (cell composition) changes associated with reproduction in women, illuminating potential pathways contributing to CoR.Lay Summary:Evolutionary theory and epidemiology support costs of reproduction (CoR) to women's health that may involve changes in immune function. We report differences in immune cell composition and gene regulation during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While many of these differences appear transient, immune cell composition may remain, suggesting mechanisms for female CoR.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

Since consortia preprocess data prior to distribution, new processing pipelines can lead to different versions of the same dataset. Similarly, analytic frameworks evolve to incorporate cutting-edge methods and best practices. However, it remains unknown how different data and analytic versions alter the results of epigenome-wide analyses, which could influence the replicability of epigenetic associations. Thus, we assessed the impact of these changes using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. We analysed DNA methylation from two data versions, processed using separate preprocessing and analytic pipelines, examining associations between seven childhood adversities or prenatal smoking exposure and DNA methylation at age 7. We performed two sets of analyses: (1) epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS); (2) Structured Life Course Modelling Approach (SLCMA), a two-stage method that models time-dependent effects. SLCMA results were also compared across two analytic versions. Data version changes impacted both EWAS and SLCMA analyses, yielding different associations at conventional p-value thresholds. However, the magnitude and direction of associations was generally consistent between data versions, regardless of p-values. Differences were especially apparent in analyses of childhood adversity, while smoking associations were more consistent using significance thresholds. SLCMA analytic versions similarly altered top associations, but time-dependent effects remained concordant. Alterations to data and analytic versions influenced the results of epigenome-wide analyses. Our findings highlight that magnitude and direction are better measures for replication and stability than p-value thresholds.",

In the face of increasing volumes of data, heuristic methods that trade software speed for accuracy may be employed. We have studied these trade-offs using the results of a large number of independent software benchmarks, and evaluated whether external factors, including speed, author reputation, journal impact, recency and developer efforts, are indicative of accurate software.We find that software speed, author reputation, journal impact, number of citations and age are unreliable predictors of software accuracy. This is unfortunate because these are frequently cited reasons for selecting software tools. However, GitHub-derived statistics and high version numbers show that accurate bioinformatic software tools are generally the product of many improvements over time. We also find an excess of slow and inaccurate bioinformatic software tools, and this is consistent across many sub-disciplines. There are few tools that are middle-of-road in terms of accuracy and speed trade-offs.Our findings indicate that accurate bioinformatic software is primarily the product of long-term commitments to software development. In addition, we hypothesise that bioinformatics software suffers from publication bias. Software that is intermediate in terms of both speed and accuracy may be difficult to publish-possibly due to author, editor and reviewer practises. This leaves an unfortunate hole in the literature, as ideal tools may fall into this gap. High accuracy tools are not always useful if they are slow, while high speed is not useful if the results are also inaccurate.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Here, we investigated whether single-cell ATAC-seq would provide further resolution of transcriptomic patterns that align with patient outcomes.We performed scATAC-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four trauma patients at <4Â h, 24Â h, 72Â h post-injury and four matched healthy controls, and extracted the features associated with the global epigenetic alterations. Three large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets from trauma, burn and sepsis patients were used to validate the scATAC-seq derived signature, explore patient epigenetic heterogeneity (Epigenetic Groups: EG_hi vs. EG_lo), and associate patterns with clinical outcomes in critical illness.Patient subsets with gene expression patterns in blood leukocytes representative of a high global epigenetic signature (EG_hi) had worse outcomes across three etiologies of critical illness. EG_hi designation contributed independent of the known immune leukocyte transcriptomic responses to patient prognosis (Trauma: HR=0.62 [95% CI: 0.43-0.89, event set as recovery], p=0.01, n=167; Burns: HR=4.35 [95% CI: 0.816-23.2, event set as death], p=0.085, n=121; Sepsis: HR=1.60 [95% CI: 1.10-2.33, event set as death], p=0.013, n=479; Cox proportional hazards regression).The inclusion of gene expression patterns that associate with global epigenetic changes in circulating leukocytes improves the resolution of transcriptome-based patient classification in acute critical illnesses.

In addition to X-linked DNA methylation, sex-specific methylation patterns are widespread across autosomal chromosomes and can be present from birth or arise over time. In individuals where gender identity and sex assigned at birth are markedly incongruent, as in the case of transgender people, feminization or masculinization may be sought through gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). GAHT is a cornerstone of transgender care, yet no studies to date have investigated its effect on genome-wide methylation. We profiled genome-wide DNA methylation in blood of transgender women (nâ€‰=â€‰13) and transgender men (nâ€‰=â€‰13) before and during GAHT (6Â months and 12Â months into feminizing or masculinizing hormone therapy).We identified several thousand differentially methylated CpG sites (DMPs) (Î”Î²â€‰â‰¥â€‰0.02, unadjusted p valueâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and several differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in both people undergoing feminizing and masculinizing GAHT, the vast majority of which were progressive changes over time. X chromosome and sex-specific autosomal DNA methylation patterns established in early development are largely refractory to change in association with GAHT, with only 3% affected (Î”Î²â€‰â‰¥â€‰0.02, unadjusted p valueâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The small number of sex-specific DMPs that were affected by GAHT were those that become sex-specific during the lifetime, known as sex-and-age DMPs, including DMRs in PRR4 and VMP1 genes. The GAHT-induced changes at these sex-associated probes consistently demonstrated a shift towards the methylation signature of the GAHT-naÃ¯ve opposite sex, and we observed enrichment of previously reported adolescence-associated methylation changes.We provide evidence for GAHT inducing a unique blood methylation signature in transgender people. This study advances our understanding of the complex interplay between sex hormones, sex chromosomes, and DNA methylation in the context of immunity. We highlight the need to broaden the field of 'sex-specific' immunity beyond cisgender males and cisgender females, as transgender people on GAHT exhibit a unique molecular profile.Â© 2022.

Accelerated aging, calculated from the discrepancy between the chronological age and the epigenetic age, has shown to predict morbidity and mortality rate. We assumed that deconvolution of epigenetic age to its components could shed light on the diversity of epigenetic, and by inference, on inter-individual variability in the causes of biological aging.Using the Horvath original epigenetic clock, we identified several CpG sites linked to distinct genes that quantitatively explain much of the inter-personal variability in epigenetic aging, with CpG sites related to secretagogin and malin being the most variable. We show that equal epigenetic age in different subjects can result from variable contribution size of the same CpG sites to the total epigenetic age. In a healthy cohort, the most variable CpG sites are responsible for accelerated and decelerated epigenetic aging, relative to chronological age.Of the 353 CpG sites that form the basis for the Horvath epigenetic age, we have found the CpG sites that are responsible for accelerated and decelerated epigenetic aging in healthy subjects. However, the relative contribution of each site to aging varies between individuals, leading to variable personal aging patterns. Our findings pave the way to form personalized aging cards allowing the identification of specific genes related to CpG sites, as aging markers, and perhaps treatment of these targets in order to hinder undesirable age drifting.Â© 2022.

Apart from a few (4%) oocytes with single imprinting defects (in eitherPEG3orGTL2), the analyzed GV oocytes displayed correct imprinting patterns.

Although countless structural and functional studies of cytosine methylation have been reported, our understanding of how it influences the nucleosome assembly, structure, and dynamics remains obscure. Here, we investigate the effects of cytosine methylation at CpG sites on nucleosome dynamics and stability. By applying long molecular dynamics simulations on several microsecond time scale, we generate extensive atomistic conformational ensembles of full nucleosomes. Our results reveal that methylation induces pronounced changes in geometry for both linker and nucleosomal DNA, leading to a more curved, under-twisted DNA, narrowing the adjacent minor grooves, and shifting the population equilibrium of sugar-phosphate backbone geometry. These DNA conformational changes are associated with a considerable enhancement of interactions between methylated DNA and the histone octamer, doubling the number of contacts at some key arginines. H2A and H3 tails play important roles in these interactions, especially for DNA methylated nucleosomes. This, in turn, prevents a spontaneous DNA unwrapping of 3-4 helical turns for the methylated nucleosome with truncated histone tails, otherwise observed in the unmethylated system on several microseconds time scale.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research 2022.",

The current study was designed to develop an epigenetic biomarker for susceptibility of preterm birth using buccal cells from the mother, father, and child (triads). An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was used to identify differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) using a comparison of control term birth versus preterm birth triads. Epigenetic DMR associations with preterm birth were identified for both the mother and father that were distinct and suggest potential epigenetic contributions from both parents. The mother (165 DMRs) and female child (136 DMRs) at pâ€‰<â€‰1e-04 had the highest number of DMRs and were highly similar suggesting potential epigenetic inheritance of the epimutations. The male child had negligible DMR associations. The DMR associated genes for each group involve previously identified preterm birth associated genes. Observations identify a potential paternal germline contribution for preterm birth and identify the potential epigenetic inheritance of preterm birth susceptibility for the female child later in life. Although expanded clinical trials and preconception trials are required to optimize the potential epigenetic biomarkers, such epigenetic biomarkers may allow preventative medicine strategies to reduce the incidence of preterm birth.Â© 2022.

This cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) site maps toWNT5B, associated with adipogenesis and glycaemic phenotypes. We did not identify associations with childhood gene expression, nor did we find enriched biological pathways. The association did not persist into childhood.In this meta-analysis, maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet (excluding alcohol) during pregnancy was associated with cord blood DNA methylation level at cg23757341. Potential mediation of DNA methylation in associations with offspring health requires further study.",

However, their molecular effects on the human brain are poorly studied, due to difficulty of tissue access and confounders associated with disease status. Here we examine differences in gene expression and DNA methylation associated with positive antipsychotic drug toxicology status in the human caudate nucleus. We find no genome-wide significant differences in DNA methylation, but abundant differences in gene expression. These gene expression differences are overall quite similar to gene expression differences between schizophrenia cases and controls. Interestingly, gene expression differences based on antipsychotic toxicology are different between brain regions, potentially due to affected cell type differences. We finally assess similarities with effects in a mouse model, which finds some overlapping effects but many differences as well. As a first look at the molecular effects of antipsychotics in the human brain, the lack of epigenetic effects is unexpected, possibly because long term treatment effects may be relatively stable for extended periods.Â© 2022.

However, the underlying role of epigenetics as a mediator of this association remains unknown.DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral blood was measured at age 18â€…years in the Isle of Wight birth cohort (IOWBC) along with data on age of pubertal events, forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1â€…s (FEV1) at 26â€…years. Structural equation models were applied to examine mediation effects of DNAm on the association of age at pubertal events with FVC and FEV1. Findings were further tested in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.In the IOWBC, for females, 21 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) were shown to mediate the association of age at puberty with FVC or FEV1at 26â€…years (p<0.05). In males, DNAm at 20 CpGs was found to mediate the association of age at puberty with FVC (p<0.05). At almost all these CpGs, indirect effects (effects of age at pubertal events on FVC or FEV1viaDNAm) contributed a smaller portion to the total effects compared to direct effects (e.g.at cg08680129, âˆ¼22% of the estimated total effect of age at menarche on FVC at age 26 was contributed by an indirect effect). Among the IOWBC-discovered CpGs available in ALSPAC, none of them was replicated in ALSPAC (p>0.05).Our findings suggest that post-adolescence DNAm in peripheral blood is likely not to mediate the association of age at pubertal onset with young adulthood FVC or FEV1.Copyright Â©The authors 2022.",

We examined the associations of maternal perceived stress, including preconception exposure, with DNA methylation (DNAm) alterations in the cord blood buffy coats of 358 singleton infants.Maternal perceived stress was measured prior to and throughout pregnancy in a cohort of women enrolled in Effects of Aspirin in Gestation and Reproduction Trial (EAGeR) trial. Perceived stress assessments based on a standardized Likert-scale were obtained in periconception (~2â€‰months preconception and 2-8â€‰weeks of gestation) and pregnancy (8-36â€‰weeks of gestation). Cumulative perceived stress was estimated by calculating the predicted area under the curve of stress reported prior to and during pregnancy. DNAm was measured by the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Multivariable robust linear regression was used to assess associations of perceived stress with individual CpG probes.Based on a 0 to 3 scale, average reported preconception and early pregnancy stress were 0.76 (0.60) and 0.67 (0.50), respectively. Average mid- to late-pregnancy stress, based on a 0 to 10 scale, was 4.9 (1.6). Neither periconception nor pregnancy perceived stress were associated with individual CpG sites in neonatal cord blood (all false discovery rate [FDR] >5%).No effects of maternal perceived stress exposure on array-wide cord blood neonatal methylation differences were found.Â© The Author(s) 2022.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the disproportionate susceptibility to sepsis and worse outcomes in the elderly are not well understood. Recently, changes in DNA methylation have been shown to be linked to aging processes and age-related diseases. Thus, we postulated that age-related changes in DNA methylation may play a role in the onset and prognosis of sepsis in elderly patients. Here, we performed genome-wide methylation profiling of peripheral blood from patients with sepsis and controls. Among the CpG sites whose methylation changes may contribute to an increase in sepsis susceptibility or mortality, 241 sites that possessed age-related changes in DNA methylation in controls may partly explain the increased risk of sepsis in older adults, and 161 sites whose methylation significantly correlated with age in sepsis group may be the potential mechanisms underlying the worse outcomes of elderly septic patients. Finally, an independent cohort was used to validate our findings. Together, our study demonstrates that age-related changes in DNA methylation may explain in part the disproportionate susceptibility and worse outcomes of sepsis in older adults.Copyright Â© 2022 Lang, Shen, Zhu, Zhao, Chen, Zhu, Su, Wang, Wang, Neri, Jiang and Chen.",

We hypothesized that differences in DNA methylation (DNAm) play a role in racial disparities in cLBP.To determine the relationship between DNAm levels and racial group differences in adults with cLBP. Our study's secondary purpose was to perform a race-stratified comparison of adults with cLBP and pain-free controls and identify functional genomic pathways enriched by annotated differentially methylated genes.We recruited 49 NHBs and 49 NHWs (49 cLBP and 49 pain-free controls, PFCs), analyzed DNAm from whole blood using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, and identified enriched genomic pathways.Among participants with cLBP, we identified 2873 differentially methylated loci (DML; methylation differences of at least 10% and pÂ <Â 0.0001), many of which were annotated to genes of importance to pain pathology. These DMLs significantly enriched pathways to involved in nociception/pain processing (Dopamine-DARPP32 Feedback in cAMP signaling,GABA Receptor Signaling,Opioid Signaling) and neuronal differentiation (e.g.,Calcium Signaling, Axon Guidance Signaling, andEndocannabinoid Neuronal Synapse). Our race stratified analyses of individuals with cLBP versus PFCs revealed 2356 DMLs in NHBs and 772 DMLs in NHWs with pÂ <Â 0.0001 andÂ >Â 10% methylation difference. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed that many pathways of significance to pain such asCorticotropin Releasing Hormone Signaling, White Adipose Tissue Browning,andGABA Receptor Signaling pathways, were more significant in NHBs than NHWs.Even though an individual's self-identified race is a social construct, not a biological variable, racism associated with that classification affects virtually every aspect of life, including disease risk. DNAm induced alterations in stress signaling pathways may explain worse pain outcomes in NHBs.Â© 2022 The Author(s).",

Environmental triggers of MS, such as viral infections or smoking, were demonstrated to affect DNA methylation, and thus to involve this important epigenetic mechanism in the development of pathological process. To identify MS-associated DNA methylation hallmarks, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of two cell populations (CD4+ T-lymphocytes and CD14+ monocytes), collected from the same treatment-naive relapsing-remitting MS patients and healthy subjects, using Illumina 450Â K methylation arrays. We revealed significant changes in DNA methylation for both cell populations in MS. In CD4+ cells of MS patients the majority of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were shown to be hypomethylated, while in CD14+ cells - hypermethylated. Differential methylation of HLA-DRB1 gene in CD4+ and CD14+ cells was associated with carriage of DRB1*15 allele independently from the disease status. Besides, about 20% of identified DMPs were shared between two cell populations and had the same direction of methylation changes; they may be involved in basic epigenetic processes occuring in MS. These findings suggest that the epigenetic mechanism of DNA methylation in immune cells contributes to MS; further studies are now required to validate these results and understand their functional significance.Copyright Â© 2022.

To the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal studies have examined the associations between gestational PFAS and DNA methylation.We examined associations of gestational PFAS exposure with longitudinal DNA methylation measures at birth and in adolescence using the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study (2003-2006; Cincinnati, Ohio).We quantified serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) in mothers during pregnancy. We measured DNA methylation in cord blood (n=266) and peripheral leukocytes at 12 years of age (n=160) using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip. We analyzed associations betweenlog2-transformedPFAS concentrations and repeated DNA methylation measures using linear regression with generalized estimating equations. We included interaction terms between children's age and gestational PFAS. We performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis to identify molecular pathways. We used Project Viva (1999-2002; Boston, Massachusetts) to replicate significant associations.After adjusting for covariates, 435 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites were associated with PFAS (false discovery rate,q<0.05). Specifically, we identified 2 CpGs for PFOS, 12 for PFOA, 8 for PFHxS, and 413 for PFNA; none overlapped. Among these, 2 CpGs for PFOA and 4 for PFNA were replicated in Project Viva. Some of the PFAS-associated CpG sites annotated to gene regions related to cancers, cognitive health, cardiovascular disease, and kidney function. We found little evidence that the associations between PFAS and DNA methylation differed by children's age.In these longitudinal data, PFAS biomarkers were associated with differences in several CpGs at birth and at 12 years of age in or near genes linked to some PFAS-associated health outcomes. Future studies should examine whether DNA methylation mediates associations between gestational PFAS exposure and health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10118.",

It is of interest to understand the interrelationship of germline genetics, DNAm, and CRC risk.We performed a genome-wide methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) analysis in 1355 people, assessing the pairwise associations between genetic variants and lymphocytes methylation data. In addition, we used penalized regression with cis-genetic variants +/- 1Mb of methylation to identify genome-wide heritable DNAm. We evaluated the association of genetically predicted methylation with CRC risk based on GWAS of over 125,000 cases and controls using the multivariate sMiST as well as univariately via examination of marginal association with CRC risk.Of the 142 known CRC genome-wide association studies (GWAS) loci, 47 were identified as meQTLs. We identified 4 novel CRC associated loci (NID2, ATXN10, KLHDC10 and CEP41) that reside over 1Mb outside of known CRC loci and 10 secondary signals within 1Mb of known loci.Leveraging information of DNAm regulation into genetic association of CRC risk reveals novel pathways in CRC tumorigenesis. Our summary statistics-based framework sMiST provides a powerful approach by combining information from the effect through methylation and residual direct effects of the meQTLs on disease risk. Further validation and functional follow-up of these novel pathways are needed.Using genotype, DNA methylation, GWAS, we identified four new CRC risk loci. We studied the landscape of genetic regulation of DNA methylation via single-SNP and multi-SNP meQTL analyses.",
No,20220314,methods,35245419,Sparse latent factor regression models for genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies.,Stat Appl Genet Mol Biol,"Association of phenotypes or exposures with genomic and epigenomic data faces important statistical challenges. One of these challenges is to account for variation due to unobserved confounding factors, such as individual ancestry or cell-type composition in tissues. This issue can be addressed with penalized latent factor regression models, where penalties are introduced to cope with high dimension in the data. If a relatively small proportion of genomic or epigenomic markers correlate with the variable of interest, sparsity penalties may help to capture the relevant associations, but the improvement over non-sparse approaches has not been fully evaluated yet. Here, we present least-squares algorithms that jointly estimate effect sizes and confounding factors in sparse latent factor regression models. In simulated data, sparse latent factor regression models generally achieved higher statistical performance than other sparse methods, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and a Bayesian sparse linear mixed model. In generative model simulations, statistical performance was slightly lower (while being comparable) to non-sparse methods, but in simulations based on empirical data, sparse latent factor regression models were more robust to departure from the model than the non-sparse approaches. We applied sparse latent factor regression models to a genome-wide association study of a flowering trait for the plantArabidopsis thalianaand to an epigenome-wide association study of smoking status in pregnant women. For both applications, sparse latent factor regression models facilitated the estimation of non-null effect sizes while overcoming multiple testing issues. The results were not only consistent with previous discoveries, but they also pinpointed new genes with functional annotations relevant to each application.Â© 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",

Traditional diagnostic techniques rely heavily on heuristic approaches, coupling clinical experience from prior rare disease presentations with the medical literature. A large number of rare disease patients remain undiagnosed for years and many even die without an accurate diagnosis. In recent years, gene panels, microarrays, and exome sequencing have helped to identify the molecular cause of such rare and undiagnosed diseases. These technologies have allowed diagnoses for a sizable proportion (25-35%) of undiagnosed patients, often with actionable findings. However, a large proportion of these patients remain undiagnosed. In this review, we focus on technologies that can be adopted if exome sequencing is unrevealing. We discuss the benefits of sequencing the whole genome and the additional benefit that may be offered by long-read technology, pan-genome reference, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and methyl profiling. We highlight computational methods to help identify regionally distant patients with similar phenotypes or similar genetic mutations. Finally, we describe approaches to automate and accelerate genomic analysis. The strategies discussed here are intended to serve as a guide for clinicians and researchers in the next steps when encountering patients with non-diagnostic exomes.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

We identified 30 genes in 19 regions across the three PTSD symptom clusters. We found nine genes to have cell-type specific expression, and over-representation of miRNA-families - miR-148, 30, and 8. Gene-drug target prioritization approach highlighted cyclooxygenase and acetylcholine compounds. Next, we tested molecular-profile based phenome-wide impact of identified genes with respect to 1678 phenotypes derived from the Electronic Health Records of the Vanderbilt University biorepository (Nâ€‰=â€‰70,439). Lastly, we tested for local genetic correlation across PTSD symptom clusters which highlighted metabolic (e.g., obesity, diabetes, vascular health) and laboratory traits (e.g., neutrophil, eosinophil, tau protein, creatinine kinase). Overall, this study finds comprehensive genomic evidence including clinical and regulatory profiles between PTSD, hematologic and cardiometabolic traits, that support comorbidities observed in epidemiologic studies of PTSD.Â© 2022.

Recent large-scale studies have reported genetic (i.e., protein quantitative trait loci, pQTLs) and non-genetic factors, such as age and sex, as major determinants to inter-individual variability in immune response variation. However, the contribution of blood-cell composition to plasma protein heterogeneity has not been fully characterized and may act as a mediating factor in association studies.Here, we evaluated plasma protein levels from 400 unrelated healthy individuals of western European ancestry, who were stratified by sex and two decades of life (20-29 and 60-69 years), from the Milieu IntÃ©rieur cohort. We quantified 229 proteins by Luminex in a clinically certified laboratory and their levels of variation were analyzed together with 5.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. With respect to non-genetic variables, we included 254 lifestyle and biochemical factors, as well as counts of seven circulating immune cell populations measured by hemogram and standardized flow cytometry.Collectively, we found 152 significant associations involving 49 proteins and 20 non-genetic variables. Consistent with previous studies, age and sex showed a global, pervasive impact on plasma protein heterogeneity, while body mass index and other health status variables were among the non-genetic factors with the highest number of associations. After controlling for these covariates, we identified 100 and 12 pQTLs acting in cis and trans, respectively, collectively associated with 87 plasma proteins and including 19 novel genetic associations. Genetic factors explained the largest fraction of the variability of plasma protein levels, as compared to non-genetic factors. In addition, blood-cell fractions, including leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and platelets, had a larger contribution to inter-individual variability than age and sex and appeared as confounders of specific genetic associations. Finally, we identified new genetic associations with plasma protein levels of five monogenic Mendelian disease genes including two primary immunodeficiency genes (Ficolin-3 and FAS).Our study identified novel genetic and non-genetic factors associated to plasma protein levels which may inform health status and disease management.Â© 2022.

We have previously observed links between epigenetic aging signatures in breast/tumor tissue and breast cancer risk/prevalence. However, these DNA methylation-based aging biomarkers capture diverse epigenetic phenomena and it is not known to what degree they relate to breast cancer risk, and/or progression.Using six epigenetic clocks, we analyzed whether they distinguish normal breast tissue adjacent to tumor (cases) vs normal breast tissue from healthy controls (controls).The Levine (pâ€‰=â€‰0.0037) and Yang clocks (pâ€‰=â€‰0.023) showed significant epigenetic age acceleration in cases vs controls in breast tissue. We observed that much of the difference between cases and controls is driven by CpGs associated with polycomb-related genes. Thus, we developed a new score utilizing only CpGs associated with polycomb-related genes and demonstrated that it robustly captured epigenetic age acceleration in cases vs controls (pâ€‰=â€‰0.00012). Finally, we tested whether this same signal could be seen in peripheral blood. We observed no difference in cases vs. controls and no correlation between matched tissue/blood samples, suggesting that peripheral blood is not a good surrogate marker for epigenetic age acceleration.Moving forward, it will be critical for studies to elucidate whether epigenetic age acceleration in breast tissue precedes breast cancer diagnosis and whether methylation changes at CpGs associated with polycomb-related genes can be used to assess the risk of developing breast cancer among unaffected individuals.Â© 2022.

The opportunity to use minimally invasive liquid biopsy testing to screen asymptomatic individuals at-risk for multiple cancers simultaneously could benefit from the aggregated diseases prevalence and a fixed specificity. Increasing both latter parameters is paramount to mediate high positive predictive value-a useful metric to evaluate a screening test accuracy and its potential harm-benefit. Thus, the use of a single test for multi-cancer early detection (stMCED) has emerged as an appealing strategy for increasing early cancer detection rate efficiency and benefit population health. A recent flurry of these stMCED technologies have been reported for clinical potential; however, their development is facing unique challenges to effectively improve clinical cost-benefit. One promising avenue is the analysis of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) for detecting DNA methylation biomarker fingerprints of malignancies-a hallmark of disease aetiology and progression holding the potential to be tissue- and cancer-type specific. Utilizing panels of epigenetic biomarkers could potentially help to detect earlier stages of malignancies as well as identify a tumour of origin from blood testing, useful information for follow-up clinical decision making and subsequent patient care improvement.

However, the mechanisms underlying changes in DNA methylation remain elusive. Transcription factors initially thought to be repressed from binding by DNA methylation, have recently emerged as being able to shape DNA methylation patterns.Here, we integrated the massive amount of data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas to predict transcription factors driving aberrant DNA methylation in 13 cancer types. We identified differentially methylated regions between cancer and matching healthy samples, searched for transcription factor motifs enriched in those regions and selected transcription factors with corresponding changes in gene expression. We predict transcription factors known to be involved in cancer as well as novel candidates to drive hypo-methylated regions such as FOXA1 and GATA3 in breast cancer, FOXA1 and TWIST1 in prostate cancer and NFE2L2 in lung cancer. We also predict transcription factors that lead to hyper-methylated regions upon transcription factor loss such as EGR1 in several cancer types. Finally, we validate that FOXA1 and GATA3 mediate hypo-methylated regions in breast cancer cells.Our work highlights the importance of some transcription factors as upstream regulators shaping DNA methylation patterns in cancer.Â© 2022.

To improve our ability to identify the most aggressive malignancies, we constructed genome-wide survival models using gene expression, copy number, methylation, and mutation data from 10,884 patients. We identified more than 100,000 significant prognostic biomarkers and demonstrate that these genomic features can predict patient outcomes in clinically ambiguous situations. While adverse biomarkers are commonly believed to represent cancer driver genes and promising therapeutic targets, we show that cancer features associated with shorter survival times are not enriched for either oncogenes or for successful drug targets. Instead, the strongest adverse biomarkers represent widely expressed cell-cycle and housekeeping genes, and, correspondingly, nearly all therapies directed against these features have failed in clinical trials. In total, our analysis establishes a rich resource for prognostic biomarker analysis and clarifies the use of patient survival data in preclinical cancer research and therapeutic development.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors.

In this study, we constructed promoter- and enhancer-enriched nucleosomal histone modification landscapes for adult prefrontal cortex from H3-lysine 27 acetylation and H3-lysine 4 trimethylation profiles, generated from 388 controls and 351 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) (nâ€‰=â€‰739). We mapped thousands of cis-regulatory domains (CRDs), revealing fine-grained, 104-106-bp chromosomal organization, firmly integrated into Hi-C topologically associating domain stratification by open/repressive chromosomal environments and nuclear topography. Large clusters of hyper-acetylated CRDs were enriched for SCZ heritability, with prominent representation of regulatory sequences governing fetal development and glutamatergic neuron signaling. Therefore, SCZ and BD brains show coordinated dysregulation of risk-associated regulatory sequences assembled into kilobase- to megabase-scaling chromosomal domains.Â© 2022.

Opioid overdose, the most severe outcome of opioid use disorder, remains the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. We interrogated the effects of opioid overdose on the brain using ChIP-seq to quantify patterns of H3K27 acetylation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortical neurons isolated from 51 opioid-overdose cases and 51 accidental death controls. Among opioid cases, we observed global hypoacetylation and identified 388 putative enhancers consistently depleted for H3K27ac. Machine learning on H3K27ac patterns predicted case-control status with high accuracy. We focused on case-specific regulatory alterations, revealing 81,399 hypoacetylation events, uncovering vast inter-patient heterogeneity. We developed a strategy to decode this heterogeneity based on convergence analysis, which leveraged promoter-capture Hi-C to identify five genes over-burdened by alterations in their regulatory network or ""plexus"": ASTN2, KCNMA1, DUSP4, GABBR2, ENOX1. These convergent loci are enriched for opioid use disorder risk genes and heritability for generalized anxiety, number of sexual partners, and years of education. Overall, our multi-pronged approach uncovers neurobiological aspects of opioid use disorder and captures genetic and environmental factors perpetuating the opioid epidemic.Â© 2022.

To better understand inter-individual variability, we investigated the genetic basis underlying EAA.Genome-wide association studies of EAA based on multiple epigenetic clocks (Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, and GrimAge) were performed. MethylationEPIC BeadChip array and whole-genome sequencing data were generated with blood-derived DNA from participants in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study (discovery: 2138 pre-existing and 502 newly generated data, all survivors; exploratory: 282 community controls). Linear regression models were fit for each epigenetic age against the allelic dose of each genetic variant, adjusting for age at sampling, sex, and cancer treatment exposures. Fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to combine summary statistics from two discovery data sets. LD (Linkage disequilibrium) score regression was used to estimate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability.For EAA-Horvath, a genome-wide significant association was mapped to the SELP gene with the strongest SNP rs732314 (meta-GWAS: Î²=0.57, P=3.30Ã—10-11). Moreover, the stratified analysis of the association between rs732314 and EAA-Horvath showed a substantial heterogeneity between children and adults (meta-GWAS: Î²=0.97 vs. 0.51, I2=73.1%) as well as between survivors with and without chest/abdominal/pelvic-RT exposure (Î²=0.64 vs. 0.31, I2=66.3%). For EAA-Hannum, an association was mapped to the HLA locus with the strongest SNP rs28366133 (meta-GWAS: Î²=0.78, P=3.78Ã—10-11).

Interestingly, among community controls, rs732314 was associated with EAA-Horvath (Î²=1.09, P=5.43Ã—10-5), whereas rs28366133 was not associated with EAA-Hannum (Î²=0.21, P=0.49). The estimated heritability was 0.33 (SE=0.20) for EAA-Horvath and 0.17 (SE=0.23) for EAA-Hannum, but close to zero for EAA-PhenoAge and EAA-GrimAge.We identified novel genetic variants in the SELP gene and HLA region associated with EAA-Horvath and EAA-Hannum, respectively, among survivors of childhood cancer. The new genetic variants in combination with other replicated known variants can facilitate the identification of survivors at higher risk in developing accelerated aging and potentially inform drug targets for future intervention strategies among vulnerable survivors.Â© 2022.

Nevertheless, it is unclear whether they play a causal role in cancer risk or if they act as a non-causal biomarker.Methods:We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to examine the genetically predicted effects of epigenetic age acceleration as measured by HannumAge (9 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), Horvath Intrinsic Age (24 SNPs), PhenoAge (11 SNPs) and GrimAge (4 SNPs) on multiple cancers (i.e., breast, prostate, colorectal, ovarian and lung cancer). We obtained genome-wide association data for biological ageing from a meta-analysis (N=34,710), and for cancer from the UK Biobank (N cases=2,671-13,879; N controls=173,493-372,016), FinnGen (N cases=719-8,401; N controls=74,685-174,006) and several international cancer genetic consortia (N cases=11,348-122,977; N controls=15,861-105,974). Main analyses were performed using multiplicative random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR. Individual study estimates were pooled using fixed effect meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode and Causal Analysis using Summary Effect Estimates (CAUSE) methods, which are robust to some of the assumptions of the IVW approach.Results:Meta-analysed IVW MR findings suggested that higher GrimAge acceleration increased the risk of colorectal cancer (OR=1.12 per year increase in GrimAge acceleration, 95%CI 1.04-1.20,p=0.002). The direction of the genetically predicted effects was consistent across main and sensitivity MR analyses. Among subtypes, the genetically predicted effect of GrimAge acceleration was greater for colon cancer (IVW OR=1.15, 95%CI 1.09-1.21,p=0.006), than rectal cancer (IVW OR=1.05, 95%CI 0.97-1.13,p=0.24). Results were less consistent for associations between other epigenetic clocks and cancers.Conclusions:GrimAge acceleration may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Findings for other clocks and cancers were inconsistent.

We aimed to identify autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood, using data from 832 children of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project.Blood DNA methylation and gene expression were measured with the Illumina 450K and the Affymetrix HTA v2 arrays, respectively. The relationship between methylation levels and expression of nearby genes (1 Mb window centered at the transcription start site, TSS) was assessed by fitting 13.6 M linear regressions adjusting for sex, age, cohort, and blood cell composition.We identified 39,749 blood autosomal cis eQTMs, representing 21,966 unique CpGs (eCpGs, 5.7% of total CpGs) and 8,886 unique transcript clusters (eGenes, 15.3% of total transcript clusters, equivalent to genes). In 87.9% of these cis eQTMs, the eCpG was located at <250 kb from eGene's TSS; and 58.8% of all eQTMs showed an inverse relationship between the methylation and expression levels. Only around half of the autosomal cis-eQTMs eGenes could be captured through annotation of the eCpG to the closest gene. eCpGs had less measurement error and were enriched for active blood regulatory regions and for CpGs reported to be associated with environmental exposures or phenotypic traits. In 40.4% of the eQTMs, the CpG and the eGene were both associated with at least one genetic variant. The overlap of autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood with those described in adults was small (13.8%), and age-shared cis eQTMs tended to be proximal to the TSS and enriched for genetic variants.This catalogue of autosomal cis eQTMs in children's blood can help the biological interpretation of EWAS findings and is publicly available at https://helixomics.isglobal.org/ and at Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.fxpnvx0t0).The study has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-206) under grant agreement no 308333 (HELIX project); the H2020-EU.3.1.2. - Preventing Disease Programme under grant agreement no 874583 (ATHLETE project); from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement no 733206 (LIFECYCLE project), and from the European Joint Programming Initiative ""A Healthy Diet for a Healthy Life"" (JPI HDHL and Instituto de Salud Carlos III) under the grant agreement no AC18/00006 (NutriPROGRAM project).

We aimed to identify and replicate previously published genomic loci where DNA methylation changes are attributable to in utero exposures in the NutriGen birth cohort studies Alliance.We reviewed the literature to identify differentially methylated sites of newborn DNA which are associated with the following five traits of interest maternal diabetes, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), diet during pregnancy, smoking, and gestational age. We then attempted to replicate these published associations in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) and the South Asian birth cohort (START) cord blood epigenome-wide data.We screened 68 full-text articles and identified a total of 17 cord blood epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of the traits of interest. Out of the 290 CpG sites reported, 19 were identified in more than one study; all of them associated with maternal smoking. In CHILD and START EWAS, thousands of sites associated with gestational age were identified and maintained significance after correction for multiple testing. In CHILD, there was differential methylation observed for 8 of the published maternal smoking sites. No other traits tested (i.e., folate levels, gestational diabetes, birthweight) replicated in the CHILD or START cohorts.Maternal smoking during pregnancy and gestational age are strongly associated with differential methylation in offspring cord blood, as assessed in the EWAS literature and our birth cohorts. There are a limited number of reported methylation sites associated in more than two independent studies related to pregnancy. Additional large studies of diverse populations with fine phenotyping are needed to produce robust epigenome-wide data in order to further elucidate the effect of intrauterine exposures on the infants' methylome.Â© 2022.

Although considered safe, studies have demonstrated associations between prenatal acetaminophen use and adverse health outcomes in offspring. Since DNA methylation (DNAm) at birth may act as an early indicator of later health, assessments on whether DNAm of newborns is associated with gestational acetaminophen use or its metabolites are needed. Using data from three consecutive generations of the Isle of Wight cohort (F0-grandmothers, F1-mothers, and F2-offspring) we investigated associations between acetaminophen metabolites in F0 serum at delivery with epigenome-wide DNAm in F1 (Guthrie cards) and between acetaminophen use of F1 and F2-cord-serum levels with F2 cord blood DNAm. In epigenome-wide screening, we eliminated non-informative DNAm sites followed by linear regression of informative sites. Based on repeated pregnancies, indication bias analyses tested whether acetaminophen indicated maternal diseases or has a risk in its own right. Considering that individuals with similar intake process acetaminophen differently, metabolites were clustered to distinguish metabolic exposures. Finally, metabolite clusters from F1-maternal and F2-cord sera were tested for their associations with newborn DNAm (F1 and F2). Twenty-one differential DNAm sites in cord blood were associated with reported maternal acetaminophen intake in the F2 generation. For 11 of these cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites, an indication bias was excluded and five were replicated in F2 with metabolite clusters. In addition, metabolite clusters showed associations with 25 CpGs in the F0-F1 discovery analysis, of which five CpGs were replicated in the F2-generation. Our results suggest that prenatal acetaminophen use, measured as metabolites, may influence DNAm in newborns.Published by Oxford University Press 2022.

We evaluated smoking-associated DNAm signatures in the Costa Rican Study on Longevity and Healthy Aging (CRELES), including participants from the high longevity region of Nicoya.Â We measured genome-wide DNAm in leukocytes, tested Epigenetic Age Acceleration (EAA) from five clocks and estimates of telomere length (DNAmTL), and examined effect modification by the high longevity region.Â 489 participants had a mean (SD) age of 79.4 (10.8) years, and 18% were from Nicoya. Overall, 7.6% reported currently smoking, 35% were former smokers, and 57.4% never smoked. 46 CpGs and five regions (e.g. AHRR, SCARNA6/SNORD39, SNORA20, and F2RL3) were differentially methylated for current smokers. Former smokers had increased Horvath's EAA (1.69-years; 95% CI 0.72, 2.67), Hannum's EAA (0.77-years; 95% CI 0.01, 1.52), GrimAge (2.34-years; 95% CI1.66, 3.02), extrinsic EAA (1.27-years; 95% CI 0.34, 2.21), intrinsic EAA (1.03-years; 95% CI 0.12, 1.94) and shorter DNAmTL (-Â 0.04-kb; 95% CI -Â 0.08, -Â 0.01) relative to non-smokers.

Recently, DNA methylation alterations were found in the blood of ICU patients, partially explaining long-term developmental impairment of critically ill children. As illness-induced aberrant DNA methylation theoretically could also be involved in long-term weakness, we investigated whether the DNA methylation signature in muscle of adult critically ill patients differs from that in muscle of healthy controls.Genome-wide methylation was determined (InfiniumÂ® HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChips) in DNA extracted from skeletal muscle biopsies that had been collected on Day 8Â Â±Â 1 in ICU from 172 EPaNIC-trial patients [66% male sex, median age 62.7Â years, median body mass index (BMI) 25.9Â kg/m2] and 20 matched healthy controls (70% male sex, median age 58.0Â years, median BMI 24.4Â kg/m2). Methylation status of individual cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites of patients and controls was compared with F-tests, using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate to correct for multiple comparisons. Differential methylation of DNA regions was assessed with bump hunting, with 1000 permutations assessing uncertainty, expressed as family-wise error rate. Gene expression was investigated for 10 representative affected genes.In DNA from ICU patients, 565 CpG sites, associated with 400 unique genes, were differentially methylated as compared with controls (average difference 3.2Â Â±Â 0.1% ranging up to 16.9%, PÂ <Â 0.00005). Many of the associated genes appeared highly relevant for muscle structure and function/weakness, including genes involved in myogenesis, muscle regeneration, nerve/muscle membrane excitability, muscle denervation/re-innervation, axon guidance/myelination/degeneration/regeneration, synapse function, ion channelling with especially calcium signalling, metabolism (glucose, protein, and fat), insulin signalling, neuroendocrine hormone regulation, mitochondrial function, autophagy, apoptosis, oxidative stress, Wnt signalling, transcription regulation, muscle fat infiltration during regeneration, and fibrosis. In patients as compared with controls, we also identified two hypomethylated regions, spanning 18 and 3 CpG sites in the promoters of the HIC1 and NADK2 genes, respectively (average differences 5.8Â Â±Â 0.01% and 12.1Â Â±Â 0.04%, family-wise error rate <0.05). HIC1 and NADK2 play important roles in muscle regeneration and postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors and in mitochondrial processes, respectively. Nine of 10 investigated genes containing DNA methylation alterations were differentially expressed in patients as compared with controls (PÂ â‰¤Â 0.03).Critically ill patients present with a different DNA methylation signature in skeletal muscle as compared with healthy controls, which in theory could provide a biological basis for long-term persistence of weakness in ICU survivors.ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00512122, registered on 31 July 2007.Â© 2022 The Authors.

To examine this hypothesis, we performed an epigenome-wide association study of left-handedness. In a meta-analysis of 3914 adults of whole-blood DNA methylation, we observed that CpG sites located in proximity of handedness-associated genetic variants were more strongly associated with left-handedness than other CpG sites (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.04), but did not identify any differentially methylated positions. In longitudinal analyses of DNA methylation in peripheral blood and buccal cells from children (Nâ€‰=â€‰1737), we observed moderately stable associations across age (correlation range [0.355-0.578]), but inconsistent across tissues (correlation range [-â€‰0.384 to 0.318]). We conclude that DNA methylation in peripheral tissues captures little of the variance in handedness. Future investigations should consider other more targeted sources of tissue, such as the brain.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Blood DNA methylation has been shown to be associated with many other environmental exposures, but to our knowledge, no studies to date have examined the association between blood DNA methylation and glyphosate exposure.We conducted an epigenome-wide association study to identify DNA methylation loci associated with urinary glyphosate and its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) levels. Secondary goals were to determine the association of epigenetic age acceleration with glyphosate and AMPA and develop blood DNA methylation indices to predict urinary glyphosate and AMPA levels.For 392 postmenopausal women, white blood cell DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Glyphosate and AMPA were measured in two urine samples per participant using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Methylation differences at the probe and regional level associated with glyphosate and AMPA levels were assessed using a resampling-based approach. Probes and regions that had an false discovery rateq<0.1inâ‰¥90%of 1,000 subsamples of the study population were considered differentially methylated. Differentially methylated sites from the probe-specific analysis were combined into a methylation index. Epigenetic age acceleration from three epigenetic clocks and an epigenetic measure of pace of aging were examined for associations with glyphosate and AMPA.We identified 24 CpG sites whose methylation level was associated with urinary glyphosate concentration and two associated with AMPA. Four regions, within the promoters of theMSH4,KCNA6,ABAT, andNDUFAF2/ERCC8genes, were associated with glyphosate levels, along with an association betweenESR1promoter hypomethylation and AMPA. The methylation index accurately predicted glyphosate levels in an internal validation cohort. AMPA, but not glyphosate, was associated with greater epigenetic age acceleration.Glyphosate and AMPA exposure were associated with DNA methylation differences that could promote the development of cancer and other diseases. Further studies are warranted to replicate our results, determine the functional impact of glyphosate- and AMPA-associated differential DNA methylation, and further explore whether DNA methylation could serve as a biomarker of glyphosate exposure. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10174.",

DNA methylation is influenced by genetic variation but the association between polygenic risk of depression and DNA methylation is unknown.We investigated the association between polygenic risk scores (PRS) for depression and DNAm by conducting a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) in Generation Scotland (N = 8898, mean age = 49.8 years) with replication in the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 and adults in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (Ncombined= 2049, mean age = 79.1, 69.6 and 47.2 years, respectively). We also conducted a replication MWAS in the ALSPAC children (N = 423, mean age = 17.1 years). Gene ontology analysis was conducted for the cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) probes significantly associated with depression PRS, followed by Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis to infer the causal relationship between depression and DNAm.Widespread associations (NCpG= 71, pBonferroni< 0.05, p < 6.3 Ã— 10-8) were found between PRS constructed using genetic risk variants for depression and DNAm in CpG probes that localised to genes involved in immune responses and neural development. The effect sizes for the significant associations were highly correlated between the discovery and replication samples in adults (r = 0.79) and in adolescents (r = 0.82). Gene Ontology analysis showed that significant CpG probes are enriched in immunological processes in the human leukocyte antigen system. Additional MWAS was conducted for each lead genetic risk variant. Over 47.9% of the independent genetic risk variants included in the PRS showed associations with DNAm inÂ CpG probes located in both the same (cis) and distal (trans) locationsÂ to the genetic loci (pBonferroni< 0.045). Subsequent MR analysis showed that there are a greater number of causal effects found from DNAm to depression than vice versa (DNAm to depression: pFDRranged from 0.024 to 7.45 Ã— 10-30; depression to DNAm: pFDRranged from 0.028 to 0.003).PRS for depression, especially those constructed from genome-wide significant genetic risk variants, showed methylome-wide differences associated with immune responses. Findings from MR analysis provided evidence for causal effect of DNAm to depression.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Epidemiological studies have established that grandparental exposures are associated with health outcomes in their grandchildren, often with sex-specific effects; however, the mechanism of transmission is still unclear. We conducted Epigenome Wide Association Studies (EWAS) to test whether grandmaternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with altered DNA methylation (DNAm) in peripheral blood from their adolescent grandchildren. We used data from a birth cohort, with discovery and replication datasets of up to 1225 and 708 individuals (respectively, for the maternal line), aged 15-17 years, and tested replication in the same individuals at birth and 7 years. We show for the first time that DNAm at a small number of loci in cord blood is associated with grandmaternal smoking in humans. In adolescents we see suggestive associations in regions of the genome which we hypothesised a priori could be involved in transgenerational transmission - we observe sex-specific associations at two sites on the X chromosome and one in an imprinting control region. All are within transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), and we observe enrichment for TFBS among the CpG sites with the strongest associations; however, there is limited evidence that the associations we see replicate between timepoints. The implication of this work is that effects of smoking during pregnancy may induce DNAm changes in later generations and that these changes are often sex-specific, in line with epidemiological associations.Â© 2022.

However, dysfunctional processing of endogenous nociceptive input, measured as conditioned pain modulation (CPM), has been associated with cLBP and may involve changes in neuronal gene expression. Epigenetic-induced changes such as DNA methylation (DNAm) have been associated with cLBP.In the present study, the relationship between CPM and DNAm changes in a sample of community-dwelling adults with nonspecific cLBP (nâ€‰=â€‰48) and pain-free controls (PFC; nâ€‰=â€‰50) was examined using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were applied to identify key pathways involved in efficient versus deficient CPM.Based on CPM efficiency, we identified 6006 and 18,305 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) with q valuesâ€‰<â€‰0.01 among individuals with cLBP and PFCs, respectively. Most of the DMCs were hypomethylated and annotated to genes of relevance to pain, including OPRM1, ADRB2, CACNA2D3, GNA12, LPL, NAXD, and ASPHD1. In both cLBP and PFC groups, the DMCs annotated genes enriched many GO terms relevant to pain processing, including transcription regulation by RNA polymerase II, nervous system development, generation of neurons, neuron differentiation, and neurogenesis. Both groups also enriched the pathways involved in Rap1-signaling, cancer, and dopaminergic neurogenesis. However, MAPK-Ras signaling pathways were enriched in the cLBP, not the PFC group.This is the first study to investigate the genome-scale DNA methylation profiles of CPM phenotype in adults with cLBP and PFCs. Based on CPM efficiency, fewer DMC enrichment pathways were unique to the cLBP than the PFCs group. Our results suggest that epigenetically induced modification of neuronal development/differentiation pathways may affect CPM efficiency, suggesting novel potential therapeutic targets for central sensitization. However, CPM efficiency and the experience of nonspecific cLBP may be independent. Further mechanistic studies are required to confirm the relationship between CPM, central sensitization, and nonspecific cLBP.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

The methylation level was determined using HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip and a linear regression analysis model. A multipollutant model including both PM10and NO2and models with single pollutants were used for each trimester exposure. The number of differentially methylated positions was the largest for midpregnancy exposure in both the single pollutant models and the multipollutant regression analysis. Additionally, gene-set analysis regarding midpregnancy exposure revealed four gene ontology terms (cellular response to staurosporine, positive regulation of cytoskeleton organization, neurotransmitter transport, and execution phase of apoptosis).

To date, at least twelve imprinting disorders have been defined with overlapping but variable clinical features including growth and metabolic disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, abdominal wall defects and asymmetry. In general, a single specific DMR is affected in an individual with a given imprinting disorder, but there are a growing number of reports on individuals with so-called multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLID), where aberrant imprinting marks (most commonly loss of methylation) occur at multiple DMRs. However, as the literature is fragmented, we reviewed the molecular and clinical data of 55 previously reported or newly identified MLID families with putative pathogenic variants in maternal effect genes (NLRP2, NLRP5, NLRP7, KHDC3L, OOEP, PADI6) and in other candidate genes (ZFP57, ARID4A, ZAR1, UHRF1, ZNF445).In 55 families, a total of 68 different candidate pathogenic variants were identified (7 in NLRP2, 16 in NLRP5, 7 in NLRP7, 17 in PADI6, 15 in ZFP57, and a single variant in each of the genes ARID4A, ZAR1, OOEP, UHRF1, KHDC3L and ZNF445). Clinical diagnoses of affected offspring included Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome spectrum, Silver-Russell syndrome spectrum, transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, or they were suspected for an imprinting disorder (undiagnosed). Some families had recurrent pregnancy loss.Genomic maternal effect and foetal variants causing MLID allow insights into the mechanisms behind the imprinting cycle of life, and the spatial and temporal function of the different factors involved in oocyte maturation and early development. Further basic research together with identification of new MLID families will enable a better understanding of the link between the different reproductive issues such as recurrent miscarriages and preeclampsia in maternal effect variant carriers/families and aneuploidy and the MLID observed in the offsprings. The current knowledge can already be employed in reproductive and genetic counselling in specific situations.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",
No,20220411,metastable epialleles,35355955,Maternal tobacco smoke exposure is associated with increased DNA methylation at human metastable epialleles in infant cord blood.,Environ Epigenet,"Metastable epialleles (MEs) are genomic regions that are stochastically methylated prior to germ layer specification and exhibit high interindividual but low intra-individual variability across tissues. ME methylation is vulnerable to environmental stressors, including diet. Tobacco smoke (TS) exposure during pregnancy is associated with adverse impacts on fetal health and maternal micronutrient levels as well as altered methylation. Our objective was to determine if maternal smoke exposure impacts methylation at MEs. Consistent with prior studies, we observed reductions in one-carbon pathway micronutrients with gestational TS exposure, including maternal folate (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02) and vitamins B6 (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.05) and B12 (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.007). We examined putative MEsBOLA3, PAX8,andZFYVE28in cord blood specimens from 85 Newborn Epigenetics STudy participants. Gestational TS exposure was associated with elevated DNA methylation atPAX8(+5.22% average methylation; 95% CI: 0.33% to 10.10%;Pâ€‰=â€‰0.037). In human conceptal kidney tissues, higherPAX8transcription was associated with lower methylation (Rsâ€‰=â€‰0.55;Pâ€‰=â€‰0.07), suggesting that the methylation levels established at MEs, and their environmentally induced perturbation, may have meaningful, tissue-specific functional consequences. This may be particularly important becausePAX8is implicated in several cancers, including pediatric kidney cancer. Our data are the first to indicate vulnerability of human ME methylation establishment to TS exposure, with a general trend of increasing levels of methylation at these loci. Further investigation is needed to determine how TS exposure-mediated changes in DNA methylation at MEs, and consequent expression levels, might affect smoking-related disease risk.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

We developed a technology called epigenetic MRI (eMRI) that enables noninvasive imaging of DNA methylation in the brain, a major epigenetic mechanism. eMRI reveals strong regional differences in global DNA methylation in pig brains, a model with stronger resemblance to human brains than are rodents. Given the noninvasive nature of eMRI, our results pave the way for a DNA-methylation imaging paradigm for living human brains. We expect eMRI to enable many studies to unravel the molecular control of brain function and disease.",
No,20220411,methods,35361122,ENNGene: an Easy Neural Network model building tool for Genomics.,BMC Genomics,"The recent big data revolution in Genomics, coupled with the emergence of Deep Learning as a set of powerful machine learning methods, has shifted the standard practices of machine learning for Genomics. Even though Deep Learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are becoming widespread in Genomics, developing and training such models is outside the ability of most researchers in the field.Here we present ENNGene-Easy Neural Network model building tool for Genomics. This tool simplifies training of custom CNN or hybrid CNN-RNN models on genomic data via an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. ENNGene allows multiple input branches, including sequence, evolutionary conservation, and secondary structure, and performs all the necessary preprocessing steps, allowing simple input such as genomic coordinates. The network architecture is selected and fully customized by the user, from the number and types of the layers to each layer's precise set-up. ENNGene then deals with all steps of training and evaluation of the model, exporting valuable metrics such as multi-class ROC and precision-recall curve plots or TensorBoard log files. To facilitate interpretation of the predicted results, we deploy Integrated Gradients, providing the user with a graphical representation of an attribution level of each input position. To showcase the usage of ENNGene, we train multiple models on the RBP24 dataset, quickly reaching the state of the art while improving the performance on more than half of the proteins by including the evolutionary conservation score and tuning the network per protein.As the role of DL in big data analysis in the near future is indisputable, it is important to make it available for a broader range of researchers. We believe that an easy-to-use tool such as ENNGene can allow Genomics researchers without a background in Computational Sciences to harness the power of DL to gain better insights into and extract important information from the large amounts of data available in the field.Â© 2022.

We investigated whether DNA methylation can provide complementary information for such genes. We first carried out an eQTM meta-analysis of 3,574 gene expression and methylation samples from blood, brain and nasal epithelial brushed cells to identify links between methylated CpG sites and genes. This revealed 6,067 significant eQTM genes, and we observed that histone modification information is predictive of both eQTM direction and presence, enabling us to link many CpG sites to genes. We then generated a co-methylation network – MethylationNetwork – using 27,720 publicly available methylation profiles and integrated it with a public RNA-seq co-expression dataset of 31,499 samples. Here, we observed that MethylationNetwork can identify experimentally validated interacting pairs of genes that could not be identified in the RNA-seq datasets. We then developed a novel integration pipeline based on CCA and used the integrated methylation and gene networks to predict gene pairs reported in the STRING database. The integrated network showed significantly improved prediction performance compared to using a DNA co-methylation or a gene co-expression network alone. This is the first study to integrate data from two -omics layers from unmatched public samples across different tissues and diseases, and our results highlight the issues and potential of integrating public datasets from multiple molecular phenotypes. The eQTMs we identified can be used as an annotation resource for epigenome-wide association, and we believe that our integration pipeline can be used as a framework for future -omics integration analyses of public datasets.

We provide supporting materials and results, including the harmonized DNA methylation data from multiple tissues and diseases in https://data.harmjanwestra.nl/comethylation/, the discovered and predicted eQTMs, the corresponding CCA components and the trained prediction models in a Zenodo repository (https://zenodo.org/record/4666994).

Although biological mechanisms underlying hypertension at the single omic level have been discovered, multi-omics integrative analyses using continuous variations in blood pressure values remain limited. We used a multi-omics regression-based method, called sparse multi-block partial least square, for integrative, explanatory, and predictive interests in study of systolic and diastolic blood pressure values. Various datasets were obtained from the Finnish Twin Cohort for up to 444 twins. Blocks of omics-including transcriptomic, methylation, metabolomic-data as well as polygenic risk scores and clinical data were integrated into the modeling and supported by cross-validation. The predictive contribution of each omics block when predicting blood pressure values was investigated using external participants from the Young Finns Study. In addition to revealing interesting inter-omics associations, we found that each block of omics heterogeneously improved the predictions of blood pressure values once the multi-omics data were integrated. The modeling revealed a plurality of clinical, transcriptomic, and metabolomic factors consistent with the literature and that play a leading role in explaining unit variations in blood pressure. These findings demonstrate (1) the robustness of our integrative method to harness results obtained by single omics discriminant analyses, and (2) the added value of predictive and exploratory gains of a multi-omics approach in studies of complex phenotypes such as blood pressure.",

Reliable methods for genome-wide measurement at scale have led to the proliferation of epigenome-wide association studies and subsequently to the development of DNA methylation-based predictors across a wide range of health-related applications, from the identification of risk factors or exposures, such as age and smoking, to early detection of disease or progression in cancer, cardiovascular and neurological disease. This Review evaluates the progress of existing DNA methylation-based predictors, including the contribution of machine learning techniques, and assesses the uptake of key statistical best practices needed to ensure their reliable performance, such as data-driven feature selection, elimination of data leakage in performance estimates and use of generalizable, adequately powered training samples.Â© 2022.

However, the diagnosis of the disorder is dependent on clinical experience and inventory. At present, there are no reliable biomarkers to help with diagnosis and treatment. DNA methylation patterns may be a promising approach for elucidating the etiology of MDD and predicting patient susceptibility. Our overarching aim was to identify biomarkers based on DNA methylation, and then use it to propose a methylation prediction score for MDD, which we hope will help us evaluate the risk of breast cancer.Methylation data from 533 samples were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, of which, 324 individuals were diagnosed with MDD. Statistical difference of DNA Methylation between Promoter and Other body region (SIMPO) score for each gene was calculated based on the DNA methylation data. Based on SIMPO scores, we selected the top genes that showed a correlation with MDD in random resampling, then proposed a methylation-derived Depression Index (mDI) by combining the SIMPO of the selected genes to predict MDD. A validation analysis was then performed using additional DNA methylation data from 194 samples extracted from the GEO database. Furthermore, we applied the mDI to construct a prediction model for the risk of breast cancer using stepwise regression and random forest methods.The optimal mDI was derived from 426 genes, which included 245 positive and 181 negative correlations. It was constructed to predict MDD with high predictive power (AUC of 0.88) in the discovery dataset. In addition, we observed moderate power for mDI in the validation dataset with an OR of 1.79. Biological function assessment of the 426 genes showed that they were functionally enriched in Eph Ephrin signaling and beta-catenin Wnt signaling pathways. The mDI was then used to construct a predictive model for breast cancer that had an AUC ranging from 0.70 to 0.67.Our results indicated that DNA methylation could help to explain the pathogenesis of MDD and assist with its diagnosis.Copyright Â© 2022 Wang, Sun, Pang, Zheng, Liang, He, Tang, Yu, Xiong and Chang.",
No,20220411,reference,35277705,A pan-tissue DNA methylation atlas enables in silico decomposition of human tissue methylomes at cell-type resolution.,Nat Methods,"Bulk-tissue DNA methylomes represent an average over many different cell types, hampering our understanding of cell-type-specific contributions to disease development. As single-cell methylomics is not scalable to large cohorts of individuals, cost-effective computational solutions are needed, yet current methods are limited to tissues such as blood. Here we leverage the high-resolution nature of tissue-specific single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets to construct a DNA methylation atlas defined for 13 solid tissue types and 40 cell types. We comprehensively validate this atlas in independent bulk and single-nucleus DNA methylation datasets. We demonstrate that it correctly predicts the cell of origin of diverse cancer types and discovers new prognostic associations in olfactory neuroblastoma and stage 2 melanoma. In brain, the atlas predicts a neuronal origin for schizophrenia, with neuron-specific differential DNA methylation enriched for corresponding genome-wide association study risk loci. In summary, the DNA methylation atlas enables the decomposition of 13 different human tissue types at a high cellular resolution, paving the way for an improved interpretation of epigenetic data.Â© 2022.

No,20220411,translation,35337378,Ethical implications of epigenetics in the era of personalized medicine.,Clin Epigenetics,"Given the increasing research activity on epigenetics to monitor human diseases and its connection with lifestyle and environmental expositions, the field of epigenetics has attracted a great deal of interest also at the ethical and societal level. In this review, we will identify and discuss current ethical, legal and social issues of epigenetics research in the context of personalized medicine. The review covers ethical aspects such as how epigenetic information should impact patient autonomy and the ability to generate an intentional and voluntary decision, the measures of data protection related to privacy and confidentiality derived from epigenome studies (e.g., risk of discrimination, patient re-identification and unexpected findings) or the debate in the distribution of responsibilities for health (i.e., personal versus public responsibilities). We pay special attention to the risk of social discrimination and stigmatization as a consequence of inferring information related to lifestyle and environmental exposures potentially contained in epigenetic data. Furthermore, as exposures to the environment and individual habits do not affect all populations equally, the violation of the principle of distributive justice in the access to the benefits of clinical epigenetics is discussed. In this regard, epigenetics represents a great opportunity for the integration of public policy measures aimed to create healthier living environments. Whether these public policies will coexist or, in contrast, compete with strategies reinforcing the personalized medicine interventions needs to be considered. The review ends with a reflection on the main challenges in epigenetic research, some of them in a technical dimension (e.g., assessing causality or establishing reference epigenomes) but also in the ethical and social sphere (e.g., risk to add an epigenetic determinism on top of the current genetic one). In sum, integration into life science investigation of social experiences such as exposure to risk, nutritional habits, prejudice and stigma, is imperative to understand epigenetic variation in disease. This pragmatic approach is required to locate clinical epigenetics out of the experimental laboratories and facilitate its implementation into society.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",
No,20220411,twins,35301182,Early life affects late-life health through determining DNA methylation across the lifespan: A twin study.,EBioMedicine,"Previous findings for the genetic and environmental contributions to DNA methylation variation were for limited age ranges only. We investigated the lifespan contributions and their implications for human health for the first time.1,720 monozygotic twin (MZ) pairs and 1,107 dizygotic twin (DZ) pairs aged 0-92 years were included. Familial correlations (i.e., correlations between twins) for 353,681 methylation sites were estimated and modelled as a function of twin pair cohabitation history.The methylome average familial correlation was around zero at birth (MZ pair: -0.01; DZ pair: -0.04), increased with the time of twins living together during childhood at rates of 0.16 (95%CI: 0.12-0.20) for MZ pairs and 0.13 (95%CI: 0.07-0.20) for DZ pairs per decade, and decreased with the time of living apart during adulthood at rates of 0.026 (95%CI: 0.019-0.033) for MZ pairs and 0.027 (95%CI: 0.011-0.043) for DZ pairs per decade. Neither the increasing nor decreasing rate differed by zygosity (both P>0.1), consistent with cohabitation environment shared by twins, rather than genetic factors, influencing the methylation familial correlation changes. Familial correlations for 6.6% (23,386/353,681) sites changed with twin pair cohabitation history. These sites were enriched for high heritability, proximal promoters, and epigenetic/genetic associations with various early-life factors and late-life health conditions.Early life strongly influences DNA methylation variation across the lifespan, and the effects are stronger for heritable sites and sites biologically relevant to the regulation of gene expression.

We hypothesized that the integration of DNAm with clinical risk factors would improve mortality prediction. We performed an epigenome-wide association study of whole blood DNAm in relation to mortality in 15 cohorts (nÂ =Â 15,013). During a mean follow-up of 10Â years, there were 4314 deaths from all causes including 1235 cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths and 868 cancer deaths. Ancestry-stratified meta-analysis of all-cause mortality identified 163 CpGs in European ancestry (EA) and 17 in African ancestry (AA) participants at pÂ <Â 1Â Ã—Â 10-7, of which 41 (EA) and 16 (AA) were also associated with CVD death, and 15 (EA) and 9 (AA) with cancer death. We built DNAm-based prediction models for all-cause mortality that predicted mortality risk after adjusting for clinical risk factors. The mortality prediction model trained by integrating DNAm with clinical risk factors showed an improvement in prediction of cancer death with 5% increase in the C-index in a replication cohort, compared with the model including clinical risk factors alone. Mendelian randomization identified 15 putatively causal CpGs in relation to longevity, CVD, or cancer risk. For example, cg06885782 (in KCNQ4) was positively associated with risk for prostate cancer (BetaÂ =Â 1.2, PMRÂ =Â 4.1Â Ã—Â 10-4) and negatively associated with longevity (BetaÂ =Â -1.9, PMRÂ =Â 0.02). Pathway analysis revealed that genes associated with mortality-related CpGs are enriched for immune- and cancer-related pathways. We identified replicable DNAm signatures of mortality and demonstrated the potential utility of CpGs as informative biomarkers for prediction of mortality risk.Â© 2022 The Authors.

However, because the training data always have a biased age distribution, the model performance becomes weak for the samples with a small age distribution density. To solve this problem, we developed the R package eClock, which uses a bagging-SMOTE method to adjust the biased distribution and predict age with an ensemble model. Moreover, it also provides a bootstrapped model based on bagging only and a traditional clock model. The performance on three datasets showed that the bagging-SMOTE model significantly improved rare sample age prediction. In addition to model construction, the package also provides other functions such as data visualization and methylation feature conversion to facilitate the research in relevant areas.",

We investigated the DNA methylation patterns of three common human inversions, at 8p23.1, 16p11.2, and 17q21.31 in 1,009 blood samples from children from the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project and in 39 prenatal heart tissue samples. We found inversion-state specific methylation patterns within and nearby flanking each inversion region in both datasets. Additionally, numerous inversion-exposure interactions on methylation levels were identified from early-life exposome data comprising 64 exposures. For instance, children homozygous at inv-8p23.1 and higher meat intake were more susceptible to TDH hypermethylation (Pâ€‰=â€‰3.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10-22); being the inversion, exposure, and gene known risk factors for adult obesity. Inv-8p23.1 associated hypermethylation of GATA4 was also detected across numerous exposures. Our data suggests that the pleiotropic influence of inversions during development and lifetime could be substantially mediated by allele-specific methylation patterns which can be modulated by the exposome.Â© 2022.

Importantly, these studies identified epigenetic modifications, including altered DNA methylation, in pancreatic islets, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and the liver from individuals with T2DM. As non-genetic factors that affect the risk of T2DM, such as obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, ageing and the intrauterine environment, have been associated with epigenetic modifications in healthy individuals, epigenetics probably also contributes to T2DM development. In addition, genetic factors associated with T2DM and obesity affect the epigenome in human tissues. Notably, causal mediation analyses found DNA methylation to be a potential mediator of genetic associations with metabolic traits and disease. In the past few years, translational studies have identified blood-based epigenetic markers that might be further developed and used for precision medicine to help patients with T2DM receive optimal therapy and to identify patients at risk of complications. This Review focuses on epigenetic mechanisms in the development of T2DM and the regulation of body weight in humans, with a special focus on precision medicine.Â© 2022. Springer Nature Limited.",

Experiment-derived enhancer-gene links are restricted to a small set of enhancers and/or cell types, while the accuracy of genome-wide approaches remains elusive due to the lack of a systematic evaluation. We combined multiple spatial and in silico approaches for defining enhancer locations and linking them to their target genes aggregated across >500 cell types, generating 1860 human genome-wide distal enhancer-to-target gene definitions (EnTDefs). To evaluate performance, we used gene set enrichment (GSE) testing on 87 independent ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets of 34 transcription factors (TFs) and assessed concordance of results with known TF Gene Ontology annotations, and other benchmarks.The top ranked 741 (40%) EnTDefs significantly outperform the common, naÃ¯ve approach of linking distal regions to the nearest genes, and the top 10 EnTDefs perform well when applied to ChIP-seq data of other cell types. The GSE-based ranking of EnTDefs is highly concordant with ranking based on overlap with curated benchmarks of enhancer-gene interactions. Both our top general EnTDef and cell-type-specific EnTDefs significantly outperform seven independent computational and experiment-based enhancer-gene pair datasets. We show that using our top EnTDefs for GSE with either genome-wide DNA methylation or ATAC-seq data is able to better recapitulate the biological processes changed in gene expression data performed in parallel for the same experiment than our lower-ranked EnTDefs.Our findings illustrate the power of our approach to provide genome-wide interpretation regardless of cell type.Â© 2022.

The placenta is uniquely situated to assess prenatal exposures in the context of DOHaD because it is an essential ephemeral fetal organ that manages the transport of oxygen, nutrients, waste, and endocrine signals between the mother and fetus. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that evaluated the DOHaD hypothesis in human placentas using epigenomics, including DNA methylation and transcriptomic studies of mRNA, lncRNA, and microRNAs.Between 2016 and 2021, 28 articles evaluated associations between prenatal exposures and placental epigenomics across broad exposure categories including maternal smoking, psychosocial stressors, chemicals, air pollution, and metals. Sixteen of these studies connected exposures to health outcome such as birth weight, fetal growth, or infant neurobehavior through mediation analysis, identification of shared associations between exposure and outcome, or network analysis. These aspects of infant and childhood health serve as a foundation for future studies that aim to use placental epigenetics to understand relationships between the prenatal environment and perinatal complications (such as preterm birth or fetal growth restriction) or later life childhood health. Placental DNA methylation and RNA expression have been linked to numerous prenatal exposures, such as PM2.5 air pollution, metals, and maternal smoking, as well as infant and childhood health outcomes, including fetal growth and birth weight. Placental epigenomics provides a unique opportunity to expand the DOHaD premise, particularly if research applies novel methodologies such as multi-omics analysis, sequencing of non-coding RNAs, mixtures analysis, and assessment of health outcomes beyond early childhood.Â© 2022.

When the phenotype is protein abundance, a reasonable hypothesis is that the gene encoding that protein is the causal gene. However, as variants impacting protein levels can occur thousands or even millions of base pairs from the gene encoding the protein, it is unclear at what distance this simple hypothesis breaks down.By making the simple assumption that cis-pQTLs should be distance dependent while trans-pQTLs are distance independent, we arrive at a simple and empirical distance cutoff separating cis- and trans-pQTLs. Analyzing a recent large-scale pQTL study (Pietzner in Science 374:eabj1541, 2021) we arrive at an estimated distance cutoff of 944 kilobasepairs (95% confidence interval: 767-1,161) separating the cis and trans regimes.We demonstrate that this simple model can be applied to other molecular GWAS traits. Since much of biology is built on molecular traits like protein, transcript and metabolite abundance, we posit that the mathematical models for cis and trans distance distributions derived here will also apply to more complex phenotypes and traits.Â© 2022.

This study investigated DNA methylation in cord blood to identify possible ""at birth"" signatures that may indicate susceptibility to behavioral problems at 18 months of age. Cord blood was collected from 256 children of mothers who had self-reported on symptoms of depression during pregnancy and the behavior of their child at 18 months of age. Whole genome DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina MethylationEPIC assay. The mother and child pairs were categorized into four groups, based on both self-reported depressive symptoms, PND or Healthy control (HC), and scores from the Child Behavior checklist (high or low for internalizing, externalizing, and total scores). Adjustments were made for batch effects, cell-type, and clinical covariates. Differentially methylated sites were identified using Kruskal-Wallis test, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p values <â€‰0.05 were considered significant. The analysis was also stratified by sex of the child. Among boys, we observed higher and correlated DNA methylation of one CpG-site in the promoter region of TPP1 in the HC group, with high externalizing scores compared to HC with low externalizing scores. Boys in the PND group showed lower DNA methylation in NUDT15 among those with high, compared to low, internalizing scores; the DNA methylation levels of CpGs in this gene were positively correlated with the CBCL scores. Hence, the differentially methylated CpG sites could be of interest for resilience, regardless of maternal mental health during pregnancy. The findings are in a relatively healthy study cohort, thus limiting the possibility of detecting strong effects associated with behavioral difficulties.

DNA methylation has been suggested as a potential underlying mechanism linking environmental exposures such as micronutrient status during pregnancy with offspring health. We performed a meta-analysis on the association of maternal early-pregnancy serum ferritin concentrations, as a marker of body iron stores, and cord blood DNA methylation. We included 1286 mother-newborn pairs from two population-based prospective cohorts. Serum ferritin concentrations were measured in early pregnancy. DNA methylation was measured with the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina). We examined epigenome-wide associations of maternal early-pregnancy serum ferritin and cord blood DNA methylation using robust linear regression analyses, with adjustment for confounders and performed fixed-effects meta-analyses. We additionally examined whether associations of any CpGs identified in cord blood persisted in the peripheral blood of older children and explored associations with other markers of maternal iron status. We also examined whether similar findings were present in the association of cord blood serum ferritin concentrations with cord blood DNA methylation.Maternal early-pregnancy serum ferritin concentrations were inversely associated with DNA methylation at two CpGs (cg02806645 and cg06322988) in PRR23A and one CpG (cg04468817) in PRSS22. Associations at two of these CpG sites persisted at each of the follow-up time points in childhood. Cord blood serum ferritin concentrations were not associated with cord blood DNA methylation levels at the three identified CpGs.Maternal early-pregnancy serum ferritin concentrations were associated with lower cord blood DNA methylation levels at three CpGs and these associations partly persisted in older children. Further studies are needed to uncover the role of these CpGs in the underlying mechanisms of the associations of maternal iron status and offspring health outcomes.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

We find 1,511 independent differentially methylated loci associated with CRP. These CpG sites show correlation structures across chromosomes, and are primarily situated in euchromatin, depleted in CpG islands. These genomic loci are predominantly situated in transcription factor binding sites and genomic enhancer regions. Mendelian randomization analysis suggests altered CpG methylation is a consequence of increased blood CRP levels. Mediation analysis reveals obesity and smoking as important underlying driving factors for changed CpG methylation. Finally, we find that an activated CpG signature significantly increases the risk for cardiometabolic diseases and COPD.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Studies have suggested that CT may affect brain plasticity through epigenetic mechanisms and contribute to developing various psychiatric disorders. We performed a blood-based epigenome-wide association study using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-short form in 602 patients with a current severe mental illness, investigating DNA methylation association separately for five trauma subtypes and the total trauma score. The median trauma score was set as the predefined cutoff for determining whether the trauma was present or not. Additionally, we compared our genome-wide results with methylation probes annotated to candidate genes previously associated with CT. Of the patients, 83.2% reported CT above the cutoff in one or more trauma subtypes, and emotional neglect was the trauma subtype most frequently reported. We identified one significant differently methylated position associated with the gene TANGO6 for physical neglect. Seventeen differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were associated with different trauma categories. Several of these DMRs were annotated to genes previously associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive impairments. Our results support a biomolecular association between CT and severe mental disorders. Genes that were previously identified as differentially methylated in CT-exposed subjects with and without psychosis did not show methylation differences in our analysis. We discuss this inconsistency, the relevance of our findings, and the limitations of our study.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

We used geocoded participant address-specific mean ambient carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO2; NOx), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations estimated over the 2-, 7-, 28-, and 365-day periods before collection of blood samples used to generate Illumina 450Â k array leukocyte DNAm measurements. We estimated methylome-wide, subpopulation- and race/ethnicity-stratified pollutant-DNAm associations in multi-level, linear mixed-effects models adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, meteorological, and technical covariates. We combined stratum-specific estimates in inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses and characterized significant associations (false discovery rate; FDR<0.05) at Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites without among-strata heterogeneity (PCochran's QÂ >Â 0.05).

The lifetime prevalence of PD is about 2-3% in the general population leading to tremendous distress and disability. Etiologically, genetic and environmental factors, such as stress, contribute to the onset and relapse of PD. In the present study, we investigated epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) in respond to a cumulative, stress-weighted life events score (wLE) in patients with PD and its boundary to major depressive disorder (MDD), frequently co-occurring with symptoms of PD.DNAm was assessed by the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. In a meta-analytic approach, epigenome-wide DNAm changes in association with wLE were first analyzed in two PD cohorts (with a total sample size of 183 PD patients and 85 healthy controls) and lastly in 102 patients with MDD to identify possible overlapping and opposing effects of wLE on DNAm. Additionally, analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was conducted to identify regional clusters of association.Two CpG-sites presented with p-values below 1â€‰Ã—â€‰10-05in PD: cg09738429 (pâ€‰=â€‰6.40â€‰Ã—â€‰10-06, located in an intergenic shore region in next proximity of PYROXD1) and cg03341655 (pâ€‰=â€‰8.14â€‰Ã—â€‰10-06, located in the exonic region of GFOD2). The association of DNAm at cg03341655 and wLE could be replicated in the independent MDD case sample indicating a diagnosis independent effect. Genes mapping to the top hits were significantly upregulated in brain and top hits have been implicated in the metabolic system. Additionally, two significant DMRs were identified for PD only on chromosome 10 and 18, including CpG-sites which have been reported to be associated with anxiety and other psychiatric phenotypes.This first DNAm analysis in PD reveals first evidence of small but significant DNAm changes in PD in association with cumulative stress-weighted life events. Most of the top associated CpG-sites are located in genes implicated in metabolic processes supporting the hypothesis that environmental stress contributes to health damaging changes by affecting a broad spectrum of systems in the body.Â© 2022.

(2) Methods: We investigated the similarity of DNAm signatures in matched blood and postmortem brain samples (n= 10). In addition, we performed EWASs in five brain regions belonging to the neurocircuitry of addiction: anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), Brodmann Area 9, caudate nucleus, putamen, and ventral striatum (n= 38-72).

Gene-environment interactions can change the methylation status in the brain, and accumulation of these epigenetic changes over a lifespan may be co-responsible for a neurodegenerative disease like Parkinson's disease, which that is characterised by a late onset in life.To determine epigenetic modifications in the brains of Parkinson's disease patients.DNA methylation patterns were compared in the cortex tissue of 14 male PD patients and 10 male healthy individuals using the Illumina Methylation 450 K chip. Subsequently, DNA methylation of candidate genes was evaluated using bisulphite pyrosequencing, and DNA methylation of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) was characterized in DNA from blood mononuclear cells (259 PD patients and 182 healthy controls) and skin fibroblasts (10 PD patients and 5 healthy controls). Protein levels ofCYP2E1were analysed using Western blot in human cortex andknock-outmice brain samples.We found 35 hypomethylated and 22 hypermethylated genes with a methylation M-value difference &gt;0.5. Decreased methylation of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) was associated with increased protein levels in PD brains, but in peripheral tissues, i.e., in blood cells and skin fibroblasts, DNA methylation ofCYP2E1was unchanged. InCYP2E1 knock-outmice brain alpha-synuclein (SNCA) protein levels were down-regulated compared to wild-type mice, whereas treatment with trichloroethylene (TCE) up-regulatedCYP2E1protein in a dose-dependent manner in cultured cells. We further identified an interconnected group of genes associated with oxidative stress, such as Methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA) and tumour protein 73 (TP73) in the brain, which again were not paralleled in other tissues and appeared to indicate brain-specific changes.Our study revealed surprisingly few dysmethylated genes in a brain region less affected in PD.

Using samples from our randomized controlled trial of folic acid supplementation in second and third trimester (FASSTT), where significant improvements in cognitive and psychosocial performance were demonstrated in children from mothers supplemented in pregnancy with 400Â Âµg/day FA compared with placebo, we examined methylation patterns from cord blood (CB) using the EPIC array which covers approximately 850,000 cytosine-guanine (CG) sites across the genome. Genes showing significant differences were verified using pyrosequencing and mechanistic approaches used in vitro to determine effects on transcription.FA supplementation resulted in significant differences in methylation, particularly at brain-related genes. Further analysis showed these genes split into two groups. In one group, which included the CES1 gene, methylation changes at the promoters were important for regulating transcription. We also identified a second group which had a characteristic bimodal profile, with low promoter and high gene body (GB) methylation. In the latter, loss of methylation in the GB is linked to decreases in transcription: this group included the PRKAR1B/HEATR2 genes and the dopamine receptor regulator PDE4C. Overall, methylation in CB also showed good correlation with methylation profiles seen in a published data set of late gestation foetal brain samples.We show here clear alterations in DNA methylation at specific classes of neurodevelopmental genes in the same cohort of children, born to FA-supplemented mothers, who previously showed improved cognitive and psychosocial performance. Our results show measurable differences at neural genes which are important for transcriptional regulation and add to the supporting evidence for continued FA supplementation throughout later gestation.

Identifying the earliest molecular events that precede observable developmental outcomes could help identify children in need of support prior to the onset of physical and mental health difficulties. In this study, we examined whether mothers' attachment insecurity, maltreatment history, and depressive symptoms were associated with alterations in DNA methylation patterns in their infants, and whether these correlates in the infant epigenome were associated with socioemotional and behavioral functioning in toddlerhood. We recruited 156 women oversampled for histories of depression, who completed psychiatric interviews and depression screening during pregnancy, then provided follow-up behavioral data on their children at 18 months. Buccal cell DNA was obtained from 32 of their infants for a large-scale analysis of methylation patterns across 5â€‰Ã—â€‰106individual CpG dinucleotides, using clustering-based significance criteria to control for multiple comparisons. We found that tens of thousands of individual infant CpGs were alternatively methylated in association with maternal attachment insecurity, maltreatment in childhood, and antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms, including genes implicated in developmental patterning, cell-cell communication, hormonal regulation, immune function/inflammatory response, and neurotransmission. Density of DNA methylation at selected genes from the result set was also significantly associated with toddler socioemotional and behavioral problems. This is the first report to identify novel regions of the human infant genome at which DNA methylation patterns are associated longitudinally both with maternal characteristics and with offspring socioemotional and behavioral problems in toddlerhood.Â© 2022.

Our EWAS on local ancestry (LA) identified the largest number of ancestry-associated DNA methylation sites and also featured the highest replication rate. Furthermore, by incorporating ancestry origins of genetic variations, we identified 36 methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) clumps for LA-associated CpGs that cannot be captured by a model that assumes identical genetic effects across ancestry origins. Lead SNPs at 152 meQTL clumps had significantly different genetic effects in the context of an African or European ancestry background. Local ancestry information enables superior capture of ancestry-associated methylation signatures and identification of ancestry-specific genetic effects on DNA methylation. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating local ancestry for EWAS in admixed samples from multi-ancestry cohorts.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

However, these profile less than 3% of DNA methylation sites in the human genome, potentially missing affected loci and preventing the discovery of disrupted biological pathways. Third generation sequencing technologies, including Nanopore sequencing, have the potential to revolutionise the generation of epigenetic data, not only by providing genuine genome-wide coverage but profiling epigenetic modifications direct from native DNA. Here we assess the viability of using Nanopore sequencing for epidemiology by performing a comparison with DNA methylation quantified using the most comprehensive microarray available, the Illumina EPIC array. We implemented a CRISPR-Cas9 targeted sequencing approach in concert with Nanopore sequencing to profile DNA methylation in three genomic regions to attempt to rediscover genomic positions that existing technologies have shown are differentially methylated in tobacco smokers. Using Nanopore sequencing reads, DNA methylation was quantified at 1779 CpGs across three regions, providing a finer resolution of DNA methylation patterns compared to the EPIC array. The correlation of estimated levels of DNA methylation between platforms was high. Furthermore, we identified 12 CpGs where hypomethylation was significantly associated with smoking status, including 10 within the AHRR gene. In summary, Nanopore sequencing is a valid option for identifying genomic loci where large differences in DNAm are associated with a phenotype and has the potential to advance our understanding of the role differential methylation plays in the aetiology of complex disease.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

A major goal in DNA methylation analysis is the detection of differentially methylated genomic regions under two different conditions. To accomplish this, many state-of-the-art methods have been proposed in the past few years; only a handful of these methods are capable of analyzing both types of data (BS-seq and microarray), though. On the other hand, covariates, such as sex and age, are known to be potentially influential on DNA methylation; and thus, it would be important to adjust for their effects on differential methylation analysis. In this chapter, we describe a Bayesian curve credible bands approach and the accompanying software, BCurve, for detecting differentially methylated regions for data generated from either microarray or BS-Seq. The unified theme underlying the analysis of these two different types of data is the model that accounts for correlation between DNA methylation in nearby sites, covariates, and between-sample variability. The BCurve R software package also provides tools for simulating both microarray and BS-seq data, which can be useful for facilitating comparisons of methods given the known ""gold standard"" in the simulated data. We provide detailed description of the main functions in BCurve and demonstrate the utility of the package for analyzing data from both platforms using simulated data from the functions provided in the package. Analyses of two real datasets, one from BS-seq and one from microarray, are also furnished to further illustrate the capability of BCurve.Â© 2022.

No,20220523,methods,35505205,Accurate Measurement of DNA Methylation: Challenges and Bias Correction.,Methods Mol Biol,"DNA methylation is a key epigenetic modification involved in gene regulation whose contribution to disease susceptibility is still not fully understood. As the cost of genome sequencing technologies continues to drop, it will soon become commonplace to perform genome-wide quantification of DNA methylation at a single base-pair resolution. However, the demand for its accurate quantification might vary across studies. When the scope of the analysis is to detect regions of the genome with different methylation patterns between two or more conditions, e.g., case vs control; treatments vs placebo, accuracy is not crucial. This is the case in epigenome-wide association studies used as genome-wide screening of methylation changes to detect new candidate genes and regions associated with a specific disease or condition. If the aim of the analysis is to use DNA methylation measurements as a biomarker for diseases diagnosis and treatment (Laird, Nat Rev Cancer 3:253-266, 2003; Bock, Epigenomics 1:99-110, 2009), it is instead recommended to produce accurate methylation measurements. Furthermore, if the objective is the detection of DNA methylation in subclonal tumor cell populations or in circulating tumor DNA or in any case of mosaicism, the importance of accuracy becomes critical. The aim of this chapter is to describe the factors that could affect the precise measurement of methylation levels and a recent Bayesian statistical method called MethylCal and its extension that have been proposed to minimize this problem.Â© 2022.

The Illumina Infinium Methylation BeadChip is a popular technology choice for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but presently, little is known about the nature of batch-effects on these designs. Given the subtlety of biological phenotypes in many EWAS, control for batch-effects should be a consideration.Using the batch-effect removal approaches in the ComBat and Harman software, we examined two in-house datasets and compared results with three large publicly available datasets, (1214 HumanMethylation450 and 1094 MethylationEPIC BeadChips in total), and find that despite various forms of preprocessing, some batch-effects persist. This residual batch-effect is associated with the day of processing, the individual glass slide and the position of the array on the slide. Consistently across all datasets, 4649 probes required high amounts of correction. To understand the impact of this set to EWAS studies, we explored the literature and found three instances where persistently batch-effect prone probes have been reported in abstracts as key sites of differential methylation. As well as batch-effect susceptible probes, we also discover a set of probes which are erroneously corrected. We provide batch-effect workflows for Infinium Methylation data and provide reference matrices of batch-effect prone and erroneously corrected features across the five datasets spanning regionally diverse populations and three commonly collected biosamples (blood, buccal and saliva).Batch-effects are ever present, even in high-quality data, and a strategy to deal with them should be part of experimental design, particularly for EWAS. Batch-effect removal tools are useful to reduce technical variance in Infinium Methylation data, but they need to be applied with care and make use of post hoc diagnostic measures.Â© 2022.

No,20220523,methods,35450213,High-Dimensional DNA Methylation Mediates the Effect of Smoking on Crohn's Disease.,Front Genet,"Epigenome-wide mediation analysis aims to identify high-dimensional DNA methylation at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites that mediate the causal effect of linking smoking with Crohn's disease (CD) outcome. Studies have shown that smoking has significant detrimental effects on the course of CD. So we assessed whether DNA methylation mediates the association between smoking and CD. Among 103 CD cases and 174 controls, we estimated whether the effects of smoking on CD are mediated through DNA methylation CpG sites, which we referred to as causal mediation effect. Based on the causal diagram, we first implemented sure independence screening (SIS) to reduce the pool of potential mediator CpGs from a very large to a moderate number; then, we implemented variable selection with de-sparsifying the LASSO regression. Finally, we carried out a comprehensive mediation analysis and conducted sensitivity analysis, which was adjusted for potential confounders of age, sex, and blood cell type proportions to estimate the mediation effects. Smoking was significantly associated with CD under odds ratio (OR) of 2.319 (95% CI: 1.603, 3.485,pÂ <Â 0.001) after adjustment for confounders. Ninety-nine mediator CpGs were selected from SIS, and then, seven candidate CpGs were obtained by de-sparsifying the LASSO regression. Four of these CpGs showed statistical significance, and the average causal mediation effects (ACME) were attenuated from 0.066 to 0.126. Notably, three significant mediator CpGs had absolute sensitivity parameters of 0.40, indicating that these mediation effects were robust even when the assumptions were slightly violated. Genes (BCL3 and FKBP5) harboring these four CpGs were related to CD. These findings suggest that changes in methylation are involved in the mechanism by which smoking increases risk of CD.Copyright Â© 2022 Wang, Xia and Su.",
No,20220523,methods,35440009,Epigenome-wide contributions to individual differences in childhood phenotypes: a GREML approach.,Clin Epigenetics,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism involved in human development. Numerous epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have investigated the associations of DNA methylation at single CpG sites with childhood outcomes. However, the overall contribution of DNA methylation across the genome (R2Methylation) towards childhood phenotypes is unknown. An estimate of R2Methylationwould provide context regarding the importance of DNA methylation explaining variance in health outcomes. We therefore estimated the variance explained by epigenome-wide cord blood methylation (R2Methylation) for five childhood phenotypes: gestational age, birth weight, and body mass index (BMI), IQ and ADHD symptoms at school age. We adapted a genome-based restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) approach with cross-validation (CV) to DNA methylation data and applied it in two population-based birth cohorts: ALSPAC (nâ€‰=â€‰775) and Generation R (nâ€‰=â€‰1382).Using information fromâ€‰>â€‰470,000 autosomal probes we estimated that DNA methylation at birth explains 32% (SDCVâ€‰=â€‰0.06) of gestational age variance and 5% (SDCVâ€‰=â€‰0.02) of birth weight variance. The R2Methylationestimates for BMI, IQ and ADHD symptoms at school age estimates were near 0% across almost all cross-validation iterations.The results suggest that cord blood methylation explains a moderate degree of variance in gestational age and birth weight, in line with the success of previous EWAS in identifying numerous CpG sites associated with these phenotypes. In contrast, we could not obtain a reliable estimate for school-age BMI, IQ and ADHD symptoms. This may reflect a null bias due to insufficient sample size to detect variance explained in more weakly associated phenotypes, although the true R2Methylationfor these phenotypes is likely below that of gestational age and birth weight when using DNA methylation at birth.Â© 2022.

A major obstacle in integrating omics data from multiple modalities is that different omics layers typically have distinct feature spaces. Here, we propose a computational framework called GLUE (graph-linked unified embedding), which bridges the gap by modeling regulatory interactions across omics layers explicitly. Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that GLUE is more accurate, robust and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data. We applied GLUE to various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, integrative regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction over millions of cells, where GLUE was able to correct previous annotations. GLUE features a modular design that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for new analysis tasks. The full package is available online at https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE .Â© 2022. The Author(s).",
No,20220523,prediction,35523767,Multi-omics signatures of alcohol use disorder in the dorsal and ventral striatum.,Transl Psychiatry,"Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a major contributor to global mortality and morbidity. Postmortem human brain tissue enables the investigation of molecular mechanisms of AUD in the neurocircuitry of addiction. We aimed to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes in the ventral and dorsal striatum between individuals with AUD and controls, and to integrate the results with findings from genome- and epigenome-wide association studies (GWAS/EWAS) to identify functionally relevant molecular mechanisms of AUD. DNA-methylation and gene expression (RNA-seq) data was generated from postmortem brain samples of 48 individuals with AUD and 51 controls from the ventral striatum (VS) and the dorsal striatal regions caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (PUT). We identified DE genes using DESeq2, performed gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and tested enrichment of DE genes in results of GWASs using MAGMA. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed for DNA-methylation and gene expression data and gene overlap was tested. Differential gene expression was observed in the dorsal (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05), but not the ventral striatum of AUD cases. In the VS, DE genes at FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.25 were overrepresented in a recent GWAS of problematic alcohol use. The ARHGEF15 gene was upregulated in all three brain regions. GSEA in CN and VS pointed towards cell-structure associated GO-terms and in PUT towards immune pathways. The WGCNA modules most strongly associated with AUD showed strong enrichment for immune response and inflammation pathways. Our integrated analysis of multi-omics data sets provides further evidence for the importance of immune- and inflammation-related processes in AUD.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",
No,20220523,prediction,35490552,Complex trait methylation scores in the prediction of major depressive disorder.,EBioMedicine,"DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with time-varying environmental factors that contribute to major depressive disorder (MDD) risk. We sought to test whether DNAm signatures of lifestyle and biochemical factors were associated with MDD to reveal dynamic biomarkers of MDD risk that may be amenable to lifestyle interventions.Here, we calculated methylation scores (MS) at multiple p-value thresholds for lifestyle (BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, and educational attainment) and biochemical (high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and total cholesterol) factors in Generation Scotland (GS) (N=9,502) and in a replication cohort (ALSPACadults, N=565), using CpG sites reported in previous well-powered methylome-wide association studies. We also compared their predictive accuracy for MDD to a MDD MS in an independent GS sub-sample (N=4,432).Each trait MS was significantly associated with its corresponding phenotype in GS (Î²range=0.089-1.457) and in ALSPAC (Î²range=0.078-2.533). Each MS was also significantly associated with MDD before and after adjustment for its corresponding phenotype in GS (Î²range=0.053-0.145). After accounting for relevant lifestyle factors, MS for educational attainment (Î²=0.094) and alcohol consumption (MSp-value<0.01-0.5; Î²range=-0.069-0.083) remained significantly associated with MDD in GS. Smoking (AUC=0.569) and educational attainment (AUC=0.585) MSs could discriminate MDD from controls better than the MDD MS (AUC=0.553) in the independent GS sub-sample. Analyses implicating MDD did not replicate across ALSPAC, although the direction of effect was consistent for all traits when adjusting for the MS corresponding phenotypes.We showed that lifestyle and biochemical MS were associated with MDD before and after adjustment for their corresponding phenotypes (pnominal<0.05), but not when smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI were also included as covariates. MDD results did not replicate in the smaller, female-only independent ALSPAC cohort (NALSPAC=565; NGS=9,502), potentially due to demographic differences or low statistical power, but effect sizes were consistent with the direction reported in GS. DNAm scores for modifiable MDD risk factors may contribute to disease vulnerability and, in some cases, explain additional variance to their observed phenotypes.Wellcome Trust.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors.

No,20220523,prediction,35473556,Accurate and highly interpretable prediction of gene expression from histone modifications.,BMC Bioinformatics,"Histone Mark Modifications (HMs) are crucial actors in gene regulation, as they actively remodel chromatin to modulate transcriptional activity: aberrant combinatorial patterns of HMs have been connected with several diseases, including cancer. HMs are, however, reversible modifications: understanding their role in disease would allow the design of 'epigenetic drugs' for specific, non-invasive treatments. Standard statistical techniques were not entirely successful in extracting representative features from raw HM signals over gene locations. On the other hand, deep learning approaches allow for effective automatic feature extraction, but at the expense of model interpretation.Here, we propose ShallowChrome, a novel computational pipeline to model transcriptional regulation via HMs in both an accurate and interpretable way. We attain state-of-the-art results on the binary classification of gene transcriptional states over 56 cell-types from the REMC database, largely outperforming recent deep learning approaches. We interpret our models by extracting insightful gene-specific regulative patterns, and we analyse them for the specific case of the PAX5 gene over three differentiated blood cell lines. Finally, we compare the patterns we obtained with the characteristic emission patterns of ChromHMM, and show that ShallowChrome is able to coherently rank groups of chromatin states w.r.t. their transcriptional activity.In this work we demonstrate that it is possible to model HM-modulated gene expression regulation in a highly accurate, yet interpretable way. Our feature extraction algorithm leverages on data downstream the identification of enriched regions to retrieve gene-wise, statistically significant and dynamically located features for each HM. These features are highly predictive of gene transcriptional state, and allow for accurate modeling by computationally efficient logistic regression models. These models allow a direct inspection and a rigorous interpretation, helping to formulate quantifiable hypotheses.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

We also evaluated the associations of the 71 CVD proteins with the following dichotomous secondary outcomes: prevalent CKD stage â‰¥3 (cross-sectional), new-onset CKD stage â‰¥3 (longitudinal), and rapid decline in eGFR (longitudinal). Proteins significantly associated with eGFR and Î”eGFR were subsequently validated in 3,951 FHS Third Generation cohort participants and were tested using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to infer putatively causal relations between plasma protein biomarkers and kidney function.In cross-sectional analysis, 37 protein biomarkers were significantly associated with eGFR at FDR<0.05 in the FHS Offspring cohort and 20 of these validated in the FHS Third Generation cohort at p<0.05/37. In longitudinal analysis, 27 protein biomarkers were significantly associated with Î”eGFR at FDR<0.05 and 12 of these were validated in the FHS Third Generation cohort at p<0.05/27. Additionally, 35 protein biomarkers were significantly associated with prevalent CKD, five were significantly associated with new-onset CKD, and 17 were significantly associated with rapid decline in eGFR. MR suggested putatively causal relations of melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM; -0.011Â±0.003 mL/min/1.73m2, p = 5.11E-5) and epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1; -0.006Â±0.002 mL/min/1.73m2, p = 0.0001) concentration with eGFR.Eight protein biomarkers were consistently associated with eGFR in cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis in both cohorts and may capture early kidney impairment; others were implicated in association and causal inference analyses. A subset of CVD protein biomarkers may contribute causally to the pathogenesis of kidney impairment and should be studied as targets for CKD treatment and early prevention.",

During normal ageing, neurons progressively accumulate somatic mutations5at rates similar to those of dividing cells6,7which suggests that genetic factors, environmental exposures or disease states might influence this accumulation5. Here we analysed single-cell whole-genome sequencing data from 319 neurons from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and neurotypical control individuals. We found that somatic DNA alterations increase in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, with distinct molecular patterns. Normal neurons accumulate mutations primarily in an age-related pattern (signature A), which closely resembles 'clock-like' mutational signatures that have been previously described in healthy and cancerous cells6-10. In neurons affected by Alzheimer's disease, additional DNA alterations are driven by distinct processes (signature C) that highlight C>A and other specific nucleotide changes. These changes potentially implicate nucleotide oxidation4,11, which we show is increased in Alzheimer's-disease-affected neurons in situ. Expressed genes exhibit signature-specific damage, and mutations show a transcriptional strand bias, which suggests that transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair has a role in the generation of mutations. The alterations in Alzheimer's disease affect coding exons and are predicted to create dysfunctional genetic knockout cells and proteostatic stress. Our results suggest that known pathogenic mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease may lead to genomic damage to neurons that can progressively impair function. The aberrant accumulation of DNA alterations in neurodegeneration provides insight into the cascade of molecular and cellular events that occurs in the development of Alzheimer's disease.Â© 2022.

No,20220620,dnam age,35681159,Cardiovascular health and four epigenetic clocks.,Clin Epigenetics,"Cardiovascular health (CVH) was defined by the American Heart Association as an integrative idealness of seven clinical or lifestyle factors. Based on populations of European ancestry, recent studies have shown that ideal CVH is associated with a slower aging rate. The aging rate is measured by levels of epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), usually obtained from the residuals of regressing DNA methylation (DNAm) age on chronological age. However, little has been known about the association of CVH with biological aging in Asian populations.We here analyzed blood DNAm data and clinical/lifestyle factors of 2474 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants, to investigate the association of CVH with EAA. CVH was assessed by seven components: smoking status, physical activity, dietary habits, body mass index, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, and blood pressure levels. Four measures of EAA were applied, among which two were based on the first-generation DNAm clocks (HannumEAA and IEAA) and two were based on the second-generation clocks (PhenoEAA and GrimEAA). After excluding 276 individuals with cardiovascular diseases, we regressed EAA on the CVH score (ranging from 0 to 7, integrating the abovementioned seven components) while adjusting for sex, drinking status, and educational attainment. Our results showed that a decrease in one point in the CVH score was associated with a 0.350-year PhenoEAA (pâ€‰=â€‰4.5E-4) and a 0.499-year GrimEAA (pâ€‰=â€‰4.2E-15). By contrast, HannumEAA and IEAA were not significantly associated with the CVH score. We have obtained consistent results within each generation of epigenetic clocks.This is one of the first studies to comprehensively investigate the associations of CVH with four epigenetic clocks. Our TWB data showed that ideal CVH is associated with lower levels of EAA calculated according to the second-generation epigenetic clocks (PhenoEAA and GrimEAA). Having an ideal CVH status can lower EAA and reduce the risk of aging-related disorders.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

No,20220620,epigenetics,35608069,Large-scale integration of DNA methylation and gene expression array platforms identifies both <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> relationships.,Epigenetics,"Although epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have been successful in identifying DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns associated with disease states, any further characterization of etiologic mechanisms underlying disease remains elusive. This knowledge gap does not originate from a lack of DNAm-trait associations, but rather stems from study design issues that affect the interpretability of EWAS results. Despite known limitations in predicting the function of a particular CpG site, most EWAS maintain the broad assumption that altered DNAm results in a concomitant change of transcription at the most proximal gene. This study integrated DNAm and gene expression (GE) measurements in two cohorts, the Adolescent and Young Adult Twin Study (AYATS) and the Pregnancy, Race, Environment, Genes (PREG) study, to improve the understanding of epigenomic regulatory mechanisms. CpG sites associated with GE inciswere enriched in areas of transcription factor binding and areas of intermediate-to-low CpG density. CpG sites associated withtransGE were also enriched in areas of known regulatory significance, including enhancer regions. These results highlight issues with restricting DNAm-transcript annotations to small genomic intervals and question the validity of assuming acisDNAm-GE pathway. Based on these findings, the interpretation of EWAS results is limited in studies without multi-omic support and further research should identify genomic regions in which GE-associated DNAm is overrepresented. An in-depth characterization of GE-associated CpG sites could improve predictions of the downstream functional impact of altered DNAm and inform best practices for interpreting DNAm-trait associations generated by EWAS.",

These changes include differentially expressed genes (DEGs) whose contextual diversity and regulation are poorly understood. Here we combined biological and informatic analyses, including RNA sequencing, protein detection, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and conditional gene deletion, to predict transcriptional regulators that differentially control more than 12,000 DEGs that areÂ potentiallyÂ associated with astrocyte reactivity across diverse central nervous system disorders in mice and humans. DEGs associated with astrocyte reactivity exhibited pronounced heterogeneity across disorders. Transcriptional regulators also exhibited disorder-specific differences, but a core group of 61 transcriptional regulators was identified as common across multiple disorders in both species. We show experimentally that DEG diversity is determined by combinatorial, context-specific interactions between transcriptional regulators. Notably, the same reactivity transcriptional regulators can regulate markedly different DEG cohorts in different disorders; changes in the access of transcriptional regulators to DNA-binding motifs differ markedly across disorders; and DEG changes can crucially require multiple reactivity transcriptional regulators. We show that, by modulating reactivity, transcriptional regulators can substantially alter disorder outcome, implicating them as therapeutic targets. We provide searchable resources of disorder-related reactive astrocyte DEGs and their predicted transcriptional regulators. Our findings show that transcriptional changes associated with astrocyte reactivity are highly heterogeneous and are customized from vast numbers of potential DEGs through context-specific combinatorial transcriptional-regulator interactions.Â© 2022.

Here, we measured TL in six blood cell types from 1046 individuals using the clinically validated Flow-FISH method. We identified remarkable cell-type-specific variations in TL. Host genetics, environmental, parental and intrinsic factors such as sex, parental age, and smoking are associated to variations in TL. By analysing the genome-wide methylation patterns, we identified that the association of maternal, but not paternal, age to TL is mediated by epigenetics. Single-cell RNA-sequencing data for 62 participants revealed differential gene expression in T-cells. Genes negatively associated with TL were enriched for pathways related to translation and nonsense-mediated decay. Altogether, this study addresses cell-type-specific differences in telomere biology and its relation to cell-type-specific gene expression and highlights how perinatal factors play a role in determining TL, on top of genetics and lifestyle.Â© 2022.

The preceding implies state-related influences upon gene expression in people with AN. The present study further examined this notion.Methods:We measured genome-wide DNA methylation in 145 women with active AN, 49 showing stable one-year remission of AN, and 64 with no ED.Results:Comparisons revealed 205 differentially methylated sites between active and no ED groups, and 162 differentially methylated sites between active and remitted groups (Qâ€‰<â€‰0.01). Probes tended to map onto genes relevant to psychiatric, metabolic and immune functions. Notably, several of the genes identified here as being differentially methylated in people with AN (e.g.,SYNJ2, PRKAG2, STAT3,CSGALNACT1, NEGR1,NR1H3) have figured in previous studies on AN. Effects also associated illness chronicity and lower BMI with more pronounced DNA methylation alterations, and remission of AN with normalization of DNA methylation.Conclusions:Findings corroborate earlier results suggesting reversible DNA methylation alterations in AN, and point to particular genes at which epigenetic mechanisms may act to shape AN phenomenology.",

Correlations between total PA-associated DNA methylation and several inflammatory markers, such as hs-CRP, were also conducted.In the meta-analysis, nine CpG sites were significantly associated with total PA (P < 1 Ã— 10-5). Among the nine sites, one site cg07030336 (annotated to VTI1A/ZDHHC6 gene) was successfully replicated (P = 0.009).The current study showed that greater accelerometer-assessed total PA was associated with higher DNA methylation levels at cg07030336 (VTI1A/ZDHHC6) in the general population. Additionally, we found a divergent relationship between the methylation levels at cg07030336 and several inflammatory biomarkers.Copyright Â© 2022 by the American College of Sports Medicine.",

Therefore, we investigated lifestyle effects on blood DNA methylation in participants of the LIFE-Adult study, a well-characterised population-based cohort from Germany.Lifestyle scores (LS) based on diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake were calculated in 4107 participants of the LIFE-Adult study. Fifty subjects with an extremely healthy lifestyle and 50 with an extremely unhealthy lifestyle (5th and 95th percentiles LS) were selected for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in blood samples employing Illumina InfiniumÂ® Methylation EPIC BeadChip system technology.Differences in DNA methylation patterns between body mass index groups (<25 vs. >30Â kg/m2) were rather marginal compared to inter-lifestyle differences (0 vs. 145 differentially methylated positions [DMPs]), which identified 4682 differentially methylated regions (DMRs; false discovery rate [FDRÂ <5%) annotated to 4426 unique genes. A DMR annotated to the glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 (GFPT2) locus showed the strongest hypomethylation (âˆ¼6.9%), and one annotated to glutamate rich 1 (ERICH1) showed the strongest hypermethylation (âˆ¼5.4%) in healthy compared to unhealthy lifestyle individuals. Intersection analysis showed that diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake equally contributed to the observed differences, which affected, among others, pathways related to glutamatergic synapses (adj. pÂ <Â .01) and axon guidance (adj. pÂ <Â .05). We showed that methylation age correlates with chronological age and waist-to-hip ratio with lower DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) acceleration distances in participants with healthy lifestyles. Finally, two identified top DMPs for the alanyl aminopeptidase (ANPEP) locus also showed the strongest expression quantitative trait methylation in blood.DNA methylation patterns help discriminate individuals with a healthy versus unhealthy lifestyle, which may mask subtle methylation differences derived from obesity.Â© 2022 The Authors.

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation may play a role in the sexual differences observed in diseases and other physiological traits.We performed a meta-analysis of the association of sex and cord blood DNA methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites in 8438 newborns from 17 cohorts participating in the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium. We also examined associations of child sex with DNA methylation in older children ages 5.5-10 years from 8 cohorts (nÂ =Â 4268).In newborn blood, sex was associated at Bonferroni level significance with differences in DNA methylation at 46,979 autosomal CpG sites (pÂ <Â 1.3Â Ã—Â 10-7) after adjusting for white blood cell proportions and batch. Most of those sites had lower methylation levels in males than in females. Of the differentially methylated CpG sites identified in newborn blood, 68% (31,727) met look-up level significance (pÂ <Â 1.1Â Ã—Â 10-6) in older children and had methylation differences in the same direction.This is a large-scale meta-analysis examining sex differences in DNA methylation in newborns and older children. Expanding upon previous studies, we replicated previous findings and identified additional autosomal sites with sex-specific differences in DNA methylation. Differentially methylated sites were enriched in genes involved in cancer, psychiatric disorders, and cardiovascular phenotypes.Copyright Â© 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

American Indian communities have a high burden of lung disease compared to the national average. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of DNAm and lung function in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). We conducted a cross-sectional study of American Indian adults, 45-74Â years of age who participated in the SHS. DNAm was measured using the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC platform at baseline (1989-1991). Lung function was measured via spirometry, including forced expiratory volume in 1Â s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), at visit 2 (1993-1995). Airflow limitation was defined as FEV1â€‰<â€‰70% predicted and FEV1/FVCâ€‰<â€‰0.7, restriction was defined as FEV1/FVCâ€‰>â€‰0.7 and FVCâ€‰<â€‰80% predicted, and normal spirometry was defined as FEV1/FVCâ€‰>â€‰0.7, FEV1â€‰>â€‰70% predicted, FVCâ€‰>â€‰80% predicted. We used elastic-net models to select relevant CpGs for lung function and spirometry-defined lung disease. We also conducted bioinformatic analyses to evaluate the biological plausibility of the findings.Among 1677 participants, 21.2% had spirometry-defined airflow limitation and 13.6% had spirometry-defined restrictive pattern lung function. Elastic-net models selected 1118 Differentially Methylated Positions (DMPs) as predictors of airflow limitation and 1385 for restrictive pattern lung function. A total of 12 DMPs overlapped between airflow limitation and restrictive pattern. EGFR, MAPK1 and PRPF8 genes were the most connected nodes in the protein-protein interaction network. Many of the DMPs targeted genes with biological roles related to lung function such as protein kinases.We found multiple differentially methylated CpG sites associated with chronic lung disease. These signals could contribute to better understand molecular mechanisms involved in lung disease, as assessed systemically, as well as to identify patterns that could be useful for diagnostic purposes. Further experimental and longitudinal studies are needed to assess whether DNA methylation has a causal role in lung disease.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Here, we investigate matched genotype and methylation profiles of primary chondrocytes from macroscopically intact (low-grade) and degraded (high-grade) osteoarthritis cartilage and from synoviocytes collected from 98 osteoarthritis-affected individuals undergoing knee replacement surgery. We perform an epigenome-wide association study of knee cartilage degeneration and report robustly replicating methylation markers, which reveal an etiologic mechanism linked to the migration of epithelial cells. Using machine learning, we derive methylation models of cartilage degeneration, which we validate with 82% accuracy in independent data. We report a genome-wide methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) map of articular cartilage and synovium and identify 18 disease-grade-specific mQTLs in osteoarthritis cartilage. We resolve osteoarthritis GWAS loci through causal inference and colocalization analyses and decipher the epigenetic mechanisms that mediate the effect of genotype on disease risk.

Here, we present a mega-analysis of 14 publicly available placenta DNA methylation (DNAm) microarray datasets to identify individual CpGs and regions associated with fetal sex. In the discovery dataset of placentas from full term pregnancies (Nâ€‰=â€‰532 samples), 5212 CpGs met genome-wide significance (pâ€‰<â€‰1E-8) and were enriched in pathways such as keratinization (FDR p-valueâ€‰=â€‰7.37E-14), chemokine activity (FDR p-valueâ€‰=â€‰1.56E-2), and eosinophil migration (FDR p-valueâ€‰=â€‰1.83E-2). Nine differentially methylated regions were identified (fwerAreaâ€‰<â€‰0.1) including a region in the promoter of ZNF300 that showed consistent differential DNAm in samples from earlier timepoints in pregnancy and appeared to be driven predominately by effects in the trophoblast cell type. We describe the largest study of fetal sex differences in placenta DNAm performed to date, revealing genes and pathways characterizing sex-specific placenta function and health outcomes later in life.Â© 2022.

Multiple lines of evidence have linked DNA methylation to both cardiovascular risk factors and social disadvantage indicators. However, limited research has investigated the role of DNA methylation in mediating the associations of individual- and neighborhood-level disadvantage with multiple cardiovascular risk factors in large, multi-ethnic, population-based cohorts. We examined whether disadvantage at the individual level (childhood and adult SES) and neighborhood level (summary neighborhood SES as assessed by Census data and social environment as assessed by perceptions of aesthetic quality, safety, and social cohesion) were associated with 11 cardiovascular risk factors including measures of obesity, diabetes, lipids, and hypertension in 1,154 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). For significant associations, we conducted epigenome-wide mediation analysis to identify methylation sites mediating the relationship between individual/neighborhood disadvantage and cardiovascular risk factors using the JT-Comp method that assesses sparse mediation effects under a composite null hypothesis. In models adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, medication use, and genetic principal components of ancestry, epigenetic mediation was detected for the associations of adult SES with body mass index (BMI), insulin, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), as well as for the association between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and HDL-C at FDRq< 0.05. The 410 CpG mediators identified for the SES-BMI association were enriched for CpGs associated with gene expression (expression quantitative trait methylation loci, or eQTMs), and corresponding genes were enriched in antigen processing and presentation pathways. For cardiovascular risk factors other than BMI, most of the epigenetic mediators lost significance after controlling for BMI. However, 43 methylation sites showed evidence of mediating the neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and HDL-C association after BMI adjustment. The identified mediators were enriched for eQTMs, and corresponding genes were enriched in inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Our findings support the hypothesis that DNA methylation acts as a mediator between individual- and neighborhood-level disadvantage and cardiovascular risk factors, and shed light on the potential underlying epigenetic pathways. Future studies are needed to fully elucidate the biological mechanisms that link social disadvantage to poor cardiovascular health.Copyright Â© 2022 Wang, Zhao, Ammous, Song, Du, Shang, Ratliff, Moore, Kelly, Needham, Diez Roux, Liu, Butler, Kardia, Mukherjee, Zhou and Smith.",

This study aimed to investigate role of DNA methylation in zinc-lung cancer association. We conducted a case-cohort study within prospective Dongfeng-Tongji cohort, including 359 incident lung cancer cases and a randomly selected sub-cohort of 1399 participants. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was used to examine association of plasma zinc with DNA methylation in peripheral blood. For the zinc-related CpGs, their mediation effects on zinc-lung cancer association were assessed; their diagnostic performance for lung cancer was testified in the case-cohort study and further validated in another 126 pairs of lung cancer case-control study. We identified 28 CpGs associated with plasma zinc at PÂ <Â 1.0Â Ã—Â 10-5and seven of them (cg07077080, cg01077808, cg17749033, cg15554270, cg26125625, cg10669424, and cg15409013 annotated to GSR, CALR3, SLC16A3, PHLPP2, SLC12A8, VGLL4, and ADAMTS16, respectively) were associated with incident risk of lung cancer. Moreover, the above seven CpGs were differently methylated between 126 pairs of lung cancer and adjacent normal lung tissues and had the same directions with EWAS of zinc. They could mediate a separate 7.05%âˆ¼22.65% and a joint 29.42% of zinc-lung cancer association. Compared to using traditional factors, addition of methylation risk score exerted improved discriminations for lung cancer both in case-cohort study [area under the curve (AUC)Â =Â 0.818 vs. 0.738] and in case-control study (AUCÂ =Â 0.816 vs. 0.646).

Defining epigenomic biomarkers of lifelong CVH exposure and understanding their roles in CVD development may help develop preventive and therapeutic strategies for CVD.In 1085 CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) participants, we defined a clinical cumulative CVH score that combines body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and fasting glucose measured longitudinally from young adulthood through middle age over 20 years (mean age, 25-45). Blood DNA methylation at >840 000 methylation markers was measured twice over 5 years (mean age, 40 and 45). Epigenome-wide association analyses on the cumulative CVH score were performed in CARDIA and compared in the FHS (Framingham Heart Study). We used penalized regression to build a methylation-based risk score to evaluate the risk of incident coronary artery calcification and clinical CVD events.We identified 45 methylation markers associated with cumulative CVH at false discovery rate <0.01 (P=4.7E-7-5.8E-17) in CARDIA and replicated in FHS. These associations were more pronounced with methylation measured at an older age.CPT1A,ABCG1, andSREBF1appeared as the most prominent genes. The 45 methylation markers were mostly located in transcriptionally active chromatin and involved lipid metabolism, insulin secretion, and cytokine production pathways. Three methylation markers located in genesSARS1,SOCS3, andLINC-PINTstatistically mediated 20.4% of the total effect between CVH and risk of incident coronary artery calcification. The methylation risk score added information and significantly (P=0.004) improved the discrimination capacity of coronary artery calcification status versus CVH score alone and showed association with risk of incident coronary artery calcification 5 to 10 years later independent of cumulative CVH score (odds ratio, 1.87;P=9.66E-09). The methylation risk score was also associated with incident clinical CVD in FHS (hazard ratio, 1.28;P=1.22E-05).Cumulative CVH from young adulthood contributes to midlife epigenetic programming over time. Our findings demonstrate the role of epigenetic markers in response to CVH changes and highlight the potential of epigenomic markers for precision CVD prevention, and earlier detection of subclinical CVD, as well.",

Here, an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed in a sample of 76 OCD patients of European ancestry (37 women, ageâ€‰Â±â€‰SD: 33.51â€‰Â±â€‰10.92 years) and 76 sex- and age-matched healthy controls for the first time using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip. After quality control, nine epigenome-wide significant quantitative trait methylation sites (QTMs) and 21 suggestive hits were discerned in the final sample of 68 patients and 68 controls. The top hit (cg24159721) and four other significant QTMs (cg11894324, cg01070250, cg11330075, cg15174812) map to the region of the microRNA 12136 gene (MIR12136). Two additional significant CpG sites (cg05740793, cg20450977) are located in the flanking region of the MT-RNR2 (humanin) like 8 gene (MT-RNRL8), while two further QTMs (cg16267121, cg15890734) map to the regions of the MT-RNR2 (humanin) like 3 (MT-RNRL3) and MT-RNR2 (humanin) like 2 (MT-RNRL2) genes. Provided replication of the present findings in larger samples, the identified QTMs might provide more biological insight into the pathogenesis of OCD and thereby could in the future serve as peripheral epigenetic markers of OCD risk with the potential to inform targeted preventive and therapeutic efforts.Â© 2022.

To study the dynamics of DNA methylation, we examined participants from a SLE longitudinal cohort sampled at two time-points.One hundred and one participants from the California Lupus Epidemiology Study were studied. DNA extracted from blood at cohort enrollment and after two years was analyzed using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip. Paired t-tests were utilized to identify changes at 256 CpG sites previously associated with SLE subtypes as well as genome-wide. Mixed linear models were developed to understand the relationship between DNA methylation and disease activity, medication use and sample cell proportions, adjusting for age, sex and genetic principal components.The majority of CpGs that were previously associated with SLE subtypes remained stable over two years (185 CpGs (72.3%), t-test FDR >0.05). Compared to background genome-wide methylation, there was an enrichment of SLE subtype associated CpGs that changed over time (27.7% vs 0.34%). Changes in cell proportion were associated with changes at 67 CpGs (p<2.70E-05) and 15 CpGs had at least one significant association with use of an immunosuppressive medication.In this longitudinal cohort of SLE, we identified a subset of SLE subtype associated CpGs that were stable over time and may be useful as biomarkers of disease subtypes. Another subset of SLE subtype-associated CpGs changed at a higher proportion compared to the genome-wide methylome. Additional studies are needed to understand the etiology and impact of these methylation changes in SLE-associated CpGs.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

DNA methylation could be a valuable tool in helping predict those at-risk individuals. This cross-sectional study comprised 112 subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and were grouped according to the current suicidal ideation severity. DNA methylation across the genome was measured with the InfiniumÂ®MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We utilized the dmpFinder and bumphunter functions within the Bioconductor minfi package to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs), respectively.

All positions and regions identified in this analysis were only found to have suggestive levels of significance at the genome-wide level. The present study was one of the first to investigate genome-wide methylation and suicidal ideation severity. While there were many strengths of our study, including investigating both differentially methylated positions and regions, further larger-scale studies are necessary to replicate, support, and validate our findings presented here.",

It is important to identify its early-life risk factors. Maternal poor sleep is common in late pregnancy, and previous studies indicated that poor sleep may influence the offspring's adiposity status. However, very few studies in humans investigated the effect of the different sleep parameters (sleep quantity, quality, and timing) on the offspring's adiposity indicators, and long-term studies are even more scarce. In addition, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study therefore aimed to examine the association between the three maternal sleep dimensions in the late pregnancy and the offspring adiposity indicators and to explore the potential mediating effect of the cord blood DNA methylation in the above association.Included participants in the current study were 2211 healthy pregnant women with singleton gestation from the Shanghai Birth Cohort (SBC) and Shanghai Sleep Birth Cohort (SSBC). Maternal nighttime sleep duration, quality, and midpoint (an indicator of circadian rhythm) were assessed by the same instrument in both cohorts during late pregnancy, and the offspring's body mass index (BMI) and subcutaneous fat (SF) were measured at 2Â years old. Additionally, in 231 SSBC samples, the genome-wide DNA methylation levels were measured using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. The multivariate linear regression was used to determine the associations between the maternal sleep parameters and the offspring adiposity indicators. The epigenome-wide association study was conducted to identify the maternal sleep-related CpG sites. The mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the potential intermediate role of DNA methylation in the association between maternal sleep and offspring adiposity indicators.The mean maternal nighttime sleep duration and the sleep midpoint for combined cohorts were 9.24â€‰Â±â€‰1.13Â h and 3.02â€‰Â±â€‰0.82, respectively, and 24.5% of pregnant women experienced poor sleep quality in late pregnancy. After adjusting for the covariates, the maternal later sleep midpoint was associated with the increased SF in offspring (Coef.â€‰=â€‰0.62, 95% CI 0.37-0.87, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) at 2Â years old. However, no significant associations of the nighttime sleep duration or sleep quality with the offspring adiposity indicators were found. In the SSBC sample, 45 differential methylated probes (DMPs) were associated with the maternal sleep midpoint, and then, we observed 10 and 3 DMPs that were also associated with the offspring's SF and BMI at 2Â years, of which cg04351668 (MARCH9) and cg12232388 significantly mediated the relationship of sleep midpoint and SF and cg12232388 and cg12225226 mediated the sleep midpoint-BMI association, respectively.Maternal later sleep timing in late pregnancy was associated with higher childhood adiposity in the offspring. Cord blood DNA methylation may play a mediation role in that relationship.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

We sought for a sparse set of CpG sites predicting lung cancer and explored the role of smoking in these associations. We analysed CpGs in relation to lung cancer in participants from two nested case-control studies, using (LASSO)-penalised regression. We accounted for the effects of smoking using known smoking-related CpGs, and through conditional-independence network. We identified 29 CpGs (8 smoking-related, 21 smoking-unrelated) associated with lung cancer. Models additionally adjusted for Comprehensive Smoking Index-(CSI) selected 1 smoking-related and 49 smoking-unrelated CpGs. Selected CpGs yielded excellent discriminatory performances, outperforming information provided by CSI only. Of the 8 selected smoking-related CpGs, two captured lung cancer-relevant effects of smoking that were missed by CSI. Further, the 50 CpGs identified in the CSI-adjusted model complementarily explained lung cancer risk. These markers may provide further insight into lung cancer carcinogenesis and help improving early identification of high-risk patients.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",
No,20220815,prediction,35064064,AHRR (cg05575921) Methylation Safely Improves Specificity of Lung Cancer Screening Eligibility Criteria: A Cohort Study,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev.,"Background: Screening reduces lung cancer mortality, but specificities of eligibility criteria are low. We tested if leukocyte AHRR(cg05575921) methylation improves specificity of lung cancer screening eligibility criteria.

Methods: A total of 9,206 and 5,370 individuals of the 1991 to 1994 and 2001 to 2003 examinations of the Copenhagen City Heart Study, Denmark, were followed for lung cancer within 5 years after examination and mortality. Screening eligibility criteria (DANTE, DLCST, ITALUNG, LUSI, NELSON, NLST, and PLCOM2012) were evaluated, and AHRR (cg05575921) methylation extent at different methylation cut points was added. The model with the lowest number of eligible individuals per 5-year lung cancer was validated within the 2001 to 2003 examination.

Results: Eligibility criteria identified risk-groups ranging from 3,182 (DANTE) to 1,641 (ITALUNG) individuals. The positive predictive value was highest for PLCOM2012 (3.2%), while DANTE showed the highest negative predictive value (99.7%). Adding AHRR (cg05575921) methylation led to higher specificities for all criteria. Number of eligible individuals per 5-year lung cancer varied from 38 (NELSON) to 27 (NLST) with AHRR (cg05575921) methylation <55%. This last model led to a 21.9% lower screening burden and increased (P < 0.05) specificity of 84.0%. Findings were reproduced among the 5,334 individuals of the 2001 to 2003 examination.

Conclusions: Adding AHRR (cg05575921) methylation on top of current eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening improves specificity by excluding those individuals with the lowest risk.

Impact: The results point toward a potential clinical use of AHRR (cg05575921) methylation, which is a cost-effective measurement compared with lung CT scanning, to provide additional predictive risk information to identify eligible smokers for lung cancer screening.

Such clocks in male germ cells are less developed and lack clinical relevance in terms of their utility to predict reproductive outcomes.This was a population-based prospective cohort study of couples discontinuing contraception to become pregnant recruited from 16 US counties from 2005 to 2009 and followed for up to 12â€‰months.Sperm DNA methylation from 379 semen samples was assessed via a beadchip array. A state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithm was employed to predict age from the sperm DNA methylation data. SEA was estimated from clocks derived from individual CpGs (SEACpG) and differentially methylated regions (SEADMR). Probability of pregnancy within 1â€‰year was compared by SEA, and discrete-time proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relations with time-to-pregnancy (TTP) with adjustment for covariates.Our SEACpG clock had the highest predictive performance with correlation between chronological and predicted age (râ€‰=â€‰0.91). In adjusted discrete Cox models, SEACpG was negatively associated with TTP (fecundability odds ratios (FORs)=0.83; 95% CI: 0.76, 0.90; Pâ€‰=â€‰1.2Ã—10-5), indicating a longer TTP with advanced SEACpG. For subsequent birth outcomes, advanced SEACpG was associated with shorter gestational age (nâ€‰=â€‰192; -2.13â€‰days; 95% CI: -3.67, -0.59; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.007). Current smokers also displayed advanced SEACpG (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Finally, SEACpG showed a strong performance in an independent IVF cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰173; râ€‰=â€‰0.83). SEADMR performance was comparable to SEACpG but with attenuated effect sizes.This prospective cohort study consisted primarily of Caucasian men and women, and thus analysis of large diverse cohorts is necessary to confirm the associations between SEA and couple pregnancy success in other races/ethnicities.These data suggest that our sperm epigenetic clocks may have utility as a novel biomarker to predict TTP among couples in the general population and underscore the importance of the male partner for reproductive success.This work was funded in part by grants the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health (R01 ES028298; PI: J.R.P. and P30 ES020957); Robert J.

In the present study, we define the genetic association with kidney function in 1.5 million individuals and identify 878 (126 new) loci. We map the genotype effect on the methylome in 443 kidneys, transcriptome in 686 samples and single-cell open chromatin in 57,229 kidney cells. Heritability analysis reveals that methylation variation explains a larger fraction of heritability than gene expression. We present a multi-stage prioritization strategy and prioritize target genes for 87% of kidney function loci. We highlight key roles of proximal tubules and metabolism in kidney function regulation. Furthermore, the causal role of SLC47A1 in kidney disease is defined in mice with genetic loss of Slc47a1 and in human individuals carrying loss-of-function variants. Our findings emphasize the key role of bulk and single-cell epigenomic information in translating genome-wide association studies into identifying causal genes, cellular origins and mechanisms of complex traits.Â© 2022.

With advanced data collection technology for large-scale studies, there has been growing research interest in developing methodology for high-dimensional mediation analysis. In this paper we present HIMA2, an extension of the HIMA method (Zhang in Bioinformatics 32:3150-3154, 2016). First, the proposed HIMA2 reduces the dimension of mediators to a manageable level based on the sure independence screening (SIS) method (Fan in J R Stat Soc Ser B 70:849-911, 2008). Second, a de-biased Lasso procedure is implemented for estimating regression parameters. Third, we use a multiple-testing procedure to accurately control the false discovery rate (FDR) when testing high-dimensional mediation hypotheses. We demonstrate its practical performance using Monte Carlo simulation studies and apply our method to identify DNA methylation markers which mediate the pathway from smoking to reduced lung function in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study.Â© 2022.

No,20220815,methods,35856716,High-dimension to high-dimension screening for detecting genome-wide epigenetic and noncoding RNA regulators of gene expression.,Bioinformatics,"The advancement of high-throughput technology characterizes a wide variety of epigenetic modifications and noncoding RNAs across the genome involved in disease pathogenesis via regulating gene expression. The high-dimensionality of both epigenetic/noncoding RNA and gene expression data make it challenging to identify the important regulators of genes. Conducting univariate test for each possible regulator-gene pair is subject to serious multiple comparison burden, and direct application of regularization methods to select regulator-gene pairs is computationally infeasible. Applying fast screening to reduce dimension first before regularization is more efficient and stable than applying regularization methods alone.We propose a novel screening method based on robust partial correlation to detect epigenetic and noncoding RNA regulators of gene expression over the whole genome, a problem that includes both high-dimensional predictors and high-dimensional responses. Compared to existing screening methods, our method is conceptually innovative that it reduces the dimension of both predictor and response, and screens at both node (regulators or genes) and edge (regulator-gene pairs) levels. We develop data-driven procedures to determine the conditional sets and the optimal screening threshold, and implement a fast iterative algorithm. Simulations and applications to long non-coding RNA and microRNA regulation in Kidney cancer and DNA methylation regulation in Glioblastoma Multiforme illustrate the validity and advantage of our method.The R package, related source codes and real data sets used in this paper are provided at https://github.com/kehongjie/rPCor.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.Â© The Author(s) (2022).

In blood samples, DeepMAge can predict chronological age within a 2.8Â years error margin, but in saliva samples, its performance is drastically reduced since aging clocks are restricted by the training set domain. However, saliva is an attractive fluid for genomic studies due to its availability, compared to other tissues, including blood. In this article, we display how cell type deconvolution and elastic net can be used to expand the domain of deep aging clocks to other tissues. Using our approach, DeepMAge's error in saliva samples was reduced from 20.9 to 4.7Â years with no retraining.Copyright Â© 2021 Galkin, Kochetov, Mamoshina and Zhavoronkov.",
No,20220815,prediction,35864305,Peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles predict future development of B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.,NPJ Precis Oncol,"Lack of accurate methods for early lymphoma detection limits the ability to cure patients. Since patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) who present with advanced disease have worse outcomes, accurate and sensitive methods for early detection are needed to improve patient care. We developed a DNA methylation-based prediction tool for NHL, based on blood samples collected prospectively from 278 apparently healthy patients who were followed for up to 16 years to monitor for NHL development. A predictive score was developed using machine learning methods in a robust training/validation framework. Our predictive score incorporates CpG DNA methylation at 135 genomic positions, with higher scores predicting higher risk. It was 85% and 78% accurate for identifying patients at risk of developing future NHL, in patients with high or low epigenetic mitotic clock respectively, in a validation cohort. It was also sensitive at detecting active NHL (96.3% accuracy) and healthy status (95.6% accuracy) in additional independent cohorts. Scores optimized for specific NHL subtypes showed significant but lower accuracy for predicting other subtypes. Our score incorporates hyper-methylation of Polycomb and HOX genes, which have roles in NHL development, as well as PAX5 - a master transcriptional regulator of B-cell fate. Subjects with higher risk scores showed higher regulatory T-cells, memory B-cells, but lower naÃ¯ve T helper lymphocytes fractions in the blood. Future prospective studies will be required to confirm the utility of our signature for managing patients who are at high risk for developing future NHL.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",
No,20220815,prediction,35740428,Predicting High Blood Pressure Using DNA Methylome-Based Machine Learning Models.,Biomedicines,"DNA methylation modification plays a vital role in the pathophysiology of high blood pressure (BP). Herein, we applied three machine learning (ML) algorithms including deep learning (DL), support vector machine, and random forest for detecting high BP using DNA methylome data. Peripheral blood samples of 50 elderly individuals were collected three times at three visits for DNA methylome profiling. Participants who had a history of hypertension and/or current high BP measure were considered to have high BP. The whole dataset was randomly divided to conduct a nested five-group cross-validation for prediction performance. Data in each outer training set were independently normalized using a min-max scaler, reduced dimensionality using principal component analysis, then fed into three predictive algorithms. Of the three ML algorithms, DL achieved the best performance (AUPRC = 0.65, AUROC = 0.73, accuracy = 0.69, and F1-score = 0.73). To confirm the reliability of using DNA methylome as a biomarker for high BP, we constructed mixed-effects models and found that 61,694 methylation sites located in 15,523 intragenic regions and 16,754 intergenic regions were significantly associated with BP measures. Our proposed models pioneered the methodology of applying ML and DNA methylome data for early detection of high BP in clinical practices.",
No,20220815,prediction,35839250,Explainable deep transfer learning model for disease risk prediction using high-dimensional genomic data.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Building an accurate disease risk prediction model is an essential step in the modern quest for precision medicine. While high-dimensional genomic data provides valuable data resources for the investigations of disease risk, their huge amount of noise and complex relationships between predictors and outcomes have brought tremendous analytical challenges. Deep learning model is the state-of-the-art methods for many prediction tasks, and it is a promising framework for the analysis of genomic data. However, deep learning models generally suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the lack of biological interpretability, both of which have greatly limited their applications. In this work, we have developed a deep neural network (DNN) based prediction modeling framework. We first proposed a group-wise feature importance score for feature selection, where genes harboring genetic variants with both linear and non-linear effects are efficiently detected. We then designed an explainable transfer-learning based DNN method, which can directly incorporate information from feature selection and accurately capture complex predictive effects. The proposed DNN-framework is biologically interpretable, as it is built based on the selected predictive genes. It is also computationally efficient and can be applied to genome-wide data. Through extensive simulations and real data analyses, we have demonstrated that our proposed method can not only efficiently detect predictive features, but also accurately predict disease risk, as compared to many existing methods.",

No,20220815,vntr,35609568,A phenome-wide association study identifies effects of copy-number variation of VNTRs and multicopy genes on multiple human traits.,Am J Hum Genet,"The human genome contains tens of thousands of large tandem repeats and hundreds of genes that show common and highly variable copy-number changes. Due to their large size and repetitive nature, these variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) and multicopy genes are generally recalcitrant to standard genotyping approaches and, as a result, this class of variation is poorly characterized. However, several recent studies have demonstrated that copy-number variation of VNTRs can modify local gene expression, epigenetics, and human traits, indicating that many have a functional role. Here, using read depth from whole-genome sequencing to profile copy number, we report results of a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of VNTRs and multicopy genes in a discovery cohort of âˆ¼35,000 samples, identifying 32 traits associated with copy number of 38 VNTRs and multicopy genes at 1% FDR. We replicated many of these signals in an independent cohort and observed that VNTRs showing trait associations were significantly enriched for expression QTLs with nearby genes, providing strong support for our results. Fine-mapping studies indicated that in the majority (âˆ¼90%) of cases, the VNTRs and multicopy genes we identified represent the causal variants underlying the observed associations. Furthermore, several lie in regions where prior SNV-based GWASs have failed to identify any significant associations with these traits. Our study indicates that copy number of VNTRs and multicopy genes contributes to diverse human traits and suggests that complex structural variants potentially explain some of the so-called ""missing heritability"" of SNV-based GWASs.Copyright Â© 2022 American Society of Human Genetics.

Yes,20220815,ewas,35943854,Epigenetic and integrative cross-omics analyses of cerebral white matter hyperintensities on MRI.,Brain,"Cerebral white matter hyperintensities on MRI are markers of cerebral small vessel disease, a major risk factor for dementia and stroke. Despite the successful identification of multiple genetic variants associated with this highly heritable condition, its genetic architecture remains incompletely understood. More specifically, the role of DNA methylation has received little attention. We investigated the association between white matter hyperintensity burden and DNA methylation in blood at approximately 450,000 CpG sites in 9,732 middle-aged to older adults from 14 community-based studies. Single-CpG and region-based association analyses were carried out. Functional annotation and integrative cross-omics analyses were performed to identify novel genes underlying the relationship between DNA methylation and white matter hyperintensities. We identified 12 single-CpG and 46 region-based DNA methylation associations with white matter hyperintensity burden. Our top discovery single CpG, cg24202936 (Pâ€‰=â€‰7.6â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8), was associated with F2 expression in blood (Pâ€‰=â€‰6.4â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5), and colocalized with FOLH1 expression in brain (posterior probability =0.75). Our top differentially methylated regions were in PRMT1 and in CCDC144NL-AS1, which were also represented in single-CpG associations (cg17417856 and cg06809326, respectively). Through Mendelian randomization analyses cg06809326 was putatively associated with white matter hyperintensity burden (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.03) and expression of CCDC144NL-AS1 possibly mediated this association. Differentially methylated region analysis, joint epigenetic association analysis, and multi-omics colocalization analysis consistently identified a role of DNA methylation near SH3PXD2A, a locus previously identified in genome-wide association studies of white matter hyperintensities. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed functions of the identified DNA methylation loci in the blood-brain barrier and in the immune response. Integrative cross-omics analysis identified 19 key regulatory genes in two networks related to extracellular matrix organization, and lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. A drug repositioning analysis indicated antihyperlipidemic agents, more specifically peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, as possible target drugs for white matter hyperintensities. Our epigenome-wide association study and integrative cross-omics analyses implicate novel genes influencing white matter hyperintensity burden, which converged on pathways related to the immune response and to a compromised blood brain barrier possibly due to disrupted cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. The results also suggest that antihyperlipidemic therapy may contribute to lowering risk for white matter hyperintensities possibly through protection against blood brain barrier disruption.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

Episignatures are distinct, highly sensitive and specific biomarkers that have recently been applied in clinical diagnosis of genetic syndromes. Episignatures are contained within the broader disorder-specific genome-wide DNA methylation changes which can share significant overlap amongst different conditions. In this study we performed functional genomic assessment and comparison of disorder-specific and overlapping genome-wide DNA methylation changes related to 65 genetic syndromes with previously described episignatures. We demonstrate evidence of disorder-specific and recurring genome-wide differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs). The overall distribution of DMPs and DMRs across the majority of the neurodevelopmental genetic syndromes analyzed showed substantial enrichment in gene promoters and CpG islands, and under-representation of the more variable intergenic regions. Analysis showed significant enrichment of the DMPs and DMRs in gene pathways and processes related to neurodevelopment, including neurogenesis, synaptic signaling and synaptic transmission. This study expands beyond the diagnostic utility of DNA methylation episignatures by demonstrating correlation between the function of the mutated genes and the consequent genomic DNA methylation profiles as a key functional element in the molecular etiology of genetic neurodevelopmental disorders.

A cross-sectional analysis of participants (median age 58 years) of the population-based prospective KORA FF4 study, habitual dietary intake was modeled based on repeated 24-h diet recalls and a food frequency questionnaire. DNA methylation was measured using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip providing data on &gt;850,000 sites in this epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). Three metabotype clusters were identified using four standard clinical parameters and BMI. Regression models were used to associate diet and DNA methylation, and to test for effect modification. Few significant signals were identified in the basic analysis while many significant signals were observed in models including food group-metabotype interaction terms. Most findings refer to interactions of food intake with metabotype 3, which is the metabotype with the most unfavorable metabolic profile. This research highlights the importance of the metabolic characteristics of subjects when identifying associations between diet and white blood cell DNA methylation in EWAS.",

Generalized estimated equation (GEE) model was used to regress the methylation level of CpG sites on WHR. The Inference about Causation through Examination of FAmiliaL CONfounding (ICE FALCON) was used to assess the temporal relationship between methylation and WHR. Gene expression analysis was conducted to validate the results of differentially methylated analyses.EWAS identified 92 CpG sites with the level of Pâ€‰<â€‰10â€‰-â€‰4which were annotated to 32 genes, especially CADPS2, TUSC5, ZCCHC14, CORO7, COL23A1, CACNA1C, CYP26B1, and BCAT1.

We performed epigenome-wide association analyses (nÂ =Â 223) to estimate associations between maternal active or inactive asthma, as compared to never asthma, and placental differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially variable positions (DVPs). Models adjusted for maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, smoking status, parity, age and education level and child sex. P-values were FDR-adjusted.One hundred and fifty-nine (71.3%) pregnant women reported no history of asthma (never asthma), 15 (6.7%) reported inactive, and 49 (22%) reported active antenatal asthma. Women predominantly self-identified as Black/Hispanic Black [88 (39.5%)] and Hispanic/non-Black [42 (18.8%)]. We identified 10 probes at FDR<0.05 and 4 probes at FDR<0.10 characterized by higher variability in maternal active asthma compared to never asthma mapping to GPX3, LHPP, PECAM1, ATAD3C, and ARHGEF4 and 2 probes characterized by lower variation mapping to CHMP4A and C5orf24.

By comparison, the Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE) study demonstrated that hormone therapy (HT) was associated with significant reduction in atherosclerosis progression in women who were within six years of menopause compared to those who were 10 or more years from menopause. These findings are consistent with other studies showing significant reductions in all-cause mortality and CVD with HT, particularly when initiated in women younger than 60Â years of age or within 10Â years since menopause. To explore the biological mechanisms underlying the age-related atheroprotective effects of HT, we investigated changes in methylation of blood cells of postmenopausal women who participated in ELITE.We first validated the epigenetic data generated from blood leukocytes of ELITE participants by replicating previously known associations between smoking and methylation levels at previously identified CpG sites, such as cg05575921 at the AHRR locus. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) evaluating changes in methylation through interactions with time-since-menopause and HT revealed two significantly associated CpG sites on chromosomes 12 (cg19552895; pâ€‰=â€‰1.1â€‰Ã—â€‰10-9) and 19 (cg18515510; pâ€‰=â€‰2.4â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8). Specifically, HT resulted in modest, but significant, increases in methylation levels at both CpGs but only in women who were 10 or more years since menopause and randomized to HT. Changes in carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) from baseline to 36Â months after HT were not significantly correlated with changes in methylation levels at either cg19552895 or cg18515510. Evaluation of other previously identified CpG sites at which methylation levels in either blood or vascular tissue were associated with atherosclerosis also did not reveal any differences in methylation as a function of HT and time-since-menopause or with changes in CIMT.We identified specific methylation differences in blood in response to HT among women who were 10 or more years since menopause. The functional consequence of these change with respect to atherosclerosis progression and protective effects of HT remains to be determined and will require additional studies.Â© 2022.

Though there has been some association between genetic polymorphisms and age of onset, there has been little exploration of the role of epigenetic processes. We sought to explore the influence of DNA methylation, a key epigenetic mechanism, and its association with the age of onset of illness.One hundred thirty-eight participants aged 18-75 years and previously diagnosed with SCZ spectrum disorders by the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (SCID DSM-5) were recruited. Venous blood was collected and genome-wide DNA methylation was quantified using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array. Individual CpG sites and regions of differential methylation were explored by the age of onset; covariates included age, sex, as well as white blood cell composition.Binary grouping (early vs. late onset) revealed four intergenic CpG sites on chromosome 2 that were above the expected P-value threshold, with hypermethylation of the CpG site cg10392614 most strongly associated with early-onset SCZ. The four most strongly associated CpG sites, including cg 10392614, were intergenic. Continuous analysis revealed the top CpG site to be cg11723066, which is linked to the JAM3 gene, with hypomethylation associated with earlier onset; however, results were below the expected P-value threshold.Studies on DNA methylation in the first-episode psychosis population may help further our understanding of the role of epigenetics in the age of onset of SCZ.Copyright Â© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We hypothesized that the programming of the central nervous system (CNS), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system (ANS) induced by prenatal stress (PS) is reflected in electrophysiological and epigenetic biomarkers. In this study, we aimed to find noninvasive epigenetic biomarkers of PS in the newborn salivary DNA.A total of 728 pregnant women were screened for stress exposure using Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), 164 women were enrolled, and 114 dyads were analyzed. Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (PDQ) was also administered to assess specific pregnancy worries. Transabdominal fetal electrocardiograms (taECG) were recorded to derive coupling between maternal and fetal heart rates resulting in a 'Fetal Stress Index' (FSI). Upon delivery, we collected maternal hair strands for cortisol measurements and newborn's saliva for epigenetic analyses. DNA was extracted from saliva samples, and DNA methylation was measured using EPIC BeadChip array (850Â k CpG sites). Linear regression was used to identify associations between PSS/PDQ/FSI/Cortisol and DNA methylation. We found epigenome-wide significant associations for 5 CpG with PDQ and cortisol at FDRâ€‰<â€‰5%. Three CpGs were annotated to genes (Illumina Gene annotation file): YAP1, TOMM20 and CSMD1, and two CpGs were located approximately lay at 50Â kb from SSBP4 and SCAMP1. In addition, two differentiated methylation regions (DMR) related to maternal stress measures PDQ and cortisol were found: DAXX and ARL4D.Genes annotated to these CpGs were found to be involved in secretion and transportation, nuclear signaling, Hippo signaling pathways, apoptosis, intracellular trafficking and neuronal signaling. Moreover, some CpGs are annotated to genes related to autism, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophrenia. However, our results should be viewed as hypothesis generating until replicated in a larger sample. Early assessment of such noninvasive PS biomarkers will allow timelier detection of babies at risk and a more effective allocation of resources for early intervention programs to improve child development. A biomarker-guided early intervention strategy is the first step in the prevention of future health problems, reducing their personal and societal impact.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Studies among other population groups have identified DNA methylation loci associated with insulin resistance, but data in African Americans are lacking. Using DNA methylation profiles of blood samples obtained from the Illumina InfiniumÂ® HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, we performed an epigenome-wide association study to identify DNA methylation loci associated with insulin resistance among 136 non-diabetic, unrelated African American men (mean age 41.6Â years) from the Howard University Family Study.We identified three differentially methylated positions (DMPs) for homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) at 5% FDR. One DMP (cg14013695, HOXA5) is a known locus among Mexican Americans, while the other two DMPs are novel-cg00456326 (OSR1; betaâ€‰=â€‰0.027) and cg20259981 (ST18; betaâ€‰=â€‰0.010). Although the cg00456326 DMP is novel, the OSR1 gene has previously been found associated with both insulin resistance and T2D in Europeans. The genes HOXA5 and ST18 have been implicated in biological processes relevant to insulin resistance. Differential methylation at the significant HOXA5 and OSR1 DMPs is associated with differences in gene expression in the iMETHYL database. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) did not identify any epigenome-wide DMRs for HOMA-IR. We tested transferability of HOMA-IR associated DMPs from five previous EWAS in Mexican Americans, Indian Asians, Europeans, and European ancestry Americans. Out of the 730 previously reported HOMA-IR DMPs, 47 (6.4%) were associated with HOMA-IR in this cohort of African Americans.The findings from our study suggest substantial differences in DNA methylation patterns associated with insulin resistance across populations. Two of the DMPs we identified in African Americans have not been reported in other populations, and we found low transferability of HOMA-IR DMPs reported in other populations in African Americans.

This is especially important in older adults whose vitamin D deficiency occurs with a high prevalence. This study aimed to examine the influence of lifestyle and vitamin D on global DNA methylation patterns in an elderly cohort in Southwest of Sweden. We also sought to examine the methylation levels of specific genes involved in vitamin D's molecular and metabolic activated pathways. We performed a genome wide methylation analysis, using Illumina Infinium DNA Methylation EPIC 850kBeadChip array, on 277 healthy individuals from Southwest Sweden at the age of 70-95. The study participants also answered queries on lifestyle, vitamin intake, heart medication, and estimated health. Vitamin D intake did not in general affect methylation patterns, which is in concert with other studies. However, when comparing the group of individuals taking vitamin supplements, including vitamin D, with those not taking supplements, a difference in methylation in the solute carrier family 25 (SCL25A24) gene was found. This confirms a previous finding, where changes in expression of SLC25A24 were associated with vitamin D treatment in human monocytes. The combination of vitamin D intake and high physical activity increased methylation of genes linked to regulation of vitamin D receptor pathway, the Wnt pathway and general cancer processes. To our knowledge, this is the first study detecting epigenetic markers associated with the combined effects of vitamin D supplementation and high physical activity. These results deserve to be further investigated in an extended, interventional study cohort, where also the levels of 25(OH)D3can be monitored.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

We explored the epigenetic signatures of COVID-19 in peripheral blood using data from an ongoing prospective observational study of COVID-19 called the Norwegian Corona Cohort Study. A series of EWASs were performed to compare the DNA methylation profiles between COVID-19 cases and controls three months post-infection. We also investigated differences associated with severity and long-COVID. Three CpGs-cg22399236, cg03607951, and cg09829636-were significantly hypomethylated (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05) in COVID-19 positive individuals. cg03607951 is located in IFI44L which is involved in innate response to viral infection and several systemic autoimmune diseases. cg09829636 is located in ANKRD9, a gene implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, including the degradation of IMPDH2. The link between ANKRD9 and IMPDH2 is striking given that IMPDHs are considered therapeutic targets for COVID-19. Furthermore, gene ontology analyses revealed pathways involved in response to viruses. The lack of significant differences associated with severity and long-COVID may be real or reflect limitations in sample size. Our findings support the involvement of interferon responsive genes in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and indicate a possible link to systemic autoimmune diseases.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Numerous genetic and environmental factors, from conception onwards, may influence this phenotype. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation have been proposed to underlie variation in sleep or may be an early-life marker of sleep disturbances. We examined if DNA methylation at birth or in school age is associated with parent-reported and actigraphy-estimated sleep outcomes in children.We meta-analysed epigenome-wide association study results. DNA methylation was measured from cord blood at birth in 11 cohorts and from peripheral blood in children (4-13Â years) in 8 cohorts. Outcomes included parent-reported sleep duration, sleep initiation and fragmentation problems, and actigraphy-estimated sleep duration, sleep onset latency and wake-after-sleep-onset duration.We found no associations between DNA methylation at birth and parent-reported sleep duration (nâ€‰=â€‰3658), initiation problems (nâ€‰=â€‰2504), or fragmentation (nâ€‰=â€‰1681) (p values above cut-off 4.0â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8). Lower methylation at cg24815001 and cg02753354 at birth was associated with longer actigraphy-estimated sleep duration (pâ€‰=â€‰3.31â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8, nâ€‰=â€‰577) and sleep onset latency (pâ€‰=â€‰8.8â€‰Ã—â€‰10-9, nâ€‰=â€‰580), respectively. DNA methylation in childhood was not cross-sectionally associated with any sleep outcomes (nâ€‰=â€‰716-2539).DNA methylation, at birth or in childhood, was not associated with parent-reported sleep.

We are unaware of epidemiological studies on longitudinal PA and placental DNA methylation (DNAm).We evaluated the association between PA before and during pregnancy and placental DNAm.Placental tissues were obtained at delivery and methylation was measured using HumanMethylation450 Beadchips for participants in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Fetal Growth Studies-Singletons among 298 participants. Using the Pregnancy PA Questionnaire, women recalled periconception PA (past 12 months) at 8-13 weeks gestation, and PA since last visit at four follow-up visits at 16-22, 24-29, 30-33, 34-37 weeks. We conducted linear regression for associations of PA at each visit with methylation controlling for false discovery rate (FDR). Top 100 CpGs were queried for enrichment of functional pathways using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.Periconception PA was significantly associated with 1 CpG site. PA since last visit for visits 1-4 was associated with 2, 2, 8, 0 CpGs (log fold changes ranging from -0.0319 to 0.0080, after controlling for FDR). The largest change in methylation occurred at a site in TIMP2, which is known to encode a protein critical for vasodilation, placentation, and uterine expansion during pregnancy (log fold change: -0.05, 95% confidence interval: -0.06, -0.03 per metabolic equivalent of task [MET]-hours/week at 30-33 weeks). Most significantly enriched pathways include Cardiac Hypertrophy Signaling, B Cell Receptor Signaling, and Netrin Signaling. Significant CpGs and enriched pathways varied by visit.Recreational PA in the year prior and during pregnancy was associated with placental DNAm.

Placental CpG methylation provides mechanistic information regarding the relationship between prenatal epigenetic programming, prematurity, neonatal inflammation, and later-in-life health.We contrasted CpG methylation in the placenta and neonatal blood spots in relation to neonatal inflammation in the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn (ELGAN) cohort. Neonatal inflammation status was based on the expression of six inflammation-related proteins, assessed as (1) day-one inflammation (DOI) or (2) intermittent or sustained systemic inflammation (ISSI, inflammation on â‰¥2 days in the first 2 postnatal weeks). Epigenome-wide CpG methylation was assessed in 354 placental samples and 318 neonatal blood samples.Placental CpG methylation displayed the strongest association with ISSI (48 CpG sites) but was not associated with DOI. This was in contrast to CpG methylation in blood spots, which was associated with DOI (111 CpG sites) and not with ISSI (one CpG site).Placental CpG methylation was strongly associated with ISSI, a measure of inflammation previously linked to later-in-life cognitive impairment, while day-one neonatal blood methylation was associated with DOI.Neonatal inflammation increases the risk of adverse later-life outcomes, especially in infants born extremely preterm. CpG methylation in the placenta and neonatal blood spots were evaluated in relation to neonatal inflammation assessed via circulating proteins as either (i) day-one inflammation (DOI) or (ii) intermittent or sustained systemic inflammation (ISSI, inflammation on â‰¥2 days in the first 2 weeks). Tissue specificity was observed in epigenetic-inflammatory relationships: placental CpG methylation was associated with ISSI, neonatal blood CpG methylation was associated with DOI. Supporting the placental origins of disease framework, placental epigenetic patterns are associated with a propensity for ISSI in neonates.Â© 2022.

Patients were recruited from the National Center for Epilepsy, Norway, from March 1, 2011 to February 28, 2017. DNA methylation was analyzed using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Analysis of variance and paired t-test were used to identify differentially methylated loci after 4 and 12â€‰weeks of dietary treatment. A false discovery rate approach with a significance threshold of <5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons.We observed a genome-wide decrease in DNA methylation, both globally and at specific sites, after 4 and 12â€‰weeks of dietary treatment. A substantial share of the differentially methylated positions (CpGs) were annotated to genes associated with epilepsy (nÂ =â€‰7), lipid metabolism (nÂ =â€‰8), and transcriptional regulation (nÂ =â€‰10). Furthermore, five of the identified genes were related to inositol phosphate metabolism, which may represent a possible mechanism by which the ketogenic diet attenuates seizures.A better understanding of the modified ketogenic diet's influence at the molecular level may be the key to unraveling the mechanisms by which the diet can ameliorate seizures and possibly to identifying novel therapeutic targets for epilepsy.Â© 2022 The Authors.

Moreover, sensation-seeking, or biological correlates of sensation-seeking, are suggested as factors linking victimization to delinquency. Here, we focused on epigenetic correlates of sensation-seeking. First, we identified DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns related to sensation-seeking. Second, we investigated the association between sensation-seeking related DNAm and the development of delinquency. Third, we examined whether victimization was related to sensation-seeking related DNAm and the development of delinquency. Participants (N= 905; 49% boys) came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. DNAm was assessed at birth, age 7 and age 15-17. Sensation-seeking (self-reports) was assessed at age 11 and 14. Delinquency (self-reports) was assessed at age 17-19. Sensation-seeking epigenome-wide association study revealed that no probes reached the critical significance level. However, 20 differential methylated probes reached marginal significance. With these 20 suggestive sites, a sensation-seeking cumulative DNAm risk score was created. Results showed that this DNAm risk score at age 15-17 was related to delinquency at age 17-19. Moreover, an indirect effect of victimization to delinquency via DNAm was found. Sensation-seeking related DNAm is a potential biological correlate that can help to understand the development of delinquency, including how victimization might be associated with adolescent delinquency.",

Some exposures such as smoking are readily observed and have high personal recall; others are more indirect or sporadic and might only be inferred from long occupational histories or lifestyles. We evaluated the utility of using lifetime-long self-reported exposures for identifying differential methylation in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases-control cohort of 855 individuals. Individuals submitted paper-based surveys on exposure and occupational histories as well as whole blood samples. Genome-wide DNA methylation levels were quantified using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 array. We analyzed 15 environmental exposures using the OSCA software linear and MOA models, where we regressed exposures individually by methylation adjusted for batch effects and disease status as well as predicted scores for age, sex, cell count, and smoking status. We also regressed on the first principal components on clustered environmental exposures to detect DNA methylation changes associated with a more generalised definition of environmental exposure. Five DNA methylation probes across three environmental exposures (cadmium, mercury and metalwork) were significantly associated using the MOA models and seven through the linear models, with one additionally across a principal component representing chemical exposures. Methylome-wide significance for four of these markers was driven by extreme hyper/hypo-methylation in small numbers of individuals. The results indicate the potential for using self-reported exposure histories in detecting DNA methylation changes in response to the environment, but also highlight the confounded nature of environmental exposure in cohort studies.Â© 2022.

PDB has a complex etiology and both genetics and environmental factors have been implicated. A recent study has identified many differentially methylated loci in PDB compared to healthy subjects. However, associations between DNA methylation profiles and disease severity of PDB have not been investigated.Objectives:To investigate the association between DNA methylation signals and PDB severity.Methods:Using 232 well-characterized PDB subjects from the PRISM trial, a disease severity score was devised based on the clinical features of PDB. DNA methylation profiling was performed using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450K array.Results:We identified 100 CpG methylation sites significantly associated with PDB severity at FDR <0.05. Additionally, methylation profiles in 11 regions showed Bonferroni-significant association with disease severity including six islands (located inVCL,TBX5,CASZ1,ULBP2,NUDT15andSQSTM1), two gene bodies (CXCR6andDENND1A), and 3 promoter regions (RPL27,LINC00301andVPS29). Moreover, FDR-significant effects from region analysis implicated genes with genetic variants previously associated with PDB severity, includingRIN3andCSF1. A multivariate predictor model featuring the top severity-associated CpG sites revealed a significant correlation (R = 0.71,p= 6.9 Ã— 10-16) between observed and predicted PDB severity scores. On dichotomizing the severity scores into low and high severity, the model featured an area under curve (AUC) of 0.80, a sensitivity of 0.74 and a specificity of 0.68.Conclusion:We identified several CpG methylation markers that are associated with PDB severity in this pioneering study while also highlighting the novel molecular pathways associated with disease progression.

DNA methylation is known to play an important role in the regulation of the immune processes behind COVID-19 progression, however it has not been studied in depth. In this study, we aim to evaluate the implication of DNA methylation in COVID-19 progression by means of a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis combined with DNA genotyping. The results reveal the existence of epigenomic regulation of functional pathways associated with COVID-19 progression and mediated by genetic loci. We find an environmental trait-related signature that discriminates mild from severe cases and regulates, among other cytokines, IL-6 expression via the transcription factor CEBP. The analyses suggest that an interaction between environmental contribution, genetics, and epigenetics might be playing a role in triggering the cytokine storm described in the most severe cases.Â© 2022.

To effectively prevent and reduce health risks related to SEP, it is critical to better understand when and under what circumstances socioeconomic adversity shapes biological processes. DNA methylation (DNAm) is one such mechanism for how early life adversity 'gets under the skin'. In this study, we evaluated the dynamic relationship between SEP and DNAm across childhood using data from 946 mother-child pairs in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We assessed six SEP indicators spanning financial, occupational, and residential domains during very-early childhood (ages 0-2), early childhood (ages 3-5), and middle childhood (ages 6-7). Epigenome-wide DNAm were measured at 412956 CpGs from peripheral blood at age 7. Using an innovative two-stage structured life course modeling approach, we tested three life-course hypotheses for how SEP shapes DNAm profiles-accumulation, sensitive period, and mobility. We showed that changes in the socioeconomic environment were associated with the greatest differences in DNAm, and that middle childhood may be a potential sensitive period when socioeconomic instability is especially important in shaping DNAm. Top SEP-related DNAm CpGs were overrepresented in genes involved in pathways important for neural development, immune function, and metabolic processes. Our findings highlight the importance of socioeconomic stability during childhood and if replicated, may emphasize the need for public programs to help children and families experiencing socioeconomic instability and other forms of socioeconomic adversity.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

However, visceral fat (VF) mass accumulation is a greater risk factor for metabolic disease than BMI alone. In this study, we dissect the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) methylome signature relevant to metabolic health by focusing on VF as the major risk factor of metabolic disease. We integrate results with genetic, blood methylation, SAT gene expression, blood metabolomic, dietary intake and metabolic phenotype data to assess and quantify genetic and environmental drivers of the identified signals, as well as their potential functional roles.Epigenome-wide association analyses were carried out to determine visceral fat mass-associated differentially methylated positions (VF-DMPs) in SAT samples from 538 TwinsUK participants. Validation and replication were performed in 333 individuals from 3 independent cohorts. To assess functional impacts of the VF-DMPs, the association between VF and gene expression was determined at the genes annotated to the VF-DMPs and an association analysis was carried out to determine whether methylation at the VF-DMPs is associated with gene expression. Further epigenetic analyses were carried out to compare methylation levels at the VF-DMPs as the response variables and a range of different metabolic health phenotypes including android:gynoid fat ratio (AGR), lipids, blood metabolomic profiles, insulin resistance, T2D and dietary intake variables. The results from all analyses were integrated to identify signals that exhibit altered SAT function and have strong relevance to metabolic health.We identified 1181 CpG positions in 788 genes to be differentially methylated with VF (VF-DMPs) with significant enrichment in the insulin signalling pathway. Follow-up cross-omic analysis of VF-DMPs integrating genetics, gene expression, metabolomics, diet, and metabolic traits highlighted VF-DMPs located in 9 genes with strong relevance to metabolic disease mechanisms, with replication of signals in FASN, SREBF1, TAGLN2, PC and CFAP410. PC methylation showed evidence for mediating effects of diet on VF. FASN DNA methylation exhibited putative causal effects on VF that were also strongly associated with insulin resistance and methylation levels in FASN better classified insulin resistance (AUC=0.91) than BMI or VF alone.Our findings help characterise the adiposity-associated methylation signature of SAT, with insights for metabolic disease risk.Â© 2022.

Models were adjusted for mother's age, ethnicity, and education level as well as cell-type fractions and then for maternal health behaviours and neonate characteristics, and last, stratified by mother's ethnicity. P-values were corrected for multiple testing and a permutation-based approach was used to account for small cell sizes. Among all children, housing tenure (owning versus renting) as well as father's occupation (manual versus non-manual) were each associated with DNAm of one CpG site and index of multiple deprivation (IMD) was associated with DNAm of 11 CpG sites. Among children born to White British mothers, father's occupation (student or unemployed versus non-manual) was associated with DNAm of 1 CpG site and IMD with DNAm of 3 CpG sites. Among children born to Pakistani mothers, IMD was associated with DNAm of 1 CpG site.

In analyses stratified by self-reported race/ethnicity, the mediation effect was only significant in Latinos, explaining ~â€‰41% of the total effect of rs78396808 on ALL risk (ACME Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0037). Conditional analyses confirmed the presence of at least three independent genetic risk loci for childhood ALL at IKZF1, with rs78396808 unique to non-European populations. We also demonstrated that the most significant DMP in the EWAS, CpG cg13344587 at gene ARID5B (Pâ€‰=â€‰8.61x10-10), was entirely confounded by the ARID5B ALL risk SNP rs7090445. Our findings provide new insights into the functional pathways of ALL risk SNPs and the DNA methylation differences associated with risk of childhood ALL.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

Prenatal vitamins do not have a standard formulation, but many contain calcium, folic acid, iodine, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, zinc, and vitamins A, B6, B12, and D, and usually they contain higher concentrations of folic acid and iron than regular multivitamins in the US Nutrient levels can impact epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation, but relationships between maternal prenatal vitamin use and DNA methylation have been relatively understudied. We examined use of prenatal vitamins in the first month of pregnancy in relation to cord blood and placenta DNA methylation in two prospective pregnancy cohorts: the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and Markers of Autism Risk Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) studies.In placenta, prenatal vitamin intake was marginally associated with -0.52% (95% CI -1.04, 0.01) lower mean array-wide DNA methylation in EARLI, and associated with -0.60% (-1.08, -0.13) lower mean array-wide DNA methylation in MARBLES. There was little consistency in the associations between prenatal vitamin intake and single DNA methylation site effect estimates across cohorts and tissues, with only a few overlapping sites with correlated effect estimates. However, the single DNA methylation sites with p-valueâ€‰<â€‰0.01 (EARLI cord nCpGsâ€‰=â€‰4068, EARLI placenta nCpGsâ€‰=â€‰3647, MARBLES cord nCpGsâ€‰=â€‰4068, MARBLES placenta nCpGsâ€‰=â€‰9563) were consistently enriched in neuronal developmental pathways.Together, our findings suggest that prenatal vitamin intake in the first month of pregnancy may be related to lower placental global DNA methylation and related to DNA methylation in brain-related pathways in both placenta and cord blood.Â© 2022.

No,20220815,imprinting,35787786,Genome-wide detection of imprinted differentially methylated regions using nanopore sequencing.,Elife,"Imprinting is a critical part of normal embryonic development in mammals, controlled by defined parent-of-origin (PofO) differentially methylated regions (DMRs) known as imprinting control regions. Direct nanopore sequencing of DNA provides a means to detect allelic methylation and to overcome the drawbacks of methylation array and short-read technologies. Here, we used publicly available nanopore sequencing data for 12 standard B-lymphocyte cell lines to acquire the genome-wide mapping of imprinted intervals in humans. Using the sequencing data, we were able to phase 95% of the human methylome and detect 94% of the previously well-characterized, imprinted DMRs. In addition, we found 42 novel imprinted DMRs (16 germline and 26 somatic), which were confirmed using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data. Analysis of WGBS data in mouse (Mus musculus), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) suggested that 17 of these imprinted DMRs are conserved. Some of the novel imprinted intervals are within or close to imprinted genes without a known DMR. We also detected subtle parental methylation bias, spanning several kilobases at seven known imprinted clusters. At these blocks, hypermethylation occurs at the gene body of expressed allele(s) with mutually exclusive H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 allelic histone marks. These results expand upon our current knowledge of imprinting and the potential of nanopore sequencing to identify imprinting regions using only parent-offspring trios, as opposed to the large multi-generational pedigrees that have previously been required.Â© 2022, Akbari et al.",
No,20220815,imprinting,35786392,Genomic map of candidate human imprint control regions: the imprintome.,Epigenetics,"Imprinted genes - critical for growth, metabolism, and neuronal function - are expressed from one parental allele. Parent-of-origin-dependent CpG methylation regulates this expression at imprint control regions (ICRs). Since ICRs are established before tissue specification, these methylation marks are similar across cell types. Thus, they are attractive for investigating the developmental origins of adult diseases using accessible tissues, but remain unknown. We determined genome-wide candidate ICRs in humans by performing whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) of DNA derived from the three germ layers and from gametes. We identified 1,488 hemi-methylated candidate ICRs, including 19 of 25 previously characterized ICRs (https://humanicr.org/). Gamete methylation approached 0% or 100% in 332 ICRs (178 paternally and 154 maternally methylated), supporting parent-of-origin-specific methylation, and 65% were in well-described CTCF-binding or DNaseI hypersensitive regions. This draft of the human imprintome will allow for the systematic determination of the role of early-acquired imprinting dysregulation in the pathogenesis of human diseases and developmental and behavioural disorders.",
No,20220815,mediation,35708873,"Alcohol consumption, blood DNA methylation and breast cancer: a Mendelian randomisation study.",Eur J Epidemiol,"Alcohol intake is thought to be a risk factor for breast cancer, but the causal relationship and carcinogenic mechanisms are not clear. We performed an up-to-date meta-analysis of prospective studies to assess observational association, and then conducted MR analysis to make causal inference based on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption (""drinks per week"") and pathological drinking behaviours (""alcohol use disorder"" and ""problematic alcohol use""), as well as genetically predicted DNA methylation at by alcohol-related CpG sites in blood. We found an observational dose-response association between alcohol intake and breast cancer incidence with an additional risk of 4% for per 10Â g/day increase in alcohol consumption. Genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption (""drinks per week"") was not causally associated with breast cancer incidence at the OR of 1.01 (95% CI 0.84, 1.23), but problematic alcohol use (PAU) was linked to a higher breast cancer risk at the OR of 1.76 (95% CI 1.04, 2.99) when conditioning on alcohol consumption. Epigenetic MR analysis identified four CpG sites, cg03260624 near CDC7 gene, cg10816169 near ZNF318 gene, cg03345232 near RIN3 gene, and cg26312998 near RP11-867G23.13 gene, where genetically predicted epigenetic modifications were associated with an increased breast cancer incidence risk. Our findings re-affirmed that alcohol consumption is of high risk for breast cancer incidence even at a very low dose, and the pathogenic effect of alcohol on breast cancer could be due to pathological drinking behaviour and epigenetic modification at several CpG sites, which could be potential intervention targets for breast cancer prevention.Â© 2022.

No,20220815,methods,35914392,Examining the epigenetic mechanisms of childhood adversity and sensitive periods: A gene set-based approach.,Psychoneuroendocrinology,"Sensitive periods are developmental stages of heightened plasticity when life experiences, including exposure to childhood adversity, have the potential to exert more lasting impacts. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm), may provide a pathway through which adversity induces long-term biological changes. DNAm shifts may be more likely to occur during sensitive periods, especially within genes that regulate the timing of sensitive periods. Here, we investigated the possibility that childhood adversity during specific life stages is associated with DNAm changes in genes known to regulate the timing and duration of sensitive periods.Genome-wide DNAm profiles came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (n = 785). We first used principal component analysis (PCA) to summarize DNAm variation across 530 CpG sites mapped to the promoters of 58 genes previously-identified as regulating sensitive periods. Gene-level DNAm summaries were calculated for genes regulating sensitive period opening (ngenes= 15), closing (ngenes= 36), and expression (ngenes= 8). We then performed linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to test associations between seven types of parent-reported, time-varying measures of exposure to childhood adversity and DNAm principal components. To our knowledge, this is the first time LDA has been applied to analyze functionally grouped DNAm data to characterize associations between an environmental exposure and epigenetic differences.Suggestive evidence emerged for associations between sexual or physical abuse as well as financial hardship during middle childhood, and DNAm of genetic pathways regulating sensitive period opening and expression. However, no statistically significant associations were identified after multiple testing correction.Our gene set-based method combining PCA and LDA complements epigenome-wide approaches. Although our results were largely null, these findings provide a proof-of-concept for studying time-varying exposures and gene- or pathway-level epigenetic modifications.Copyright Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

No,20220815,methods,35870905,EpiVisR: exploratory data analysis and visualization in epigenome-wide association analyses.,BMC Bioinformatics,"With the widespread availability of microarray technology for epigenetic research, methods for calling differentially methylated probes or differentially methylated regions have become effective tools to analyze this type of data. Furthermore, visualization is usually employed for quality check of results and for further insights. Expert knowledge is required to leverage capabilities of these methods. To overcome this limitation and make visualization in epigenetic research available to the public, we designed EpiVisR.The EpiVisR tool allows to select and visualize combinations of traits (i.e., concentrations of chemical compounds) and differentially methylated probes/regions. It supports various modes of enriched presentation to get the most knowledge out of existing data: (1) enriched Manhattan plot and enriched volcano plot for selection of probes, (2) trait-methylation plot for visualization of selected trait values against methylation values, (3) methylation profile plot for visualization of a selected range of probes against selected trait values as well as, (4) correlation profile plot for selection and visualization of further probes that are correlated to the selected probe. EpiVisR additionally allows exporting selected data to external tools for tasks such as network analysis.The key advantage of EpiVisR is the annotation of data in the enriched plots (and tied tables) as well as linking to external data sources for further integrated data analysis. Using the EpiVisR approach will allow users to integrate data from traits with epigenetic analyses that are connected by belonging to the same individuals. Merging data from various data sources among the same cohort and visualizing them will enable users to gain more insights from existing data.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",
No,20220815,methods,35765087,Low reliability of DNA methylation across Illumina Infinium platforms in cord blood: implications for replication studies and meta-analyses of prenatal exposures.,Clin Epigenetics,"There is an increasing interest in the role of epigenetics in epidemiology, but the emerging research field faces several critical biological and technical challenges. In particular, recent studies have shown poor correlation of measured DNA methylation (DNAm) levels within and across Illumina Infinium platforms in various tissues. In this study, we have investigated concordance between 450Â k and EPIC Infinium platforms in cord blood. We could not replicate our previous findings on the association of prenatal paracetamol exposure with cord blood DNAm, which prompted an investigation of cross-platform DNAm differences.This study is based on two DNAm data sets from cord blood samples selected from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). DNAm of one data set was measured using the 450Â k platformÂ and the other data set was measured using the EPIC platform. Initial analyses of the EPIC data could not replicate any of our previous significant findings in the 450Â k data on associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and cord blood DNAm. A subset of the samples (nâ€‰=â€‰17) was included in both data sets, which enabled analyses of technical sources potentially contributing to the negative replication. Analyses of these 17 samples with repeated measurements revealed high per-sample correlations ([Formula: see text]â€‰0.99), but low per-CpG correlations ([Formula: see text]â€‰â‰ˆâ€‰0.24) between the platforms. 1.7% of the CpGs exhibited a mean DNAm difference across platforms >â€‰0.1. Furthermore, only 26.7% of the CpGs exhibited a moderate or better cross-platform reliability (intra-class correlation coefficient â‰¥â€‰0.5).The observations of low cross-platform probe correlation and reliability corroborate previous reports in other tissues. Our study cannot determine the origin of the differences between platforms. Nevertheless, it emulates the setting in studies using data from multiple Infinium platforms, often analysed several years apart. Therefore, the findings may have important implications for future epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs), in replication, meta-analyses and longitudinal studies. Cognisance and transparency of the challenges related to cross-platform studies may enhance the interpretation, replicability and validity of EWAS results both in cord blood and other tissues, ultimately improving the clinical relevance of epigenetic epidemiology.Â© 2022.

These data, as well as nearly all high-throughput 'omic' data, are influenced by technical and biological factors unknown to the researcher, which, if unaccounted for, can severely obfuscate estimation of and inference on the effects of interest. We therefore developed CBCV and CorrConf: provably accurate and computationally efficient methods to choose the number of and estimate latent confounding factors present in high dimensional data with correlated or nonexchangeable residuals.

Analysis of DNA methylation profiles has been shown to be a reliable method to classify central nervous system (CNS) tumours with high accuracy. We aimed to prospectively analyse CNS tumours diagnosed in Sweden, to assess the clinical impact of adding DNA methylation-based classification to standard paediatric brain tumour diagnostics in an unselected cohort.All CNS tumours diagnosed in children (0-18â€‰years) during 2017-2020 were eligible for inclusion provided sufficient tumour material was available. Tumours were analysed using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and classified by the MNP brain tumour classifier. The initial histopathological diagnosis was compared with the DNA methylation-based classification. For incongruent results, a blinded re-evaluation was performed by an experienced neuropathologist.Two hundred forty tumours with a histopathology-based diagnosis were profiled. A high-confidence methylation score of 0.84 or more was reached in 78% of the cases. In 69%, the histopathological diagnosis was confirmed, and for some of these also refined, 6% were incongruent, and the re-evaluation favoured the methylation-based classification. In the remaining 3% of cases, the methylation class was non-contributory. The change in diagnosis would have had a direct impact on the clinical management in 5% of all patients.Integrating DNA methylation-based tumour classification into routine clinical analysis improves diagnostics and provides molecular information that is important for treatment decisions. The results from methylation profiling should be interpreted in the context of clinical and histopathological information.Â© 2022 The Authors.

Liquid biopsies have been proposed as a novel method for the early detection of cancer, but low cell-free DNA tumor fraction might pose a problem for the use in population screening. Using breast cancer microsimulation model MISCAN-Fadia, we estimated the outcomes of using liquid biopsies in breast cancer screening in women aged 50 to 74 in the United States. For varying combinations of test sensitivity and specificity, we quantify the impact of the use of liquid biopsies on the harms and benefits of screening, and we estimate the maximum liquid biopsy price for cost-effective implementation in breast cancer screening at a cost-effectiveness threshold of USD 50,000. We investigate under what conditions liquid biopsies could be a suitable alternative to digital mammography and compare these conditions to a CCGA substudy. Outcomes were compared to digital mammography screening, and include mortality reduction, overdiagnoses, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the maximum price of a liquid biopsy for cost-effective implementation. When liquid biopsies are unable to detect DCIS, a large proportion of overdiagnosed cases is prevented but overall breast cancer mortality reduction and quality of life are lower, and costs are higher compared to digital mammography screening. Liquid biopsies prices should be restricted to USD 187 per liquid biopsy depending on test performance. Overall, liquid biopsies that are unable to detect ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) need to be able to detect small, early-stage tumors, with high specificity, at low costs in order to be an alternative to digital mammography. Liquid biopsies might be more suitable as an addition to digital mammography than as an alternative.",

However, owing to past emphasis on targeted and low-resolution profiling approaches, our understanding of the distinct populations that comprise bulk ctDNA is incomplete2-12. Here we perform deep whole-genome sequencing of serial plasma and synchronous metastases in patients with aggressive prostate cancer. We comprehensively assess all classes of genomic alterations and show that ctDNA contains multiple dominant populations, the evolutionary histories of which frequently indicate whole-genome doubling and shifts in mutational processes. Although tissue and ctDNA showed concordant clonally expanded cancer driver alterations, most individual metastases contributed only a minor share of total ctDNA. By comparing serial ctDNA before and after clinical progression on potent inhibitors of the androgen receptor (AR) pathway, we reveal population restructuring converging solely on AR augmentation as the dominant genomic driver of acquired treatment resistance. Finally, we leverage nucleosome footprints in ctDNA to infer mRNA expression in synchronously biopsied metastases, including treatment-induced changes in AR transcription factor signalling activity. Our results provide insights into cancer biology and show that liquid biopsy can be used as a tool for comprehensive multi-omic discovery.Â© 2022.

However, existing resources are often inaccessible, infeasible or inappropriate for biologists because they require significant computational and mathematical knowledge, demand an unrealistic time-investment or teach skills primarily for computational researchers. We created the Machine Learning for Biologists (ML4Bio) workshop, a short, intensive workshop that empowers biological researchers to comprehend machine learning applications and pursue machine learning collaborations in their own research. The ML4Bio workshop focuses on classification and was designed around three principles: (i) emphasizing preparedness over fluency or expertise, (ii) necessitating minimal coding and mathematical background and (iii) requiring low time investment. It incorporates active learning methods and custom open-source software that allows participants to explore machine learning workflows. After multiple sessions to improve workshop design, we performed a study on three workshop sessions. Despite some confusion around identifying subtle methodological flaws in machine learning workflows, participants generally reported that the workshop met their goals, provided them with valuable skills and knowledge and greatly increased their beliefs that they could engage in research that uses machine learning.

Particularly, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma or serum has been utilized for minimally invasive molecular diagnostics. Disease onset or pathological conditions that lead to increased cell death alter the contribution of different tissues to the total pool of cfDNA. Because cfDNA molecules retain cell-type specific epigenetic features, it is possible to infer tissue-of-origin from epigenetic characteristics. Recent research efforts demonstrated that analysis of, e.g., methylation patterns, nucleosome occupancy, and fragmentomics determined the cell- or tissue-of-origin of individual cfDNA molecules. This novel tissue-of origin-analysis enables to estimate the contributions of different tissues to the total cfDNA pool in body fluids and find tissues with increased cell death (pathologic condition), expanding the portfolio of liquid biopsies towards a wide range of pathologies and early diagnosis.

Here we use machine learning to model megabase-scale mutation burden in 2,500 whole cancer genomes and 17 cancer types via a compendium of 900 CA and RT profiles covering primary cancers, normal tissues, and cell lines. CA profiles of primary cancers, rather than those of normal tissues, are most predictive of regional mutagenesis in most cancer types. Feature prioritisation shows that the epigenomes of matching cancer types and organ systems are often the strongest predictors of regional mutation burden, highlighting disease-specific associations of mutational processes. The genomic distributions of mutational signatures are also shaped by the epigenomes of matched cancer and tissue types, with SBS5/40, carcinogenic and unknown signatures most accurately predicted by our models. In contrast, fewer associations of RT and regional mutagenesis are found. Lastly, the models highlight genomic regions with overrepresented mutations that dramatically exceed epigenome-derived expectations and show a pan-cancer convergence to genes and pathways involved in development and oncogenesis, indicating the potential of this approach for coding and non-coding driver discovery. The association of regional mutational processes with the epigenomes of primary cancers suggests that the landscape of passenger mutations is predominantly shaped by the epigenomes of cancer cells after oncogenic transformation.",

Here we describe a method for spatially resolved chromatin accessibility profiling of tissue sections using next-generation sequencing (spatial-ATAC-seq) by combining in situ Tn5 transposition chemistry6and microfluidic deterministic barcoding5. Profiling mouse embryos using spatial-ATAC-seq delineated tissue-region-specific epigenetic landscapes and identified gene regulators involved in the development of the central nervous system.

Applying spatial-ATAC-seq to tonsil tissue resolved the spatially distinct organization of immune cell types and states in lymphoid follicles and extrafollicular zones.

Dysregulated loci demonstrate strong genetic influence, notably VMP1 (p=1.53Ã—10 -15). Age acceleration is seen in IBD (coefficient 0.94, p<2.2x10 -16). Several immuno-active genes demonstrated highly significant correlations between methylation and gene expression in IBD, in particular OSM: IBD r -0.32, p 3.64Ã—10 -7 vs. non-IBD r -0.14, p=0.77). Multi-omic integration of methylome, genome and transcriptome also implicate specific pathways that associate with immune activation, response and regulation at disease inception. At follow up, a signature of 3 DMPs (TAP1, TESPA1, RPTOR) associated with treatment escalation to biological agents or surgery (hazard ratio of 5.19 (CI:2.14-12.56, logrank p=9.70Ã—10 -4).These data demonstrate consistent epigenetic alterations at diagnosis in European patients with IBD, providing insights into the pathogenetic importance and translational potential of epigenetic mapping in complex disease.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

No,20220905,ewas,36017556,Epigenome-wide association studies of occupational exposure to benzene and formaldehyde.,Epigenetics,"relationship between certain myeloid neoplasms and exposure to benzene or formaldehyde. DNA methylation could underlie benzene- and formaldehyde-induced health outcomes, but data in exposed human populations are limited. We conducted two cross-sectional epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), one in workers exposed to benzene and another in workers exposed to formaldehyde. Using HumanMethylation450 BeadChips, we investigated differences in blood cell DNA methylation among 50 benzene-exposed subjects and 48 controls, and among 31 formaldehyde-exposed subjects and 40 controls. We performed CpG-level and regional-level analyses. In the benzene EWAS, we found genome-wide significant alterations, i.e., FWER-controlledP-values <0.05, in the mean and variance of methylation at 22 and 318 CpG sites, respectively, and in mean methylation of a large genomic region. Pathway analysis of genes corresponding to benzene-associated differential methylation sites revealed an impact on the AMPK signalling pathway. In formaldehyde-exposed subjects compared to controls, 9 CpGs in theDUSP22gene promoter had genome-wide significant decreased methylation variability and a large region of theHOXA5promoter with 44 CpGs was hypomethylated. Our findings suggest that DNA methylation may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases related to benzene and formaldehyde exposure. Aberrant expression and methylation ofHOXA5previously has been shown to be clinically significant in myeloid leukaemias. The tumour suppressor geneDUSP22is a potential biomarker of exposure to formaldehyde, and irregularities have been associated with multiple exposures and diseases.",

Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as an explanation for this association. We examined the association of experiences of trauma with epigenome-wide DNAm among African American mothers (n= 236) and their children aged 3-5 years (n= 232; N = 500), using the Life Events Checklist-5 (LEC) and Traumatic Events Screening Inventory-Parent Report Revised (TESI-PRR). We identified no DNAm sites significantly associated with potentially traumatic experience scores in mothers. One CpG site on theENOX1gene was methylome-wide-significant in children (FDR-corrected q-value = 0.05) from the TESI-PRR. This protein-coding gene is associated with mental illness, including unipolar depression, bipolar, and schizophrenia. Future research should further examine the associations between childhood trauma, DNAm, and health outcomes among this understudied and high-risk group. Findings from such longitudinal research may inform clinical and translational approaches to prevent adverse health outcomes associated with epigenetic changes.",

However, a comprehensive summary and meta-analysis of peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) DNA methylation studies has thus far not been conducted. Here, we systematically reviewed all available literature up to February 2022 and summarized the observations by means of meta-analysis.We conducted a systematic search and critical appraisal of IBD-associated DNA methylation studies in PBL using the biomarker-based cross-sectional studies (BIOCROSS) tool. Subsequently, we performed meta-analyses on the summary statistics obtained from epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) that included patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and/or healthy controls (HC).Altogether, we included 15 studies for systematic review. Critical appraisal revealed large methodological and outcome heterogeneity between studies. Summary statistics were obtained from 4 studies based on a cumulative 552 samples (177 CD, 132 UC and 243 HC). Consistent differential methylation was identified for 256 differentially methylated probes (DMPs; Bonferroni-adjusted p-value â‰¤0.05) when comparing CD with HC and 103 when comparing UC with HC. Comparing IBD (CD + UC) with HC resulted in 224 DMPs. Importantly, several of the previously identified DMPs, such as VMP1/TMEM49/MIR21 and RPS6KA2, were consistently differentially methylated across all studies.Methodological homogenization of IBD epigenetic studies is needed to allow for easier aggregation and independent validation. Nonetheless, we were capable of confirming previous observations. Our results can serve as the basis for future IBD epigenetic biomarker research in PBL.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

Nevertheless, the applications of ctDNA to the early detection and screening of cancer remain highly challenging due to the scarcity of cancer cell-specific ctDNA, the low signal-to-noise ratio of DNA variation, and the lack of non-locus-specific DNA methylation technologies.We enrolled three cohorts of breast cancer (BC) patients from two hospitals in China (BC: nÂ =Â 123; healthy controls: nÂ =Â 40). We developed a ctDNA whole-genome bisulfite sequencing technology employing robust trace ctDNA capture from up to 200 Î¼L plasma, mini-input (1Â ng) library preparation, unbiased genome-wide coverage and comprehensive computational methods.A diagnostic signature comprising 15 ctDNA methylation markers exhibited high accuracy in the early (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.967) and advanced (AUC of 0.971) BC stages in multicentre patient cohorts. Furthermore, we revealed a ctDNA methylation signature that discriminates estrogen receptor status (Training set: AUC of 0.984 and Test set: AUC of 0.780). Different cancer types, including hepatocellular carcinoma and lung cancer, could also be well distinguished.Our study provides a toolset to generate unbiased whole-genome ctDNA methylomes with a minimal amount of plasma to develop highly specific and sensitive biomarkers for the early diagnosis and molecular subtyping of cancer.Â© 2022 The Authors.

To explore the role of DNA methylation changes in PD and DLB pathogenesis, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of 322 postmortem frontal cortex samples and replicated results in an independent set of 200 donors. We report novel differentially methylated replicating loci associated with Braak Lewy body stage near TMCC2, SFMBT2, AKAP6 and PHYHIP. Differentially methylated probes were independent of known PD genetic risk alleles. Meta-analysis provided suggestive evidence for a differentially methylated locus within the chromosomal region affected by the PD-associated 22q11.2 deletion. Our findings elucidate novel disease pathways in PD and DLB and generate hypotheses for future molecular studies of Lewy body pathology.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

By studying the epigenetic profile in pre-diagnostic blood samples of melanoma cases and cancer free controls, we aimed to identify DNA methylation sites conferring melanoma risk. DNA methylation was measured at 775,528 CpG sites using the Illumina EPIC array in whole blood in incident melanoma cases (nâ€‰=â€‰183) and matched cancer-free controls (nâ€‰=â€‰183) in the Norwegian Women and Cancer cohort. Phenotypic information and ultraviolet radiation exposure were obtained from questionnaires. Epigenome wide association (EWAS) was analyzed in future melanoma cases and controls with conditional logistic regression, with correction for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR). We extended the analysis by including a public data set on melanoma (GSE120878), and combining these different data sets using a version of covariate modulated FDR (AdaPT). The analysis on future melanoma cases and controls did not identify any genome wide significant CpG sites (0.85â€‰â‰¤â€‰padjâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.99). In the restricted AdaPT analysis, 7 CpG sites were suggestive at the FDR level of 0.15. These CpG sites may potentially be used as pre-diagnostic biomarkers of melanoma risk.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Epigenetic regulation plays a key role in infection and inflammation. To reveal the epigenetic relationships between sCD14, immune function and disease progression among PWH, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of sCD14 and investigated the relationship with mortality.DNA methylation (DNAm) levels of peripheral blood samples from PWH in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) were measured using the Illumina Infinium Methylation 450K (nâ€Š=â€Š549) and EPIC (850K) BeadChip (nâ€Š=â€Š526). Adjusted for covariates and multiple testing, we conducted an epigenome-wide discovery, replication, and meta-analysis to identify significant associations with sCD14. We then examined and replicated the relationship between the principal epigenetic sites and survival using Cox regression models.We identified 118 DNAm sites significantly associated with sCD14 in the meta-analysis of 1075 PWH. The principal associated DNAm sites mapped to genes (e.g. STAT1, PARP9, IFITM1, MX1, and IFIT1) related to inflammation and antiviral response. Adjusting for multiple testing, 10 of 118 sCD14-associated DNAm sites significantly predicted survival time conditional on sCD14 levels.The identification of DNAm sites independently predicting survival may improve our understanding of prognosis and potential therapeutic targets among PWH.Copyright Â© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

It is proposed that early nutrition may affect neurodevelopmental pathways by altering gene expression through epigenetic modification. Variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) is a commonly studied epigenetic modification.To assess whether early MM intake by VLBW infants is associated with variations in DNAm at 5.5 years, and whether these variations correlate with neurodevelopmental phenotypes.This cohort study was a 5.5-year follow-up (2016-2018) of VLBW infants born in Ontario, Canada who participated in the Donor Milk for Improved Neurodevelopmental Outcomes trial. We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to test whether % MM (not including supplemental donor milk) during hospitalization was associated with DNAm in buccal cells during early childhood (5.7Â Â±Â 0.2 years, nÂ =Â 143; birth weight of 1008Â Â±Â 517 grams). DNAm was assessed with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array at 814,583 CpGs. In secondary analyses, we tested associations between top-ranked CpGs and measures of early childhood neurodevelopment, e.g., total surface area of the cerebral cortex (nÂ =Â 41, magnetic resonance imaging) and Full-Scale IQ (nÂ =Â 133, Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-IV).EWAS analysis demonstrated % MM intake by VLBW infants during hospitalization was associated with DNAm at 2 CpGs, cg03744440 (MYO15B) and cg00851389 (MT1A) at 5.5 years (PÂ <Â 9E-08). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis indicated that top-ranked CpGs (PÂ <Â 0.001) were annotated to genes enriched in neurodevelopmental biological processes. Corroborating these findings, DNAm at several top identified CpGs from EWAS was associated with cortical surface area and IQ at 5.5 years (PÂ <Â 0.05).In-hospital % MM intake by VLBW infants was associated with variations in DNAm of neurodevelopmental genes at 5.5 years; some of these DNAm variations are associated with brain structure and IQ.

In the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE TM) human trial we evaluated associations of CR and changes in whole-blood DNAm.CALERIE TM randomized 220 healthy, non-obese adults in a 2:1 allocation to two years of CR or ad libitum (AL) diet. The average CR in the treatment group through 24-months of follow-up was 12%. Whole blood (baseline, 12 and 24 month) DNAm profiles were measured. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) analysis tested CR-induced changes from baseline to 12- and 24-months in the n=197 participants with available DNAm data.CR treatment was not associated with epigenome-wide significant (FDR<0.05) DNAm changes at the individual-CpG-site level. Secondary analysis of sets of CpG sites identified in published EWAS revealed that CR induced DNAm changes opposite to those associated with higher body mass index and cigarette smoking (p<0.003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups). In contrast, CR altered DNAm at chronological-age associated CpG sites in the direction of older age (p<0.003 at 12- and 24-month follow-ups).Although individual CpG site DNAm changes in response to CR were not identified, analyses of sets CpGs identified in prior EWAS revealed CR-induced changes to blood DNAm. Altered CpG sets were enriched for insulin-production, glucose-tolerance, inflammation, and DNA-binding and -regulation pathways, several of which are known to be modified by CR. DNAm changes may contribute to CR effects on aging.Â© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.",

Our study aimed to estimate DNAm trajectories of CpG sites associated with T2D, epigenetic age (DNAmAge), and age acceleration based on four epigenetic clocks (GrimAge, Hannum, Horvath, phenoAge) in the period 10Â years prior to and up to T2D onset. In this nested case-control study within Doetinchem Cohort Study, we included 132 incident T2D cases and 132 age- and sex-matched controls. DNAm was measured in blood using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC array. From 107 CpG sites associated with T2D, 10 CpG sites (9%) showed different slopes of DNAm trajectories over time (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) and an additional 8 CpG sites (8%) showed significant differences in DNAm levels (at least 1%, p-value per time pointâ€‰<â€‰0.05) at all three time points with nearly parallel trajectories between incident T2D cases and controls. In controls, age acceleration levels were negative (slower epigenetic aging), while in incident T2D cases, levels were positive, suggesting accelerated aging in the case group. We showed that DNAm levels at specific CpG sites, up to 10Â years before T2D onset, are different between incident T2D cases and healthy controls and distinct patterns of clinical traits over time may have an impact on those DNAm profiles. Up to 10Â years before T2D diagnosis, cases manifested accelerated epigenetic aging. Markers of biological aging including age acceleration estimates based on Horvath need further investigation to assess their utility for predicting age-related diseases including T2D.Â© 2022.

This phenomenon mediates, at least in part, the beneficial off-target effects of the BCG vaccine. Using an in vitro model of trained immunity, we show that BCG exposure induces a persistent change in active histone modifications, DNA methylation, transcription, and adenosine-to-inosine RNA modification in human monocytes. By profiling DNA methylation of circulating monocytes from infants in the MIS BAIR clinical trial, we identify a BCG-associated DNA methylation signature that persisted more than 12 months after neonatal BCG vaccination. Genes associated with this epigenetic signature are involved in viral response pathways, consistent with the reported off-target protection against viral infections in neonates, adults, and the elderly. Our findings indicate that the off-target effects of BCG in infants are accompanied by epigenetic remodeling of circulating monocytes that lasts more than 1 year.",

However, statistical inference for causal mediation effects is challenged by the fact that one needs to test a large number of composite null hypotheses across the whole epigenome. Two popular tests, the Wald-type Sobel's test and the joint significant test using the traditional null distribution are underpowered and thus can miss important scientific discoveries. In this paper, we show that the null distribution of Sobel's test is not the standard normal distribution and the null distribution of the joint significant test is not uniform under the composite null of no mediation effect, especially in finite samples and under the singular point null case that the exposure has no effect on the mediator and the mediator has no effect on the outcome. Our results explain why these two tests are underpowered, and more importantly motivate us to develop a more powerful Divide-Aggregate Composite-null Test (DACT) for the composite null hypothesis of no mediation effect by leveraging epigenome-wide data. We adopted Efron's empirical null framework for assessing statistical significance of the DACT test. We showed analytically that the proposed DACT method had improved power, and could well control type I error rate. Our extensive simulation studies showed that, in finite samples, the DACT method properly controlled the type I error rate and outperformed Sobel's test and the joint significance test for detecting mediation effects. We applied the DACT method to the US Department of Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study which included men who were aged 21 to 80 years at entry. We identified multiple DNA methylation CpG sites that might mediate the effect of smoking on lung function with effect sizes ranging from -0.18 to -0.79 and false discovery rate controlled at level 0.05, including the CpG sites in the genes AHRR and F2RL3. Our sensitivity analysis found small residual correlations (less than 0.01) of the error terms between the outcome and mediator regressions, suggesting that our results are robust to unmeasured confounding factors.",

We examined the genome-wide false positive (GFP) rates of five widely used DMR methods: comb-p, Bumphunter, DMRcate, mCSEA and coMethDMR using both Illumina HumanMethylation450 (450Â K) and MethylationEPIC (EPIC) data and simulated continuous and dichotomous null phenotypes (i.e., generated independently of methylation data). coMethDMR provided well-controlled GFP rates (~5%) except when analysing skewed continuous phenotypes. DMRcate generally had well-controlled GFP rates when applied to 450Â K data except for the skewed continuous phenotype and EPIC data only for the normally distributed continuous phenotype. GFP rates for mCSEA were at least 0.096 and comb-p yielded GFP rates above 0.34. Bumphunter had high GFP rates of at least 0.35 across conditions, reaching as high as 0.95. Analysis of the performance of these methods in specific regions of the genome found that regions with higher correlation across loci had higher regional false positive rates on average across methods. Based on the false positive rates, coMethDMR is the most recommended analysis method, and DMRcate had acceptable performance when analysing 450Â K data. However, as both could display higher levels of FPs for skewed continuous distributions, a normalizing transformation of skewed continuous phenotypes is suggested.

This article reviews the current state of statistical methods developed for differential variability analysis focusing on DNAm data.With the advent of high-throughput technologies allowing for highly reliable and cost-effective measurements of DNAm, many epigenome studies have analyzed DNAm levels to uncover biological mechanisms underlying past environmental exposures and subsequent health outcomes. These studies typically focused on detecting sites or regions which differ in their mean DNAm levels among exposure groups. However, more recent studies highlighted the importance of identifying differentially variable sites or regions as biologically relevant features. Currently, the analysis of differentially variable DNAm sites has not yet gained widespread adoption in environmental studies; yet, it is important to examine the effects of environmental exposures on inter-individual epigenetic variability. In this article, we describe six of the most widely used statistical approaches for analyzing differential variability of DNAm levels and provide a discussion of their advantages and current limitations.Â© 2022.

Few studies have explored whether identifying probe subsets based on their biological and statistical properties can maximise predictions whilst minimising array content. Variance component analyses and penalised regression (epigenetic predictors) were used to test the influence of (i) the number of probes considered, (ii) mean probe variability and (iii) methylation QTL status on the variance captured in eighteen traits by blood DNA methylation. Training and test samples comprisedâ€‰â‰¤â€‰4450 andâ€‰â‰¤â€‰2578 unrelated individuals from Generation Scotland, respectively.As the number of probes under consideration decreased, so too did the estimates from variance components and prediction analyses. Methylation QTL status and mean probe variability did not influence variance components. However, relative effect sizes were 15% larger for epigenetic predictors based on probes with known or reported methylation QTLs compared to probes without reported methylation QTLs. Relative effect sizes were 45% larger for predictors based on probes with mean Beta-values between 10 and 90% compared to those based on hypo- or hypermethylated probes (Beta-valueâ€‰â‰¤â€‰10% orâ€‰â‰¥â€‰90%).Arrays with fewer probes could reduce costs, leading to increased sample sizes for analyses.

Therefore, artificial intelligence has been recently used to develop prognostic and predictive models of treatment response (either activity/efficacy or toxicity) to aid in clinical decision making. In this systematic review, we have examined the ability of learning methods to predict response to chemotherapy alone or combined with targeted therapy in mCRC patients by targeting specific narrative publications in Medline up to April 2022 to identify appropriate original scientific articles. After the literature search, 26 original articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in the study. Our results show that all investigations conducted on this field have provided generally promising results in predicting the response to therapy or toxic side-effects. By a meta-analytic approach we found that the overall weighted means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) were 0.90, 95% C.I. 0.80-0.95 and 0.83, 95% C.I. 0.74-0.89 in training and validation sets, respectively, indicating a good classification performance in discriminating response vs. non-response. The calculation of overall HR indicates that learning models have strong ability to predict improved survival. Lastly, the delta-radiomics and the 74 gene signatures were able to discriminate response vs. non-response by correctly identifying up to 99% of mCRC patients who were responders and up to 100% of patients who were non-responders. Specifically, when we evaluated the predictive models with tests reaching 80% sensitivity (SE) and 90% specificity (SP), the delta radiomics showed an SE of 99% and an SP of 94% in the training set and an SE of 85% and SP of 92 in the test set, whereas for the 74 gene signatures the SE was 97.6% and the SP 100% in the training set.",

To address this, we developed a deep learning-based individualised longitudinal survival model using Dynamic-DeepHit-Lite (DDHL) that learns data-driven distribution of time-to-event outcomes. Further refining outputs, we used a reinforcement learning approach (Actor-Critic) for temporal predictive clustering (AC-TPC) to discover groups with similar time-to-event outcomes to support clinical utility. We applied these methods to data from 585 men on AS with longitudinal and comprehensive follow-up (median 4.4 years). Time-dependent C-indices and Brier scores were calculated and compared to Cox regression and landmarking methods. Both Cox and DDHL models including only baseline variables showed comparable C-indices but the DDHL model performance improved with additional follow-up data. With 3 years of data collection and 3 years follow-up the DDHL model had a C-index of 0.79 (Â±0.11) compared to 0.70 (Â±0.15) for landmarking Cox and 0.67 (Â±0.09) for baseline Cox only. Model calibration was good across all models tested. The AC-TPC method further discovered 4 distinct outcome-related temporal clusters with distinct progression trajectories. Those in the lowest risk cluster had negligible progression risk while those in the highest cluster had a 50% risk of progression by 5 years. In summary, we report a novel machine learning approach to inform personalised follow-up during active surveillance which improves predictive power with increasing data input over time.Â© 2022.

No,20220905,ml,35785523,Interpretable Machine Learning Models to Predict the Resistance of Breast Cancer Patients to Doxorubicin from Their microRNA Profiles.,Adv Sci (Weinh),"Doxorubicin is a common treatment for breast cancer. However, not all patients respond to this drug, which sometimes causes life-threatening side effects. Accurately anticipating doxorubicin-resistant patients would therefore permit to spare them this risk while considering alternative treatments without delay. Stratifying patients based on molecular markers in their pretreatment tumors is a promising approach to advance toward this ambitious goal, but single-gene gene markers such as HER2 expression have not shown to be sufficiently predictive. The recent availability of matched doxorubicin-response and diverse molecular profiles across breast cancer patients permits now analysis at a much larger scale. 16 machine learning algorithms and 8 molecular profiles are systematically evaluated on the same cohort of patients. Only 2 of the 128 resulting models are substantially predictive, showing that they can be easily missed by a standard-scale analysis. The best model is classification and regression tree (CART) nonlinearly combining 4 selected miRNA isoforms to predict doxorubicin response (median Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC) and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.56 and 0.80, respectively). By contrast, HER2 expression is significantly less predictive (median MCC and AUC of 0.14 and 0.57, respectively). As the predictive accuracy of this CART model increases with larger training sets, its update with future data should result in even better accuracy.Â© 2022 The Authors.

No,20220905,ml,36010273,Big Data in Laboratory Medicine-FAIR Quality for AI?,Diagnostics (Basel),"Laboratory medicine is a digital science. Every large hospital produces a wealth of data each day-from simple numerical results from, e.g., sodium measurements to highly complex output of ""-omics"" analyses, as well as quality control results and metadata. Processing, connecting, storing, and ordering extensive parts of these individual data requires Big Data techniques. Whereas novel technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning have exciting application for the augmentation of laboratory medicine, the Big Data concept remains fundamental for any sophisticated data analysis in large databases. To make laboratory medicine data optimally usable for clinical and research purposes, they need to be FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. This can be achieved, for example, by automated recording, connection of devices, efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, careful data governance, and modern data security solutions. Enriched with clinical data, laboratory medicine data allow a gain in pathophysiological insights, can improve patient care, or can be used to develop reference intervals for diagnostic purposes. Nevertheless, Big Data in laboratory medicine do not come without challenges: the growing number of analyses and data derived from them is a demanding task to be taken care of. Laboratory medicine experts are and will be needed to drive this development, take an active role in the ongoing digitalization, and provide guidance for their clinical colleagues engaging with the laboratory data in research.",
No,20220905,nanopore,36030244,Epigenetic tumor heterogeneity in the era of single-cell profiling with nanopore sequencing.,Clin Epigenetics,"Nanopore sequencing has brought the technology to the next generation in the science of sequencing. This is achieved through research advancing on: pore efficiency, creating mechanisms to control DNA translocation, enhancing signal-to-noise ratio, and expanding to long-read ranges. Heterogeneity regarding epigenetics would be broad as mutations in the epigenome are sensitive to cause new challenges in cancer research. Epigenetic enzymes which catalyze DNA methylation and histone modification are dysregulated in cancer cells and cause numerous heterogeneous clones to evolve. Detection of this heterogeneity in these clones plays an indispensable role in the treatment of various cancer types. With single-cell profiling, the nanopore sequencing technology could provide a simple sequence at long reads and is expected to be used soon at the bedside or doctor's office. Here, we review the advancements of nanopore sequencing and its use in the detection of epigenetic heterogeneity in cancer.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

While FAP accounts for less than 1% of all CRC cases, loss of APC expression is seen inâ€‰>â€‰80% of non-hereditary CRCs. To better understand molecular mechanisms underlying APC-driven CRC, we performed an epigenome-wide analysis of colon organoids derived from normal-appearing colons of FAP patients versus healthy subjects to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that may precede the onset of CRC.We identified 358 DMRs when comparing colon organoids of FAP patients to those of healthy subjects (FDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05, |mean beta difference|â€‰=â€‰5%). Of these, nearly 50% of DMRs were also differentially methylated in at least one of three CRC tumor and normal adjacent tissue (NAT) cohorts (TCGA-COAD, GSE193535 and ColoCare). Moreover, 27 of the DMRs mapped to CRC genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci. We provide evidence suggesting that some of these DMRs led to significant differences in gene expression of adjacent genes using quantitative PCR. For example, we identified significantly greater expression of five genes: Kazal-type serine peptidase inhibitor domain 1 (KAZALD1, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.032), F-Box and leucine-rich repeat protein 8 (FBXL8, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.036), TRIM31 antisense RNA 1 (TRIM31-AS1, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.036), Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.049) and (Collagen beta (1-0)galactosyltransferase 2 (COLGALT2, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.049). Importantly, both FBXL8 and TRIM31-AS1 were also significantly differentially expressed in TCGA-COAD tumor versus matched NAT, supporting a role for these genes in CRC tumor development.We performed the first DNA methylome-wide analysis of normal colon organoids derived from FAP patients compared to those of healthy subjects. Our results reveal that normal colon organoids from FAP patients exhibit extensive epigenetic differences compared to those of healthy subjects that appear similar to those exhibited in CRC tumor. Our analyses therefore identify DMRs and candidate target genes that are potentially important in CRC tumor development in FAP, with potential implications for non-hereditary CRC.Â© 2022.

No,20220905,mqtl,35969790,Deep learning predicts DNA methylation regulatory variants in the human brain and elucidates the genetics of psychiatric disorders.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"There is growing evidence for the role of DNA methylation (DNAm) quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) in the genetics of complex traits, including psychiatric disorders. However, due to extensive linkage disequilibrium (LD) of the genome, it is challenging to identify causal genetic variations that drive DNAm levels by population-based genetic association studies. This limits the utility of mQTLs for fine-mapping risk loci underlying psychiatric disorders identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we present INTERACT, a deep learning model that integrates convolutional neural networks with transformer, to predict effects of genetic variations on DNAm levels at CpG sites in the human brain. We show that INTERACT-derived DNAm regulatory variants are not confounded by LD, are concentrated in regulatory genomic regions in the human brain, and are convergent with mQTL evidence from genetic association analysis. We further demonstrate that predicted DNAm regulatory variants are enriched for heritability of brain-related traits and improve polygenic risk prediction for schizophrenia across diverse ancestry samples. Finally, we applied predicted DNAm regulatory variants for fine-mapping schizophrenia GWAS risk loci to identify potential novel risk genes. Our study shows the power of a deep learning approach to identify functional regulatory variants that may elucidate the genetic basis of complex traits.",

In this work, we considered the epigenetic analog of PRS, methylation risk scores (MRS), a linear combination of methylation states. We measured methylation across a large cohort (nâ€‰=â€‰831) of diverse samples in the UCLA Health biobank, for which both genetic and complete EHR data are available. We constructed MRS for 607 phenotypes spanning diagnoses, clinical lab tests, and medication prescriptions. When added to a baseline set of predictive features, MRS significantly improved the imputation of 139 outcomes, whereas the PRS improved only 22 (median improvement for methylation 10.74%, 141.52%, and 15.46% in medications, labs, and diagnosis codes, respectively, whereas genotypes only improved the labs at a median increase of 18.42%). We added significant MRS to state-of-the-art EHR imputation methods that leverage the entire set of medical records, and found that including MRS as a medical feature in the algorithm significantly improves EHR imputation in 37% of lab tests examined (median R2increase 47.6%). Finally, we replicated several MRS in multiple external studies of methylation (minimum p-value of 2.72â€‰Ã—â€‰10-7) and replicated 22 of 30 tested MRS internally in two separate cohorts of different ethnicity. Our publicly available results and weights show promise for methylation risk scores as clinical and scientific tools.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

Many existing feature attribution methods are optimized for continuous rather than discrete input patterns and assess individual feature importance in isolation, making them ill-suited for interpreting non-linear interactions in molecular sequences. Building on work in computer vision and natural language processing, we developed an approach based on deep learning - Scrambler networks - wherein the most salient sequence positions are identified with learned input masks. Scramblers learn to predict Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSMs) where unimportant nucleotides or residues are scrambled by raising their entropy. We apply Scramblers to interpret the effects of genetic variants, uncover non-linear interactions between cis-regulatory elements, explain binding specificity for protein-protein interactions, and identify structural determinants ofde novodesigned proteins. We show that Scramblers enable efficient attribution across large datasets and result in high-quality explanations, often outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

Driven by high-throughput sequencing technologies, several promising deep learning methods have been proposed for fusing multi-omics data generated from a large number of samples.In this study, 16 representative deep learning methods are comprehensively evaluated on simulated, single-cell, and cancer multi-omics datasets. For each of the datasets, two tasks are designed: classification and clustering. The classification performance is evaluated by using three benchmarking metrics including accuracy, F1 macro, and F1 weighted. Meanwhile, the clustering performance is evaluated by using four benchmarking metrics including the Jaccard index (JI), C-index, silhouette score, and Davies Bouldin score. For the cancer multi-omics datasets, the methods' strength in capturing the association of multi-omics dimensionality reduction results with survival and clinical annotations is further evaluated. The benchmarking results indicate that moGAT achieves the best classification performance. Meanwhile, efmmdVAE, efVAE, and lfmmdVAE show the most promising performance across all complementary contexts in clustering tasks.Our benchmarking results not only provide a reference for biomedical researchers to choose appropriate deep learning-based multi-omics data fusion methods, but also suggest the future directions for the development of more effective multi-omics data fusion methods.

Based on their subsets we construct a machine learning-based Cognitive Clock that predicts chronological age with a mean absolute error of 8.62 years. Remarkably, epigenetic and phenotypic ages are predicted by Cognitive Clock with an even better accuracy.

However, the results from EWASs have been inconsistent, and longitudinal observations of these associations are scarce. Twin studies provide a valuable tool for epigenetic studies, as they are naturally matched for genetic information. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed and EMBASE for EWASs, and 214, 33, and 117 candidate CpG sites were selected for T2DM, HbA1c and fasting blood glucose (FBG). Based on 1,070 twins from the Chinese National Twin Registry, 67, 17 and 16 CpG sites from previous studies were validated for T2DM, HbA1c and FBG. Longitudinal review and blood sampling for phenotypic information and DNAm were conducted twice in 2013 and 2018 on 308 twins. A cross-lagged analysis was performed to examine the temporal relationship between DNAm and T2DM or glycemic traits in the longitudinal data. 11 significant paths from T2DM to subsequent DNAm and 15 paths from DNAm to subsequent T2DM were detected, suggesting both directions of associations. For glycemic traits, we detected 17 cross-lagged associations from baseline glycemic traits to subsequent DNAm, and none was from the other cross-lagged direction, indicating CpG sites may be the consequences, not the causes, of glycemic traits. Finally, a longitudinal mediation analysis was performed, and the potential role of DNAm of cg19693031, cg00574958 and cg04816311 in mediating the effect of glycemic traits on T2DM was detected.Â© 2022 by the American Diabetes Association.",

Given the importance of the placenta in foetal development, we sought to examine how prenatal Pb exposure was associated with differential placental DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation and to identify affected biological pathways linked to developmental outcomes. Maternal (nÂ =Â 167) and infant (nÂ =Â 172) toenail and placenta (nÂ =Â 115) samples for prenatal Pb exposure were obtained from participants in a US birth cohort, and methylation and hydroxymethylation data were quantified using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. An epigenome-wide association study was applied to identify differential methylation and hydroxymethylation associated with Pb exposure. Biological functions of the Pb-associated genes were determined by overrepresentation analysis through ConsensusPathDB. Prenatal Pb quantified from maternal toenail, infant toenail, and placenta was associated with 480, 27, and 2 differentially methylated sites (qÂ <Â 0.05), respectively, with both increases and decreases associated with exposure. Alternatively, we identified 2, 1, and 14 differentially hydroxymethylated site(s) associated with maternal toenail, infant toenail, and placental Pb, respectively, with most showing increases in hydroxymethylation with exposure. Significantly overrepresented pathways amongst genes associated with differential methylation and hydroxymethylation (qÂ <Â 0.10) included mechanisms pertaining to nervous system and organ development, calcium transport and regulation, and signalling activities.

However, the cellular effects of these differentially methylated positions (DMPs) are often unclear. Therefore, we investigated top differentially methylated positions identified from an EWAS study. This included a putative regulatory region ofNHLRC1. Hypomethylation of this gene was recently linked with decreased survival rates in lung cancer patients. HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (450K) analysis was performed on 66 lung cancer case-control pairs from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Heidelberg lung cancer EWAS (EPIC HD) cohort. DMPs identified in these pre-diagnostic blood samples were then investigated for differential DNA methylation in lung tumor versus adjacent normal lung tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and replicated in two independent lung tumor versus adjacent normal tissue replication sets with MassARRAY. The EPIC HD top hypermethylated DMP cg06646708 was found to be a hypomethylated region in multiple data sets of lung tumor versus adjacent normal tissue. Hypomethylation within this region caused increased mRNA transcription of the closest geneNHLRC1in lung tumors. In functional assays, we demonstrate attenuated proliferation, viability, migration, and invasion uponNHLRC1knock-down in lung cancer cells.

There is also growing evidence for the prominent role of DNA methylation (DNAm) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).We studied sex-specific DNA methylation differences in the blood samples of AD subjects compared to cognitively normal subjects, by performing sex-specific meta-analyses of two large blood-based epigenome-wide association studies (ADNI and AIBL), which included DNA methylation data for a total of 1284 whole blood samples (632 females and 652 males). Within each dataset, we used two complementary analytical strategies, a sex-stratified analysis that examined methylation to AD associations in male and female samples separately, and a methylation-by-sex interaction analysis that compared the magnitude of these associations between different sexes. After adjusting for age, estimated immune cell type proportions, batch effects, and correcting for inflation, the inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis model was used to identify the most consistent DNAm differences across datasets. In addition, we also evaluated the performance of the sex-specific methylation-based risk prediction models for AD diagnosis using an independent external dataset.In the sex-stratified analysis, we identified 2 CpGs, mapped to the PRRC2A and RPS8 genes, significantly associated with AD in females at a 5% false discovery rate, and an additional 25 significant CpGs (21 in females, 4 in males) at P-value < 1Ã—10-5. In methylation-by-sex interaction analysis, we identified 5 significant CpGs at P-value < 10-5. Out-of-sample validations using the AddNeuroMed dataset showed in females, the best logistic prediction model included age, estimated immune cell-type proportions, and methylation risk scores (MRS) computed from 9 of the 23 CpGs identified in AD vs. CN analysis that are also available in AddNeuroMed dataset (AUC = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65-0.83). In males, the best logistic prediction model included only age and MRS computed from 2 of the 5 CpGs identified in methylation-by-sex interaction analysis that are also available in the AddNeuroMed dataset (AUC = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56-0.82).Overall, our results show that the DNA methylation differences in AD are largely distinct between males and females. Our best-performing sex-specific methylation-based prediction model in females performed better than that for males and additionally included estimated cell-type proportions. The significant discriminatory classification of AD samples with our methylation-based prediction models demonstrates that sex-specific DNA methylation could be a predictive biomarker for AD. As sex is a strong factor underlying phenotypic variability in AD, the results of our study are particularly relevant for a better understanding of the epigenetic architecture that underlie AD and for promoting precision medicine in AD.Â© 2022.

What remains unknown is the ""biologically embedding"" of maternal adverse experiences resulting in maladaptive parenting and whether these epigenetic effects are transmitted to the next generation. This study focuses on neglectful mothering indexed by a severe disregard for the basic and psychological needs of the child. Using the Illumina Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip in saliva samples, we identified genes with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in those mothers with (n= 51), versus those without (n= 87), neglectful behavior that present similar DMRs patterns in their children being neglected versus non-neglected (n= 40 vs. 75). Mothers reported the emotional intensity of adverse life events. After covariate adjustment and multiple testing corrections, we identified 69 DMRs in the mother epigenome and 42 DMRs in the child epigenome that were simultaneously above the Î± = 0.01 threshold. The common set of nine DMRs contained genes related to childhood adversity, neonatal and infant diabetes, child neurobehavioral development and other health problems such as obesity, hypertension, cancer, posttraumatic stress, and the Alzheimer's disease; four of the genes were associated with maternal life adversity. Identifying a shared epigenetic signature of neglect linked to maternal life adversity is an essential step in breaking the intergenerational transmission of one of the most common forms of childhood maltreatment.Copyright Â© 2022 LeÃ³n, Herrero RoldÃ¡n, Rodrigo, LÃ³pez RodrÃ­guez, Fisher, Mitchell and Lage-Castellanos.",

Here we introduce a blood-based neutrophil dexamethasone methylation index (NDMI) that provides a measure of the epigenetic response of subjects to dexamethasone. This marker outperforms conventional approaches based on leukocyte composition as a marker of glucocorticoid response. The NDMI is associated with low CD4 T cells and the accumulation of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and also serves as prognostic factor in glioma survival. In a non-glioma population, the NDMI increases with a history of prednisone use. Therefore, it may also be informative in other conditions where glucocorticoids are employed. We conclude that DNA methylation remodeling within the peripheral immune compartment is a rich source of clinically relevant markers of glucocorticoid response.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

In this work, we aim to identify blood DNAm profiles associated with TTD, with the aim to improve the reliability of the results, as well as their biological meaningfulness. We argue that a global approach to estimate CpG sites effect profile should capture the complex (potentially non-linear) relationships interplaying between sites. To prove our concept, we develop a new Deep Learning-based approach assessing the relevance of individual CpG Islands (i.e., assigning a weight to each site) in determining TTD while modeling their combined effect in a survival analysis scenario. The algorithm combines a tailored sampling procedure with DNAm sites agglomeration, deep non-linear survival modeling and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values estimation to aid robustness of the derived effects profile. The proposed approach deals with the common complexities arising from epidemiological studies, such as small sample size, noise, and low signal-to-noise ratio of blood-derived DNAm. We apply our approach to a prospective case-control study on breast cancer nested in the EPIC Italy cohort and we perform weighted gene-set enrichment analyses to demonstrate the biological meaningfulness of the obtained results. We compared the results of Deep Survival EWAS with those of a traditional EWAS approach, demonstrating that our method performs better than the standard approach in identifying biologically relevant pathways.",
No,20221003,prediction,36153611,Liquid biopsies based on DNA methylation as biomarkers for the detection and prognosis of lung cancer.,Clin Epigenetics,"Lung cancer (LC) is the main cause of cancer-related mortality. Most LC patients are diagnosed in an advanced stage when the symptoms are obvious, and the prognosis is quite poor. Although low-dose computed tomographyÂ (LDCT) is a routine clinical examination for early detection of LC, the false-positive rate is over 90%. As one of the intensely studied epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation plays a key role in various diseases, including cancer and other diseases. Hypermethylation in tumor suppressor genes or hypomethylation in oncogenes is an important event in tumorigenesis. Remarkably, DNA methylation usually occurs in the very early stage of malignant tumors. Thus, DNA methylation analysis may provide some useful information about the early detection of LC. In recent years, liquid biopsy has developed rapidly. Liquid biopsy can detect and monitor both primary and metastatic malignant tumors and can reflect tumor heterogeneity. Moreover, it is a minimally invasive procedure, and it causes less pain for patients. This review summarized various liquid biopsies based on DNA methylation for LC. At first, we briefly discussed some emerging technologies for DNA methylation analysis. Subsequently, we outlined cell-free DNA (cfDNA), sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, bronchial aspirates, and bronchial washings DNA methylation-based liquid biopsy for the early detection of LC. Finally, the prognostic value of DNA methylation in cfDNA and sputum and the diagnostic value of other DNA methylation-based liquid biopsies for LC were also analyzed.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",

A substantial body of research has shown associations between epigenetic aging and risk of disease, including cancer. Here we aimed to study epigenetic measures of aging and lifestyle-related factors in association with risk of breast cancer.Using data from four prospective case-control studies nested in three cohorts of European ancestry participants, including a total of 1,655 breast cancer cases, we calculated three methylation-based measures of lifestyle factors (body mass index [BMI], tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption) and seven measures of epigenetic aging (Horvath-based, Hannum-based, PhenoAge and GrimAge). All measures were regression-adjusted for their respective risk factors and expressed per standard deviationÂ (SD). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional or unconditional logistic regression and pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age at blood draw, time from blood sample to diagnosis, oestrogen receptor-positivity status and tumour stage.None of the measures of epigenetic aging were associated with risk of breast cancer in the pooled analysis: Horvath 'age acceleration' (AA): ORÂ per SDâ€‰=â€‰1.02, 95%CI: 0.95-1.10; AA-Hannum: ORâ€‰=â€‰1.03, 95%CI:0.95-1.12; PhenoAge: ORâ€‰=â€‰1.01, 95%CI: 0.94-1.09 and GrimAge: ORâ€‰=â€‰1.03, 95%CI: 0.94-1.12, in models adjusting for white blood cell proportions, body mass index, smoking and alcohol consumption. The BMI-adjusted predictor of BMI was associated with breast cancer risk, OR per SDâ€‰=â€‰1.09, 95%CI: 1.01-1.17. The results for the alcohol and smoking methylation-based predictors were consistent with a null association. Risk did not appear to substantially vary by age at blood draw, time to diagnosis or tumour characteristics.We found no evidence that methylation-based measures of aging, smoking or alcohol consumption were associated with risk of breast cancer. A methylation-based marker of BMI was associated with risk and may provide insights into the underlying associations between BMI and breast cancer.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",
No,20221003,prediction,36138228,Ten challenges for clinical translation in psychiatric genetics.,Nat Genet,"Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of robust genetic associations underlying psychiatric disorders and provided important biological insights into disease onset and progression. There is optimism that genetic findings will pave the way to precision psychiatry by facilitating the development of more effective treatments and the identification of groups of patients that these treatments should be targeted toward. However, there are several challenges that must be addressed before genetic findings can be translated into the clinic. In this Perspective, we highlight ten challenges for the field of psychiatric genetics, focused on the robust and generalizable detection of genetic risk factors, improved definition and assessment of psychopathology and achieving better clinical indicators. We discuss recent advancements in the field that will improve the explanatory and predictive power of genetic data and ultimately contribute to improving the management and treatment of patients with a psychiatric disorder.Â© 2022.

We introduce single-cell disease relevance score (scDRS), an approach that links scRNA-seq with polygenic disease risk at single-cell resolution, independent of annotated cell types. scDRS identifies cells exhibiting excess expression across disease-associated genes implicated by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We applied scDRS to 74 diseases/traits and 1.3 million single-cell gene-expression profiles across 31 tissues/organs. Cell-type-level results broadly recapitulated known cell-type-disease associations. Individual-cell-level results identified subpopulations of disease-associated cells not captured by existing cell-type labels, including T cell subpopulations associated with inflammatory bowel disease, partially characterized by their effector-like states; neuron subpopulations associated with schizophrenia, partially characterized by their spatial locations; and hepatocyte subpopulations associated with triglyceride levels, partially characterized by their higher ploidy levels. Genes whose expression was correlated with the scDRS score across cells (reflecting coexpression with GWAS disease-associated genes) were strongly enriched for gold-standard drug target and Mendelian disease genes.Â© 2022.

African American women experience disproportionate risk for cardiovascular disease including exposure to high levels of psychosocial stress. We hypothesized that psychosocial stress, such as perceived stress overload, may influence epigenetic marks, specifically DNA methylation (DNAm), that contribute to increased risk for cardiovascular disease in African American women.We conducted an epigenome-wide study evaluating the relationship of psychosocial stress and DNAm among African American mothers from the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure (InterGEN) cohort. Linear mixed effects models were used to explore the epigenome-wide associations with the Stress Overload Scale (SOS), which examines self-reported past-week stress, event load and personal vulnerability.In total, n = 228 participants were included in our analysis. After adjusting for known epigenetic confounders, we did not identify any DNAm sites associated with maternal report of stress measured by SOS after controlling for multiple comparisons. Several of the top differentially methylated CpG sites related to SOS score (P< 1 Ã— 10-5), mapped to genes of unknown significance for hypertension or heart disease, namely,PXDNLandC22orf42.This study provides foundational knowledge for future studies examining epigenetic associations with stress and other psychosocial measures in African Americans, a key area for growth in epigenetics.

DNA methylation is one underexplored mechanism that may explain differences in disease risk. Currently, there is little knowledge of how DNA methylation varies between South Asian and European ethnicities. This study characterised differences in blood DNA methylation between individuals of self-reported European and South Asian ethnicity from two UK-based cohorts: Southall and Brent Revisited and Born in Bradford. DNA methylation differences between ethnicities were widespread throughout the genome (nâ€‰=â€‰16,433 CpG sites, 3.4% sites tested). Specifically, 76% of associations were attributable to ethnic differences in cell composition with fewer effects attributable to smoking and genetic variation. Ethnicity-associated CpG sites were enriched for EWAS Catalog phenotypes including metabolites. This work highlights the need to consider ethnic diversity in epigenetic research.Â© 2022.

We examined whether BMI-related DNA methylation (DNAm) variation would mediate the association of BMI with serum uric acid (SUA). We first conducted an epigenome-wide association analysis (EWAS) in 64 monozygotic twin pairs to detect BMI-related DNAm variation and then evaluated the mediated effect of DNAm using mediation analysis. Ontology enrichments analysis was performed for CpGs using GREAT tool. The genes where the candidate CpG mediators mapped were validated using gene expression data. BMI was positively associated with log10transformed SUA level (Î²Â =Â 0.01, PÂ <Â 0.001). The association between BMI and DNAm of 138 CpGs reached PÂ <Â 1Â Ã—Â 10-4level. Twenty BMI-related differentially methylated regions within MAP2K2, POU4F2, AGAP2, MRGPRE, ADM5, and NKX1-1 were found. Of the 138 CpGs, 4 within VENTX (involved in cellular responses to stress pathway), SMOC2 (enable calcium ion binding), and FSCN2 (a member of fascin protein family) mediated the association between BMI and SUA, with a mediating effect of 0.002-Î¼mol/L lower log10transformed SUA levels and a proportion of 18.89Â %-24.92Â % negative mediating effect. BMIÂ Ã—Â DNAm interactions on SUA were observed for 2 CpGs within VENTX. The gene expression level of VENTX was also negatively associated with SUA level.

The proposed framework methylDeConv (available as an R package) integrates several deconvolution methods for methylation profiles (Illumina HumanMethylation450 and MethylationEPIC arrays) and offers different cell-type-specific CpG selection to construct the extended reference library which incorporates the main immune cell subsets, epithelial cells and cell-free DNAs. We compared the performance of different deconvolution algorithms via simulations and benchmark datasets and further investigated the associations of the estimated cell type proportions to cancer therapy in breast cancer and subtypes in melanoma methylation case studies. Our results indicated that the deconvolution based on the extended reference library is critical to obtain accurate estimates of cell proportions in non-blood tissues.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

DNA methylation associated with behavioral problems may reflect this risk and long-lasting effects of NLEs.To identify consistent associations between blood DNA methylation and EBs or IBs across adolescence, we conducted longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) using data from the IMAGEN cohort, collected at ages 14 and 19 years (nÂ = 506). Significant findings were validated in a separate subsample (nÂ = 823). Methylation risk scores were generated by 10-fold cross-validation and further tested for their associations with gray matter volumes and NLEs.No significant findings were obtained for the IB-EWAS. The EB-EWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in a gene linked to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (IQSEC1, cg01460382; pÂ = 1.26Â Ã— 10-8). Other most significant CpG sites were near ADHD-related genes and enriched for genes regulating tumor necrosis factor and interferon-Î³ signaling, highlighting the relevance of EB-EWAS findings for ADHD. Analyses with the EB methylation risk scores suggested that it partly reflected comorbidity with IBs in late adolescence. Specific to EBs, EB methylation risk scores correlated with smaller gray matter volumes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior/middle cingulate cortices, brain regions known to associate with ADHD and conduct problems. Longitudinal mediation analyses indicated that EB-related DNA methylation were more likely the outcomes of problematic behaviors accentuated by NLEs, and less likely the epigenetic bases of such behaviors.Our findings suggest that novel epigenetic mechanisms through which NLEs exert short and longer-term effects on behavior may contribute to ADHD.Copyright Â© 2022.

Such evidence is valuable for analyses utilizing precious or limited DNA sources. We used a single pooled sample of DNA in quadruplicate at three dilutions to define replicability and noise, and an independent population dataset of 328 individuals (from a community-based study including US-born non-Hispanic Black and white persons) to assess the impact of total DNA input on the quality of data generated using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We found that data are less reliable and more noisy as DNA input decreases to 40ng, with clear reductions in data quality; and that low DNA input is associated with a reduction in power to detect EWAS associations, requiring larger sample sizes. We conclude that DNA input as low as 40ng can be used with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip, provided quality checks and sensitivity analyses are undertaken.",

A potential mechanism underlying these exposure-outcome relationships is differential DNA methylation. Our objective was to examine the associations of maternal phthalate and bisphenol concentrations during pregnancy with DNA methylation in cord blood using a chemical mixtures approach.This study was embedded in a prospective birth cohort study in the Netherlands and included 306 participants. We measured urine phthalates and bisphenols concentrations in the first, second and third trimester. Cord blood DNA methylation in their children was processed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip using an epigenome-wide association approach. Using quantile g-computation, we examined the association of increasing all mixture components by one quartile with cord blood DNA methylation.We did not find evidence for statistically significant associations of a maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols during any of the trimesters of pregnancy with DNA methylation in cord blood (all p valuesâ€‰>â€‰4.01â€‰*â€‰10-8).

The methylome may mediate this association as the period of in vitro culture of ART treatments coincides with epigenetic reprogramming.This study was conducted as a follow-up to a previous culture medium comparison study in which couples were pseudo-randomized to embryo culture in G3 or K-SICM medium. Of the resultant singletons, 120 (nâ€‰=â€‰65 G3, nâ€‰=â€‰55 K-SICM), were recruited at age 9.The ART children provided a saliva sample from which the methylome was analysed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array. After quality and context filtering, 106 (nâ€‰=â€‰57 G3, nâ€‰=â€‰49 K-SICM) samples and 659â€Š708 sites were retained for the analyses. Differential methylation analyses were conducted using mixed effects linear models corrected for age, sex, sample plate and cell composition. These were applied to all cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, various genomic regions (genes, promoters, CpG Islands (CGIs)) and as a targeted analysis of imprinted genes and birth weight-associated CpG sites. Differential variance was assessed using the improved epigenetic variable outliers for risk prediction analysis (iEVORA) algorithm and methylation outliers were identified using a previously defined threshold (upper or lower quartile plus or minus three times the interquartile range, respectively).After correcting for multiple testing, we did not identify any significantly differentially methylated CpG sites, genes, promoters or CGIs between G3 and K-SICM children despite a lenient corrected P-value threshold of 0.1. Targeted analyses of (sites within) imprinted genes and birth weight-associated sites also did not identify any significant differences. The number of DNA methylation outliers per sample was comparable between the culture medium groups. iEVORA identified 101 differentially variable CpG sites of which 94 were more variable in the G3 group.Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) GSE196432.To detect significant methylation differences with a magnitude of <10% between the groups many more participants would be necessary; however, the clinical relevance of such small differences is unclear.The results of this study are reassuring, suggesting that if there is an effect of the culture medium on DNA methylation (and methylation-mediated diseases risk), it does not differ between the two media investigated here. The findings concur with other methylome studies of ART neonates and children that underwent embryo culture in different media, which also found no significant methylome differences.Study funded by March of Dimes (6-FY13-153), EVA (Erfelijkheid Voortplanting & Aanleg) specialty programme (grant no.

The long-term impact of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on DNA methylation patterns is unknown.To determine the long-term impact of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on DNA methylation patterns, we examined the association of the recommended dosage (400Â Î¼g/d) and time period (periconceptional before pregnancy through first trimester) of folic acid supplementation with the DNA methylation patterns in the offspring at age 14-17 y compared with offspring with no supplementation.Two geographic sites in China from the 1993-1995 Community Intervention Program of folic acid supplementation were selected for the follow-up study. DNA methylation at 402,730 CpG sites was assessed using saliva samples from 89 mothers and 179 adolescents (89 male).

Here, we investigated how a placental mammal-specific gene, Zfp42, emerged in an ancient vertebrate topologically associated domain (TAD) without adopting or disrupting the conserved expression of its gene, Fat1. In ESCs, physical TAD partitioning separates Zfp42 and Fat1 with distinct local enhancers that drive their independent expression. This separation is driven by chromatin activity and not CTCF/cohesin. In contrast, in embryonic limbs, inactive Zfp42 shares Fat1's intact TAD without responding to active Fat1 enhancers. However, neither Fat1 enhancer-incompatibility nor nuclear envelope-attachment account for Zfp42's unresponsiveness. Rather, Zfp42's promoter is rendered inert to enhancers by context-dependent DNA methylation. Thus, diverse mechanisms enabled the integration of independent Zfp42 regulation in the Fat1 locus. Critically, such regulatory complexity appears common in evolution as, genome wide, most TADs contain multiple independently expressed genes.Copyright Â© 2022 The Author(s).

The DNA methylation status of CpG sites on the same fragment represents a discrete methylation haplotype (mHap). The mHap-level metrics were demonstrated to be promising cancer biomarkers and explain more gene expression variation than average methylation. However, most existing tools focus on average methylation and neglect mHap patterns. Here, we present mhapTk, a comprehensive python toolkit for the analysis of DNA methylation haplotypes. It calculates eight mHap-level summary statistics in predefined regions or across individual CpG in a genome-wide manner. It identifies methylation haplotype blocks (MHBs), in which methylations of pairwise CpGs is tightly correlated. Furthermore, mHap patterns can be visualized with the built-in functions in mHapTk or external tools such as IGV and deepTools.https://jiantaoshi.github.io/mhaptk/index.html.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.Â© The Author(s) (2022).

Also, maternal folate intake is associated with decreased risk of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but the mechanism is not known.We evaluated the relationship between periconceptional folate intake by source and DNA methylation at birth in a cohort of pediatric ALL cases and controls in an epigenome-wide association study.Genome-wide DNA methylation status obtained from archived neonatal blood spots from pediatric ALL cases (nÂ =Â 189) and controls (nÂ =Â 205) in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS) from 1995-2008 was compared to periconceptional folate from total, food, and supplemental sources using multivariable linear regression. Further stratification was performed by income, education, ethnicity, and total folate intake. We evaluated variable DNA methylation response to periconceptional folate by ALL case status through an interaction term.Two significant differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were associated with food and supplemental periconceptional folate intake in all subjects (nÂ =Â 394). The top differentially methylated region at the promoter region of DUSP22 demonstrated DNA hypermethylation in ALL cases but not controls in response to total and food folate intake. We further identified eight interaction term DMPs with variable DNA methylation response to folate intake by ALL case status. Further stratification of the cohort by education and ethnicity revealed a substantially higher number of DMPs associated with supplemental folic acid intake in Hispanic subjects with lower income and education level.We identified modest associations between periconceptional folate intake and DNA methylation differing by source, including variation by ALL case status. Hispanic subjects of lower income and education appear uniquely responsive to periconceptional folate supplementation.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

No,20221024,methods,36175791,Identifying disease-critical cell types and cellular processes by integrating single-cell RNA-sequencing and human genetics.,Nat Genet,"Genome-wide association studies provide a powerful means of identifying loci and genes contributing to disease, but in many cases, the related cell types/states through which genes confer disease risk remain unknown. Deciphering such relationships is important for identifying pathogenic processes and developing therapeutics. In the present study, we introduce sc-linker, a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-sequencing, epigenomic SNP-to-gene maps and genome-wide association study summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants influence disease. The inferred disease enrichments recapitulated known biology and highlighted notable cell-disease relationships, including Î³-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurons in major depressive disorder, a disease-dependent M-cell program in ulcerative colitis and a disease-specific complement cascade process in multiple sclerosis. In autoimmune disease, both healthy and disease-dependent immune cell-type programs were associated, whereas only disease-dependent epithelial cell programs were prominent, suggesting a role in disease response rather than initiation. Our framework provides a powerful approach for identifying the cell types and cellular processes by which genetic variants influence disease.Â© 2022.

No,20221024,prediction,36175966,A blood DNA methylation biomarker for predicting short-term risk of cardiovascular events.,Clin Epigenetics,"Recent evidence highlights the epidemiological value of blood DNA methylation (DNAm) as surrogate biomarker for exposure to risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCD). DNAm surrogate of exposures predicts diseases and longevity better than self-reported or measured exposures in many cases. Consequently, disease prediction models based on blood DNAm surrogates may outperform current state-of-the-art prediction models. This study aims to develop novel DNAm surrogates for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) risk factors and develop a composite biomarker predictive of CVD risk. We compared the prediction performance of our newly developed risk score with the state-of-the-art DNAm risk scores for cardiovascular diseases, the 'next-generation' epigenetic clock DNAmGrimAge, and the prediction model based on traditional risk factors SCORE2.Using data from the EPIC Italy cohort, we derived novel DNAm surrogates for BMI, blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and coagulation biomarkers. We validated them in four independent data sets from Europe and the USA. Further, we derived a DNAmCVDscore predictive of the time-to-CVD event as a combination of several DNAm surrogates. ROC curve analyses show that DNAmCVDscore outperforms previously developed DNAm scores for CVD risk and SCORE2 for short-term CVD risk. Interestingly, the performance of DNAmGrimAge and DNAmCVDscore was comparable (slightly lower for DNAmGrimAge, although the differences were not statistically significant).We described novel DNAm surrogates for CVD risk factors useful for future molecular epidemiology research, and we described a blood DNAm-based composite biomarker, DNAmCVDscore, predictive of short-term cardiovascular events. Our results highlight the usefulness of DNAm surrogate biomarkers of risk factors in epigenetic epidemiology to identify high-risk populations. In addition, we provide further evidence on the effectiveness of prediction models based on DNAm surrogates and discuss methodological aspects for further improvements. Finally, our results encourage testing this approach for other NCD diseases by training and developing DNAm surrogates for disease-specific risk factors and exposures.Â© 2022. The Author(s).",
No,20221024,methods,36265006,Deep mendelian randomization: Investigating the causal knowledge of genomic deep learning models,PLoS Comput Biol,"Multi-task deep learning (DL) models can accurately predict diverse genomic marks from sequence, but whether these models learn the causal relationships between genomic marks is unknown. Here, we describe Deep Mendelian Randomization (DeepMR), a method for estimating causal relationships between genomic marks learned by genomic DL models. By combining Mendelian randomization with in silico mutagenesis, DeepMR obtains local (locus specific) and global estimates of (an assumed) linear causal relationship between marks. In a simulation designed to test recovery of pairwise causal relations between transcription factors (TFs), DeepMR gives accurate and unbiased estimates of the 'true' global causal effect, but its coverage decays in the presence of sequence-dependent confounding. We then apply DeepMR to examine the global relationships learned by a state-of-the-art DL model, BPNet, between TFs involved in reprogramming. DeepMR's causal effect estimates validate previously hypothesized relationships between TFs and suggest new relationships for future investigation.",

Dynamic control of DNA methylation is therefore vital for embryogenesis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Results: Here we report a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from Dnmt and Tet mutant mouse embryos during early organogenesis. We show that both the maintenance and de novo methyltransferase enzymes are dispensable for the formation of all major cell types at E8.5. However, DNA methyltransferases are required for silencing of prior or alternative cell fates such as pluripotency and extraembryonic programmes. Deletion of all three TET enzymes produces substantial lineage biases, in particular, a failure to generate primitive erythrocytes. Single-cell multi-omics profiling moreover reveals that this is linked to a failure to demethylate distal regulatory elements in Tet triple-knockout embryos.

Conclusions: This study provides a detailed analysis of the effects of perturbing DNA methylation on mouse organogenesis at a whole organism scale and affords new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of cell fate decisions.",
,,,31554804,Ageing affects DNA methylation drift and transcriptional cell-to-cell variability in mouse muscle stem cells,Nat Commun,"Age-related tissue alterations have been associated with a decline in stem cell number and function. Although increased cell-to-cell variability in transcription or epigenetic marks has been proposed to be a major hallmark of ageing, little is known about the molecular diversity of stem cells during ageing. Here we present a single cell multi-omics study of mouse muscle stem cells, combining single-cell transcriptome and DNA methylome profiling. Aged cells show a global increase of uncoordinated transcriptional heterogeneity biased towards genes regulating cell-niche interactions. We find context-dependent alterations of DNA methylation in aged stem cells. Importantly, promoters with increased methylation heterogeneity are associated with increased transcriptional heterogeneity of the genes they drive. These results indicate that epigenetic drift, by accumulation of stochastic DNA methylation changes in promoters, is associated with the degradation of coherent transcriptional networks during stem cell ageing. Furthermore, our observations also shed light on the mechanisms underlying the DNA methylation clock.",
,,,35948369,Single-cell multi-omics of human preimplantation embryos shows susceptibility to glucocorticoids,Genome Res,"The preconceptual, intrauterine, and early life environments can have a profound and long-lasting impact on the developmental trajectories and health outcomes of the offspring. Given the relatively low success rates of assisted reproductive technologies (ART; ?25%), additives and adjuvants, such as glucocorticoids, are used to improve the success rate. Considering the dynamic developmental events that occur during this window, these exposures may alter blastocyst formation at a molecular level, and as such, affect not only the viability of the embryo and the ability of the blastocyst to implant, but also the developmental trajectory of the first three cell lineages, ultimately influencing the physiology of the embryo. In this study, we present a comprehensive single-cell transcriptome, methylome, and small RNA atlas in the day 7 human embryo. We show that, despite no change in morphology and developmental features, preimplantation glucocorticoid exposure reprograms the molecular profile of the TE lineage, and these changes are associated with an altered metabolic and inflammatory response. Our data also suggest that glucocorticoids can precociously mature the TE sublineages, supported by the presence of extravillous trophoblast markers in the polar sublineage and presence of X Chromosome dosage compensation. Further, we have elucidated that epigenetic regulation-DNA methylation and microRNAs (miRNAs)-likely underlies the transcriptional changes observed. This study suggests that exposures to exogenous compounds during preimplantation may unintentionally reprogram the human embryo, possibly leading to suboptimal development and longer-term health outcomes.",
,,,36253871,Local CpG density affects the trajectory and variance of age-associated DNA methylation changes,Genome Biol,"Background: DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark associated with the repression of gene promoters. Its pattern in the genome is disrupted with age and these changes can be used to statistically predict age with epigenetic clocks. Altered rates of aging inferred from these clocks are observed in human disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning age-associated DNA methylation changes remain unknown. Local DNA sequence can program steady-state DNA methylation levels, but how it influences age-associated methylation changes is unknown.

Results: We analyze longitudinal human DNA methylation trajectories at 345,895 CpGs from 600 individuals aged between 67 and 80 to understand the factors responsible for age-associated epigenetic changes at individual CpGs. We show that changes in methylation with age occur at 182,760 loci largely independently of variation in cell type proportions. These changes are especially apparent at 8322 low CpG density loci. Using SNP data from the same individuals, we demonstrate that methylation trajectories are affected by local sequence polymorphisms at 1487 low CpG density loci. More generally, we find that low CpG density regions are particularly prone to change and do so variably between individuals in people aged over 65. This differs from the behavior of these regions in younger individuals where they predominantly lose methylation.

Conclusions: Our results, which we reproduce in two independent groups of individuals, demonstrate that local DNA sequence influences age-associated DNA methylation changes in humans in vivo. We suggest that this occurs because interactions between CpGs reinforce maintenance of methylation patterns in CpG dense regions.",
,,,36280888,Significant variation in the performance of DNA methylation predictors across data preprocessing and normalization strategie,Genome Biol,"Background: DNA methylation (DNAm)-based predictors hold great promise to serve as clinical tools for health interventions and disease management. While these algorithms often have high prediction accuracy, the consistency of their performance remains to be determined. We therefore conduct a systematic evaluation across 101 different DNAm data preprocessing and normalization strategies and assess how each analytical strategy affects the consistency of 41 DNAm-based predictors.

Results: Our analyses are conducted in a large EPIC DNAm array dataset from the Jackson Heart Study (N = 2053) that included 146 pairs of technical replicate samples. By estimating the average absolute agreement between replicate pairs, we show that 32 out of 41 predictors (78%) demonstrate excellent consistency when appropriate data processing and normalization steps are implemented. Across all pairs of predictors, we find a moderate correlation in performance across analytical strategies (mean rho = 0.40, SD = 0.27), highlighting significant heterogeneity in performance across algorithms. Successful or unsuccessful removal of technical variation furthermore significantly impacts downstream phenotypic association analysis, such as all-cause mortality risk associations.

Conclusions: We show that DNAm-based algorithms are sensitive to technical variation. The right choice of data processing strategy is important to achieve reproducible estimates and improve prediction accuracy in downstream phenotypic association analyses. For each of the 41 DNAm predictors, we report its degree of consistency and provide the best performing analytical strategy as a guideline for the research community. As DNAm-based predictors become more and more widely used, our work helps improve their performance and standardize their implementation.",
