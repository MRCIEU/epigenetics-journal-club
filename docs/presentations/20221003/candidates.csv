x,36174482,Genome-wide alternation and effect of DNA methylation in the impairments of steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis after PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure.,Environ Int,"The effects of ambient fine particles on male reproductive health have raised widespread concern. The particular underlying mechanisms of the damage remain largely unclear and demand more research in new directions. Previous research has revealed that DNA methylation plays an important role in male reproductive development and is also vulnerable to environmental influences. However, there hasn't been enough investigation into the involvement of DNA methylation in PM2.5-induced male reproductive toxicity. Here, we establish a real-time PM2.5exposure model and revealed that PM2.5exposure could lead to testicular dysfunction including spermatogenesis impairment and steroid hormone dysfunction. In particular, the decrease in the testicular global level of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) indicated a possible association of DNA methylation with testicular injury induced by PM2.5exposure. Further genome-wide methylation analysis revealed genomic hypomethylation of testicular DNA and identified more than 1000 differentially methylated regions in both CAP and UA versus FA, indicating that PM2.5exposure, even low-dose, could modulate the testicular methylome. Furthermore, integrated analysis of methylome and transcriptome identified some key methylated genes and networks, which may be involved in spermatogenesis and synthesis of steroid hormone. The testicular methylation levels of key genes especially Cyp11a1 and Pax8 raised, and their consequent reduced expression may impair the testosterone and sperm production process. Our research provides fundamental knowledge as well as novel insights into the possible involvement of DNA methylation in PM2.5-induced male reproductive harm.Copyright © 2022.

x,36170668,Longitudinal Association of DNA Methylation with Type 2 Diabetes and Glycemic Traits: A 5-year Cross-Lagged Twin Study.,Diabetes,"Previous cross-sectional Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWASs) in adults have reported hundreds of 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and glycemic traits. However, the results from EWASs have been inconsistent, and longitudinal observations of these associations are scarce. Twin studies provide a valuable tool for epigenetic studies, as they are naturally matched for genetic information. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed and EMBASE for EWASs, and 214, 33, and 117 candidate CpG sites were selected for T2DM, HbA1c and fasting blood glucose (FBG). Based on 1,070 twins from the Chinese National Twin Registry, 67, 17 and 16 CpG sites from previous studies were validated for T2DM, HbA1c and FBG. Longitudinal review and blood sampling for phenotypic information and DNAm were conducted twice in 2013 and 2018 on 308 twins. A cross-lagged analysis was performed to examine the temporal relationship between DNAm and T2DM or glycemic traits in the longitudinal data. 11 significant paths from T2DM to subsequent DNAm and 15 paths from DNAm to subsequent T2DM were detected, suggesting both directions of associations. For glycemic traits, we detected 17 cross-lagged associations from baseline glycemic traits to subsequent DNAm, and none was from the other cross-lagged direction, indicating CpG sites may be the consequences, not the causes, of glycemic traits. Finally, a longitudinal mediation analysis was performed, and the potential role of DNAm of cg19693031, cg00574958 and cg04816311 in mediating the effect of glycemic traits on T2DM was detected.© 2022 by the American Diabetes Association."
x,36155971,A Deep Survival EWAS approach estimating risk profile based on pre-diagnostic DNA methylation: An application to breast cancer time to diagnosis.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Previous studies for cancer biomarker discovery based on pre-diagnostic blood DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles, either ignore the explicit modeling of the Time To Diagnosis (TTD), or provide inconsistent results. This lack of consistency is likely due to the limitations of standard EWAS approaches, that model the effect of DNAm at CpG sites on TTD independently. In this work, we aim to identify blood DNAm profiles associated with TTD, with the aim to improve the reliability of the results, as well as their biological meaningfulness. We argue that a global approach to estimate CpG sites effect profile should capture the complex (potentially non-linear) relationships interplaying between sites. To prove our concept, we develop a new Deep Learning-based approach assessing the relevance of individual CpG Islands (i.e., assigning a weight to each site) in determining TTD while modeling their combined effect in a survival analysis scenario. The algorithm combines a tailored sampling procedure with DNAm sites agglomeration, deep non-linear survival modeling and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values estimation to aid robustness of the derived effects profile. The proposed approach deals with the common complexities arising from epidemiological studies, such as small sample size, noise, and low signal-to-noise ratio of blood-derived DNAm. We apply our approach to a prospective case-control study on breast cancer nested in the EPIC Italy cohort and we perform weighted gene-set enrichment analyses to demonstrate the biological meaningfulness of the obtained results. We compared the results of Deep Survival EWAS with those of a traditional EWAS approach, demonstrating that our method performs better than the standard approach in identifying biologically relevant pathways."
x,36148884,Prenatal lead (Pb) exposure is associated with differential placental DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in a human population.,Epigenetics,"Prenatal lead (Pb) exposure is associated with adverse developmental outcomes and to epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in animal models and in newborn blood. Given the importance of the placenta in foetal development, we sought to examine how prenatal Pb exposure was associated with differential placental DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation and to identify affected biological pathways linked to developmental outcomes. Maternal (n = 167) and infant (n = 172) toenail and placenta (n = 115) samples for prenatal Pb exposure were obtained from participants in a US birth cohort, and methylation and hydroxymethylation data were quantified using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. An epigenome-wide association study was applied to identify differential methylation and hydroxymethylation associated with Pb exposure. Biological functions of the Pb-associated genes were determined by overrepresentation analysis through ConsensusPathDB. Prenatal Pb quantified from maternal toenail, infant toenail, and placenta was associated with 480, 27, and 2 differentially methylated sites (q < 0.05), respectively, with both increases and decreases associated with exposure. Alternatively, we identified 2, 1, and 14 differentially hydroxymethylated site(s) associated with maternal toenail, infant toenail, and placental Pb, respectively, with most showing increases in hydroxymethylation with exposure. Significantly overrepresented pathways amongst genes associated with differential methylation and hydroxymethylation (q < 0.10) included mechanisms pertaining to nervous system and organ development, calcium transport and regulation, and signalling activities. Our results suggest that both methylation and hydroxymethylation in the placenta can be variable based on Pb exposure and that the pathways impacted could affect placental function."

However, the cellular effects of these differentially methylated positions (DMPs) are often unclear. Therefore, we investigated top differentially methylated positions identified from an EWAS study. This included a putative regulatory region ofNHLRC1. Hypomethylation of this gene was recently linked with decreased survival rates in lung cancer patients. HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (450K) analysis was performed on 66 lung cancer case-control pairs from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Heidelberg lung cancer EWAS (EPIC HD) cohort. DMPs identified in these pre-diagnostic blood samples were then investigated for differential DNA methylation in lung tumor versus adjacent normal lung tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and replicated in two independent lung tumor versus adjacent normal tissue replication sets with MassARRAY. The EPIC HD top hypermethylated DMP cg06646708 was found to be a hypomethylated region in multiple data sets of lung tumor versus adjacent normal tissue. Hypomethylation within this region caused increased mRNA transcription of the closest geneNHLRC1in lung tumors. In functional assays, we demonstrate attenuated proliferation, viability, migration, and invasion uponNHLRC1knock-down in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, diminished AKT phosphorylation at serine 473 causing expression of pro-apoptotic AKT-repressed genes was detected in these knock-down experiments. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the powerful potential for discovery of novel functional mechanisms in oncogenesis based on EWAS DNA methylation data.NHLRC1holds promise as a new prognostic biomarker for lung cancer survival and prognosis, as well as a target for novel treatment strategies in lung cancer patients."
x,36142381,Peripheral Blood DNA Methylation Profiles Do Not Predict Endoscopic Post-Operative Recurrence in Crohn's Disease Patients.,Int J Mol Sci,"Prediction of endoscopic post-operative recurrence (POR) in Crohn's disease (CD) patients following ileocolonic resection (ICR) using clinical risk factors alone has thus far been inadequate. While peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) DNA methylation has shown promise as a tool for predicting recurrence in cancer, no data in CD patients exists. Therefore, this study explored the association and predictive value of PBL DNA methylation in CD patients following ICR. From a cohort of 117 CD patients undergoing ICR, epigenome-wide PBL methylation profiles from 25 carefully selected patients presenting either clear endoscopic remission (n= 12) or severe recurrence (n= 13) were assessed using the Illumina MethylationEPIC (850K) array. No statistically significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) or regions (DMRs) associated with endoscopic POR were identified (FDRp≤ 0.05), further evidenced by the low accuracy (0.625) following elastic net classification analysis. Nonetheless, interrogating the most significant differences in methylation suggested POR-associated hypermethylation in theMBNL1,RAB29andLEPRgenes, respectively, which are involved in intestinal fibrosis, inflammation and wound healing. Notably, we observed a higher estimated proportion of monocytes in endoscopic POR compared to remission. Altogether, we observed limited differences in the genome-wide DNA methylome among CD patients with and without endoscopic POR. We therefore conclude that PBL DNA methylation is not a feasible predictive tool in post-operative CD."
x,36109771,Distinct sex-specific DNA methylation differences in Alzheimer's disease.,Alzheimers Res Ther,"Sex is increasingly recognized as a significant factor contributing to the biological and clinical heterogeneity in AD. There is also growing evidence for the prominent role of DNA methylation (DNAm) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).We studied sex-specific DNA methylation differences in the blood samples of AD subjects compared to cognitively normal subjects, by performing sex-specific meta-analyses of two large blood-based epigenome-wide association studies (ADNI and AIBL), which included DNA methylation data for a total of 1284 whole blood samples (632 females and 652 males). Within each dataset, we used two complementary analytical strategies, a sex-stratified analysis that examined methylation to AD associations in male and female samples separately, and a methylation-by-sex interaction analysis that compared the magnitude of these associations between different sexes. After adjusting for age, estimated immune cell type proportions, batch effects, and correcting for inflation, the inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis model was used to identify the most consistent DNAm differences across datasets. In addition, we also evaluated the performance of the sex-specific methylation-based risk prediction models for AD diagnosis using an independent external dataset.In the sex-stratified analysis, we identified 2 CpGs, mapped to the PRRC2A and RPS8 genes, significantly associated with AD in females at a 5% false discovery rate, and an additional 25 significant CpGs (21 in females, 4 in males) at P-value < 1×10-5. In methylation-by-sex interaction analysis, we identified 5 significant CpGs at P-value < 10-5. Out-of-sample validations using the AddNeuroMed dataset showed in females, the best logistic prediction model included age, estimated immune cell-type proportions, and methylation risk scores (MRS) computed from 9 of the 23 CpGs identified in AD vs. CN analysis that are also available in AddNeuroMed dataset (AUC = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65-0.83). In males, the best logistic prediction model included only age and MRS computed from 2 of the 5 CpGs identified in methylation-by-sex interaction analysis that are also available in the AddNeuroMed dataset (AUC = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56-0.82).Overall, our results show that the DNA methylation differences in AD are largely distinct between males and females. Our best-performing sex-specific methylation-based prediction model in females performed better than that for males and additionally included estimated cell-type proportions. The significant discriminatory classification of AD samples with our methylation-based prediction models demonstrates that sex-specific DNA methylation could be a predictive biomarker for AD. As sex is a strong factor underlying phenotypic variability in AD, the results of our study are particularly relevant for a better understanding of the epigenetic architecture that underlie AD and for promoting precision medicine in AD.© 2022.

x,36102013,Maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index and offspring with overweight/obesity at preschool age: The possible role of epigenome-wide DNA methylation changes in cord blood.,Pediatr Obes,"Epigenome-wide association studies have identified some DNA methylation sites associated with body mass index (BMI) or obesity. Studies in the Asian population are lacking.To examine the association of cord blood genome-wide DNA methylation (GWDm) changes with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and children's BMI-z score at preschool age. Additionally, we also explored the genome-wide differentially methylated regions and differentially methylated probes between preschoolers with overweight/obesity and normal-weight counterparts.This two-stage study design included (1) a GWDm analysis of 30 mother-child pairs from 633 participants of the Zhuhai birth cohort with data on newborn cord blood, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, and children's BMI at 3 years of age; and (2) a targeted validation analysis of the cord blood of ten children with overweight/obesity and ten matched controls to validate the CpG sites.In the first stage, no significant CpG sites were found to be associated with children's BMI-z score at preschool age after FDR correction with the p-values of the CpG sites in FOXN3 (cg23501836) and ZNF264 (cg27437574) being close to 1 × 10-6. In the second stage, a significant difference of CpG sites in AHRR (chr5:355067-355068) and FOXN3 (chr14: 89630264-89630272 and chr14: 89630387-89630388) was found between the ten children with overweight/obesity and ten controls (p < 0.05). The CpG sites in FOXN3 (chr14:89630264-89630272 and chr14:89630295-89630296) and ZNF264 (chr19: 57703104-57703107 and chr19: 57703301-57703307) were associated with children's BMI-z score; and the CpG sites in FOXN3 (chr14: 89630264-89630272 and chr14: 89630387-89630388) were associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.DNA methylation in FOXN3 and AHRR is associated with overweight/obesity in preschool-aged children, and the methylation in FOXN3 and ZNF264 might be associated with children's BMI-z score. FOXN3 methylation may be associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, suggesting its potential role in the children's BMI-z score or overweight/obesity. Our results provide novel insights into the mechanisms of children's obesity.© 2022 World Obesity Federation."
x,36091392,The shared mother-child epigenetic signature of neglect is related to maternal adverse events.,Front Physiol,"Studies of DNA methylation have revealed the biological mechanisms by which life adversity confers risk for later physical and mental health problems. What remains unknown is the ""biologically embedding"" of maternal adverse experiences resulting in maladaptive parenting and whether these epigenetic effects are transmitted to the next generation. This study focuses on neglectful mothering indexed by a severe disregard for the basic and psychological needs of the child. Using the Illumina Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip in saliva samples, we identified genes with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in those mothers with (n= 51), versus those without (n= 87), neglectful behavior that present similar DMRs patterns in their children being neglected versus non-neglected (n= 40 vs. 75). Mothers reported the emotional intensity of adverse life events. After covariate adjustment and multiple testing corrections, we identified 69 DMRs in the mother epigenome and 42 DMRs in the child epigenome that were simultaneously above the α = 0.01 threshold. The common set of nine DMRs contained genes related to childhood adversity, neonatal and infant diabetes, child neurobehavioral development and other health problems such as obesity, hypertension, cancer, posttraumatic stress, and the Alzheimer's disease; four of the genes were associated with maternal life adversity. Identifying a shared epigenetic signature of neglect linked to maternal life adversity is an essential step in breaking the intergenerational transmission of one of the most common forms of childhood maltreatment.Copyright © 2022 León, Herrero Roldán, Rodrigo, López Rodríguez, Fisher, Mitchell and Lage-Castellanos."
x,36153611,Liquid biopsies based on DNA methylation as biomarkers for the detection and prognosis of lung cancer.,Clin Epigenetics,"Lung cancer (LC) is the main cause of cancer-related mortality. Most LC patients are diagnosed in an advanced stage when the symptoms are obvious, and the prognosis is quite poor. Although low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is a routine clinical examination for early detection of LC, the false-positive rate is over 90%. As one of the intensely studied epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation plays a key role in various diseases, including cancer and other diseases. Hypermethylation in tumor suppressor genes or hypomethylation in oncogenes is an important event in tumorigenesis. Remarkably, DNA methylation usually occurs in the very early stage of malignant tumors. Thus, DNA methylation analysis may provide some useful information about the early detection of LC. In recent years, liquid biopsy has developed rapidly. Liquid biopsy can detect and monitor both primary and metastatic malignant tumors and can reflect tumor heterogeneity. Moreover, it is a minimally invasive procedure, and it causes less pain for patients. This review summarized various liquid biopsies based on DNA methylation for LC. At first, we briefly discussed some emerging technologies for DNA methylation analysis. Subsequently, we outlined cell-free DNA (cfDNA), sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, bronchial aspirates, and bronchial washings DNA methylation-based liquid biopsy for the early detection of LC. Finally, the prognostic value of DNA methylation in cfDNA and sputum and the diagnostic value of other DNA methylation-based liquid biopsies for LC were also analyzed.© 2022. The Author(s)."
x,36068634,Methylation-based markers of aging and lifestyle-related factors and risk of breast cancer: a pooled analysis of four prospective studies.,Breast Cancer Res,"DNA methylation in blood may reflect adverse exposures accumulated over the lifetime and could therefore provide potential improvements in the prediction of cancer risk. A substantial body of research has shown associations between epigenetic aging and risk of disease, including cancer. Here we aimed to study epigenetic measures of aging and lifestyle-related factors in association with risk of breast cancer.Using data from four prospective case-control studies nested in three cohorts of European ancestry participants, including a total of 1,655 breast cancer cases, we calculated three methylation-based measures of lifestyle factors (body mass index [BMI], tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption) and seven measures of epigenetic aging (Horvath-based, Hannum-based, PhenoAge and GrimAge). All measures were regression-adjusted for their respective risk factors and expressed per standard deviation (SD). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional or unconditional logistic regression and pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age at blood draw, time from blood sample to diagnosis, oestrogen receptor-positivity status and tumour stage.None of the measures of epigenetic aging were associated with risk of breast cancer in the pooled analysis: Horvath 'age acceleration' (AA): OR per SD = 1.02, 95%CI: 0.95-1.10; AA-Hannum: OR = 1.03, 95%CI:0.95-1.12; PhenoAge: OR = 1.01, 95%CI: 0.94-1.09 and GrimAge: OR = 1.03, 95%CI: 0.94-1.12, in models adjusting for white blood cell proportions, body mass index, smoking and alcohol consumption. The BMI-adjusted predictor of BMI was associated with breast cancer risk, OR per SD = 1.09, 95%CI: 1.01-1.17. The results for the alcohol and smoking methylation-based predictors were consistent with a null association. Risk did not appear to substantially vary by age at blood draw, time to diagnosis or tumour characteristics.We found no evidence that methylation-based measures of aging, smoking or alcohol consumption were associated with risk of breast cancer. A methylation-based marker of BMI was associated with risk and may provide insights into the underlying associations between BMI and breast cancer.© 2022. The Author(s)."
x,36064845,A new cognitive clock matching phenotypic and epigenetic ages.,Transl Psychiatry,"Cognitive abilities decline with age, constituting a major manifestation of aging. The quantitative biomarkers of this process, as well as the correspondence to different biological clocks, remain largely an open problem. In this paper we employ the following cognitive tests: 1. differentiation of shades (campimetry); 2. evaluation of the arithmetic correctness and 3. detection of reversed letters and identify the most significant age-related cognitive indices. Based on their subsets we construct a machine learning-based Cognitive Clock that predicts chronological age with a mean absolute error of 8.62 years. Remarkably, epigenetic and phenotypic ages are predicted by Cognitive Clock with an even better accuracy. We also demonstrate the presence of correlations between cognitive, phenotypic and epigenetic age accelerations that suggests a deep connection between cognitive performance and aging status of an individual.© 2022.

x,36050550,Polygenic enrichment distinguishes disease associations of individual cells in single-cell RNA-seq data.,Nat Genet,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unique insights into the pathology and cellular origin of disease. We introduce single-cell disease relevance score (scDRS), an approach that links scRNA-seq with polygenic disease risk at single-cell resolution, independent of annotated cell types. scDRS identifies cells exhibiting excess expression across disease-associated genes implicated by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We applied scDRS to 74 diseases/traits and 1.3 million single-cell gene-expression profiles across 31 tissues/organs. Cell-type-level results broadly recapitulated known cell-type-disease associations. Individual-cell-level results identified subpopulations of disease-associated cells not captured by existing cell-type labels, including T cell subpopulations associated with inflammatory bowel disease, partially characterized by their effector-like states; neuron subpopulations associated with schizophrenia, partially characterized by their spatial locations; and hepatocyte subpopulations associated with triglyceride levels, partially characterized by their higher ploidy levels. Genes whose expression was correlated with the scDRS score across cells (reflecting coexpression with GWAS disease-associated genes) were strongly enriched for gold-standard drug target and Mendelian disease genes.© 2022.

x,36138228,Ten challenges for clinical translation in psychiatric genetics.,Nat Genet,"Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of robust genetic associations underlying psychiatric disorders and provided important biological insights into disease onset and progression. There is optimism that genetic findings will pave the way to precision psychiatry by facilitating the development of more effective treatments and the identification of groups of patients that these treatments should be targeted toward. However, there are several challenges that must be addressed before genetic findings can be translated into the clinic. In this Perspective, we highlight ten challenges for the field of psychiatric genetics, focused on the robust and generalizable detection of genetic risk factors, improved definition and assessment of psychopathology and achieving better clinical indicators. We discuss recent advancements in the field that will improve the explanatory and predictive power of genetic data and ultimately contribute to improving the management and treatment of patients with a psychiatric disorder.© 2022.

Recent years have seen the rapid accumulation of large-scale cancer omics data catalysed by breakthroughs in high-throughput technologies. This fast data growth has given rise to an evolving concept of 'big data' in cancer, whose analysis demands large computational resources and can potentially bring novel insights into essential questions. Indeed, the combination of big data, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence has led to notable advances in our basic understanding of cancer biology and to translational advancements. Further advances will require a concerted effort among data scientists, clinicians, biologists and policymakers.

x,36151511,Local data commons: the sleeping beauty in the community of data commons.,BMC Bioinformatics,"Public Data Commons (PDC) have been highlighted in the scientific literature for their capacity to collect and harmonize big data. On the other hand, local data commons (LDC), located within an institution or organization, have been underrepresented in the scientific literature, even though they are a critical part of research infrastructure. Being closest to the sources of data, LDCs provide the ability to collect and maintain the most up-to-date, high-quality data within an organization, closest to the sources of the data. As a data provider, LDCs have many challenges in both collecting and standardizing data, moreover, as a consumer of PDC, they face problems of data harmonization stemming from the monolithic harmonization pipeline designs commonly adapted by many PDCs. Unfortunately, existing guidelines and resources for building and maintaining data commons exclusively focus on PDC and provide very little information on LDC.This article focuses on four important observations. First, there are three different types of LDC service models that are defined based on their roles and requirements. These can be used as guidelines for building new LDC or enhancing the services of existing LDC. Second, the seven core services of LDC are discussed, including cohort identification and facilitation of genomic sequencing, the management of molecular reports and associated infrastructure, quality control, data harmonization, data integration, data sharing, and data access control. Third, instead of commonly developed monolithic systems, we propose a new data sharing method for data harmonization that combines both divide-and-conquer and bottom-up approaches. Finally, an end-to-end LDC implementation is introduced with real-world examples.Although LDCs are an optimal place to identify and address data quality issues, they have traditionally been relegated to the role of passive data provider for much larger PDC. Indeed, many LDCs limit their functions to only conducting routine data storage and transmission tasks due to a lack of information on how to design, develop, and improve their services using limited resources. We hope that this work will be the first small step in raising awareness among the LDCs of their expanded utility and to publicize to a wider audience the importance of LDC.© 2022. The Author(s)."
x,36127421,DNA methylation as a pharmacodynamic marker of glucocorticoid response and glioma survival.,Nat Commun,"Assessing individual responses to glucocorticoid drug therapies that compromise immune status and affect survival outcomes in neuro-oncology is a great challenge. Here we introduce a blood-based neutrophil dexamethasone methylation index (NDMI) that provides a measure of the epigenetic response of subjects to dexamethasone. This marker outperforms conventional approaches based on leukocyte composition as a marker of glucocorticoid response. The NDMI is associated with low CD4 T cells and the accumulation of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and also serves as prognostic factor in glioma survival. In a non-glioma population, the NDMI increases with a history of prednisone use. Therefore, it may also be informative in other conditions where glucocorticoids are employed. We conclude that DNA methylation remodeling within the peripheral immune compartment is a rich source of clinically relevant markers of glucocorticoid response.© 2022. The Author(s)."
