"36174482","Genome-wide alternation and effect of DNA methylation in the impairments of steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis after PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure.","Environ Int","The effects of ambient fine particles on male reproductive health have raised widespread concern. The particular underlying mechanisms of the damage remain largely unclear and demand more research in new directions. Previous research has revealed that DNA methylation plays an important role in male reproductive development and is also vulnerable to environmental influences. However, there hasn't been enough investigation into the involvement of DNA methylation in PM2.5-induced male reproductive toxicity. Here, we establish a real-time PM2.5exposure model and revealed that PM2.5exposure could lead to testicular dysfunction including spermatogenesis impairment and steroid hormone dysfunction. In particular, the decrease in the testicular global level of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) indicated a possible association of DNA methylation with testicular injury induced by PM2.5exposure. Further genome-wide methylation analysis revealed genomic hypomethylation of testicular DNA and identified more than 1000 differentially methylated regions in both CAP and UA versus FA, indicating that PM2.5exposure, even low-dose, could modulate the testicular methylome. Furthermore, integrated analysis of methylome and transcriptome identified some key methylated genes and networks, which may be involved in spermatogenesis and synthesis of steroid hormone. The testicular methylation levels of key genes especially Cyp11a1 and Pax8 raised, and their consequent reduced expression may impair the testosterone and sperm production process. Our research provides fundamental knowledge as well as novel insights into the possible involvement of DNA methylation in PM2.5-induced male reproductive harm.Copyright © 2022.

"36171645","DNA Methylation Profile in CpG-depleted Regions Uncovers a High-Risk Subtype of Early-stage Colorectal Cancer.","J Natl Cancer Inst","The current risk stratification system defined by clinicopathological features does not identify the risk of recurrence in early-stage (stage I-II) colorectal cancer (CRC) with sufficient accuracy. We aimed to investigate whether DNA methylation could serve as novel biomarkers for predicting prognosis in early-stage CRC patients.We analyzed the genome-wide methylation status of CpG loci using Infinium MethylationEPIC array run on primary tumor tissues and normal mucosa of early-stage CRC patients to identify potential methylation markers for prognosis. The machine learning approach was applied to construct a DNA methylation-based prognostic classifier for early-stage CRC (MePEC) using the 4 gene methylation markers, including FAT3, KAZN, TLE4, and DUSP3. The prognostic value of the classifier was evaluated in two independent cohorts (n = 438 and 359, respectively).The comprehensive analysis identified an epigenetic subtype with high risk of recurrence based on a group of CpG loci in CpG-depleted region. In multivariate analysis, the MePEC classifier was independently and significantly associated with time to recurrence in the validation cohort one (HR 2.35, 95% CI 1.47-3.76, p < 0.001) and cohort two (HR 3.20, 95% CI 1.92-5.33, p < 0.001). All results were further confirmed after each cohort was stratified by clinicopathological variables and molecular subtypes.We demonstrated the prognostic significance of DNA methylation profile in CpG-depleted region, which may serve as a valuable source for tumor biomarkers. MePEC could identify an epigenetic subtype with high risk of recurrence and improve the prognostic accuracy of current clinical variables in early-stage CRC.© The Author(s) 2022.

"36170668","Longitudinal Association of DNA Methylation with Type 2 Diabetes and Glycemic Traits: A 5-year Cross-Lagged Twin Study.","Diabetes","Previous cross-sectional Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWASs) in adults have reported hundreds of 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and glycemic traits. However, the results from EWASs have been inconsistent, and longitudinal observations of these associations are scarce. Twin studies provide a valuable tool for epigenetic studies, as they are naturally matched for genetic information. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed and EMBASE for EWASs, and 214, 33, and 117 candidate CpG sites were selected for T2DM, HbA1c and fasting blood glucose (FBG). Based on 1,070 twins from the Chinese National Twin Registry, 67, 17 and 16 CpG sites from previous studies were validated for T2DM, HbA1c and FBG. Longitudinal review and blood sampling for phenotypic information and DNAm were conducted twice in 2013 and 2018 on 308 twins. A cross-lagged analysis was performed to examine the temporal relationship between DNAm and T2DM or glycemic traits in the longitudinal data. 11 significant paths from T2DM to subsequent DNAm and 15 paths from DNAm to subsequent T2DM were detected, suggesting both directions of associations. For glycemic traits, we detected 17 cross-lagged associations from baseline glycemic traits to subsequent DNAm, and none was from the other cross-lagged direction, indicating CpG sites may be the consequences, not the causes, of glycemic traits. Finally, a longitudinal mediation analysis was performed, and the potential role of DNAm of cg19693031, cg00574958 and cg04816311 in mediating the effect of glycemic traits on T2DM was detected.© 2022 by the American Diabetes Association."
"36169620","Genome-wide identification, phylogeny, and gene duplication of the epigenetic regulators in Fagaceae.","Physiol Plant","Epigenetic regulators are proteins involved in controlling gene expression. Information about the epigenetic regulators within the Fagaceae, a relevant family of trees and shrubs of the northern hemisphere ecosystems, is scarce. With the intent to characterize these proteins in Fagaceae, we searched for orthologs of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and demethylases (DDMEs) and Histone modifiers involved in acetylation (HATs), deacetylation (HDACs), methylation (HMTs), and demethylation (HDMTs) in Fagus, Quercus and Castanea genera. Blast searches were performed in the available genomes, and freely available RNA-seq data were used to de novo assemble transcriptomes. We identified homologs of seven DNMTs, three DDMEs, six HATs, eleven HDACs, 32 HMTs and 21 HDMTs proteins. Protein analysis showed that most of them have the putative characteristic domains found in these protein families, which suggests their conserved function. Additionally, to elucidate the evolutionary history of these genes within Fagaceae, paralogs were identified, and phylogenetic analyses were performed with DNA and histone modifiers. We detected duplication events in all species analyzed with higher frequency in Quercus and Castanea and discuss the evidence of transposable elements adjacent to paralogs and their involvement in gene duplication. The knowledge gathered from this work is a steppingstone to upcoming studies concerning epigenetic regulation in this economically important family of Fagaceae.

"36167684","Marine DNA methylation patterns are associated with microbial community composition and inform virus-host dynamics.","Microbiome","DNA methylation in prokaryotes is involved in many different cellular processes including cell cycle regulation and defense against viruses. To date, most prokaryotic methylation systems have been studied in culturable microorganisms, resulting in a limited understanding of DNA methylation from a microbial ecology perspective. Here, we analyze the distribution patterns of several microbial epigenetics marks in the ocean microbiome through genome-centric metagenomics across all domains of life.We reconstructed 15,056 viral, 252 prokaryotic, 56 giant viral, and 6 eukaryotic metagenome-assembled genomes from northwest Pacific Ocean seawater samples using short- and long-read sequencing approaches. These metagenome-derived genomes mostly represented novel taxa, and recruited a majority of reads. Thanks to single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology, base modification could also be detected for these genomes. This showed that DNA methylation can readily be detected across dominant oceanic bacterial, archaeal, and viral populations, and microbial epigenetic changes correlate with population differentiation. Furthermore, our genome-wide epigenetic analysis of Pelagibacter suggests that GANTC, a DNA methyltransferase target motif, is related to the cell cycle and is affected by environmental conditions. Yet, the presence of this motif also partitions the phylogeny of the Pelagibacter phages, possibly hinting at a competitive co-evolutionary history and multiple effects of a single methylation mark.Overall, this study elucidates that DNA methylation patterns are associated with ecological changes and virus-host dynamics in the ocean microbiome.

"36153599","Longitudinal multi-omics analysis identifies early blood-based predictors of anti-TNF therapy response in inflammatory bowel disease.","Genome Med","Treatment with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) antagonists in IBD patients suffers from primary non-response rates of up to 40%. Biomarkers for early prediction of therapy success are missing. We investigated the dynamics of gene expression and DNA methylation in blood samples of IBD patients treated with the TNF antagonist infliximab and analyzed the predictive potential regarding therapy outcome.We performed a longitudinal, blood-based multi-omics study in two prospective IBD patient cohorts receiving first-time infliximab therapy (discovery: 14 patients, replication: 23 patients). Samples were collected at up to 7 time points (from baseline to 14 weeks after therapy induction). RNA-sequencing and genome-wide DNA methylation data were analyzed and correlated with clinical remission at week 14 as a primary endpoint.We found no consistent ex ante predictive signature across the two cohorts. Longitudinally upregulated transcripts in the non-remitter group comprised TH2- and eosinophil-related genes including ALOX15, FCER1A, and OLIG2. Network construction identified transcript modules that were coherently expressed at baseline and in non-remitting patients but were disrupted at early time points in remitting patients. These modules reflected processes such as interferon signaling, erythropoiesis, and platelet aggregation. DNA methylation analysis identified remission-specific temporal changes, which partially overlapped with transcriptomic signals. Machine learning approaches identified features from differentially expressed genes cis-linked to DNA methylation changes at week 2 as a robust predictor of therapy outcome at week 14, which was validated in a publicly available dataset of 20 infliximab-treated CD patients.Integrative multi-omics analysis reveals early shifts of gene expression and DNA methylation as predictors for efficient response to anti-TNF treatment. Lack of such signatures might be used to identify patients with IBD unlikely to benefit from TNF antagonists at an early time point.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We profiled DNA methylation in two regions of the cortex from 631 donors, performing an epigenome-wide association study of multiple measures of AD neuropathology. We meta-analyzed our results with those from previous studies of DNA methylation in AD cortex (total n = 2013 donors), identifying 334 cortical differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with AD pathology including methylomic variation at loci not previously implicated in dementia. We subsequently profiled DNA methylation in NeuN+ (neuronal-enriched), SOX10+ (oligodendrocyte-enriched) and NeuN-/SOX10- (microglia- and astrocyte-enriched) nuclei, finding that the majority of DMPs identified in 'bulk' cortex tissue reflect DNA methylation differences occurring in non-neuronal cells. Our study highlights the power of utilizing multiple measures of neuropathology to identify epigenetic signatures of AD and the importance of characterizing disease-associated variation in purified cell-types.© 2022.

"36157320","Searching for the methylation sites involved in human papillomavirus type 16 and 18‑positive women with cervical cancer.","Mol Clin Oncol","It has been reported that >90% of women with cervical cancer are human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive, with HPV16 and 18 being the most 'highest-risk' HPV genotypes. However, in numerous women, HPV infection will not progress to cervical cancer. Accordingly, more appropriate screening markers need to be explored. In the present study, genome-wide DNA methylomic differences between cervical cancer tissues with HPV-16 or HPV-18 infection and normal cervical tissues were detected by using an Illumina Human Methylation 850 K BeadChip. The Gene Ontology functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were conducted in order to define the nearest neighbouring genes of differentiated methylation sites. Moreover, differentiated methylation sites were verified using pyrosequencing. KEGG analyses suggested that the focal adhesion pathway and pathways in cancer were highly enriched. Bioinformatics and statistical analysis indicated that the nine CpG loci had the most significant differences amongst the genes involved in these pathways. Among these, six CpG sites in the CHRM2, LAMA4, COL11A1, FGF10, IGF1 and TEK genes were highly associated with HPV-16-positive cervical cancer, as validated using pyrophosphate sequencing. Additionally, 10 significantly different CpG sites of the HPV-18-positive group were selected and verified in The Cancer Genome Atlas, indicating their possible diagnostic roles in cervical cancer development and determination. In addition, eight hypermethylated CpG island sites that were associated with HPV-16-positive cervical cancer tissues and 10 hypermethylated CpG island sites that were associated with HPV-18-positive cervical cancer tissues were identified, highlighting their potential roles in screening and evaluating targeted therapy efficacy and prognosis. The main focus of the present study was to identify the genetic variability in HPV-16- and HPV-18-positive samples and to elucidate possible methylation biomarkers in HPV-positive women with a risk of developing cervical cancer.Copyright: © Ma et al."
"36155971","A Deep Survival EWAS approach estimating risk profile based on pre-diagnostic DNA methylation: An application to breast cancer time to diagnosis.","PLoS Comput Biol","Previous studies for cancer biomarker discovery based on pre-diagnostic blood DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles, either ignore the explicit modeling of the Time To Diagnosis (TTD), or provide inconsistent results. This lack of consistency is likely due to the limitations of standard EWAS approaches, that model the effect of DNAm at CpG sites on TTD independently. In this work, we aim to identify blood DNAm profiles associated with TTD, with the aim to improve the reliability of the results, as well as their biological meaningfulness. We argue that a global approach to estimate CpG sites effect profile should capture the complex (potentially non-linear) relationships interplaying between sites. To prove our concept, we develop a new Deep Learning-based approach assessing the relevance of individual CpG Islands (i.e., assigning a weight to each site) in determining TTD while modeling their combined effect in a survival analysis scenario. The algorithm combines a tailored sampling procedure with DNAm sites agglomeration, deep non-linear survival modeling and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values estimation to aid robustness of the derived effects profile. The proposed approach deals with the common complexities arising from epidemiological studies, such as small sample size, noise, and low signal-to-noise ratio of blood-derived DNAm. We apply our approach to a prospective case-control study on breast cancer nested in the EPIC Italy cohort and we perform weighted gene-set enrichment analyses to demonstrate the biological meaningfulness of the obtained results. We compared the results of Deep Survival EWAS with those of a traditional EWAS approach, demonstrating that our method performs better than the standard approach in identifying biologically relevant pathways."

Monoallelic promoter methylation and downregulation were observed forSERHL(serine hydrolase-like) andCAT(catalase) genes associated with peroxisome function.Conclusion:These data are consistent with the hypothesis implicating impaired peroxisome function/biogenesis for ASD. A similar approach holds promise for identifying rare epimutations in ASD and other complex disorders."

Moreover, genetic variation at the X-chromosome linked TLR7 gene has been associated with COVID-19 severity. It has been suggested that the sex-biased incidence of COVID-19 might be related to the fact that TLR7 escapes X-chromosome inactivation during early embryogenesis in females, thus encoding a doble dose of its gene product compared to males. We analyzed TLR7 expression in two acute phase cohorts of COVID-19 patients that used two different technological platforms, one of them in a multi-tissue context including saliva, nasal, and blood samples, and a third cohort that included different post-infection timepoints of long-COVID-19 patients. We additionally explored methylation patterns of TLR7 using epigenomic data from an independent cohort of COVID-19 patients stratified by severity and sex. In line with genome-wide association studies, we provide supportive evidence indicating that TLR7 has altered CpG sites and is consistently downregulated in males compared to females in the most severe cases of COVID-19.Copyright © 2022.

"36152762","Reverse Inflammaging: Long-term effects of HCV cure on biological age.","J Hepatol","Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be cured with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA). However, not all sequelae of chronic hepatitis C appear to be completely reversible after sustained virologic response (SVR). Recently, chronic viral infections have been shown to be associated with biological age acceleration defined by the epigenetic clock. The aim of this study was to investigate whether chronic HCV infection is associated with epigenetic changes and biological age acceleration and whether this is reversible after SVR.We included 54 well-characterized patients with chronic hepatitis C who achieved SVR after DAA therapy at three time points: DAA treatment initiation, end of treatment, and long-term follow-up (median 96 weeks after end of treatment). Genome-wide DNA methylation status from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was generated and used to calculate epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) using Horvath's clock.HCV patients had an overall significant EAA of 3.12 years at baseline compared with -2.61 years in the age- and sex-matched reference group (p<0.00003). HCV elimination resulted in a significant long-term increase in DNA methylation dominated by hypermethylated CpGs in all patient groups. Accordingly, EAA decreased to 1.37 years at long-term follow-up. The decrease in EAA was significant only between the end of treatment and follow-up (p=0.01). Interestingly, eight patients who developed hepatocellular carcinoma after SVR had the highest EAA and showed no evidence of reversal after SVR.Our data contribute to the understanding of the biological impact of HCV elimination after DAA and demonstrate that HCV elimination can lead to ""reverse inflammaging"". In addition, we provide new conceptual ideas for the use of biological age as a potential biomarker for HCV sequelae after SVR.Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is now curable with direct acting antiviral agents (DAA), but are concomitant and sequelae also fully reversible after cure? Recent data demonstrate that chronic viral infections lead to an increase in biological age as measured by epigenetic DNA methylation status. Using a unique cohort of hepatitis C patients with and without cirrhosis as well as progression to HCC, we demonstrated that these epigenetic changes and concomitant increase in biological age are also observed in chronic HCV infection. Our data further suggest that this effect seems to be partially reversible in the long-term course after sustained virological response (SVR) by DAA therapy and that biological regeneration occurs. In this regard, the recovery effect appears to be dependent on disease course and was significantly lower in patients with progression to HCC. This suggests the use of biological age based on epigenetic state as a potential biomarker for HCV sequelae.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier B.V."

However, the maladaptive fear response is one of the hallmarks of fear-related disorders, which is characterized by the failure to discriminate threatening signals from neutral or safe cues. The biological mechanisms of fear discrimination remain to be clarified. In this study, we found that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was indispensable for the formation of cued fear memory in mice, during which the expression of DNA methyltransferase 3a gene (DNMT3a) increased. Injection of Zebularine, a nonspecific DNMT inhibitor, into NAc immediately after conditioning induced a maladaptive fear response to neutral cue (CS-). Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), differentially methylated sites and methylated regions (DMRs) were investigated. 16,226 DMRs in the genenome were identified, in which, 214 genes with significant differences in their methylation levels and mRNA expression profiles were identified through correlation analysis. Notably, 15 genes were synaptic function-related and 8 genes were enriched in the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway. Moreover, inhibition of PKG impaired fear discrimination. Together, our results revealed the profile and role of genome-wide DNA methylation in NAc in the regulation of fear discrimination.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Inc."

Approximately 90% of PD cases are due to a complex interaction between age, genes, and environmental factors, and epigenetic marks are thought to mediate the relationship between aging, genetics, the environment, and disease risk. To date, there are a small number of published genome-wide studies of DNA methylation in PD, but none accounted for cell type or sex in their analyses. Given the heterogeneity of bulk brain tissue samples and known sex differences in PD risk, progression, and severity, these are critical variables to account for. In this genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in an enriched neuronal population from PD postmortem parietal cortex, we report sex-specific PD-associated methylation changes in PARK7 (DJ-1), SLC17A6 (VGLUT2), PTPRN2 (IA-2β), NR4A2 (NURR1), and other genes involved in developmental pathways, neurotransmitter packaging and release, and axon and neuron projection guidance.© 2022.

Given the importance of the placenta in foetal development, we sought to examine how prenatal Pb exposure was associated with differential placental DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation and to identify affected biological pathways linked to developmental outcomes. Maternal (n = 167) and infant (n = 172) toenail and placenta (n = 115) samples for prenatal Pb exposure were obtained from participants in a US birth cohort, and methylation and hydroxymethylation data were quantified using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. An epigenome-wide association study was applied to identify differential methylation and hydroxymethylation associated with Pb exposure. Biological functions of the Pb-associated genes were determined by overrepresentation analysis through ConsensusPathDB. Prenatal Pb quantified from maternal toenail, infant toenail, and placenta was associated with 480, 27, and 2 differentially methylated sites (q < 0.05), respectively, with both increases and decreases associated with exposure. Alternatively, we identified 2, 1, and 14 differentially hydroxymethylated site(s) associated with maternal toenail, infant toenail, and placental Pb, respectively, with most showing increases in hydroxymethylation with exposure. Significantly overrepresented pathways amongst genes associated with differential methylation and hydroxymethylation (q < 0.10) included mechanisms pertaining to nervous system and organ development, calcium transport and regulation, and signalling activities. Our results suggest that both methylation and hydroxymethylation in the placenta can be variable based on Pb exposure and that the pathways impacted could affect placental function."

Up to date, only a few studies reported the DNA methylation in yak. In the present study, genome-wide DNA methylome and transcriptome profiles in lung, mammary, and biceps brachii muscle tissues were compared between yak and three cattle breeds (Tibetan cattle, Sanjiang cattle, and Holstein cattle). The association between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was analyzed, and the biological functions of DEGs potentially driven by DMRs were explored by KEGG enrichment analysis. Finally, we found that yak-specific DMRs-driven DEGs were mainly involved in neuromodulation, respiration, lung development, blood pressure regulation, cardiovascular protection, energy metabolism, DNA repair, and immune functions. The higher levels of the key genes associated with these functions were observed in yak than in cattle, suggesting that DNA methylation might regulate these genes.

Although a series of tools have been developed to overcome the mapping challenges caused by bisulfite treatment, the latest available tools have not been evaluated on the performance of reads mapping as well as on biological insights in multiple mammals. Herein, based on the real and simulated WGBS data of 14.77 billion reads, we undertook 936 mappings to benchmark and evaluate 14 wildly utilized alignment algorithms from reads mapping to biological interpretation in humans, cattle and pigs: Bwa-meth, BSBolt, BSMAP, Walt, Abismal, Batmeth2, Hisat_3n, Hisat_3n_repeat, Bismark-bwt2-e2e, Bismark-his2, BSSeeker2-bwt, BSSeeker2-soap2, BSSeeker2-bwt2-e2e and BSSeeker2-bwt2-local. Specifically, Bwa-meth, BSBolt, BSMAP, Bismark-bwt2-e2e and Walt exhibited higher uniquely mapped reads, mapped precision, recall and F1 score than other nine alignment algorithms, and the influences of distinct alignment algorithms on the methylomes varied considerably at the numbers and methylation levels of CpG sites, the calling of differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) and regions (DMRs). Moreover, we reported that BSMAP showed the highest accuracy at the detection of CpG coordinates and methylation levels, the calling of DMCs, DMRs, DMR-related genes and signaling pathways. These results suggested that careful selection of algorithms to profile the genome-wide DNA methylation is required, and our works provided investigators with useful information on the choice of alignment algorithms to effectively improve the DNA methylation detection accuracy in mammals.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36145200","Mendelian Randomization Analysis of the Association of SOCS3 Methylation with Abdominal Obesity.","Nutrients","This study was conducted to evaluate the potential causality association of SOCS3 methylation with abdominal obesity using Mendelian randomization. A case-control study, including 1064 participants, was carried out on Chinese subjects aged 18 to 79. MethylTargetTM was used to detect the methylation level for each CpG site of SOCS3, and SNPscan®was applied to measure the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. The logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of SOCS3 methylation level and SNP genotyping with abdominal obesity. Three types of Mendelian randomization methods were implemented to examine the potential causality between SOCS3 methylation and obesity based on the SNP of SOCS3 as instrumental variables. SOCS3 methylation levels were inversely associated with abdominal obesity in five CpG sites (effect estimates ranged from 0.786 (Chr17:76356054) to 0.851 (Chr17:76356084)), and demonstrated positively association in 18 CpG sites (effect estimates ranged from 1.243 (Chr17:76354990) to 1.325 (Chr17:76355061)). The causal relationship between SOCS3 methylation and abdominal obesity was found using the maximum-likelihood method and Mendelian randomization method of penalized inverse variance weighted (MR-IVW), and theβvalues (95%CI) were 5.342 (0.215, 10.469) and 4.911 (0.259, 9.564), respectively. The causality was found between the SOCS3 methylation level and abdominal obesity in the Chinese population."

However, the cellular effects of these differentially methylated positions (DMPs) are often unclear. Therefore, we investigated top differentially methylated positions identified from an EWAS study. This included a putative regulatory region ofNHLRC1. Hypomethylation of this gene was recently linked with decreased survival rates in lung cancer patients. HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (450K) analysis was performed on 66 lung cancer case-control pairs from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Heidelberg lung cancer EWAS (EPIC HD) cohort. DMPs identified in these pre-diagnostic blood samples were then investigated for differential DNA methylation in lung tumor versus adjacent normal lung tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and replicated in two independent lung tumor versus adjacent normal tissue replication sets with MassARRAY. The EPIC HD top hypermethylated DMP cg06646708 was found to be a hypomethylated region in multiple data sets of lung tumor versus adjacent normal tissue. Hypomethylation within this region caused increased mRNA transcription of the closest geneNHLRC1in lung tumors. In functional assays, we demonstrate attenuated proliferation, viability, migration, and invasion uponNHLRC1knock-down in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, diminished AKT phosphorylation at serine 473 causing expression of pro-apoptotic AKT-repressed genes was detected in these knock-down experiments. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the powerful potential for discovery of novel functional mechanisms in oncogenesis based on EWAS DNA methylation data.NHLRC1holds promise as a new prognostic biomarker for lung cancer survival and prognosis, as well as a target for novel treatment strategies in lung cancer patients."

Herein, we examined the potential of employing gibberellic acid (GA3) as an inducer of sorghum development during salt stress. Thus far, there have been no reports on the signaling network involved in the GA3-mediated regulation of sorghum development. In this study, we demonstrated that the stimulating properties of 50 mg/L GA3on sorghum development was far superior to other GA3concentrations under a 150 mM NaCl salinity condition. Furthermore, using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq), we established an m6A methylation (m6A-M) profile in sorghum following exposure to 50 mg/L GA3. Overall, 23,363 m6A peaks and 16,200 m6A genes were screened among the GA3-treated and control leaves. These identified peaks were shown to be primarily enriched in the coding, as were the 3'- and 5'-untranslated regions. In addition, we employed m6A and transcript expression cross-analysis to identify 70 genes with differential transcript expression and simultaneous m6A-M. Intriguingly, the principal gene,LOC8066282, which is associated withLOC8084853, was shown to be intricately linked to the phosphatidylinositol signaling, which in turn regulates sorghum development and response to salt stress. This investigation presents a novel RNA m6A-M profile in sorghum, which may facilitate new insights into the underlying signaling behind salt stress resistance.

The methylation status of NMR19-4 is associated withPPHexpression and leaf senescence in Arabidopsis natural accessions. In this study, we show that the CRISPR/dCas9-TET1cd system can be used to target the methylation of hypermethylated NMR19-4 region to reduce the level of methylation, thereby increasing the expression ofPPHand accelerating leaf senescence. Furthermore, hybridization between transgenic demethylated plants and hypermethylated ecotypes showed that the demethylation status of edited NMR19-4, along with the enhancedPPHexpression and accelerated leaf senescence, showed Mendelian inheritance in F1 and F2 progeny, indicating that spontaneous epialleles are stably transmitted trans-generationally after demethylation editing. Our results provide a rational approach for future editing of spontaneously mutated epialleles and provide insights into the epigenetic mechanisms that control plant leaf senescence."
"36142381","Peripheral Blood DNA Methylation Profiles Do Not Predict Endoscopic Post-Operative Recurrence in Crohn's Disease Patients.","Int J Mol Sci","Prediction of endoscopic post-operative recurrence (POR) in Crohn's disease (CD) patients following ileocolonic resection (ICR) using clinical risk factors alone has thus far been inadequate. While peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) DNA methylation has shown promise as a tool for predicting recurrence in cancer, no data in CD patients exists. Therefore, this study explored the association and predictive value of PBL DNA methylation in CD patients following ICR. From a cohort of 117 CD patients undergoing ICR, epigenome-wide PBL methylation profiles from 25 carefully selected patients presenting either clear endoscopic remission (n= 12) or severe recurrence (n= 13) were assessed using the Illumina MethylationEPIC (850K) array. No statistically significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) or regions (DMRs) associated with endoscopic POR were identified (FDRp≤ 0.05), further evidenced by the low accuracy (0.625) following elastic net classification analysis. Nonetheless, interrogating the most significant differences in methylation suggested POR-associated hypermethylation in theMBNL1,RAB29andLEPRgenes, respectively, which are involved in intestinal fibrosis, inflammation and wound healing. Notably, we observed a higher estimated proportion of monocytes in endoscopic POR compared to remission. Altogether, we observed limited differences in the genome-wide DNA methylome among CD patients with and without endoscopic POR. We therefore conclude that PBL DNA methylation is not a feasible predictive tool in post-operative CD."

In a retrospective North Carolina-based-birth-cohort, we examined the effect of ovulation drugs and ART on CpG methylation in differentially methylated CpGs in known imprint control regions (ICRs). Nine ICRs containing 48 CpGs were assessed for methylation status by pyrosequencing in mixed leukocytes from cord blood. After restricting to non-smoking, college-educated participants who agreed to follow-up, ART-exposed (n= 27), clomifene-only-exposed (n= 22), and non-exposed (n= 516) groups were defined. Associations of clomifene and ART with ICR CpG methylation were assessed with linear regression and stratifying by offspring sex. In males, ART was associated with hypomethylation of thePEG3ICR [β(95% CI) = -1.46 (-2.81, -0.12)] and hypermethylation of theMEG3ICR [3.71 (0.01, 7.40)]; clomifene-only was associated with hypomethylation of theNNATICR [-5.25 (-10.12, -0.38)]. In female offspring, ART was associated with hypomethylation of theIGF2ICR [-3.67 (-6.79, -0.55)]. Aberrant methylation of these ICRs has been associated with cardiovascular disease and metabolic and behavioral outcomes in children. The results suggest that the increased risk of adverse outcomes in offspring conceived through ART may be due in part to altered methylation of ICRs. Larger studies utilizing epigenome-wide interrogation are warranted."
"36132131","Biomarkers for risk-based treatment modifications for CNS germ cell tumors: Updates on biological underpinnings, clinical trials, and future directions.","Front Oncol","CNS germ cell tumors (GCTs) preferentially occur in pediatric and adolescent patients. GCTs are located predominantly in the neurohypophysis and the pineal gland. Histopathologically, GCTs are broadly classified into germinomas and non-germinomatous GCTs (NGGCTs). In general, germinoma responds well to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with a 10-year overall survival (OS) rate of approximately 90%. In contrast, NGGCTs have a less favorable prognosis, with a five-year OS of approximately 70%. Germinomas are typically treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and whole-ventricular radiation therapy, while mature teratomas can be surgically cured. Other NGGCTs require intensive chemotherapy with radiation therapy, including whole brain or craniospinal irradiation, depending on the dissemination status and protocols. Long-term treatment-related sequelae, including secondary neoplasms and cerebrovascular events, have been well recognized. These late effects have a tremendous impact in later life, especially since patients are mostly affected in childhood or young adults. Intending to minimize the treatment burden on patients, the identification of biomarkers for treatment stratification and evaluation of treatment response is of critical importance. Recently, tumor cell content in germinomas has been shown to be closely related to prognosis, suggesting that cases with low tumor cell content may be safely treated with a less intensive regimen. Among the copy number alterations, the 12p gain is the most prominent and has been shown to be a negative prognostic factor in NGGCTs. MicroRNA clusters (mir-371-373) were also revealed to be a hallmark of GCTs, demonstrating the potential for the application of liquid biopsy in the diagnosis and detection of recurrence. Recurrent mutations have been detected in the MAPK or PI3K pathways, most typically inKITandMTORand low genome-wide methylation has been demonstrated in germinoma; this most likely reflects the cell-of-origin primordial germ cells for this tumor type. These alterations can also be leveraged for liquid biopsies of cell-free DNA and may potentially be targeted for treatment in the future. Advancements in basic research will be translated into clinical practice and can directly impact patient management. Additional understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of GCTs will lead to the development of better-stratified clinical trials, ultimately resulting in improved treatment outcomes and a reduction in long-term treatment-related adverse effects.Copyright © 2022 Takami and Ichimura."

However, the precise location and sequence context of 4mC in the whole genome are limited. In this study, we developed an APOBEC3A-mediated deamination sequencing (4mC-AMD-seq) method for genome-wide mapping of 4mC at single-base resolution. In the 4mC-AMD-seq method, cytosine and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) are deaminated by APOBEC3A (A3A) protein to generate uracil and thymine, both of which are read as thymine in sequencing, while 4mC is resistant to deamination and therefore read as cytosine. Thus, the readouts of cytosines from sequencing could manifest the original 4mC sites in genomes. With the 4mC-AMD-seq method, we achieved the genome-wide mapping of 4mC inDeinococcus radiodurans(D. radiodurans). In addition, we confirmed that 4mC, but not 5mC, was the major modification in theD. radioduransgenome. We identified 1586 4mC sites in the genome ofD. radiodurans, among which 564 sites were located in the CCGCGG motif. The average methylation levels in the CCGCGG motif and non-CCGCGG sequence were 70.0% and 22.8%, respectively. We envision that the 4mC-AMD-seq method will facilitate the investigation of 4mC functions, including the 4mC-involved R-M systems, in uncharacterized but potentially useful strains.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry."
"36127735","DNA methylation underpins the epigenomic landscape regulating genome transcription in Arabidopsis.","Genome Biol","It is challenging to determine the effect of DNA methylation on the epigenetic landscape and the function in higher organisms due to the lack of DNA methylation-free mutants.Here, the analysis of a recently generated Arabidopsis mutant completely devoid of DNA methylation reveals that DNA methylation underpins the genome-wide landscape of histone modifications. Complete loss of DNA methylation causes an upheaval of the histone modification landscape, including complete loss of H3K9me2 and widespread redistribution of active and H3K27me3 histone marks, mostly owing to the role of DNA methylation in initiating H3K9me2 deposition and excluding active marks and repressive mark H3K27me3; CG and non-CG methylation can act independently at some genomic regions while they act cooperatively at many other regions. The transcriptional reprogramming upon loss of all DNA methylation correlates with the extensive redistribution or switches of the examined histone modifications. Histone modifications retained or gained in the DNA methylation-free mutant serve as DNA methylation-independent transcriptional regulatory signals: active marks promote genome transcription, whereas the repressive mark H3K27me3 compensates for the lack of DNA hypermethylation/H3K9me2 at multiple transposon families.Our results show that an intact DNA methylome constitutes the scaffolding of the epigenomic landscape in Arabidopsis and is critical for controlled genome transcription and ultimately for proper growth and development.© 2022.

We investigated whether blood and buccal cells could be viable surrogates for myocardium.We measured epigenome-wide DNA methylation at 866,895 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites in blood (n=3), buccal cells (n=3), and right ventricular myocardium (n=4) collected from infants with TOF and compared the percent of differentially methylated CpG sites across tissue types. Gene-specific DNA methylation profiles were also analyzed for ten representative genes associated with heart development. Welch's ANOVAs compared general methylation between tissue types.Comparison of DNA methylation profiles across blood, buccal, and myocardium suggested myocardium and buccal samples were most similar, differing in DNA methylation at only 1.3% (11,386) of CpG sites whereas myocardium and blood were most dissimilar, having 146,857 statistically dissimilar methylated CpG sites (~17% dissimilarity; adjusted p < 0.01 for each site). Buccal swabs were significantly more variable (p < .001) than either blood or myocardial samples. In gene-specific analyses, SCO2, GATA4, NOTCH4, WNT7A, and DKK2 showed conserved DNA methylation profiles across tissue types, while HAND1, JAG1, NKX2-5, TBX5 and TBX20 showed more distinctive tissue-specific patterns of DNA methylation.Compared with blood, buccal tissue more closely mirrors the myocardial methylome, with >10-fold similarity. Nevertheless, both buccal and blood tissue capture highly conserved DNA methylation patterns at specific genetic loci related to cardiac development. Buccal cheek swabs may be a useful surrogate tissue type for future investigations of TOF-specific epigenetic profiles.© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"36114205","Imprinting fidelity in mouse iPSCs depends on sex of donor cell and medium formulation.","Nat Commun","Reprogramming of somatic cells into induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) is a major leap towards personalised approaches to disease modelling and cell-replacement therapies. However, we still lack the ability to fully control the epigenetic status of iPSCs, which is a major hurdle for their downstream applications. Epigenetic fidelity can be tracked by genomic imprinting, a phenomenon dependent on DNA methylation, which is frequently perturbed in iPSCs by yet unknown reasons. To try to understand the causes underlying these defects, we conducted a thorough imprinting analysis using IMPLICON, a high-throughput method measuring DNA methylation levels, in multiple female and male murine iPSC lines generated under different experimental conditions. Our results show that imprinting defects are remarkably common in iPSCs, but their nature depends on the sex of donor cells and their response to culture conditions. Imprints in female iPSCs resist the initial genome-wide DNA demethylation wave during reprogramming, but ultimately cells accumulate hypomethylation defects irrespective of culture medium formulations. In contrast, imprinting defects on male iPSCs depends on the experimental conditions and arise during reprogramming, being mitigated by the addition of vitamin C (VitC). Our findings are fundamental to further optimise reprogramming strategies and generate iPSCs with a stable epigenome.© 2022. The Author(s)."

DNA methylation may be a mechanism, but few studies directly tested mediation. These few integrative studies are reviewed along with studies from three research areas: prenatal maternal stress and child mental health, prenatal maternal stress and child DNA methylation, and child mental health and DNA methylation.We conducted a narrative review of articles in each research area and the few published integrative studies to evaluate the state of knowledge.Prenatal maternal stress was related to greater offspring internalizing and externalizing symptoms and to greater offspring peripheral DNA methylation of the NR3C1 gene. Youth mental health problems were also related to NR3C1 hypermethylation while epigenome-wide studies identified genes involved in nervous system development. Integrative studies focused on infant outcomes and did not detect significant mediation by DNA methylation though methodological considerations may partially explain these null results.Operationalization of prenatal maternal stress and child mental health varied greatly. The few published integrative studies did not report conclusive evidence of mediation by DNA methylation.DNA methylation likely mediates the association between prenatal maternal stress and child mental health. This conclusion still needs to be tested in a larger number of integrative studies. Key empirical and statistical considerations for future research are discussed. Understanding the consequences of prenatal maternal stress and its pathways of influence will help prevention and intervention efforts and ultimately promote well-being for both mothers and children.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

"36112508","Genome-wide analysis of DNaseI hypersensitivity unveils open chromatin associated with histone H3 modifications after areca nut with lime exposure.","Mutagenesis","Research over the years revealed that precocious anaphase, securin overexpression, and genome instability in both target and nontarget cells are significantly associated with the increased risk of areca nut (AN) and lime-induced oral, esophageal, and gastric cancers. Further, hyperphosphorylation of Rb and histone H3 epigenetic modifications both globally and in the promoter region of the securin gene were demonstrated after AN + lime exposure. This study aims whether the extract of raw AN + lime relaxes chromatin structure which further facilitates the histone H3 epigenetic modifications during the initial phase of carcinogenesis. Three groups of mice (10 in each group) were used. The treated group consumed 1 mg/day/mice of AN extract with lime ad libitum in the drinking water for 60 days. The dose was increased by 1 mg every 60 days. Isolated nuclei were digested with DNaseI and 2 kb and below DNA was eluted from the agarose gel, purified and PCR amplified by using securin and GAPDH primers. Securin and E2F1 expression, pRb phosphorylation, and histone epigenetic modifications were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The number of DNA fragments within 2 kb in size after DNaseI treatment was higher significantly in AN + lime exposed tissue samples than in the untreated one. The PCR result showed that the number of fragments bearing securin gene promoter and GAPDH gene was significantly higher in AN + lime exposed DNaseI-treated samples. Immunohistochemistry data revealed increased Rb hyperphosphorylation, upregulation of E2F1, and securin in the AN + lime-treated samples. Increased trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 and acetylation of H3 lysine 9 and 18 were observed globally in the treated samples. Therefore, the results of this study have led to the hypothesis that AN + lime exposure relaxes the chromatin, changes the epigenetic landscape, and deregulates the Rb-E2F1 circuit which might be involved in the upregulation of securin and some other proto-oncogenes that might play an important role in the initial phases of AN + lime mediated carcinogenesis.© The Author(s) 2022.

There is also growing evidence for the prominent role of DNA methylation (DNAm) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).We studied sex-specific DNA methylation differences in the blood samples of AD subjects compared to cognitively normal subjects, by performing sex-specific meta-analyses of two large blood-based epigenome-wide association studies (ADNI and AIBL), which included DNA methylation data for a total of 1284 whole blood samples (632 females and 652 males). Within each dataset, we used two complementary analytical strategies, a sex-stratified analysis that examined methylation to AD associations in male and female samples separately, and a methylation-by-sex interaction analysis that compared the magnitude of these associations between different sexes. After adjusting for age, estimated immune cell type proportions, batch effects, and correcting for inflation, the inverse-variance fixed-effects meta-analysis model was used to identify the most consistent DNAm differences across datasets. In addition, we also evaluated the performance of the sex-specific methylation-based risk prediction models for AD diagnosis using an independent external dataset.In the sex-stratified analysis, we identified 2 CpGs, mapped to the PRRC2A and RPS8 genes, significantly associated with AD in females at a 5% false discovery rate, and an additional 25 significant CpGs (21 in females, 4 in males) at P-value < 1×10-5. In methylation-by-sex interaction analysis, we identified 5 significant CpGs at P-value < 10-5. Out-of-sample validations using the AddNeuroMed dataset showed in females, the best logistic prediction model included age, estimated immune cell-type proportions, and methylation risk scores (MRS) computed from 9 of the 23 CpGs identified in AD vs. CN analysis that are also available in AddNeuroMed dataset (AUC = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65-0.83). In males, the best logistic prediction model included only age and MRS computed from 2 of the 5 CpGs identified in methylation-by-sex interaction analysis that are also available in the AddNeuroMed dataset (AUC = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56-0.82).Overall, our results show that the DNA methylation differences in AD are largely distinct between males and females. Our best-performing sex-specific methylation-based prediction model in females performed better than that for males and additionally included estimated cell-type proportions. The significant discriminatory classification of AD samples with our methylation-based prediction models demonstrates that sex-specific DNA methylation could be a predictive biomarker for AD. As sex is a strong factor underlying phenotypic variability in AD, the results of our study are particularly relevant for a better understanding of the epigenetic architecture that underlie AD and for promoting precision medicine in AD.© 2022.

"36106794","Site-specific decreases in DNA methylation in replicating cells following exposure to oxidative stress.","Hum Mol Genet","Oxidative stress is a common feature of inflammation-driven cancers, and promotes genomic instability and aggressive tumour phenotypes. It is known that oxidative stress transiently modulates gene expression through the oxidation of transcription factors and associated regulatory proteins. Neutrophils are our most abundant white blood cells and accumulate at sites of infection and inflammation. Activated neutrophils produce hypochlorous acid and chloramines, which can disrupt DNA methylation by oxidising methionine. The goal of the current study was to determine whether chloramine exposure results in sequence-specific modifications in DNA methylation that enable long-term alterations in transcriptional output. Proliferating Jurkat T-lymphoma cells were exposed to sublethal doses of glycine chloramine and differential methylation patterns were compared using Illumina EPIC 850 K bead chip arrays. There was a substantial genome-wide decrease in methylation four hours after exposure that correlated with altered RNA expression for 24 and 48 hours, indicating sustained impacts on exposed cells. A large proportion of the most significant differentially methylated CpG sites were situated towards chromosomal ends, suggesting that these regions are most susceptible to inhibition of maintenance DNA methylation. This may contribute to epigenetic instability of chromosomal ends in rapidly dividing cells, with potential implications for the regulation of telomere length and cellular longevity.© The Author(s) 2022.

Epigenetic mechanisms are good candidates to explain the molecular links between the two phenomena, but recent reports have also revealed considerable differences, particularly regarding the loss of DNA methylation in the two processes. The large-scale generation and availability of genome-wide epigenetic data now permits systematic studies to be undertaken which may help clarify the similarities and differences between aging and cancer epigenetic alterations. In addition, the development of epigenetic clocks provides a new dimension in which to investigate diseases at the molecular level. Here, we examine current and future questions about the roles of DNA methylation mechanisms as causal factors in the processes of aging and cancer so that we may better understand if and how aging-associated epigenetic alterations lead to tumorigenesis. It seems certain that comprehending the molecular mechanisms underlying epigenetic clocks, especially with regard to somatic stem cell aging, combined with applying single-cell epigenetic-age profiling technologies to aging and cancer cohorts, and the integration of existing and upcoming epigenetic evidence within the genetic damage models of aging will prove to be crucial to improving understanding of these two interrelated phenomena.© 2022 The Authors.

Studies in the Asian population are lacking.To examine the association of cord blood genome-wide DNA methylation (GWDm) changes with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and children's BMI-z score at preschool age. Additionally, we also explored the genome-wide differentially methylated regions and differentially methylated probes between preschoolers with overweight/obesity and normal-weight counterparts.This two-stage study design included (1) a GWDm analysis of 30 mother-child pairs from 633 participants of the Zhuhai birth cohort with data on newborn cord blood, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, and children's BMI at 3 years of age; and (2) a targeted validation analysis of the cord blood of ten children with overweight/obesity and ten matched controls to validate the CpG sites.In the first stage, no significant CpG sites were found to be associated with children's BMI-z score at preschool age after FDR correction with the p-values of the CpG sites in FOXN3 (cg23501836) and ZNF264 (cg27437574) being close to 1 × 10-6. In the second stage, a significant difference of CpG sites in AHRR (chr5:355067-355068) and FOXN3 (chr14: 89630264-89630272 and chr14: 89630387-89630388) was found between the ten children with overweight/obesity and ten controls (p < 0.05). The CpG sites in FOXN3 (chr14:89630264-89630272 and chr14:89630295-89630296) and ZNF264 (chr19: 57703104-57703107 and chr19: 57703301-57703307) were associated with children's BMI-z score; and the CpG sites in FOXN3 (chr14: 89630264-89630272 and chr14: 89630387-89630388) were associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.DNA methylation in FOXN3 and AHRR is associated with overweight/obesity in preschool-aged children, and the methylation in FOXN3 and ZNF264 might be associated with children's BMI-z score. FOXN3 methylation may be associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, suggesting its potential role in the children's BMI-z score or overweight/obesity.

In this study, we profiled m6As in spikelets transcriptome at the flowering stage of hexaploid wheat and found that m6As are evenly distributed across the A, B, and D subgenomes but their extents and locations vary across homeologous genes. m6As are enriched in homeologous genes with close expression levels and the m6A methylated genes are more conserved. The extent of m6A methylation is negatively correlated with mRNA expression levels and its presence on mRNAs has profound impacts on mRNA translation in a location-dependent manner. Specifically, m6As within coding sequences and 3'UTRs repress the translation of mRNAs while the m6As within 5'UTRs and start codons could promote it. The m6A-containing mRNAs are significantly enriched in processes and pathways of ""translation"" and ""RNA transport,"" suggesting the potential role of m6As in regulating the translation of genes involved in translation regulation. Our data also show a stronger translation inhibition by small RNAs (miRNA and phasiRNA) than by m6A methylation, and no synergistical effect between the two was observed. We propose a secondary amplification machinery of translation regulation triggered by the changes in m6A methylation status. Taken together, our results suggest translation regulation as a key role played by m6As in hexaploid wheat.Copyright © 2022 Huang, He, Li, Zhang, Liao, Song and Yang."

The jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing proteins are demethylases that are involved in regulating epigenetic modification in plants. In our study, the JmjC genes inTriticum aestivumL.,Triticum turgidumL.,Triticum dicoccoidesL.,Triticum urartuL., andAegilops tauschiiL. were identified. Phylogenetic relationship and colinearity analysis revealed that the wheat JmjC genes were conserved in A, B, and D subgenomes during evolution.Cis-acting elements analysis showed that elements related to stress response, hormone response, and light response were found in wheat JmjC genes. The expression of JmjC genes was affected by tissue types and developmental stages, and members of the same subfamily tended to have similar expression patterns in wheat. They also showed a unique expression pattern in root during PEG (Polyethylene glycol) treatment. In conclusion, comprehensive analysis indicated that three members (Tr-1A-JMJ2,Tr-1B-JMJ2, andTr-1D-JMJ2) might be regulated by several hormones and function in the early stages of drought stress, while eight members (Tr-1B-JMJ3,Tr-4B-JMJ1,Tr-7A-JMJ1, etc.) displayed a significantly high expression after 24 h of PEG treatment, indicating a role in the later stages of drought stress.

Among the differentially expressed transcripts, 200 mRNAs and 12 lncRNAs were upregulated, and 144 mRNAs and eight lncRNAs were downregulated. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs showed that genes involved in immune stimulation, especially those for T-cell activation, were upregulated, whereas genes involved in negative immune response regulation were downregulated. Coexpression analysis revealed that the targeted upregulated genes of differentially expressed lncRNA were similarly closely related to immune activation, especially T-cell activation. Methylation analysis showed inhibitor patients exhibited a slightly lower methylation status in the CpG islands, 5' untranslated region, and exon regions (p < 0.01). Genes with differentially methylated regions were also related to T-cell activation.There is an upregulation of genes involved in activation of the immune system in hemophilia A patients with inhibitors.

Although the genetic basis and molecular mechanisms of growth-related traits have been widely investigated in the oyster, the role of DNA methylation involved in growth regulation remains largely unexplored. In this study, we performed a comparative DNA methylome analysis of two selectively bred C. gigas strains with contrasted phenotypes in growth and shell color based on whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation at the single-base resolution revealed that DNA methylations were widely spread across the genome with obvious hotspots, coinciding with the distribution of genes and repetitive elements. Higher methylation levels were observed within genic regions compared with intergenic and promoter regions. Comparative analysis of DNA methylation allowed the identification of 339,604 differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) clustering in 27,600 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Functional annotation analysis identified 11,033 genes from DMRs which were enriched in biological processes including cytoskeleton system, cell cycle, signal transduction, and protein biosynthesis. Integrative analysis of methylome and transcriptome profiles revealed a positive correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation within gene-body regions. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of differentially expressed and methylated genes allowed for the identification of integrin beta-6 (homolog of human ITGB3) as a hub modulator of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway that was involved in various growth-related processes. This work provided insights into epigenetic regulation of growth in oysters and will be valuable resources for studying DNA methylation in invertebrates.© 2022.

"36084135","Conditional GWAS of non-CG transposon methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana reveals major polymorphisms in five genes.","PLoS Genet","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed that the striking natural variation for DNA CHH-methylation (mCHH; H is A, T, or C) of transposons has oligogenic architecture involving major alleles at a handful of known methylation regulators. Here we use a conditional GWAS approach to show that CHG-methylation (mCHG) has a similar genetic architecture-once mCHH is statistically controlled for. We identify five key trans-regulators that appear to modulate mCHG levels, and show that they interact with a previously identified modifier of mCHH in regulating natural transposon mobilization."
"36083902","Heat selection enables highly scalable methylome profiling in cell-free DNA for noninvasive monitoring of cancer patients.","Sci Adv","Genome-wide analysis of cell-free DNA methylation profile is a promising approach for sensitive and specific detection of many cancers. However, scaling such assays for clinical translation is impractical because of the high cost of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. We show that the small fraction of GC-rich genome is highly enriched in CpG sites and disproportionately harbors most of the cancer-specific methylation signature. Here, we report on the simple and effective heat enrichment of CpG-rich regions for bisulfite sequencing (Heatrich-BS) platform that allows for focused methylation profiling in these highly informative regions. Our novel method and bioinformatics algorithm enable accurate tumor burden estimation and quantitative tracking of colorectal cancer patient's response to treatment at much reduced sequencing cost suitable for frequent monitoring. We also show tumor epigenetic subtyping using Heatrich-BS, which could enable patient stratification. Heatrich-BS holds great potential for highly scalable screening and monitoring of cancer using liquid biopsy."
"36082629","Twin study: Genetic and epigenetic factors affecting circulating adiponectin levels.","J Clin Endocrinol Metab","Clarification of the association among phenotypes, genetic and environmental factors with clinical laboratory traits can reveal the cause of diseases and assist in developing methods for the prediction and prevention of diseases. It is difficult to investigate the environmental effect on phenotypes using individual samples because their genetic and environmental factors differ, but we can easily investigate the influence of environmental factors using monozygotic (MZ) twins because they have the same genetic factor.We aimed to examine the methylation level of CpG sites as an environmental factor affecting adiponectin levels on the basis of the same genetic background using MZ twins and to identify the epigenetic factors related to adiponectin levels and the genetic factors associated with sensitivity to acquired changes in adiponectin.Using two groups built from each twin of 232 MZ twin pairs, we performed a replicated epigenome-wide association study to clarify the epigenetic factors affecting adiponectin levels adjusted by genetic risk score. Moreover, we divided twin pairs into concordant and discordant for adiponectin levels. We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify a genetic background specific for discordance.Methylation levels at 38 CpG sites were reproducibly associated with adjusted adiponectin levels, and some of these CpG sites were in genes related to adiponectin, including CDH13. Some genes related to adiponectin or insulin resistance were found to be genetic factors specific for discordance.We clarified specific epigenetic factors affecting adiponectin levels and genetic factors associated with sensitivity to acquired changes in adiponectin.© The Author(s) 2022.

Genome-wide DNA methylome using the cancer genome atlas-bladder cancer (TCGA-BLCA) datasets (primary tumors = 374 and normal tissues = 37) was performed for 154 DDR genes. The most two significant differentially methylated genes, Retinoblastoma binding protein 8 (RBBP8) and MutS homologue 4 (MSH4), between primary tumors and normal tissues of TCGA-BLCA were validated by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in UBC (n = 70) compared to normal tissues (n = 30). RBBP8 and MSH4 expression was measured using qRT-PCR. We developed a predictive model for therapeutic response based on the RBBP8- and MSH4-methylation along with patients' clinical features. Then, we assessed the prognostic significance of RBBP8 and MSH4. RBBP8- and MSH4 methylation and corresponding gene downregulation significantly associated with muscle-invasive phenotype, prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and increased susceptibility to cisplatin chemotherapy in UBC. Promoter methylation of RBBP8 and MSH4 was positively correlated with each other and with their corresponding gene repression. The best machine-learning classification model predicted UBC patients' response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy with an accuracy of 90.05 ± 4.5%. Epigenetic inactivation of RBBP8 and MSH4 in UBC could sensitize patients to DNA-damaging agents. A predictive machine-learning modeling approach based on the clinical features along with RBBP8- and MSH4-methylation might be a promising tool for stratification of UBC responders from nonresponders to chemotherapy.© 2022.

"36075396","Sex-based comparison of CD4+ T cell DNA methylation in lupus reveals proinflammatory epigenetic changes in men.","Clin Immunol","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is more common in women than men, but the disease is more severe when it affects men. Lupus CD4+ T cells demonstrate dysregulated DNA methylation patterns. The purpose of this study was to investigate genome-wide CD4+ T cell differential DNA methylation between men (n = 12) and women (n = 10) with SLE. DNA methylation was evaluated using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array, and differences between male versus female SLE patients were calculated with probe-wise linear regressions with adjustment for age and disease activity. We identified 198 hypomethylated and 108 hypermethylated CpG sites in CD4+ T cells isolated from male compared to female SLE patients, annotated to 201 and 102 genes, respectively. A great proportion of these genes were related to apoptosis and immune functions. Among differentially methylated genes, CASP10, which is involved in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and multiple genes involved in T cell function and differentiation such as ELAVL1, UHRF1, and SMAD2, were hypomethylated in men compared to women with SLE. Importantly, network analysis of differentially methylated genes revealed a pattern consistent with increased activation of ROCK, PP2A, PI3K, and ERK1/ERK2 in men compared to women with SLE. These data provide epigenetic evidence suggesting activation of key T cell pathways in men compared to women with SLE and shed new light into possible mechanisms underlying increased SLE disease severity in men.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

"36072677","Significance of ZEB2 in the immune microenvironment of colon cancer.","Front Genet","Background:ZEB2 is a protein-coding gene that is differentially expressed in tumors and can regulate the growth of tumor cells. This study investigated the specific regulatory mechanism of ZEB2 in COAD, a common cancer with high rates of morbidity and mortality.Methods:Multi-omics panoramic display of expression and function of ZEB2 in colon cancer. R software was used to study the expression of ZEB2 in 33 types of cancer. Furthermore, RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of ZEB2 in colon cancers and para-cancer tissues, as well as in colon cancer cells and normal cells. The ssGSEA was then used to explore the relationship between ZEB2 and immune cells, with UALCAN, EWAS and MEXPRESS applied to explore the methylation of ZEB2. The relationship between immunomodulators and chemokines (or receptors) based on expression data, copy number data, methylation data, and mutation data of ZEB2 was investigated using TISIDB. Finally, a protein interaction network of ZEB2 was constructed, and GO and KEGG analyses were performed on the differentially expressed genes.Results:ZEB2 is downregulated in most cancers, including COAD. The infiltration of the immune cells NK CD56 and Th17 cells was negatively correlated with ZEB2 expression, while the other 22 cells were positively correlated with ZEB2 expression. The DNA methylation of ZEB2 and the methylation of the ZEB2 protein on the EWAS website increased significantly. Analysis of the methylation levels and ZEB2 expression revealed that only the DNA methylation level and the expression of ZEB2 were significantly negatively correlated. The tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes positively correlated with the expression of ZEB2 but negatively correlated with the methylation of ZEB2. The same trend was observed for immunomodulators, chemokines, and receptors. The network showed that the protein performed certain biological functions, thereby affecting disease symptoms.Conclusion:These findings provide evidence that ZEB2-based therapy may represent a powerful treatment strategy for COAD.Copyright © 2022 Xie, Wu, Li, Huang, Zou and Zhou."

The aim of the study was to investigate the role of epigenetics in CH pathogenesis.A genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed on the peripheral blood of 23 twin pairs (10 monozygotic and 13 dizygotic), 4 concordant and 19 discordant pairs for CH at birth.Differential methylation analysis did not show significant differences in methylation levels between CH cases and controls, but a different methylation status of several genes may explain the CH discordance of a monozygotic twin couple carrying a monoallelic nonsense mutation of DUOX2. In addition, the median number of hypo-methylated Stochastic Epigenetic Mutations (SEMs) resulted significantly increased in cases compared to controls. The prioritization analysis for CH performed on the genes epimutated exclusively in the cases identified SLC26A4, FOXI1, NKX2-5 and TSHB as the genes with the highest score. The analysis of significantly SEMs-enriched regions led to the identification of two genes (FAM50B and MEG8) that resulted epigenetically dysregulated in cases.Epigenetic modifications may potentially account for CH pathogenesis and explain discordance among monozygotic twins.© 2022.

"36071044","Derivation and validation of an epigenetic frailty risk score in population-based cohorts of older adults.","Nat Commun","DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns in peripheral blood have been shown to be associated with aging related health outcomes. We perform an epigenome-wide screening to identify CpGs related to frailty, defined by a frailty index (FI), in a large population-based cohort of older adults from Germany, the ESTHER study. Sixty-five CpGs are identified as frailty related methylation loci. Using LASSO regression, 20 CpGs are selected to derive a DNAm based algorithm for predicting frailty, the epigenetic frailty risk score (eFRS). The eFRS exhibits strong associations with frailty at baseline and after up to five-years of follow-up independently of established frailty risk factors. These associations are confirmed in another independent population-based cohort study, the KORA-Age study, conducted in older adults. In conclusion, we identify 65 CpGs as frailty-related loci, of which 20 CpGs are used to calculate the eFRS with predictive performance for frailty over long-term follow-up.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The study aims to investigate if aberrant epigenetic DNA methylation changes may be a potential mechanism for regulating neighborhood exposures and health outcomes.Exposure to environmental stressors identified in 98 young African American (AA) adults aged 18-25 years old from the Washington D.C., area were used in the study. We correlated the association between stress markers; cortisol, CRP, IgG, IGA, IgM, and self-reported exposure to violence and stress, with quantitative DNA methylation changes in a panel of gene-specific loci using saliva DNA.In all participants studied, the exposure to violence was significant and negatively correlated with DNA methylation of MST1R loci (p = 0.032; r = -0.971) and nominally significant with NR3C1 loci (p = 0.053; r = -0.948). In addition, we observed significant and negative correlation of DNA methylation changes of LINE1 (p = 0.044; r = -0.248); NR3C1 (p = 0.017; r = -0.186); MSTR1 (p = 0.022; r = -0.192); and DRD2 (p = 0.056; r = -0.184; albeit nominal significant correlation) with IgA expression. On the other hand, we observed a significant and position correlation of DNA methylation changes in DRD2 (p = 0.037; r = 0.184) with IgG expression. When participants were stratified by sex, we observed in AA young male adults, significant DNA methylation changes of MST1R (p< 0.05) and association with exposure to violence and IgG level. We also observed significant DNA methylation levels of DRD2 (p< 0.05) and association with IgA, IgG, and cortisol level. Furthermore, we observed significant DNA methylation changes of NR3C1 (p< 0.05) with stress, IgA, and IgG in the male participants only. On the other hand, we only observed significant and a positive association of IgG with DNA methylation levels of ESR1 (p = 0.041) in the young AA female participants.Our preliminary observation of significant DNA methylation changes in neuronal and immune genes in saliva samples supports our recently published genome-wide DNA methylations changes in blood samples from young AA male adults indicating that saliva offers a non-invasive means for DNA methylation prediction of exposure to environmental stressors in a gender-specific manner."
"36066769","Computational discovery of novel inhibitory candidates targeting versatile transcriptional repressor MBD2.","J Mol Model","Genome methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism in various biological events such as development, cellular differentiation, cancer progression, aging, and iPSC reprogramming. Crosstalk between DNA methylation and gene expression is mediated by MBD2, known as the reader of DNA methylation and suggested as a drug target. Despite its magnitude of significance, a scarcely limited number of small molecules to be used as inhibitors have been detected so far. Therefore, we screened a comprehensive compound library to elicit MBD2 inhibitor candidates. Promising molecules were subjected to computational docking analysis by targeting the methylated DNA-binding domain of human MBD2. We could detect reasonable binding energies and docking residues, presumably located in druggable pockets. Docking results were also validated via MD simulation and per-residue energy decomposition calculation. Drug-likeness of these small molecules was assessed through ADMET prediction to foresee off-target side effects for future studies. All computational approaches notably highlighted two compounds named CID3100583 and 8,8-ethylenebistheophylline. These compounds have become prominent as novel candidates, possibly disrupting MBD2MBD-DNA interaction. Consequently, these compounds have been considered prospective inhibitors with the usage potential in a wide range of applications from cancer treatment to somatic cell reprogramming protocols.© 2022.

"36066721","Histone Modification Analysis of Low-Mappability Regions.","Methods Mol Biol","Posttranslational modifications of histone are intimately related to chromatin/chromosome-mediated cellular events. Among all, the roles of histone modifications including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation of lysine or arginine residue of nucleosome core histones in gene expression have been intensively studied. Genome-wide profiles of histone modification marks revealed their combinatorial organization in the functional features of chromatin. Analysis of histone modification by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is one of the standard assays to examine chromatin states. Although high-throughput sequencing analysis (ChIP-seq) is now widely conducted, classical ChIP-qPCR analysis has advantages in investigation of multiple histone modification marks at a target site simply through the use of relatively small numbers of cells. Since ChIP-qPCR is devoid of biases caused by overamplification and inaccurate mapping of sequencing reads, it is a more reliable quantification method than genome-wide ChIP-seq especially for analyses of the low-mappability regions, which harbor many repetitive sequences and/or highly homologous segmental multiplications as found in gene clusters. We have recently analyzed histone H3 and H4 modifications of the Zscan4 family gene loci in an 880 kb gene cluster and found that the atypical enhancer-like structure is formed upon derepression of Zscan4. In this chapter, we describe the detailed protocols for histone modification ChIP-assay of repeat-enriched gene cluster regions. The protocol here we applied to mouse ES cells, but the protocol is perfectly applicable to human cultured cells and specimens.© 2023.

"36065016","Multi-omics analysis identifies rare variation in leptin/PPAR gene sets and hypermethylation of ABCG1 contribute to antipsychotics-induced metabolic syndromes.","Mol Psychiatry","Antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome (APs-induced Mets) is the most common adverse drug reaction, which affects more than 60% of the psychiatric patients. Although the etiology of APs-induced Mets has been extensively investigated, there is a lack of integrated analysis of the genetic and epigenetic factors. In this study, we performed genome-wide, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and epigenome-wide association studies in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients with or without APs-induced Mets to find the underlying mechanisms, followed by in vitro and in vivo functional validations. By population-based omics analysis, we revealed that rare functional variants across in the leptin and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) gene sets were imbalanced with rare functional variants across the APs-induced Mets and Non-Mets cohort. Besides, we discovered that APs-induced Mets are hypermethylated in ABCG1 (chr21:43642166-43642366, adjusted P < 0.05) than Non-Mets, and hypermethylation of this area was associated with higher TC (total cholesterol) and TG (triglycerides) levels in HepG2 cells. Candidate genes from omics studies were furtherly screened in C. elegans and 17 gene have been verified to associated with olanzapine (OLA) induced fat deposit. Among them, several genes were expressed differentially in Mets cohort and APs-induced in vitro/in vivo models compared to controls, demonstrating the validity of omics study. Overexpression one of the most significant gene, PTPN11, exhibited compromised glucose responses and insulin resistance. Pharmacologic inhibition of PTPN11 protected HepG2 cell from APs-induced insulin resistance. These findings provide important insights into our understanding of the mechanism of the APs-induced Mets.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."

It is well-established that aberrant DNA methylation in cells can lead to carcinogenesis. The primary objective of our study was to investigate the aberrant DNA methylation status of genes associated with stomach cancer with a particular reference to the ethnic population of Mizoram, North East India. The site-level analysis identified 2883 CpG sites differentially methylated, representing ∼922 genes. Out of which 476 Differentially Methylated Positions (DMPs) were promoter-associated, 452 DMPs were hypermethylated, and 24 were hypomethylated. The region-level analysis identified 462 Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) corresponding to ∼320 genes, of which ∼281 genes were hypermethylated and ∼40 genes were hypomethylated. TCGA analysis showed that some of the genes had been previously implicated in other cancers including stomach cancer. Five hypermethylated genes were selected as candidate genes for further investigations and they have shown to be novel and could serve as candidate hypermethylation biomarkers for stomach cancer in this particular ethnic group.Copyright © 2022.

"36061205","DNA methylation as a mediator of genetic and environmental influences on Parkinson's disease susceptibility: Impacts of alpha-Synuclein, physical activity, and pesticide exposure on the epigenome.","Front Genet","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a complex etiology and increasing prevalence worldwide. As PD is influenced by a combination of genetic and environment/lifestyle factors in approximately 90% of cases, there is increasing interest in identification of the interindividual mechanisms underlying the development of PD as well as actionable lifestyle factors that can influence risk. This narrative review presents an outline of the genetic and environmental factors contributing to PD risk and explores the possible roles of cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation in the etiology and/or as early-stage biomarkers of PD, with an emphasis on epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of PD conducted over the past decade. Specifically, we focused on variants in theSNCAgene, exposure to pesticides, and physical activity as key contributors to PD risk. Current research indicates that these factors individually impact the epigenome, particularly at the level of CpG methylation. There is also emerging evidence for interaction effects between genetic and environmental contributions to PD risk, possibly acting across multiple omics layers. We speculated that this may be one reason for the poor replicability of the results of EWAS for PD reported to date. Our goal is to provide direction for future epigenetics studies of PD to build upon existing foundations and leverage large datasets, new technologies, and relevant statistical approaches to further elucidate the etiology of this disease.Copyright © 2022 Schaffner and Kobor."

It is still unclear how DNA methylation regulates the formation of freezing tolerance in winter rapeseed under freezing stress. Therefore, in this study, the whole-genome DNA methylation map and transcriptome expression profiles of freezing-resistant cultivar NTS57 (NS) under freezing stress were obtained. The genome-wide methylation assay exhibited lower levels of methylation in gene-rich regions. DNA methylation was identified in three genomic sequence contexts including CG, CHG and CHH, of which CG contexts exhibited the highest methylation levels (66.8%), followed by CHG (28.6%) and CHH (9.5%). Higher levels of the methylation were found in upstream 2 k and downstream 2 k of gene regions, whereas lowest levels were in the gene body regions. In addition, 331, 437, and 1720 unique differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were identified in three genomic sequence contexts in 17NS under freezing stress compared to the control. Function enrichment analysis suggested that most of enriched DMGs were involved in plant hormones signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and protein processing pathways. Changes of genes expression in signal transduction pathways for cytokinin (CK) and jasmonic acid (JA) implied their involvement in freezing stress responses. Collectively, these results suggested a critical role of DNA methylation in their transcriptional regulation in winter rapeseed under freezing stress.Copyright © 2022 Wei, Shen, Dong, Zhu, Cui, Li, Zheng, Tian, Wang and Liu."
"36060560","An Overview of DNA Methylation Indicators for the Course of Oral Precancer.","Appl Bionics Biomech","DNA methylation is a physiologically epigenetic alteration that happens when a methyl group is introduced to a CpG dinucleotide in the gene-regulating sequence of DNA. However, the majority of oral cancers have a well-defined precancerous stage; there are few clinical and morphological parameters for detecting and signalling the progression of precancerous to malignant tumours. DNA methylation forms are dynamic and reversible, allowing them to adjust to environmental or therapeutic changes. We did an extensive investigation to compile the data supporting aberrant DNA methylation forms as a possible biomarker for prediction. According to two longitudinal studies, p16 hypermethylation was considerably higher in precancerous lesions that progressed to cancer than in lesions that shrank. Most of the studies examined for this study were tiny cross-sectional research with scant validation and inadequately specified control groups. Existing evidence suggests that DNA methylation sequences can be relevant as a diagnostic biomarker for OPS development; however, sample size and research design restrictions make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Strong studies, including extensive epigenome-wide methylation scans of OPS with longitudinal monitoring, are necessary in this study in order to corroborate the recently discovered signals and discover new risk loci and disease progression molecular pathways.Copyright © 2022 Wenjing Wang et al."
"36059621","Aberrant DNA methylation in multiple myeloma: A major obstacle or an opportunity?","Front Oncol","Drug resistance (DR) of cancer cells leading to relapse is a huge problem nowadays to achieve long-lasting cures for cancer patients. This also holds true for the incurable hematological malignancy multiple myeloma (MM), which is characterized by the accumulation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). Although new treatment approaches combining immunomodulatory drugs, corticosteroids, proteasome inhibitors, alkylating agents, and monoclonal antibodies have significantly improved median life expectancy, MM remains incurable due to the development of DR, with the underlying mechanisms remaining largely ill-defined. It is well-known that MM is a heterogeneous disease, encompassing both genetic and epigenetic aberrations. In normal circumstances, epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and posttranslational histone modifications, play an important role in proper chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation. However, in MM, numerous epigenetic defects or so-called 'epimutations' have been observed and this especially at the level of DNA methylation. These include genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, locus specific hypermethylation and somatic mutations, copy number variations and/or deregulated expression patterns in DNA methylation modifiers and regulators. The aberrant DNA methylation patterns lead to reduced gene expression of tumor suppressor genes, genomic instability, DR, disease progression, and high-risk disease. In addition, the frequency of somatic mutations in the DNA methylation modifiers seems increased in relapsed patients, again suggesting a role in DR and relapse. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in understanding the involvement of aberrant DNA methylation patterns and/or DNA methylation modifiers in MM development, progression, and relapse. In addition, we discuss their involvement in MM cell plasticity, driving myeloma cells to a cancer stem cell state characterized by a more immature and drug-resistant phenotype. Finally, we briefly touch upon the potential of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors to prevent relapse after treatment with the current standard of care agents and/or new, promising (immuno) therapies.Copyright © 2022 Muylaert, Van Hemelrijck, Maes, De Veirman, Menu, Vanderkerken and De Bruyne."

While multiple studies document the ability of environmental stressors to alter methylation patterns, there is little information regarding the effects of oil and hypoxia on the methylome. Oil and hypoxic stress are threats in coastal ecosystems, which act as nursery habitats for developing fish. To explore the methylation altering effects of oil and hypoxia on developing fish, we exposed larval Cyprinodon variegatus to oil, hypoxia, or both for 48 h followed by 48 h of depuration in clean, normoxic conditions. We then used immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (MeDIP seq) to evaluate genome-wide methylation changes. We also performed RNA seq to associate methylation and altered transcription. Oil and hypoxia together elicited greater impacts to methylation than either stressor individually. Additionally, the oil+hypoxia treatment exhibited an overlap between differentially methylated regions and differential gene expression at 20 loci. Functional analyses of these loci revealed enrichment of processes related to neurological function and development. Two neurological genes (slc1a2, asxl2) showed altered methylation of promoter CpG islands and transcriptional changes, suggesting epigenetic modulation of gene expression. Our results suggest a possible mechanism explaining altered behavior patterns noted in fish following oil exposure.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier B.V."

However, there is a lack of profiling both epigenome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome for the same patients with PCa at different stages. This study aims to identify epitranscriptomic biomarkers screened in the peri-prostatic (PP) adipose tissue for predicting LPC and LAPC.We profiled gene expression and DNA methylation of 10 PCa patients' PP adipose tissue (4 LPC and 6 LAPC). Differential analysis was used to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and expressed genes. An integrative analysis of the microarray gene expression profiles and DNA methylation profiles was conducted using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) between each studied gene and the CpG sites in their promoter region. This epitranscriptomic signature was constructed by combining the association and differential analyses. The signature was then refined using the genetic mutation data of >1500 primary PCa and metastasis PCa samples from 4 different studies. We determined genes that were the most significantly affected by mutations. Machine learning models were built to evaluate the classification ability of the identified signature using the gene expression profiles from three external cohorts.From the LASSO-based association analysis, we identified 56 genes presenting significant anti-correlation between the expression level and the methylation level of at least one CpG site in the promoter region (p-value<5 × 10-8). From the differential analysis, we detected 16,405 downregulated genes and 9485 genes containing at least one hypermethylated CpG site. We identified 30 genes that showed anti-correlation, down-regulation and hyper-methylation simultaneously. Using genetic mutation data, we determined that 6 of the 30 genes showed significant differences (adjusted p-value<0.05) in mutation frequencies between the primary PCa and metastasis PCa samples. The identified 30 genes performed well in distinguishing PCa patients with metastasis from PCa patient without metastasis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81). The gene signature also performed well in distinguishing PCa patients with high risk of progression from PCa patients with low risk of progression (AUC = 0.88).We established an integrative framework to identify differentially expressed genes with an aberrant methylation pattern on PP adipose tissue that may represent novel candidate molecular markers for distinguishing between LPC and LAPC.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

High temperature negatively impacts the tuberization process, eventually affecting crop yield. DNA methylation plays an important role in various developmental and physiological processes in plants. It is a conserved epigenetic mark determined by the dynamic concurrent action of cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferases (C5-MTases) and demethylases (DeMets). However,C5-MTasesandDeMetsremain unidentified in potato, and their expression patterns are unknown under high temperatures. Here, we performed genome-wide analysis and identified 10 C5-MTases and 8 DeMets in potatoes. Analysis of their conserved motifs, gene structures, and phylogenetic analysis groupedC5-MTasesinto four subfamilies (StMET, StCMT3, StDRM, andStDNMT2) andDeMetsinto three subfamilies (StROS, StDML, andStDME). Promoter analysis showed the presence of multiple cis-regulatory elements involved in plant development, hormone, and stress response. Furthermore, expression dynamics ofC5-MTasesandDeMetswere determined in the different tissues (leaf, flower, and stolon) of heat-sensitive (HS) and heat-tolerant (HT) genotypes under high temperature. qPCR results revealed that high temperature resulted in pronounced upregulation ofCMTandDRMgenes in the HT genotype. Likewise, demethylases showed strong upregulation in HT genotype as compared to HS genotype. Several positive (StSP6AandStBEL5) and negative (StSP5G, StSUT4, andStRAP1) regulators are involved in the potato tuberization. Expression analysis of these genes revealed that high temperature induces the expression of positive regulators in the leaf and stolon samples of HT genotype, possibly through active DNA demethylation and RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway components. Our findings lay a framework for understanding how epigenetic pathways synergistically or antagonistically regulate the tuberization process under high-temperature stress in potatoes. Uncovering such mechanisms will contribute to potato breeding for developing thermotolerant potato varieties.Copyright © 2022 Dutta, Raturi, Gahlaut, Kumar, Sharma, Verma, Gupta, Sood and Zinta."
"36051243","The epitranscriptome of Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 assessed by direct RNA sequencing reveals m6A pattern changes and DRACH motif biases in viral and cellular RNAs.","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","The epitranscriptomics of the SARS-CoV-2 infected cell reveals its response to viral replication. Among various types of RNA nucleotide modifications, the m6A is the most common and is involved in several crucial processes of RNA intracellular location, maturation, half-life and translatability. This epitranscriptome contains a mixture of viral RNAs and cellular transcripts. In a previous study we presented the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA m6A methylation based on direct RNA sequencing and characterized DRACH motif mutations in different viral lineages. Here we present the analysis of the m6A transcript methylation of Vero cells (derived from African Green Monkeys) and Calu-3 cells (human) upon infection by SARS-CoV-2 using direct RNA sequencing data. Analysis of these data by nonparametric statistics and two computational methods (m6anet and EpiNano) show that m6A levels are higher in RNAs of infected cells. Functional enrichment analysis reveals increased m6A methylation of transcripts involved in translation, peptide and amine metabolism. This analysis allowed the identification of differentially methylated transcripts and m6A unique sites in the infected cell transcripts. Results here presented indicate that the cell response to viral infection not only changes the levels of mRNAs, as previously shown, but also its epitranscriptional pattern. Also, transcriptome-wide analysis shows strong nucleotide biases in DRACH motifs of cellular transcripts, both in Vero and Calu-3 cells, which use the signature GGACU whereas in viral RNAs the signature is GAACU. We hypothesize that the differences of DRACH motif biases, might force the convergent evolution of the viral genome resulting in better adaptation to target sequence preferences of writer, reader and eraser enzymes. To our knowledge, this is the first report on m6A epitranscriptome of the SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells by direct RNA sequencing, which is thesensu strictoRNA-seq.Copyright © 2022 Campos, Alves, Maricato, Braconi, Antoneli, Janini and Briones."

Among described epigenetic mechanisms, DNA methylation has been defined as the most studied epigenetic modification involved in several developmental processes. It has been shown that contrasting methylation marks are associated with gene expression variations between cultivated and wild crop species. In this study, we analyzed single-base resolution methylome maps forOryza sativa(a cultivated species) andOryza glumaepatula(a wild species) genotypes grown under control conditions. Our results showed that overall, genome-wide methylation profiles are mainly conserved between both species, nevertheless, there are several differentially methylated regions with species-specific methylation patterns. In addition, we analyzed the association of identified DNA methylation marks in relation with Aluminum-tolerance levels of studied genotypes. We found several differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and DMR-associated genes (DAGs) that are linked with Al tolerance. Some of these DAGs have been previously reported as differentially expressed under Al exposure inO. sativa. Complementarily a Transposable Elements (TE) analysis revealed that specific aluminum related genes have associated-TEs potentially regulated by DNA methylation. Interestingly, the DMRs and DAGs between Al-tolerant and susceptible genotypes were different betweenO. sativaandO. glumaepatula, suggesting that methylation patterns related to Al responses are unique for each rice species. Our findings provide novel insights into DNA methylation patterns in wild and cultivated rice genotypes and their possible role in the regulation of plant stress responses.© 2022 The Authors.

To bypass the inherent redundancy in the network, we have used a microRNA (mir) approach to target multiple members of the chaperome simultaneously. We identified a potent microRNA, miR-570 that could bind the 3'untranslated regions of multiple HSP mRNAs and inhibit HSP synthesis. Transfection of cells with this miR species reduced expression of multiple HSPs, inhibited the heat shock response and reduced tumor cell growth while acted additively in combination with cytotoxic drugs. As overexpression of miR-570 elicited tumor suppressive effects, we inferred that this miR could play a potential role in inhibiting tumorigenesis and cancer cell growth. In accordance with this hypothesis, we determined a significant role for miR-570 in regulating markers of mammary tumor progression, including cell motility and invasion. Our data provide a proof of the principle that the tumor chaperome can be targeted by microRNAs suggesting a potential therapeutic avenue towards cancer therapy.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36091392","The shared mother-child epigenetic signature of neglect is related to maternal adverse events.","Front Physiol","Studies of DNA methylation have revealed the biological mechanisms by which life adversity confers risk for later physical and mental health problems. What remains unknown is the ""biologically embedding"" of maternal adverse experiences resulting in maladaptive parenting and whether these epigenetic effects are transmitted to the next generation. This study focuses on neglectful mothering indexed by a severe disregard for the basic and psychological needs of the child. Using the Illumina Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip in saliva samples, we identified genes with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in those mothers with (n= 51), versus those without (n= 87), neglectful behavior that present similar DMRs patterns in their children being neglected versus non-neglected (n= 40 vs. 75). Mothers reported the emotional intensity of adverse life events. After covariate adjustment and multiple testing corrections, we identified 69 DMRs in the mother epigenome and 42 DMRs in the child epigenome that were simultaneously above the α = 0.01 threshold. The common set of nine DMRs contained genes related to childhood adversity, neonatal and infant diabetes, child neurobehavioral development and other health problems such as obesity, hypertension, cancer, posttraumatic stress, and the Alzheimer's disease; four of the genes were associated with maternal life adversity. Identifying a shared epigenetic signature of neglect linked to maternal life adversity is an essential step in breaking the intergenerational transmission of one of the most common forms of childhood maltreatment.Copyright © 2022 León, Herrero Roldán, Rodrigo, López Rodríguez, Fisher, Mitchell and Lage-Castellanos."
"36064314","DMRscaler: a scale-aware method to identify regions of differential DNA methylation spanning basepair to multi-megabase features.","BMC Bioinformatics","Pathogenic mutations in genes that control chromatin function have been implicated in rare genetic syndromes. These chromatin modifiers exhibit extraordinary diversity in the scale of the epigenetic changes they affect, from single basepair modifications by DNMT1 to whole genome structural changes by PRM1/2. Patterns of DNA methylation are related to a diverse set of epigenetic features across this full range of epigenetic scale, making DNA methylation valuable for mapping regions of general epigenetic dysregulation. However, existing methods are unable to accurately identify regions of differential methylation across this full range of epigenetic scale directly from DNA methylation data.To address this, we developed DMRscaler, a novel method that uses an iterative windowing procedure to capture regions of differential DNA methylation (DMRs) ranging in size from single basepairs to whole chromosomes. We benchmarked DMRscaler against several DMR callers in simulated and natural data comparing XX and XY peripheral blood samples. DMRscaler was the only method that accurately called DMRs ranging in size from 100 bp to 1 Mb (pearson's r = 0.94) and up to 152 Mb on the X-chromosome. We then analyzed methylation data from rare-disease cohorts that harbor chromatin modifier gene mutations in NSD1, EZH2, and KAT6A where DMRscaler identified novel DMRs spanning gene clusters involved in development.Taken together, our results show DMRscaler is uniquely able to capture the size of DMR features across the full range of epigenetic scale and identify novel, co-regulated regions that drive epigenetic dysregulation in human disease.© 2022.

In the management of PD, accurate and specific biomarkers in blood for the early diagnosis of PD are urgently needed. DNA methylation is one of the main epigenetic mechanisms and associated with the gene expression and disease initiation of PD. We aimed to construct a methylation signature for the diagnosis of PD patients, and explore the potential value of DNA methylation in therapeutic options.Whole blood DNA methylation and gene expression data of PD patients as well as healthy controls were extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Next, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs) between PD patients and healthy controls were identified. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator cox regression analysis was carried out to construct a diagnostic signature based on the overlapped genes. And, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess the diagnostic performance of the signature in both the training and testing datasets. Finally, gene ontology and gene set enrichment analysis were subsequently carried out to explore the underlying mechanisms.We obtained a total of 9,596 DMGs, 1,058 DEGs, and 237 overlapped genes in the whole blood between PD patients and healthy controls. Eight methylation-driven genes (HIST1H4L, CDC42EP3, KIT, GNLY, SLC22A1, GCM1, INO80B, and ARHGAP26) were identified to construct the gene expression signature. The AUCs in predicting PD patients were 0.84 and 0.76 in training dataset and testing dataset, respectively. Additionally, eight methylation-altered CpGs were also identified to construct the CpGs signature which showed a similarly robust diagnostic capability, with AUCs of 0.8 and 0.73 in training dataset and testing dataset, respectively.We conducted an integrated analysis of the gene expression and DNA methylation data, and constructed a methylation-driven genes signature and a methylation-altered CpGs signature to distinguish the patients with PD from healthy controls. Both of them had a robust prediction power and provide a new insight into personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for PD.Copyright © 2022 Li, Liang, Guo, Zhang, Wu and Zhang."
"36114581","DNA methylation and aeroallergen sensitization: The chicken or the egg?","Clin Epigenetics","DNA methylation (DNAm) is considered a plausible pathway through which genetic and environmental factors may influence the development of allergies. However, causality has yet to be determined as it is unknown whether DNAm is rather a cause or consequence of allergic sensitization. Here, we investigated the direction of the observed associations between well-known environmental and genetic determinants of allergy, DNAm, and aeroallergen sensitization using a combination of high-dimensional and causal mediation analyses.Using prospectively collected data from the German LISA birth cohort from two time windows (6-10 years: N = 234; 10-15 years: N = 167), we tested whether DNAm is a cause or a consequence of aeroallergen sensitization (specific immunoglobulin E > 0.35kU/l) by conducting mediation analyses for both effect directions using maternal smoking during pregnancy, family history of allergies, and a polygenic risk score (PRS) for any allergic disease as exposure variables. We evaluated individual CpG sites (EPIC BeadChip) and allergy-related methylation risk scores (MRS) as potential mediators in the mediation analyses. We applied three high-dimensional mediation approaches (HIMA, DACT, gHMA) and validated results using causal mediation analyses. A replication of results was attempted in the Swedish BAMSE cohort.Using high-dimensional methods, we identified five CpGs as mediators of prenatal exposures to sensitization with significant (adjusted p < 0.05) indirect effects in the causal mediation analysis (maternal smoking: two CpGs, family history: one, PRS: two). None of these CpGs could be replicated in BAMSE. The effect of family history on allergy-related MRS was significantly mediated by aeroallergen sensitization (proportions mediated: 33.7-49.6%), suggesting changes in DNAm occurred post-sensitization.The results indicate that DNAm may be a cause or consequence of aeroallergen sensitization depending on genomic location. Allergy-related MRS, identified as a potential cause of sensitization, can be considered as a cross-sectional biomarker of disease. Differential DNAm in individual CpGs, identified as mediators of the development of sensitization, could be used as clinical predictors of disease development.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Large cohort studies have associated AMA with increased risks of various pregnancy complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes, which raises great concerns about the adverse effect of AMA on the long-term health of offspring. Specific acquired characteristics of parents can be passed on to descendants through certain molecular mechanisms, yet the underlying connection between AMA-related alterations in parents and that in offspring remains largely uncharted.We profiled the DNA methylomes of paired parental peripheral bloods and cord bloods from 20 nuclear families, including 10 AMA and 10 Young, and additional transcriptomes of 10 paired maternal peripheral bloods and cord bloods.We revealed that AMA induced aging-like changes in DNA methylome and gene expression in both parents and offspring. The expression changes in several genes, such as SLC28A3, were highly relevant to the disorder in DNA methylation. In addition, AMA-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified in mother and offspring groups showed remarkable similarities in both genomic locations and biological functions, mainly involving neuron differentiation, metabolism, and histone modification pathways. AMA-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared by mother and offspring groups were highly enriched in the processes of immune cell activation and mitotic nuclear division. We further uncovered developmental-dependent dynamics for the DNA methylation of intergenerationally correlated DMRs during pre-implantation embryonic development, as well as diverse gene expression patterns during gametogenesis and early embryonic development for those common AMA-related DEGs presenting intergenerational correlation, such as CD24. Moreover, some intergenerational DEGs, typified by HTRA3, also showed the same significant alterations in AMA MII oocyte or blastocyst.Our results reveal potential intergenerational inheritance of both AMA-related DNA methylome and transcriptome and provide new insights to understand health problems in AMA offspring.© 2022 The Authors.

Most LC patients are diagnosed in an advanced stage when the symptoms are obvious, and the prognosis is quite poor. Although low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is a routine clinical examination for early detection of LC, the false-positive rate is over 90%. As one of the intensely studied epigenetic modifications, DNA methylation plays a key role in various diseases, including cancer and other diseases. Hypermethylation in tumor suppressor genes or hypomethylation in oncogenes is an important event in tumorigenesis. Remarkably, DNA methylation usually occurs in the very early stage of malignant tumors. Thus, DNA methylation analysis may provide some useful information about the early detection of LC. In recent years, liquid biopsy has developed rapidly. Liquid biopsy can detect and monitor both primary and metastatic malignant tumors and can reflect tumor heterogeneity. Moreover, it is a minimally invasive procedure, and it causes less pain for patients. This review summarized various liquid biopsies based on DNA methylation for LC. At first, we briefly discussed some emerging technologies for DNA methylation analysis. Subsequently, we outlined cell-free DNA (cfDNA), sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, bronchial aspirates, and bronchial washings DNA methylation-based liquid biopsy for the early detection of LC. Finally, the prognostic value of DNA methylation in cfDNA and sputum and the diagnostic value of other DNA methylation-based liquid biopsies for LC were also analyzed.© 2022. The Author(s)."

How perceived stress relates to the epigenetic clock measure, DNA methylation age acceleration (DNAmAA), is less well understood and existing studies reported inconsistent results. DNAmAA was estimated from five epigenetic clocks (7-CpG, Horvath's, Hannum's, PhenoAge and GrimAge DNAmAA). Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was used as marker of psychological stress. We analyzed data from 1,100 Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II) participants assessed as part of the GendAge study (mean age = 75.6 years, SD = 3.8 years, 52.1% women). In a first step, we replicated well-established associations of perceived stress with morbidity, frailty, and symptoms of depression in the BASE-II cohort studied here. In a second step, we did not find any statistically significant association of perceived stress with any of the five epigenetic clocks in multiple linear regression analyses that adjusted for covariates. Although the body of literature suggests an association between higher DNAmAA and stress or trauma during early childhood, the current study found no evidence for an association of perception of stress with DNAmAA in older people. We discuss possible reasons for the lack of associations and highlight directions for future research.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36110145","Methylation of genes and regulation of inflammatory processes on emotional response in young adults with alcoholic parents.","Brain Behav Immun Health","Many Americans are adult children of an alcoholic parent (ACoA), which can confer an increased risk of trauma and hazardous alcohol use, as well as heritable and environmental genetic influence. Psychological health and related neural activity can be influenced by inflammation responses, but it is not clear how these factors interact regarding risk or resilience to hazardous alcohol use. The goals of this study were to better understand the relationships between current alcohol use and inflammation, how these are modified by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and/or epigenetic modifications of inflammation-associated genes; and how these alter neural reactivity to emotionally-salient stimuli. To do so, ACoA participants were dichotomized as resilient (not engaged in hazardous alcohol use) or vulnerable (currently engaged in hazardous alcohol use). Measures of blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity within regions of interest (ROIs), SNPs and DNA methylation of specific inflammation regulatory genes, and biological markers of inflammation were compared between these groups. Vulnerable ACoAs exhibited higher plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) and greater BOLD activity in the right hippocampus and ventral anterior cingulate cortex in response to emotional cues as well as reduced methylation of CRP and glucocorticoid-related genes. Path analysis revealed significant relationships between alcohol use, SNPs, DNA methylation of inflammatory-related genes, CRP levels, and BOLD activity to emotional stimuli. Taken together, these findings suggest a complex association related to hazardous alcohol use in ACoAs that may predict current inflammation and neural reactivity to emotional stimuli. A better understanding of these associations could direct the future of individual treatment options.© 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc."
"36153327","For whom the bell tolls: psychopathological and neurobiological correlates of a DNA methylation index of time-to-death.","Transl Psychiatry","Psychopathology is a risk factor for accelerated biological aging and early mortality. We examined associations between broad underlying dimensions of psychopathology (reflecting internalizing and externalizing psychiatric symptoms), PTSD, and age-adjusted GrimAge (""GrimAge residuals""), a DNA methylation biomarker of mortality risk relative to age. We also examined neurobiological correlates of GrimAge residuals, including neurocognitive functioning, blood-based biomarkers (of inflammation, neuropathology, metabolic disease), and cortical thickness. Data from two independent trauma-exposed military cohorts (n = 647 [62.9% male, Mage = 52], n = 434 [90% male, Mage = 32]) were evaluated using linear regression models to test associations between GrimAge residuals, psychopathology, and health correlates. Externalizing psychopathology significantly predicted GrimAge residuals in both cohorts (ps < 0.028). PTSD predicted GrimAge residuals in the younger (p = 0.001) but not the older cohort. GrimAge residuals were associated with several neurobiological variables available in the younger cohort, including cognitive disinhibition (padj = 0.021), poorer memory recall (padj = 0.023), cardiometabolic pathology (padj < 0.001), oxidative stress (padj = 0.003), astrocyte damage (padj = 0.021), inflammation (C-reactive protein: padj < 0.001; IL-6: padj < 0.001), and immune functioning (padj < 0.001). A subset of inflammatory and neuropathology analytes were available in the older cohort and showed associations with GrimAge residuals (IL-6: padj < 0.001; TNF-α: padj < 0.001). GrimAge residuals were also associated with reduced cortical thickness in right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (padj = 0.018) and left fusiform gyrus (padj = 0.030), which are related to emotion regulation and facial recognition, respectively. Psychopathology may be a common risk factor for elevated mortality risk. GrimAge could help identify those at risk for adverse health outcomes and allow for early disease identification and treatment.© 2022.

From the Nordic trial, which randomized GBM patients of 60 years or older between two radiotherapy arms (60 Gy or 34 Gy) or temozolomide (TMZ), we selected 59 with good prognostic factors. These selected GBM patients were equally distributed according to treatment and MGMT promoter methylation status but had long or short survival. Methylation profiling with the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip arrays was performed and utilized for methylation-based CNS tumor classification, and pathway enrichment analysis of differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs), as well as calculation of epigenetic age acceleration with three different algorithms, to compare the long and short survival groups. Samples identified by the classifier as non-GBMIDHwildtype were excluded. DMCs between long- and short-term survivors were found in patients with methylatedMGMTpromoter treated with TMZ (123,510), those with unmethylatedMGMTtreated with 60Gy radiotherapy (4,086), and with methylatedMGMTpromoter treated with 34Gy radiotherapy (39,649). Long-term survivors with methylatedMGMTpromoter treated with TMZ exhibited hypermethylation of the Wnt signaling and the platelet activation, signaling, and aggregation pathways. The joint analysis of radiotherapy arms revealed 319 DMCs between long- and short-term survivors with unmethylatedMGMTand none for samples with methylatedMGMTpromoter. An analysis comparing epigenetic age acceleration between patients with long- and short-term survival across all treatment arms showed a decreased epigenetic age acceleration for the latter. We identified DMCs for both TMZ and RT-treated patients and epigenetic age acceleration as a potential prognostic marker, but further systematic analysis of larger patient cohorts is necessary for confirmation of their prognostic and/or predictive properties.Copyright © 2022 Łysiak, Das, Malmström and Söderkvist."

A substantial body of research has shown associations between epigenetic aging and risk of disease, including cancer. Here we aimed to study epigenetic measures of aging and lifestyle-related factors in association with risk of breast cancer.Using data from four prospective case-control studies nested in three cohorts of European ancestry participants, including a total of 1,655 breast cancer cases, we calculated three methylation-based measures of lifestyle factors (body mass index [BMI], tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption) and seven measures of epigenetic aging (Horvath-based, Hannum-based, PhenoAge and GrimAge). All measures were regression-adjusted for their respective risk factors and expressed per standard deviation (SD). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional or unconditional logistic regression and pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age at blood draw, time from blood sample to diagnosis, oestrogen receptor-positivity status and tumour stage.None of the measures of epigenetic aging were associated with risk of breast cancer in the pooled analysis: Horvath 'age acceleration' (AA): OR per SD = 1.02, 95%CI: 0.95-1.10; AA-Hannum: OR = 1.03, 95%CI:0.95-1.12; PhenoAge: OR = 1.01, 95%CI: 0.94-1.09 and GrimAge: OR = 1.03, 95%CI: 0.94-1.12, in models adjusting for white blood cell proportions, body mass index, smoking and alcohol consumption. The BMI-adjusted predictor of BMI was associated with breast cancer risk, OR per SD = 1.09, 95%CI: 1.01-1.17. The results for the alcohol and smoking methylation-based predictors were consistent with a null association. Risk did not appear to substantially vary by age at blood draw, time to diagnosis or tumour characteristics.We found no evidence that methylation-based measures of aging, smoking or alcohol consumption were associated with risk of breast cancer. A methylation-based marker of BMI was associated with risk and may provide insights into the underlying associations between BMI and breast cancer.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Over the last years, accumulating evidence suggest that DNA methylation is a highly dynamic mechanism driven by a balance between methylation by DNMTs and TET-mediated demethylation processes. However, one of the main challenges is to understand the dynamics underlying steady state DNA methylation levels. In this review article, we give an overview of the latest advances highlighting DNA methylation as a dynamic cycling process with a continuous turnover of cytosine modifications. We describe the cooperative actions of DNMT and TET enzymes which combine with many additional parameters including chromatin environment and protein partners to govern 5mC turnover. We also discuss how mathematical models can be used to address variable methylation levels during development and explain cell-type epigenetic heterogeneity locally but also at the genome scale. Finally, we review the therapeutic implications of these discoveries with the use of both epigenetic clocks as predictors and the development of epidrugs that target the DNA methylation/demethylation machinery. Together, these discoveries unveil with unprecedented detail how dynamic is DNA methylation during development, underlying the establishment of heterogeneous DNA methylation landscapes which could be altered in aging, diseases and cancer.Copyright © 2022 Turpin and Salbert."
"36052275","Advancing understanding of maternal age: correlating epigenetic clocks in blood and myometrium.","Epigenetics Commun","Advanced maternal age is currently a term defined by chronological age. However, a group of biomarkers known as epigenetic clocks, which can predict morbidity and mortality, has been used to estimate measures of biological aging. Uterine myometrial function during the process of parturition may be influenced by aging, as labor dystocia, unplanned intrapartum cesarean birth, and postpartum hemorrhage are more common in older individuals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of epigenetic clocks in maternal myometrium and blood for predicting age and to evaluate the correlation of epigenetic age between the tissues.We compared epigenetic age in blood and myometrial samples provided by women undergoing planned cesarean birth at term gestation. Chronological age ranged from 20 to 50 with a median (IQR) age of 35.5(8) years. The MethylationEPIC BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation data, and then epigenetic age was calculated using the Horvath, Hannum, GrimAge, and PhenoAge clocks. Spearman correlations of epigenetic age with chronological age were calculated. We tested the relationship of epigenetic age in maternal blood to epigenetic age in myometrium. Age acceleration, for each clock, was also correlated between tissues. Twenty-seven participants provided samples, and 21 matched specimens were included in the final analysis after quality control. Spearman correlation between maternal chronological age and epigenetic age were significant in three of the four clocks (pan-tissue Horvath, Hannum, and GrimAge), for both myometrium and blood samples. Correlations between blood epigenetic age and maternal age ranged from 0.72 to 0.87 (allp< 0.001). Correlations between myometrial epigenetic age and maternal age were also significant (0.62-0.70,p= 0.002), though lower than correlations seen in blood. Maternal blood epigenetic age also correlated with epigenetic age in myometrium with each of these three clocks 0.60 (p= 0.004, Horvath), 0.63 (p= 0.003, Hannum), and 0.80 (p< 0.001, GrimAge). GrimAge age acceleration had the highest correlation between tissues among the clocks (0.49,p= 0.02).Given the limited sample, this study provides insight into the potential use of epigenetic age derived from blood as a proxy for myometrial epigenetic age, which may be a useful biomarker in estimating myometrial biological age in relationship to myometrial dysfunction. GrimAge outperformed the other tested clocks in terms of concordance of epigenetic age and age acceleration between tissues; however, the Horvath and Hannum clocks may be useful depending on the outcome of interest in pregnancy."
"36046215","Clonal Hematopoiesis and Epigenetic Age Acceleration in Elderly Danish Twins.","Hemasphere","Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is common in the elderly and has been reported to associate with accelerated epigenetic age (AgeAccel), especially intrinsic (ie, cell-type independent) AgeAccel and to a lesser degree extrinsic AgeAccel, which reflects the immune-cell composition of the peripheral blood. We investigated the association between CHIP occurrence and AgeAccel in 154 Danish twin pairs aged 73-90 years (mean 79), using both individual-level and intrapair analyses, the latter to control for shared genetic and environmental factors. Of 308 individuals, 116 carried a CHIP mutation. CHIP carriers had non-significantly increased AgeAccel compared with non-carriers; the strongest association was for the Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA) estimator (CHIP carriers 1.4 years older,P= 0.052). In intrapair analyses, the extrinsic Hannum age estimator showed the strongest association (1.6 years older,P= 0.027). In mutation-specific analyses,TET2mutations were associated with the extrinsic Hannum age estimator in both individual-level (3.0 years older,P= 0.003) and intrapair analyses (2.8 years older,P= 0.05).DNMT3Amutations were associated with IEAA in individual-level (1.9 years older,P= 0.034) but not intrapair analysis (0.9 years,P= 0.41). Analyses of logit-transformed variant allele frequency were generally consistent with these results. Together, these observations indicate that different factors may be driving the expansion ofDNMT3AandTET2clones, respectively.

"36130949","Multi-omic brain and behavioral correlates of cell-free fetal DNA methylation in macaque maternal obesity models.","Nat Commun","Maternal obesity during pregnancy is associated with neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) risk. We utilized integrative multi-omics to examine maternal obesity effects on offspring neurodevelopment in rhesus macaques by comparison to lean controls and two interventions. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from longitudinal maternal blood-derived cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) significantly overlapped with DMRs from infant brain. The DMRs were enriched for neurodevelopmental functions, methylation-sensitive developmental transcription factor motifs, and human NDD DMRs identified from brain and placenta. Brain and cffDNA methylation levels from a large region overlapping mir-663 correlated with maternal obesity, metabolic and immune markers, and infant behavior. A DUX4 hippocampal co-methylation network correlated with maternal obesity, infant behavior, infant hippocampal lipidomic and metabolomic profiles, and maternal blood measurements of DUX4 cffDNA methylation, cytokines, and metabolites. We conclude that in this model, maternal obesity was associated with changes in the infant brain and behavior, and these differences were detectable in pregnancy through integrative analyses of cffDNA methylation with immune and metabolic factors.© 2022.

"36129958","Epigenetic analysis in placentas from sickle cell disease patients reveals a hypermethylation profile.","PLoS One","Pregnancy in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) women is associated to increased risk of clinical and obstetrical complications. Placentas from SCD pregnancies can present increased abnormal findings, which may lead to placental insufficiency, favoring adverse perinatal outcome. These placental abnormalities are well known and reported, however little is known about the molecular mechanisms, such as epigenetics. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the DNA methylation profile in placentas from women with SCD (HbSS and HbSC genotypes), compared to uncomplicated controls (HbAA). We included in this study 11 pregnant women with HbSS, 11 with HbSC and 21 with HbAA genotypes. Illumina Methylation EPIC BeadChip was used to assess the whole placental DNA methylation. Pyrosequencing was used for array data validation and qRT-PCR was applied for gene expression analysis. Our results showed high frequency of hypermethylated CpGs sites in HbSS and HbSC groups with 73.5% and 76.2% respectively, when compared with the control group. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) also showed an increased hypermethylation status for the HbSS (89%) and HbSC (86%) groups, when compared with the control group methylation data. DMRs were selected for methylation validation (4 DMRs-HbSS and 3 DMRs the HbSC groups) and after analyses three were validated in the HbSS group, and none in the HbSC group. The gene expression analysis showed differential expression for the PTGFR (-2.97-fold) and GPR56 (3.0-fold) genes in the HbSS group, and for the SPOCK1 (-2.40-fold) and ADCY4 (1.80-fold) genes in the HbSC group. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that SCD (HbSS and HbSC genotypes) can alter placental DNA methylation and lead to gene expression changes. These changes possibly contribute to abnormal placental development and could impact in the clinical course, especially for the fetus, possibly leading to increased risk of abortion, fetal growth restriction (FGR), stillbirth, small for gestational age newborns and prematurity."
"36052432","Density Control over MBD2 Receptor-Coated Surfaces Provides Superselective Binding of Hypermethylated DNA.","ACS Appl Mater Interfaces","Using the biomarker hypermethylated DNA (hmDNA) for cancer detection requires a pretreatment to isolate or concentrate hmDNA from nonmethylated DNA. Affinity chromatography using a methyl binding domain-2 (MBD2) protein can be used, but the relatively low enrichment selectivity of MBD2 limits its clinical applicability. Here, we developed a superselective, multivalent, MBD2-coated platform to improve the selectivity of hmDNA enrichment. The multivalent platform employs control over the MBD2 surface receptor density, which is shown to strongly affect the binding of DNA with varying degrees of methylation, improving both the selectivity and the affinity of DNAs with higher numbers of methylation sites. Histidine-10-tagged MBD2 was immobilized on gold surfaces with receptor density control by tuning the amount of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (NiNTA)-functionalized thiols in a thiol-based self-assembled monolayer. The required MBD2 surface receptor densities for DNA surface binding decreases for DNA with higher degrees of methylation. Both higher degrees of superselectivity and surface coverages were observed upon DNA binding at increasing methylation levels. Adopting the findings of this study into hmDNA enrichment of clinical samples has the potential to become more selective and sensitive than current MBD2-based methods and, therefore, to improve cancer diagnostics."

Acetylation levels of histones on lysine residues are dynamically regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), which play an essential role in the control of gene expression. However, their role in regulating fruit development and ripening process, especially in pepper (Capsicum annuum), a typical non-climacteric fruit, remains to understand. Herein, we performed genome-wide analyses of the HDAC and HAT family in the pepper, including phylogenetic analysis, gene structure, encoding protein conserved domain, and expression assays. A total of 30 HAT and 15 HDAC were identified from the pepper genome and the number of gene differentiation among species. The sequence and phylogenetic analysis of CaHDACs and CaHATs compared with other plant HDAC and HAT proteins revealed gene conserved and potential genus-specialized genes. Furthermore, fruit developmental trajectory expression profiles showed thatCaHDACandCaHATgenes were differentially expressed, suggesting that some are functionally divergent. The integrative analysis allowed us to propose CaHDAC and CaHAT candidates to be regulating fruit development and ripening-related phytohormone metabolism and signaling, which also accompanied capsaicinoid and carotenoid biosynthesis. This study provides new insights into the role of histone modification mediate development and ripening in non-climacteric fruits.Copyright © 2022 Cai, Xu, Liu, Zeng, Song, Sun, Chen, Deng, Lei, Cao, Chen, Chen, Chen, Chen and Zhu."

ToLCNDV infection disrupts methylation machinery and reactivates TRN1 expression - likely causing abnormal leaf growth pattern. Leaf curl disease of tomato caused by tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) inflicts huge economical loss. Disease symptoms resemble leaf developmental defects including abnormal vein architecture. Leaf vein patterning-related TORNADO1 gene's (SlTRN1) transcript level is augmented in virus-infected leaves. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the upregulation of SlTRN1 in vivo, we have deployed SlTRN1 promoter-reporter transgenic tomato plants and investigated the gene's dynamic expression pattern in leaf growth stages and infection. Expression of the gene was delimited in the vascular tissues and suppressed in fully developed leaves. WRKY16 transcription factor readily activated SlTRN1 promoter in varied sized leaves and upon virus infection, while silencing of WRKY16 gene resulted in dampened promoter activity. Methylation-sensitive PCR analyses confirmed the accumulation of CHH methylation at multiple locations in the SlTRN1 promoter in older leaves. However, ToLCNDV infection reverses the methylation status and restores expression level in the leaf vascular bundle. The virus dampens the level of key maintenance and de novo DNA methyltransferases SlDRM5, SlMET1, SlCMT2 with concomitant augmentation of two DNA demethylases, SlDML1 and SlDML2 levels in SlTRN1 promoter-reporter transgenics. Transient overexpression of SlDML2 mimics the virus-induced hypomethylation state of the SlTRN1 promoter in mature leaves, while silencing of SlDML2 lessens promoter activity. Furthermore, in line with the previous studies, we confirm the crucial role of viral suppressors of RNA silencing AC2 and AC4 proteins in promoting DNA demethylation and directing it to restore activated transcription of SlTRN1. Unusually elevated expression of SlTRN1 may negatively impact normal growth of leaves.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

As a vital vitamin and nutrient source, fruit make up an indispensable and enjoyable component of the human diet. Fruit ripening involves a series of physiological and biochemical changes in, among others, pigmentation, chlorophyll (Chl) degradation, texture, sugar accumulation, and flavor. Growing evidence indicates that the coordinated and ordered trait changes during fruit ripening depend on a complex regulatory network consisting of transcription factors, co-regulators, hormonal signals, and epigenetic modifications. As one of the predominant transcription factor families in plants and a downstream component of ethylene signaling, more and more studies are showing that APETALA2/ethylene responsive factor (AP2/ERF) family transcription factors act as critical regulators in fruit ripening. In this review, we focus on the regulatory mechanisms of AP2/ERFs in fruit ripening, and in particular the recent results on their target genes and co-regulators. We summarize and discuss the role of AP2/ERFs in the formation of key fruit-ripening attributes, the enactment of their regulatory mechanisms by interaction with other proteins, their role in the orchestration of phytohormone-signaling networks, and the epigenetic modifications associated with their gene expression. Our aim is to provide a multidimensional perspective on the regulatory mechanisms of AP2/ERFs in fruit ripening, and a reference for understanding and furthering research on the roles of AP2/ERF in fruit ripening.Copyright © 2022 Zhai, Fan, Cui, Gu, Chen and Ma."
"36046583","Epigenetics and its role in effecting agronomical traits.","Front Plant Sci","Climate-resilient crops with improved adaptation to the changing climate are urgently needed to feed the growing population. Hence, developing high-yielding crop varieties with better agronomic traits is one of the most critical issues in agricultural research. These are vital to enhancing yield as well as resistance to harsh conditions, both of which help farmers over time. The majority of agronomic traits are quantitative and are subject to intricate genetic control, thereby obstructing crop improvement. Plant epibreeding is the utilisation of epigenetic variation for crop development, and has a wide range of applications in the field of crop improvement. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that are heritable and induced by methylation of DNA, post-translational modifications of histones or RNA interference rather than an alteration in the underlying sequence of DNA. The epigenetic modifications influence gene expression by changing the state of chromatin, which underpins plant growth and dictates phenotypic responsiveness for extrinsic and intrinsic inputs. Epigenetic modifications, in addition to DNA sequence variation, improve breeding by giving useful markers. Also, it takes epigenome diversity into account to predict plant performance and increase crop production. In this review, emphasis has been given for summarising the role of epigenetic changes in epibreeding for crop improvement.Copyright © 2022 Gupta and Salgotra."

Angiogenesis has a pivotal role in the wound-healing process, which becomes impaired in many chronic non-healing wounds, leading to several healing disorders and complications. Therefore, induction or promotion of angiogenesis can be considered a promising approach for healing of chronic wounds. Gene therapy is one of the most promising upcoming strategies for the treatment of chronic wounds. It can be classified into three main approaches: gene augmentation, gene silencing, and gene editing. Despite the increasing number of encouraging results obtained using nucleic acids (NAs) as active pharmaceutical ingredients of gene therapy, efficient delivery of NAs to their site of action (cytoplasm or nucleus) remains a key challenge. Selection of the right therapeutic cargo and delivery methods is crucial for a favorable prognosis of the healing process.

"36140833","G-quadruplexes Mark Sites of Methylation Instability Associated with Ageing and Cancer.","Genes (Basel)","Regulation of the epigenome is critical for healthy cell function but can become disrupted with age, leading to aberrant epigenetic profiles including altered DNA methylation. Recent studies have indicated that DNA methylation homeostasis can be compromised by the formation of DNA secondary structures known as G-quadruplexes (G4s), which form in guanine-rich regions of the genome. G4s can be recognised and bound by certain methylation-regulating enzymes, and in turn perturb the surrounding methylation architecture. However, the effect G4 formation has on DNA methylation at critical epigenetic sites remains elusive and poorly explored. In this work, we investigate the association between G4 sequences and prominent DNA methylation sites, termed 'ageing clocks', that act asbona fidedysregulated regions in aged and cancerous cells. Using a combination ofin vitro(G4-seq) andin cellulo(BG4-ChIP) G4 distribution maps, we show that ageing clocks sites are significantly enriched with G4-forming sequences. The observed enrichment also varies across species and cell lines, being least significant in healthy cells and more pronounced in tumorigenic cells. Overall, our results suggest a biological significance of G4s in the realm of DNA methylation, which may be important for further deciphering the driving forces of diseases characterised by epigenetic abnormality, including ageing."

Data analysis was performed from September 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022.Childhood adversity, including physical neglect, emotional neglect, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and emotional abuse, was assessed retrospectively through the online mental health survey (2016).A phenotypic aging measure, phenotypic age acceleration, was calculated, with higher values indicating accelerated aging. Body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and diet were combined to construct an unhealthy lifestyle score (range, 0-5, with higher scores denoting a more unhealthy lifestyle).A total of 127 495 participants aged 40 to 69 years (mean [SD] chronological age at baseline, 56.4 [7.7] years; 70 979 women [55.7%]; 123 987 White participants [97.2%]) were included. Each individual type of childhood adversity and cumulative childhood adversity score were associated with phenotypic age acceleration. For instance, compared with participants who did not experience childhood adversity, those who experienced 4 (β = 0.296, 95% CI, 0.130-0.462) or 5 (β = 0.833; 95% CI, 0.537-1.129) childhood adversities had higher phenotypic age acceleration in fully adjusted models. The formal mediation analysis revealed that unhealthy lifestyle partially mediated the associations of childhood adversity with phenotypic age acceleration by 11.8% to 42.1%.In this retrospective cohort study, childhood adversity was significantly associated with acceleration of aging and, more importantly, unhealthy lifestyle partially mediated these associations. These findings reveal a pathway from childhood adversity to health in middle and early older adulthood through lifestyle and underscore the potential of more psychological strategies beyond lifestyle interventions to promote healthy aging."
"36050730","Multidimensional associations between nutrient intake and healthy ageing in humans.","BMC Biol","Little is known about how normal variation in dietary patterns in humans affects the ageing process. To date, most analyses of the problem have used a unidimensional paradigm, being concerned with the effects of a single nutrient on a single outcome. Perhaps then, our ability to understand the problem has been complicated by the fact that both nutrition and the physiology of ageing are highly complex and multidimensional, involving a high number of functional interactions. Here we apply the multidimensional geometric framework for nutrition to data on biological ageing from 1560 older adults followed over four years to assess on a large-scale how nutrient intake associates with the ageing process.Ageing and age-related loss of homeostasis (physiological dysregulation) were quantified via the integration of blood biomarkers. The effects of diet were modelled using the geometric framework for nutrition, applied to macronutrients and 19 micronutrients/nutrient subclasses. We observed four broad patterns: (1) The optimal level of nutrient intake was dependent on the ageing metric used. Elevated protein intake improved/depressed some ageing parameters, whereas elevated carbohydrate levels improved/depressed others; (2) There were non-linearities where intermediate levels of nutrients performed well for many outcomes (i.e. arguing against a simple more/less is better perspective); (3) There is broad tolerance for nutrient intake patterns that don't deviate too much from norms ('homeostatic plateaus'). (4) Optimal levels of one nutrient often depend on levels of another (e.g. vitamin E and vitamin C). Simpler linear/univariate analytical approaches are insufficient to capture such associations. We present an interactive tool to explore the results in the high-dimensional nutritional space.Using multidimensional modelling techniques to test the effects of nutrient intake on physiological dysregulation in an aged population, we identified key patterns of specific nutrients associated with minimal biological ageing.

This review focuses on the application of scRNA-seq in investigation of the TIME. Over time, scRNA-seq methods have evolved, and components of the TIME have been deciphered with high resolution. In this review, we first introduced the principle of scRNA-seq and compared different sequencing approaches. Novel cell types in the TIME, a continuous transitional state, and mutual intercommunication among TIME components present potential targets for prognosis prediction and treatment in cancer. Thus, we concluded novel cell clusters of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), T cells, tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and dendritic cells (DCs) discovered after the application of scRNA-seq in TIME. We also proposed the development of TAMs and exhausted T cells, as well as the possible targets to interrupt the process. In addition, the therapeutic interventions based on cellular interactions in TIME were also summarized. For decades, quantification of the TIME components has been adopted in clinical practice to predict patient survival and response to therapy and is expected to play an important role in the precise treatment of cancer. Summarizing the current findings, we believe that advances in technology and wide application of single-cell analysis can lead to the discovery of novel perspectives on cancer therapy, which can subsequently be implemented in the clinic.

Medical histories of osteoporosis, fractures caused by accident or falling, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis were not distinct between monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Accidental fracture occurrence in both monozygotic twins showed significantly lower odds than that in dizygotic twins. Genetic influence on liability to fracture risk might thus be maintained. DEXA T-scores for bone mineral density indicated more comparable tendencies within monozygotic twin pairs than within dizygotic ones, suggesting the relative importance of genetic contribution to bone mineral density.

"36140810","Model Comparison of Heritability Enrichment Analysis in Livestock Population.","Genes (Basel)","Heritability enrichment analysis is an important means of exploring the genetic architecture of complex traits in human genetics. Heritability enrichment is typically defined as the proportion of an SNP subset explained heritability, divided by the proportion of SNPs. Heritability enrichment enables better study of underlying complex traits, such as functional variant/gene subsets, biological networks and metabolic pathways detected through integrating explosively increased omics data. This would be beneficial for genomic prediction of disease risk in humans and genetic values estimation of important economical traits in livestock and plant species. However, in livestock, factors affecting the heritability enrichment estimation of complex traits have not been examined. Previous studies on humans reported that the frequencies, effect sizes, and levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) of underlying causal variants (CVs) would affect the heritability enrichment estimation. Therefore, the distribution of heritability across the genome should be fully considered to obtain the unbiased estimation of heritability enrichment. To explore the performance of different heritability enrichment models in livestock populations, we used the VanRaden, GCTA and α models, assuming different α values, and the LDAK model, considering LD weight. We simulated three types of phenotypes, with CVs from various minor allele frequency (MAF) ranges: genome-wide (0.005 ≤ MAF ≤ 0.5), common (0.05 ≤ MAF ≤ 0.5), and uncommon (0.01 ≤ MAF &lt; 0.05). The performances of the models with two different subsets (one of which contained known CVs and the other consisting of randomly selected markers) were compared to verify the accuracy of heritability enrichment estimation of functional variant sets. Our results showed that models with known CV subsets provided more robust enrichment estimation. Models with different α values tended to provide stable and accurate estimates for common and genome-wide CVs (relative deviation 0.5-2.2%), while tending to underestimate the enrichment of uncommon CVs. As the α value increased, enrichments from 15.73% higher than true value (i.e., 3.00) to 48.93% lower than true value for uncommon CVs were observed. In addition, the long-range LD windows (e.g., 5000 kb) led to large bias of the enrichment estimations for both common and uncommon CVs. Overall, heritability enrichment estimations were sensitive for the α value assumption and LD weight consideration of different models. Accuracy would be greatly improved by using a suitable model. This study would be helpful in understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits and provides a reference for genetic analysis in the livestock population."

EWS/FLI dysregulates transcription to induce and maintain sarcomagenesis, but the mechanisms utilized are not fully understood. We therefore sought to define the global effects of EWS/FLI on chromatin conformation and transcription in Ewing sarcoma cells using a well-validated 'knock-down/rescue' model of EWS/FLI function in combination with next generation sequencing assays to evaluate how the chromatin landscape changes with loss, and recovery, of EWS/FLI expression. We found that EWS/FLI (and EWS/ERG) genomic localization is largely conserved across multiple patient-derived Ewing sarcoma cell lines. This EWS/FLI binding signature is associated with establishment of topologically-associated domain (TAD) boundaries, compartment activation, enhancer-promoter looping that involve both intra- and inter-TAD interactions, and gene activation. In addition, EWS/FLI co-localizes with the loop-extrusion factor cohesin to promote chromatin loops and TAD boundaries. Importantly, local chromatin features provide the basis for transcriptional heterogeneity in regulation of direct EWS/FLI target genes across different Ewing sarcoma cell lines. These data demonstrate a key role of EWS/FLI in mediating genome-wide changes in chromatin configuration and support the notion that fusion transcription factors serve as master regulators of three-dimensional reprogramming of chromatin.© The Author(s) 2022.

Additionally, we conducted pathway analysis of proteins altered by spironolactone.Spironolactone therapy was associated with proteome-wide significant changes in 7 proteins. Among these, CARD18 (caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 18), PKD2 (polycystin 2), and PSG2 (pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 2) were upregulated, whereas HGF (hepatic growth factor), PLTP (phospholipid transfer protein), IGF2R (insulin growth factor 2 receptor), and SWP70 (switch-associated protein 70) were downregulated. CARD18, a caspase-1 inhibitor, was the most upregulated protein by spironolactone (-0.5% with placebo versus +66.5% with spironolactone,P<0.0001). The top canonical pathways that were significantly associated with spironolactone were apelin signaling, stellate cell activation, glycoprotein 6 signaling, atherosclerosis signaling, liver X receptor activation, and farnesoid X receptor activation. Among the top pathways, collagens were a consistent theme that increased in patients receiving placebo but decreased in patients randomized to spironolactone.Proteomic analysis in the TOPCAT trial revealed proteins and pathways altered by spironolactone, including the caspase inhibitor CARD18 and multiple pathways that involved collagens. In addition to effects on fibrosis, our studies suggest potential antiapoptotic effects of spironolactone in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, a hypothesis that merits further exploration."
"36117803","Coarse-grained Simulations of the Impact of Chain Length and Stiffness on the Formation and Aggregation of Polyelectrolyte Complexes.","Macromol Theory Simul","Polyelectrolyte complexes formed from nucleic acids and synthetic polycations have been studied because of their potential in gene delivery. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are performed to examine the impact of chain length and polyanion stiffness on polyplex formation and aggregation. Polyplexes containing single polyanion chain fall into three structural regimes depending on polyanion stiffness: flexible polyanions form collapsed complexes, semiflexible polyanions form various morphologies including toroids and hairpins, and stiff polyanions form rod-like structures. Polyplex size generally decreases as polycation length increases. Aggregation (i.e., formation of complexes containing multiple polyanions) is observed in some simulations containing multiple polyanions and an excess of short polycations. Aggregation is observed to only occur for semiflexible and stiff polyanions and is promoted by shorter polycation lengths. Simulations of short, stiff polyanions condensed by long polycations are used as a model for siRNA gene delivery complexes. These simulations show multiple polyanions are spaced out along the polycation with polyanion-polyanion interactions, usually limited to overlapping chain ends. These structures differ from aggregates of longer polyanions in which the polyanions are packed together in parallel, forming bundles."
"36110216","Non-canonical DNA/RNA structures associated with the pathogenesis of Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome and Fragile X syndrome.","Front Genet","Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and fragile X syndrome (FXS) are primary examples of fragile X-related disorders (FXDs) caused by abnormal expansion of CGG repeats above a certain threshold in the 5'-untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene. Both diseases have distinct clinical manifestations and molecular pathogenesis. FXTAS is a late-adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by a premutation (PM) allele (CGG expansion of 55-200 repeats), resulting in FMR1 gene hyperexpression. On the other hand, FXS is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results from a full mutation (FM) allele (CGG expansions of ≥200 repeats) leading to heterochromatization and transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene. The main challenge is to determine how CGG repeat expansion affects the fundamentally distinct nature of FMR1 expression in FM and PM ranges. Abnormal CGG repeat expansions form a variety of non-canonical DNA and RNA structures that can disrupt various cellular processes and cause distinct effects in PM and FM alleles. Here, we review these structures and how they are related to underlying mutations and disease pathology in FXS and FXTAS. Finally, as new CGG expansions within the genome have been identified, it will be interesting to determine their implications in disease pathology and treatment.Copyright © 2022 Yousuf, Ahmed and Qurashi."

Particularly, hypomethylation of the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) has been reported in patients with AD.In this study, we used catalytically inactivated Cas9 (dCas9) fused with Dnmt3a for targeted DNA methylation of APP, and showed that the CRISPR/dCas9-Dnmt3a-mediated DNA methylation system could efficiently induce targeted DNA methylation of APP both in vivo and in vitro.We hypothesized that the targeted methylation of the APP promoter might rescue AD-related neuronal cell death by reducing APP mRNA expression. The cultured APP-KI mouse primary neurons exhibited an altered DNA-methylation pattern on the APP promoter after dCas9-Dnmt3a treatment. Likewise, the APP mRNA level was significantly reduced in the dCas9-Dnmt3a-treated wild-type and APP-KI mouse primary neurons. We also observed decreased amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide level and Aβ42/40 ratio in the dCas9-Dnmt3a-treated APP-KI mouse neurons compared to the control APP-KI mouse neurons. In addition, neuronal cell death was significantly decreased in the dCas9-Dnmt3a-treated APP-KI mouse neurons. Furthermore, the in vivo methylation of APP in the brain via dCas9-Dnmt3a treatment altered Aβ plaques and attenuated cognitive and behavioral impairments in the APP-KI mouse model.These results suggest that the targeted methylation of APP via dCas9-Dnmt3a treatment can be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.© 2022.

"36129517","Sleep exerts lasting effects on hematopoietic stem cell function and diversity.","J Exp Med","A sleepless night may feel awful in its aftermath, but sleep's revitalizing powers are substantial, perpetuating the idea that convalescent sleep is a consequence-free physiological reset. Although recent studies have shown that catch-up sleep insufficiently neutralizes the negative effects of sleep debt, the mechanisms that control prolonged effects of sleep disruption are not understood. Here, we show that sleep interruption restructures the epigenome of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and increases their proliferation, thus reducing hematopoietic clonal diversity through accelerated genetic drift. Sleep fragmentation exerts a lasting influence on the HSPC epigenome, skewing commitment toward a myeloid fate and priming cells for exaggerated inflammatory bursts. Combining hematopoietic clonal tracking with mathematical modeling, we infer that sleep preserves clonal diversity by limiting neutral drift. In humans, sleep restriction alters the HSPC epigenome and activates hematopoiesis. These findings show that sleep slows decay of the hematopoietic system by calibrating the hematopoietic epigenome, constraining inflammatory output, and maintaining clonal diversity.© 2022 McAlpine et al."
"36045754","Multi-tissue transcriptional changes and core circadian clock disruption following intensive care.","Front Physiol","Objective:Both critical illness and current care have been hypothesized to upset daily rhythms and impair molecular circadian function. However, the influence of critical illness on clock function in different tissues and on circadian output genes are unknown. Here we evaluate the effect of critical care and illness on transcription, focusing on the functional organization of the core circadian oscillator.Methods:We downloaded RNAseq count data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Treating mechanical ventilation as a marker for intensive care, we stratified samples into acute death (AD) and intensive care (IC) groups based on the documented Hardy Death Scale. We restricted our analysis to the 25 tissues with >50 samples in each group. Using the edgeR package and controlling for collection center, gender, and age, we identified transcripts differentially expressed between the AD and IC groups. Overrepresentation and enrichment methods were used to identify gene sets modulated by intensive care across tissues. For each tissue, we then calculated the delta clock correlation distance (ΔCCD), a comparative measure of the functional organization of the core circadian oscillator, in the both the AD and IC groups. The statistical significance of the ΔCCD was assessed by permutation, modifying a pre-existing R package to control for confounding variables.Results:Intensive care, as marked by ventilation, significantly modulated the expression of thousands of genes. Transcripts that were modulated in ≥75% of tissues were enriched for genes involved in mitochondrial energetics, cellular stress, metabolism, and notably circadian regulation. Transcripts that were more markedly affected, in ≥10 tissues, were enriched for inflammation, complement and immune pathways. Oscillator organization, as assessed by ΔCCD, was significantly reduced in the intensive care group in 11/25 tissues.Conclusion:Our findings support the hypothesis that patients in intensive care have impaired molecular circadian rhythms. Tissues involved in metabolism and energetics demonstrated the most marked changes in oscillator organization. In adipose tissue, there was a significant overlap between transcripts previously established to be modulated by sleep deprivation and fasting with those modulated by critical care. This work suggests that intensive care protocols that restore sleep/wake and nutritional rhythms may be of benefit.Copyright © 2022 Hollis, Francis and Anafi."

These chemical compounds are used in a variety of sectors like food, forestry, agriculture and aquaculture. Pesticides shows their toxicity into the living systems. The World Health Organization (WHO) categorizes them based on their detrimental effects, emphasizing the relevance of public health. The usage can be minimized to a least level by using them sparingly with a complete grasp of their categorization, which is beneficial to both human health and the environment.

Although the previous PBAT or rPBAT was sensitive enough for single-cell methylome analysis, the protocol had several drawbacks owing to the repeated random priming reactions. To resolve these problems, we developed a unique single-strand DNA ligation technique, termed TACS ligation, and established a new protocol called tPBAT. With tPBAT, the data quality improved, with a longer insert and higher mapping rate than that obtained with rPBAT. In addition, paired-end sequencing and indexing were supported by the default.

"36110213","Pan-cancer analysis of the prognosis and immunological role of AKAP12: A potential biomarker for resistance to anti-VEGF inhibitors.","Front Genet","The primary or acquired resistance to anti-VEGF inhibitors remains a common problem in cancer treatment. Therefore, identifying potential biomarkers enables a better understanding of the precise mechanism. Through the GEO database, three profiles associated with bevacizumab (BV) resistance to ovarian cancer, glioma, and non-small-cell lung carcinoma, respectively, were collected for the screening process, and two genes were found. A-kinase anchor protein 12 (AKAP12), one of these two genes, correlates with tumorigenesis of some cancers. However, the role of AKAP12 in pan-cancer remains poorly defined. The present study first systematically analyzed the association of AKAP12 with anti-VEGF inhibitors' sensitivity, clinical prognosis, DNA methylation, protein phosphorylation, and immune cell infiltration across various cancers via bioinformatic tools. We found that AKAP12 was upregulated in anti-VEGF therapy-resistant cancers, including ovarian cancer (OV), glioblastoma (GBM), lung cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). A high AKAP12 expression revealed dismal prognoses in OV, GBM, and CRC patients receiving anti-VEGF inhibitors. Moreover, AKAP12 expression was negatively correlated with cancer sensitivity towards anti-VEGF therapy. Clinical prognosis analysis showed that AKAP12 expression predicted worse prognoses of various cancer types encompassing colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), OV, GBM, and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Gene mutation status may be a critical cause for the involvement of AKAP12 in resistance. Furthermore, lower expression of AKAP12 was detected in nearly all cancer types, and hypermethylation may explain its decreased expression. A decreased phosphorylation of T1760 was observed in breast cancer, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. For the immunologic significance, AKAP12 was positively related to the abundance of pro-tumor cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in various types of cancer. The results of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis suggested that ""cell junction organization"" and ""MAPK pathway"" participated in the effect of AKAP12. Importantly, we discovered that AKAP12 expression was greatly associated with metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma as well as differential and angiogenesis of retinoblastoma through investigating the single-cell sequencing data. Our study showed that the dual role of AKAP12 in various cancers and AKAP12 could serve as a biomarker of anti-VEGF resistance in OV, GBM, LUSC, and COAD.Copyright © 2022 Liang, Peng, Xu, Li, Jiang, Ouyang, Wu, Fu, Liu, Liu and Yan."
"36059838","Disease mechanisms in preclinical rheumatoid arthritis: A narrative review.","Front Med (Lausanne)","In the last decades, the concept of preclinical rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has become established. In fact, the discovery that disease mechanisms start years before the onset of clinical RA has been one of the major recent insights in the understanding of RA pathogenesis. In accordance with the complex nature of the disease, preclinical events extend over several sequential phases. In a genetically predisposed host, environmental factors will further increase susceptibility for incident RA. In the initial steps of preclinical disease, immune disturbance mechanisms take place outside the joint compartment, namely in mucosal surfaces, such as the lung, gums or gut. Herein, the persistent immunologic response to altered antigens will lead to breach of tolerance and trigger autoimmunity. In a second phase, the immune response matures and is amplified at a systemic level, with epitope spreading and widening of the autoantibody repertoire. Finally, the synovial and bone compartment are targeted by specific autoantibodies against modified antigens, initiating a local inflammatory response that will eventually culminate in clinically evident synovitis. In this review, we discuss the elaborate disease mechanisms in place during preclinical RA, providing a broad perspective in the light of current evidence.Copyright © 2022 Romão and Fonseca."

In this present study, we hypothesize that in utero exposure to T1DM alters offspring DNA methylation and gene expression, thereby altering their risk of future disease.Follow-up study using data from the Epigenetic, Genetic and Environmental Effects on Growth, Metabolism and Cognitive Functions in Offspring of Women with Type 1 Diabetes (EPICOM) collected between 2012 and 2013.Exploratory sub-study using data from the nationwide EPICOM study.Adolescent offspring born to women with T1DM (n=20) and controls (n=20) matched on age, sex, and postal code.This study investigates DNA methylation using the 450K-Illumina Infinium assay and RNA expression (RNA sequencing) of leucocytes from peripheral blood samples.We identified 9 hypomethylated and 5 hypermethylated positions (p < 0.005, |ΔM-value| > 1) and 38 up- and 1 downregulated genes (p < 0.005, log2FC ≥ 0.3) in adolescent offspring born to women with T1DM compared to controls. None of these findings remained significant after correction for multiple testing. However, we identified differences in gene co-expression networks, which could be of biological significance, using weighted gene correlation network analysis. Interestingly, one of these modules was significantly associated with offspring born to women with T1DM. Functional enrichment analysis, using the identified changes in methylation and gene expression as input, revealed enrichment in disease ontologies related to diabetes, carbohydrate and glucose metabolism, pathways including MAPK1/MAPK3 and MAPK family signaling, and genes related to T1DM, obesity, atherosclerosis, and vascular pathologies. Lastly, by integrating the DNA methylation and RNA expression data, we identified six genes where relevant methylation changes corresponded with RNA expression (CIITA, TPM1, PXN, ST8SIA1, LIPA, DAXX).These findings suggest the possibility for intrauterine exposure to maternal T1DM to impact later in life methylation and gene expression in the offspring, a profile that may be linked to the increased risk of vascular and metabolic disease later in life.© 2022.

"36168637","Cerenkov luminescence imaging of interscapular brown adipose tissue using a TSPO-targeting PET probe in the UCP1 ThermoMouse.","Theranostics","Rationale:[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET) has been widely used as an imaging technique to measure interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) activity. However, it is challenging to obtain iBAT-specific images using [18F]FDG-PET because increased uptake of [18F]FDG is observed in tumors, muscle, and inflamed tissues. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in the mitochondrial membrane, a well-known molecular marker of BAT, has been proposed as a useful BAT imaging marker. Recently, the UCP1 ThermoMouse was developed as a reporter mouse for monitoring UCP1 expression and investigating BAT activation. In addition, Translocator protein-18 kDa (TSPO) located in the outer mitochondrial membrane is also overexpressed in BAT, suggesting that TSPO-targeting PET has potential for iBAT imaging. However, there are no studies monitoring BAT using TSPO-targeting PET probes in the UCP1 ThermoMouse. Moreover, the non-invasive Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) using Cerenkov radiation from the PET probe has been proposed as an alternative option for PET as it is less expensive and user-friendly. Therefore, we selected [18F]fm-PBR28-d2as a TSPO-targeting PET probe for iBAT imaging to evaluate the usefulness of CLI in the UCP1 ThermoMouse.Methods:UCP1 ThermoMouse was used to monitor UCP1 expression. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to measure the level of protein expression. [18F]fm-PBR28-d2and [18F]FDG were used as radioactive probes for iBAT imaging. PET images were acquired with SimPET, and optical images were acquired with IVIS 100.Results:UCP1 ThermoMouse showed that UCP1 and TSPO expressions were correlated in iBAT. In both PET and CLI, the TSPO-targeting probe [18F]fm-PBR28-d2was superior to [18F]FDG for acquiring iBAT images. The high molar activity of the probe was essential for CLI and PET imaging. We tested the feasibility of TSPO-targeting probe under cold exposure by imaging with TSPO-PET/CLI. Both signals of iBAT were clearly increased after cold stimulation. Under prolonged isoflurane anesthesia, TSPO-targeting images showed higher signals from iBAT in the short-term than in long-term groups.Conclusion:We demonstrated that TSPO-PET/CLI reflected UCP1 expression in iBAT imaging better than [18F]FDG-PET/CLI under the various conditions. Considering convenience and cost, TSPO-CLI could be used as an alternative TSPO-PET technique for iBAT imaging.© The author(s)."

Modifications in DNA methylation pattern have been detected in cancer and infectious diseases and may be associated with gene expression changes. In cancer development DNA methylation aberrations are early events whereas in infectious diseases these epigenetic changes may be due to host/pathogen interaction. In particular, in leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease caused by the protozoanLeishmania, DNA methylation alterations have been detected in macrophages upon infection withLeishmania donovaniand in skin lesions from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis. Interestingly, different types of cancers, such as cutaneous malignant lesions, lymphoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, have been diagnosed in patients with a history of leishmaniasis. In fact, it is known that there exists an association between cancer and infectious diseases.Leishmaniainfection may increase susceptibility to develop cancer, but the mechanisms involved are not entirely clear. Considering these aspects, in this review we discuss the hypothesis that DNA methylation alterations induced byLeishmaniamay trigger tumorigenesis in long term infection since these epigenetic modifications may enhance and accumulate during chronic leishmaniasis.Copyright © 2022 Vega-Benedetti, Loi and Zavattari."

We conducted a cross-ancestry meta-analysis of OUD in the Million Veteran Program (N = 425,944). In addition to known exonic variants in OPRM1 and FURIN, we identified intronic variants in RABEPK, FBXW4, NCAM1 and KCNN1. A meta-analysis including other datasets identified a locus in TSNARE1. In total, we identified 14 loci for OUD, 12 of which are novel. Significant genetic correlations were identified for 127 traits, including psychiatric disorders and other substance use-related traits. The only significantly enriched cell-type group was CNS, with gene expression enrichment in brain regions previously associated with substance use disorders. These findings increase our understanding of the biological basis of OUD and provide further evidence that it is a brain disease, which may help to reduce stigma and inform efforts to address the opioid epidemic.© 2022.

However, because most of the variants located in the non-coding region of the human genome, the onset of ADHD requires further exploration.The risk genes involved in ADHD were identified by integrating GWAS summary data and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data using summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method. We then used a stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR) method to estimate the contribution of ADHD-relevant tissues to its heritability to screen out disease-relevant tissues. To determine the ADHD-relevant cell types, we used an R package for expression-weighted cell type enrichment (EWCE) analysis.By integrating the brain eQTL data and ADHD GWAS data using SMR, we identified 247 genes associated with ADHD. The LDSR applied to specifically expressed genes results showed that the ADHD risk genes were mainly enriched in brain tissue, especially in the mesencephalon, visual cortex, and frontal lobe regions. Further cell-type-specific analysis suggested that ADHD risk genes were highly expressed in excitatory neurons.The study showed that the etiology of ADHD is associated with excitatory neurons in the midbrain, visual cortex, and frontal lobe regions.Copyright © 2022 Wei, Sun, Chen, Liu, Zhou, Li and Liu."
"36071172","Genome-wide association analyses of physical activity and sedentary behavior provide insights into underlying mechanisms and roles in disease prevention.","Nat Genet","Although physical activity and sedentary behavior are moderately heritable, little is known about the mechanisms that influence these traits. Combining data for up to 703,901 individuals from 51 studies in a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies yields 99 loci that associate with self-reported moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity during leisure time (MVPA), leisure screen time (LST) and/or sedentary behavior at work. Loci associated with LST are enriched for genes whose expression in skeletal muscle is altered by resistance training. A missense variant in ACTN3 makes the alpha-actinin-3 filaments more flexible, resulting in lower maximal force in isolated type IIAmuscle fibers, and possibly protection from exercise-induced muscle damage. Finally, Mendelian randomization analyses show that beneficial effects of lower LST and higher MVPA on several risk factors and diseases are mediated or confounded by body mass index (BMI).

"36070311","Identifying enhancer properties associated with genetic risk for complex traits using regulome-wide association studies.","PLoS Comput Biol","Genetic risk for complex traits is strongly enriched in non-coding genomic regions involved in gene regulation, especially enhancers. However, we lack adequate tools to connect the characteristics of these disruptions to genetic risk. Here, we propose RWAS (Regulome Wide Association Study), a new application of the MAGMA software package to identify the characteristics of enhancers that contribute to genetic risk for disease. RWAS involves three steps: (i) assign genotyped SNPs to cell type- or tissue-specific regulatory features (e.g., enhancers); (ii) test associations of each regulatory feature with a trait of interest for which genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics are available; (iii) perform enhancer-set enrichment analyses to identify quantitative or categorical features of regulatory elements that are associated with the trait. These steps are implemented as a novel application of MAGMA, a tool originally developed for gene-based GWAS analyses. Applying RWAS to interrogate genetic risk for schizophrenia, we discovered a class of risk-associated AT-rich enhancers that are active in the developing brain and harbor binding sites for multiple transcription factors with neurodevelopmental functions. RWAS utilizes open-source software, and we provide a comprehensive collection of annotations for tissue-specific enhancer locations and features, including their evolutionary conservation, AT content, and co-localization with binding sites for hundreds of TFs. RWAS will enable researchers to characterize properties of regulatory elements associated with any trait of interest for which GWAS summary statistics are available."

We applied scDRS to 74 diseases/traits and 1.3 million single-cell gene-expression profiles across 31 tissues/organs. Cell-type-level results broadly recapitulated known cell-type-disease associations. Individual-cell-level results identified subpopulations of disease-associated cells not captured by existing cell-type labels, including T cell subpopulations associated with inflammatory bowel disease, partially characterized by their effector-like states; neuron subpopulations associated with schizophrenia, partially characterized by their spatial locations; and hepatocyte subpopulations associated with triglyceride levels, partially characterized by their higher ploidy levels. Genes whose expression was correlated with the scDRS score across cells (reflecting coexpression with GWAS disease-associated genes) were strongly enriched for gold-standard drug target and Mendelian disease genes.© 2022.

However, effective statistical methods for such a goal are currently lacking.By leveraging summary statistics available from global-scale genome-wide association studies, we herein proposed a novel genetic overlap detection method called CONTO (COmposite Null hypothesis test for Trans-ethnic genetic Overlap) from the perspective of high-dimensional composite null hypothesis testing. Unlike previous studies which generally analyzed individual genetic variants, CONTO is a gene-centric method which focuses on a set of genetic variants located within a gene simultaneously and assesses their joint significance with the trait of interest. By borrowing the similar principle of joint significance test (JST), CONTO takes the maximum P value of multiple associations as the significance measurement.Compared to JST which is often overly conservative, CONTO is improved in two aspects, including the construction of three-component mixture null distribution and the adjustment of trans-ethnic genetic correlation. Consequently, CONTO corrects the conservativeness of JST with well-calibrated P values and is much more powerful validated by extensive simulation studies. We applied CONTO to discover common associated genes for 31 complex diseases/traits between the East Asian and European populations, and identified many shared trait-associated genes that had otherwise been missed by JST. We further revealed that population-common genes were generally more evolutionarily conserved than population-specific or null ones.Overall, CONTO represents a powerful method for detecting common associated genes across diverse ancestral groups; our results provide important implications on the transferability of GWAS discoveries in one population to others.© 2022.

Traditional PRS prediction methods are predominantly for the European population. The accuracy of PRS prediction in non-European populations is diminished due to much smaller sample size of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In this article, we introduced a novel method to construct PRS for non-European populations, abbreviated as TL-Multi, by conducting a transfer learning framework to learn useful knowledge from the European population to correct the bias for non-European populations. We considered non-European GWAS data as the target data and European GWAS data as the informative auxiliary data. TL-Multi borrows useful information from the auxiliary data to improve the learning accuracy of the target data while preserving the efficiency and accuracy. To demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed method, we applied TL-Multi to predict the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the Asian population and the risk of asthma in the Indian population by borrowing information from the European population.

The current study aimed to investigate whether exposure to famine in early life is associated with a higher risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adulthood.We used data from participants included in the sub-cohort of the China Patient-centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events Million Persons Project in Guangdong Province. Specific years of birth were used to define the famine-exposed group (born during the famine of 1959-1962), the pre-famine group (born before the famine [1954-1957], and the post-famine group (born after the famine [1964-1967]). Multivariable-adjusted generalized linear models were used to examine the associations of early life famine exposure with the risk of hospitalization for heart failure.A total of 36,212 participants were enrolled in this analysis with a median age of 57.4 years and 37.5% of them were men. Compared with the post-famine group, famine births and pre-famine births were associated with increased risk of heart failure (OR: 1.96 [1.56-2.48] and OR: 1.62 [1.07-2.47], respectively). When compared with the age-balanced non-exposed group, the famine-exposed group was also significantly associated with increased risk of heart failure (OR: 1.32 [1.11-1.57]). The associations were stronger in participants with better economic status and in participants with hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia (P for interaction < 0.05).Early life exposure to the Chinese famine is associated with an elevated risk of hospitalization for heart failure in adulthood.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Wang, Huang and Feng."
"36171190","Regional gene expression signatures are associated with sex-specific functional connectivity changes in depression.","Nat Commun","The neural substrates of depression may differ in men and women, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that depression is associated with sex-specific patterns of abnormal functional connectivity in the default mode network and in five regions of interest with sexually dimorphic transcriptional effects. Regional differences in gene expression in two independent datasets explained the neuroanatomical distribution of abnormal connectivity. These gene sets varied by sex and were strongly enriched for genes implicated in depression, synapse function, immune signaling, and neurodevelopment. In an independent sample, we confirmed the prediction that individual differences in default mode network connectivity are explained by inferred brain expression levels for six depression-related genes, including PCDH8, a brain-specific protocadherin integral membrane protein implicated in activity-related synaptic reorganization. Together, our results delineate both shared and sex-specific changes in the organization of depression-related functional networks, with implications for biomarker development and fMRI-guided therapeutic neuromodulation.© 2022.

"36120101","Immune characterization of suicidal behavior in female adolescents.","Brain Behav Immun Health","To address the need to identify potential markers of suicide behavior for adolescents (ages 12-18 years), mass cytometry was used to explore the cellular mechanisms that may underpin immune dysregulation in adolescents with recent suicidal behavior.Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 10 female adolescents with a recent suicide attempt and 4 healthy female adolescents were used. A panel of 30 antibodies was analyzed using mass cytometry. We used two complementary approaches to 1) identify the cell types that significantly differed between the two groups, and 2) explore differences in the expression profile of markers on the surface of these cells. Mass cytometry data were investigated using (Center for Disease Control, 2021) Opt-SNE for dimension reduced (Curtin and Heron, 2019), FlowSOM for clustering, and (Bridge et al., 2006) EgdeR and SAM for statistical analyses.Opt-SNE (a data driven clustering analysis) identified 15 clusters of distinct cell types. From these 15 clusters, cluster 5 (classical monocytes) had statistically lower abundance in suicidal adolescents as compared to healthy controls, whereas cluster 7 (gamma-delta T cells) had statistically higher abundance in suicidal adolescents compared to healthy control. Furthermore, across the 15 cell types, chemokine receptors, CXCR3 (cluster 5) and CXCR5 (clusters 4, 5, 7, and 9), had an elevated expression profile in those with a recent suicide attempt versus healthy controls.This report demonstrates the utility of high dimensional cell phenotyping in psychiatric disorders and provides preliminary evidence for distinct immune dysfunctions in adolescents with recent suicide attempts as compared to healthy controls.© 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc."
"36090817","Brain transcriptomic profiling reveals common alterations across neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders (ND-NPs) are multifactorial, polygenic and complex behavioral phenotypes caused by brain abnormalities. Large-scale collaborative efforts have tried to identify the genetic architecture of these conditions. However, the specific and shared underlying molecular pathobiology of brain illnesses is not clear. Here, we examine transcriptome-wide characterization of eight conditions, using a total of 2,633 post-mortem brain samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Pathological Aging (PA), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Schizophrenia (Scz), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and Bipolar Disorder (BP)-in comparison with 2,078 brain samples from matched control subjects. Similar transcriptome alterations were observed between NDs and NPs with the top correlations obtained between Scz-BP, ASD-PD, AD-PD, and Scz-ASD. Region-specific comparisons also revealed shared transcriptome alterations in frontal and temporal lobes across NPs and NDs. Co-expression network analysis identified coordinated dysregulations of cell-type-specific modules across NDs and NPs.

In this study, we performed joint analysis on large-scale transcriptome multi-tissue data to investigate tissue-specific expression patterns in major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BP). We established the strategies of identifying tissues-specific modules, annotated pathways for elucidating biological functions of tissues, and tissue-specific genes based on weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and robust rank aggregation (RRA) with transcriptional profiling data from different human tissues and genome wide association study (GWAS) data, which have been expanded into overlapping tissue-specific modules and genes sharing with MDD and BP. Nine tissue-specific modules were identified and distributed across the four tissues in the MDD and six modules in the BP. In general, the annotated biological functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in blood were mainly involved in MDD and BP progression through immune response, while those in the brain were in neuron and neuroendocrine response. Tissue-specific genes of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in MDD-, such asIGFBP2andHTR1A, were involved in disease-related functions, such as response to glucocorticoid, taste transduction, and tissue-specific genes of PFC in BP-, such asCHRM5andLTB4R2, were involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. We also found PFC tissue-specific genes includingSSTandCRHBPwere shared in MDD-BP,SSTwas enriched in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, andCRHBPshown was related to the regulation of hormone secretion and hormone transport.Copyright © 2022 Han, Yuan, Huang, Wang, Du, Wang and Zhang."

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), such as LINC00473, had been reported to be involved in the progression of depression.Chronic unpredictable moderate stress in mice (CUMS) was applied to construct a depression model. Subsequently, RT-qPCR was applied to check the level of LINC00473 and microRNA-497-5p (miR-497-5p) in the hippocampal region of the mice induced by CUMS. CUMS mice were injected with lentiviral vectors of LINC00473 (LV-LINC00473), miR-497-5p inhibitor, short hairpin- (sh-) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (sh-BDNF), or miR-497-5p mimic to evaluate depressive behaviors, including sucrose preference test, forced swim test, elevated plus maze, and tail suspension test. Moreover, the production of hypothalamic neurotransmitters was assessed with the usage of ELISA kits. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, RNA pull-down, and RIP analysis were performed to measure the relationship between miR-497-5p and LINC00473 or BDNF. Further, western blot was employed to determine the protein level of BDNF.We discovered that LINC00473 level was downregulated in the female mice with depression, but not in male mice. Besides, the depressive behaviors induced by CUMS in mice, including the decrease of sucrose preference and time in open arm, as well as the increase of immobility time and swimming resting time were all ameliorated by LINC00473 overexpression. Moreover, the concentration of neurotransmitters was decreased in CUMS-induced mouse hypothalamus, which was blocked by LV-LINC00473 lentiviral vector administration. Mechanistically, LINC00473 directly targeted miR-497-5p. Absence of miR-497-5p revealed the antidepression effects on CUMS-induced mice, and miR-497-5p upregulation could counter the antidepressive impacts of LINC00473 upregulation on CUMS-induced mice. Furthermore, LINC00473 could target miR-497-5p to modulate BDNF level. Knockdown of BDNF could abrogate the improving influences of miR-497-5p suppression on CUMS-induced depression.LINC00473 ameliorated CUMS-caused depression by encouraging BDNF expression via binding to miR-497-5p, which might provide a potential therapeutic target for depression in females.Copyright © 2022 Bo Li et al."
"36052296","Age group DNA methylation differences in lemon sharks (<i>Negaprion brevirostris</i>): Implications for future age estimation tools.","Ecol Evol","Age information is often non-existent for most shark populations due to a lack of measurable physiological and morphological traits that can be used to estimate age. Recently, epigenetic clocks have been found to accurately estimate age for mammals, birds, and fish. However, since these clocks rely, among other things, on the availability of reference genomes, their application is hampered in non-traditional model organisms lacking such molecular resources. The technique known as Methyl-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) has emerged as a valid alternative for studying DNA methylation biomarkers when reference genome information is missing, and large numbers of samples need to be processed. Accordingly, the MSAP technique was used in the present study to characterize global DNA methylation patterns in lemon sharks from three different age groups (juveniles, subadults, and adults). The obtained results reveal that, while MSAP analyses lack enough resolution as a standalone approach to infer age in these organisms, the global DNA methylation patterns observed using this technique displayed significant differences between age groups. Overall, these results confer that DNA methylation does change with age in sharks like what has been seen for other vertebrates and that MSAP could be useful as part of an epigenetics pipeline to infer the broad range of ages found in large samples sizes.© 2022 The Authors.

The increase in the number and power of large genetic association studies has led to the identification of hormone linked genetic variants. However, the biological mechanisms underpinning the majority of these loci are poorly understood. The advent of affordable, high throughput next generation sequencing and readily available transcriptomic databases has shown that many of these genetic variants also associate with variation in gene expression levels as expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs). In addition to further dissecting complex genetic variation, eQTLs have been applied as tools for causal inference. Many hormone networks are driven by transcription factors, and many of these genes can be linked to eQTLs. In this mini-review, we demonstrate how causal inference and gene networks can be used to describe the impact of hormone linked genetic variation upon the transcriptome within an endocrinology context.Copyright © 2022 Bankier and Michoel."
"36160011","Haplotype-specific chromatin looping reveals genetic interactions of regulatory regions modulating gene expression in 8p23.1.","Front Genet","A major goal of genetics research is to elucidate mechanisms explaining how genetic variation contributes to phenotypic variation. The genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) generally explain only a small proportion of heritability of phenotypic traits, the so-called missing heritability problem. Recent evidence suggests that additional common variants beyond lead GWAS variants contribute to phenotypic variation; however, their mechanistic underpinnings generally remain unexplored. Herein, we undertake a study of haplotype-specific mechanisms of gene regulation at 8p23.1 in the human genome, a region associated with a number of complex diseases. TheFAM167A-BLKlocus in this region has been consistently found in the genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in all major ancestries. Our haplotype-specific chromatin interaction (Hi-C) experiments, allele-specific enhancer activity measurements, genetic analyses, and epigenome editing experiments revealed that: 1) haplotype-specific long-range chromatin interactions are prevalent in 8p23.1; 2)BLKpromoter andcis-regulatory elements cooperatively interact with haplotype-specificity; 3) genetic variants at distal regulatory elements are allele-specific modifiers of the promoter variants atFAM167A-BLK; 4) theBLKpromoter interacts with and, as an enhancer-like promoter, regulatesFAM167Aexpression and 5) local allele-specific enhancer activities are influenced by global haplotype structure due to chromatin looping. Although systemic lupus erythematosus causal variants at theFAM167A-BLKlocus are thought to reside in theBLKpromoter region, our results reveal that genetic variants at distal regulatory elements modulate promoter activity, changingBLKandFAM167Agene expression and disease risk. Our results suggest that global haplotype-specific 3-dimensional chromatin looping architecture has a strong influence on local allelicBLKandFAM167Agene expression, providing mechanistic details for how regional variants controlling theBLKpromoter may influence disease risk.Copyright © 2022 Saint Just Ribeiro, Tripathi, Namjou, Harley and Chepelev."

A method that can closely predict the production performance of hybrids is of great significance for research and practice. In our study, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were introduced to estimate the production performance ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae. The genetic variation of 971 published isolates and their growth ratios under 35 medium conditions were analyzed by genome-wide association analysis, and the precisep-value threshold for each phenotype was calculated. Risk markers for the above 35 phenotypes were obtained. By estimating the genotype of F1 hybrids according to that of the parents, the PRS of 613 F1 hybrids was predicted. There was a significant linear correlation between the maximum growth rate at 40 °C and PRS in F1 hybrids and their parents (R2= 0.2582, R2= 0.2414, respectively), which indicates that PRS can be used to estimate the production performance of individuals and their hybrids. Our method can provide a reference for strain selection and F1 prediction in cross-breeding yeasts, reduce workload, and improve work efficiency."

Besides genome, transcriptome and metabolome information are increasingly considered new sources for GS. Difficulties in building the model with multi-omics data for GS and the limit of specimen availability have both delayed the progress of investigating multi-omics.We utilized the Cosine kernel to map genomic and transcriptomic data as [Formula: see text] symmetric matrix (G matrix and T matrix), combined with the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) for GS. Here, we defined five kernel-based prediction models: genomic BLUP (GBLUP), transcriptome-BLUP (TBLUP), multi-omics BLUP (MBLUP, [Formula: see text]), multi-omics single-step BLUP (mssBLUP), and weighted multi-omics single-step BLUP (wmssBLUP) to integrate transcribed individuals and genotyped resource population. The predictive accuracy evaluations in four traits of the Chinese Simmental beef cattle population showed that (1) MBLUP was far preferred to GBLUP (ratio = 1.0), (2) the prediction accuracy of wmssBLUP and mssBLUP had 4.18% and 3.37% average improvement over GBLUP, (3) We also found the accuracy of wmssBLUP increased with the growing proportion of transcribed cattle in the whole resource population.We concluded that the inclusion of transcriptome data in GS had the potential to improve accuracy. Moreover, wmssBLUP is accepted to be a promising alternative for the present situation in which plenty of individuals are genotyped when fewer are transcribed.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36090990","Polygenic autoimmune disease risk alleles impacting B cell tolerance act in concert across shared molecular networks in mouse and in humans.","Front Immunol","Most B cells produced in the bone marrow have some level of autoreactivity. Despite efforts of central tolerance to eliminate these cells, many escape to periphery, where in healthy individuals, they are rendered functionally non-responsive to restimulation through their antigen receptorviaa process termed anergy. Broad repertoire autoreactivity may reflect the chances of generating autoreactivity by stochastic use of germline immunoglobulin gene segments or active mechanisms may select autoreactive cells during egress to the naïve peripheral B cell pool. Likewise, it is unclear why in some individuals autoreactive B cell clones become activated and drive pathophysiologic changes in autoimmune diseases. Both of these remain central questions in the study of the immune system(s). In most individuals, autoimmune diseases arise from complex interplay of genetic risk factors and environmental influences. Advances in genome sequencing and increased statistical power from large autoimmune disease cohorts has led to identification of more than 200 autoimmune disease risk loci. It has been observed that autoantibodies are detectable in the serum years to decades prior to the diagnosis of autoimmune disease. Thus, current models hold that genetic defects in the pathways that control autoreactive B cell tolerance set genetic liability thresholds across multiple autoimmune diseases. Despite the fact these seminal concepts were developed in animal (especially murine) models of autoimmune disease, some perceive a disconnect between human risk alleles and those identified in murine models of autoimmune disease. Here, we synthesize the current state of the art in our understanding of human risk alleles in two prototypical autoimmune diseases - systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and type 1 diabetes (T1D) along with spontaneous murine disease models. We compare these risk networks to those reported in murine models of these diseases, focusing on pathways relevant to anergy and central tolerance. We highlight some differences between murine and human environmental and genetic factors that may impact autoimmune disease development and expression and may, in turn, explain some of this discrepancy. Finally, we show that there is substantial overlap between the molecular networks that define these disease states across species. Our synthesis and analysis of the current state of the field are consistent with the idea that the same molecular networks are perturbed in murine and human autoimmune disease. Based on these analyses, we anticipate that murine autoimmune disease models will continue to yield novel insights into how best to diagnose, prognose, prevent and treat human autoimmune diseases.Copyright © 2022 Harley, Allison and Scofield."

"36071171","Genetic determinants of chromatin reveal prostate cancer risk mediated by context-dependent gene regulation.","Nat Genet","Many genetic variants affect disease risk by altering context-dependent gene regulation. Such variants are difficult to study mechanistically using current methods that link genetic variation to steady-state gene expression levels, such as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). To address this challenge, we developed the cistrome-wide association study (CWAS), a framework for identifying genotypic and allele-specific effects on chromatin that are also associated with disease. In prostate cancer, CWAS identified regulatory elements and androgen receptor-binding sites that explained the association at 52 of 98 known prostate cancer risk loci and discovered 17 additional risk loci. CWAS implicated key developmental transcription factors in prostate cancer risk that are overlooked by eQTL-based approaches due to context-dependent gene regulation. We experimentally validated associations and demonstrated the extensibility of CWAS to additional epigenomic datasets and phenotypes, including response to prostate cancer treatment. CWAS is a powerful and biologically interpretable paradigm for studying variants that influence traits by affecting transcriptional regulation.© 2022.

"36061617","An eco-evo-devo genetic network model of stress response.","Hortic Res","The capacity of plants to resist abiotic stresses is of great importance to agricultural, ecological and environmental sustainability, but little is known about its genetic underpinnings. Existing genetic tools can identify individual genetic variants mediating biochemical, physiological, and cellular defenses, but fail to chart an overall genetic atlas behind stress resistance. We view stress response as an eco-evo-devo process by which plants adaptively respond to stress through complex interactions of developmental canalization, phenotypic plasticity, and phenotypic integration. As such, we define and quantify stress response as the developmental change of adaptive traits from stress-free to stress-exposed environments. We integrate composite functional mapping and evolutionary game theory to reconstruct omnigenic, information-flow interaction networks for stress response. Using desert-adapted Euphrates poplar as an example, we infer salt resistance-related genome-wide interactome networks and trace the roadmap of how each SNP acts and interacts with any other possible SNPs to mediate salt resistance. We characterize the previously unknown regulatory mechanisms driving trait variation; i.e. the significance of a SNP may be due to the promotion of positive regulators, whereas the insignificance of a SNP may result from the inhibition of negative regulators. The regulator-regulatee interactions detected are not only experimentally validated by two complementary experiments, but also biologically interpreted by their encoded protein-protein interactions. Our eco-evo-devo model of genetic interactome networks provides an approach to interrogate the genetic architecture of stress response and informs precise gene editing for improving plants' capacity to live in stress environments.© The Author(s) 2022.

Here we report genome scanning of the risk of puppies being eliminated for behavioral reasons prior to entering the training phase of the US Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) canine olfactory detection breeding and training program through 2013. Elimination of dogs for behavioral rather than medical reasons was based on evaluations at three, six, nine and twelve months after birth. Throughout that period, the fostered dogs underwent standardized behavioral tests at TSA facilities, and, for a subset of tests, dogs were tested in four different environments. Using methods developed for family studies, we performed a case-control genome wide association study (GWAS) of elimination due to behavioral observation and testing results in a cohort of 528 Labrador Retrievers (2002-2013). We accounted for relatedness by including the pedigree as a covariate and maximized power by including individuals with phenotype, but not genotype, data (approximately half of this cohort). We determined genome wide significance based on Bonferroni adjustment of two quasi-likelihood score tests optimized for either small or nearly-fully penetrant effect sizes. Six loci were significant and five suggestive, with approximately equal numbers of loci for the two tests and frequencies of loci with single versus multiple mapped markers. Several loci implicate a single gene, including CHD2, NRG3 and PDE1A which have strong relevance to behavior in humans and other species. We briefly discuss how expanded studies of canine breeding programs could advance understanding of learning and performance in the mammalian life course. Although human interactions and other environmental conditions will remain critical, our findings suggest genomic breeding selection could help improve working dog populations.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Genome-wide association studies have started to identify multiple genetic risk loci associated with ADHD, however, the exact causal genes and biological mechanisms remain largely unknown. We performed a multi-step analysis to identify and characterize modules of co-expressed genes associated with ADHD using data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 270 ADHD cases and 279 controls. We identified seven ADHD-associated modules of co-expressed genes, some of them enriched in both genetic and epigenetic signatures for ADHD and in biological pathways relevant for psychiatric disorders, such as the regulation of gene expression, epigenetics and immune system. In addition, for some of the modules, we found evidence of potential regulatory mechanisms, including microRNAs and common genetic variants. In conclusion, our results point to promising genes and pathways for ADHD, supporting the use of peripheral blood to assess gene expression signatures in psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, they highlight that the combination of multi-omics signals provides deeper and broader insights into the biological mechanisms underlying ADHD.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing for tumor samples from 12 SBA patients and predicted drug candidates for SBA. We identified four prevalent subtypes of malignant cells with distinct signatures including cell cycle program, mitochondria program, metabolism program and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. The progression relationships of these four subtypes of malignant cells were also revealed, which started from the cell cycle program, through the mitochondria program and then progressing into either the metabolism program or the EMT program. Importantly, ligand-receptor interaction pairs were found to be specifically enriched in pairs of EMT-program malignant cells and highly exhausted CD8+T cells, suggesting that cancer cell subpopulations with EMT features may contribute most to the exhaustion of T cells. We also showed that the duodenal subtype of SBA exhibited molecular features more similar to gastric cancer whereas jejunal subtype of SBA more similar to colorectal cancer. Especially, we predicted specific drugs for SBA based on differential gene expression signatures between malignant cells and normal epithelial cells of SBA, and verified more potent inhibitory effects of volasertib and tozasertib for SBA cancer cells than conventional drugs of SBA at the same concentration, which provides new clues for treatments of SBA. In summary, our study provides a blueprint of the molecular signatures of both tumor cells and tumor microenvironment cells in SBA and reveals potential targets and drug candidates for its clinical treatments.© 2022.

However, the dynamic features of decision-making between these cell-fates during liver development and regeneration remains elusive. Here, we identify a core gene regulatory network comprising c/EBPα, TGFBR2, and SOX9 which is multistable in nature, enabling three distinct cell states - hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and liver progenitor cells (hepatoblasts/oval cells) - and stochastic switching among them. Predicted expression signature for these three states are validated through multiple bulk and single-cell transcriptomic datasets collected across developmental stages and injury-induced liver repair. This network can also explain the experimentally observed spatial organization of phenotypes in liver parenchyma and predict strategies for efficient cellular reprogramming.

Numerous studies have shown that miRNAs are abnormally expressed in tumor tissues and are closely associated with tumorigenesis. MiRNA-based cancer gene therapy has consistently shown promising anti-tumor effects and is recognized as a new field in cancer treatment. So far, some clinical trials involving the treatment of malignancies have been carried out; however, studies of miRNA-based cancer gene therapy are still proceeding slowly. Therefore, furthering our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of miRNA can bring substantial benefits to the development of miRNA-based gene therapy or other combination therapies and the clinical outcome of patients with cancer. Recent studies have revealed that the aberrant expression of miRNA in tumors is associated with promoter sequence mutation, epigenetic alteration, aberrant RNA modification, etc., showing the complexity of aberrant expression mechanisms of miRNA in tumors. In this paper, we systematically summarized the regulation mechanisms of miRNA expression in tumors, with the aim of providing assistance in the subsequent elucidation of the role of miRNA in tumorigenesis and the development of new strategies for tumor prevention and treatment."

DNA methylation undergoes dynamic regulation involving maintenance of preexisting patterns, passive and active demethylation, andde novomethylation. Scattered evidence suggests that these processes control different stages of Treg cell lifespan ranging from lineage induction to cell fate maintenance, suppression of effector T cells and innate immune cells, and transdifferentiation. Despite significant progress, it remains to be fully explored how differential DNA methylation regulates Treg cell fate and immunological function. Here, we review recent progress and discuss the questions and challenges for further understanding the immunological roles and mechanisms of dynamic DNA methylation in controlling Treg cell differentiation and function. We also explore the opportunities that these processes offer to manipulate Treg cell suppressive function for therapeutic purposes by targeting DNA methylation."

DNMT3A mutations result in myeloid over lymphoid bias, and an expansion of immature myeloid progenitors primed toward megakaryocytic-erythroid fate, with dysregulated expression of lineage and leukemia stem cell markers. Mutated DNMT3A leads to preferential hypomethylation of polycomb repressive complex 2 targets and a specific CpG flanking motif. Notably, the hypomethylation motif is enriched in binding motifs of key hematopoietic transcription factors, serving as a potential mechanistic link between DNMT3A mutations and aberrant transcriptional phenotypes. Thus, single-cell multi-omics paves the road to defining the downstream consequences of mutations that drive clonal mosaicism.© 2022.

"36123357","Dominant role of DNA methylation over H3K9me3 for IAP silencing in endoderm.","Nat Commun","Silencing of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) is largely mediated by repressive chromatin modifications H3K9me3 and DNA methylation. On ERVs, these modifications are mainly deposited by the histone methyltransferase Setdb1 and by the maintenance DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. Knock-out of either Setdb1 or Dnmt1 leads to ERV de-repression in various cell types. However, it is currently not known if H3K9me3 and DNA methylation depend on each other for ERV silencing. Here we show that conditional knock-out of Setdb1 in mouse embryonic endoderm results in ERV de-repression in visceral endoderm (VE) descendants and does not occur in definitive endoderm (DE). Deletion of Setdb1 in VE progenitors results in loss of H3K9me3 and reduced DNA methylation of Intracisternal A-particle (IAP) elements, consistent with up-regulation of this ERV family. In DE, loss of Setdb1 does not affect H3K9me3 nor DNA methylation, suggesting Setdb1-independent pathways for maintaining these modifications. Importantly, Dnmt1 knock-out results in IAP de-repression in both visceral and definitive endoderm cells, while H3K9me3 is unaltered. Thus, our data suggest a dominant role of DNA methylation over H3K9me3 for IAP silencing in endoderm cells. Our findings suggest that Setdb1-meditated H3K9me3 is not sufficient for IAP silencing, but rather critical for maintaining high DNA methylation.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36061943","Analysis of Epigenetic Changes in Vitamin D Pathway Genes in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients.","Acta Med Litu","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease with complex etiopathogenesis launched by multiple risk factors, including epigenetic alterations. RA is possibly linked to vitamin D that is epigenetically active and may alter DNA methylation of certain genes. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the relationship between DNA methylation status of vitamin D signaling pathway genes (VDR, CYP24A1, CYP2R1), vitamin D level and associations with RA.Totally 76 participants (35 RA patients and 41 healthy controls) were enrolled from a case-control vitamin D andVDRgene polymorphisms study regarding age and vitamin D concentration. CpG islands in promoter regions of theVDR, CYP24A1, CYP2R1genes were chosen for DNA methylation analysis by means of pyrosequencing. Chemiluminescent microplate immunoassay was used to assess 25(OH)D serum levels. RA clinical data, i.e. the disease activity score C-reactive protein 28 (DAS28 - CRP) as well as patient-reported outcome questionnaires were recorded.The study showed similar methylation pattern in the promoter regions of vitamin D pathway genes in RA and control group withp>0.05 (VDRgene 2.39%vs.2.48%,CYP24A1gene 16.02%vs.15.17% andCYP2R12.53%vs.2.41%).CYP24A1methylation intensity was significantly higher in compare to methylation intensity ofVDRandCYP2R1genes in both groups (p<0.0001). A tendency of higher vitamin D concentration in cases having methylatedVDR (57.57±28.93vs.47.40±29.88 nmol/l),CYP24A1 (53.23±26.22vs.48.23±34.41 nmol/l) andCYP2R1(60.41±30.73vs.44.54±27.63 nmol/l) genes and a positive correlation betweenVDR, CYP2R1methylation intensity and vitamin D level in RA affected participants was revealed (p>0.05). A significantly higherCYP24A1methylation intensity (p=0.0104) was detected in blood cells of vitamin D deficient (<50 nmol/l) RA patientsvs.vitamin D deficient controls.Our data suggests some indirect associations between DNA methylation status of vitamin D pathway genes and vitamin D level in RA.Copyright © 2022 Eglė Puncevičienė, Justina Gaiževska, Rasa Sabaliauskaitė, Kristina Šnipaitienė, Lina Vencevičienė, Dalius Vitkus, Sonata Jarmalaitė, Irena Butrimienė.

The mechanism of the dramatic conversion of flowers to leafy structures leading to yield losses and the drastic reduction in leaf size due to Phytoplasma infection remains yet to be identified. Cytosine methylation profiles of healthy and infected sesame plants studied using Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) and Quantitative analysis of DNA methylation with the real-time PCR (qAMP) technique revealed altered DNA methylation patterns upon infection. Phyllody was associated with global cytosine hypomethylation, though predominantly in the CHH (where H = A, T or C) context. Interestingly, comparable cytosine methylation levels were observed between healthy and little leaf-affected plant samples in CG, CHG and CHH contexts. Among the different genomic fractions, the highest number of differentially methylated Cytosines was found in the intergenic regions, followed by promoter, exonic and intronic regions in decreasing order. Further, most of the differentially methylated genes were hypomethylated and were mainly associated with development and defense-related processes. Loci for STOREKEEPER protein-like, a DNA-binding protein and PP2-B15, an F-Box protein, responsible for plugging sieve plates to maintain turgor pressure within the sieve tubes were found to be hypomethylated by WGBS, which was confirmed by methylation-dependent restriction digestion and qPCR. Likewise, serine/threonine-protein phosphatase-7 homolog, a positive regulator of cryptochrome signaling involved in hypocotyl and cotyledon growth and probable O-methyltransferase 3 locus were determined to be hypermethylated. Phytoplasma infection-associated global differential methylation as well as the defense and development-related loci reported here for the first time significantly elucidate the mechanism of phytoplasma-associated disease development."

The most recent update to the search was on July 18, 2022, through the databases of Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for quality assessment of included studies. Finally, 14 studies were included in the review, and among them, ten studies were included in the meta-analysis. Our results showed that NLR levels were significantly increased in the patients with GBS compared with healthy controls (SMD = 1.05; 95%CI = 0.59 to 1.50,P< 0.001). After treatment, NLR levels were decreased to the extent that they became similar to healthy controls (SMD = -0.03, 95%CI = -0.29 to 0.22,P= 0.204). Moreover, NLR was a stable predictor of outcome or response to treatment in such patients (SMD = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.65 to 1.37,P< 0.001); the higher the NLR, the worse the outcome. In addition, patients who underwent mechanical ventilation had higher levels of NLR compared to those who did not (SMD = 0.93, 95%CI = 0.05 to 1.82,P= 0.03). However, NLR levels were not different among distinct GBS subtypes, so it could not distinguish among them. In conclusion, our analysis indicates that the NLR levels are highly elevated in patients with GBS. Therefore, the NLR has the potential to be used as a biomarker to inform diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment responses in GBS, and future studies are warranted.Copyright © 2022 Shirin Sarejloo et al."

Based on the postoperative pathological results, enrolled patients were divided into ovarian cancer group and benign tumor group (n = 135). The ovarian cancer group was further divided into a mid-stage group (n = 46) and an advanced-stage group (n = 82). The basic information of the three groups of patients was collected, the preoperative imaging data of the patients were collected to assess the lymph node metastasis, the preoperative blood samples were collected to examine cancer antigen 125 (CA125), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and the postoperative pathological data were sorted and summarized.Result:The average during of disease in the advanced ovarian cancer group was 0.55 ± 0.18 years higher than the benign tumor group (0.43 ± 0.14 years),p< 0.001. In the advanced ovarian cancer group, the ratio of patients with the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage IV (64.63%), with tumor Grade stage II and III (93.90%), and without lymph node metastasis (64.63%) was respectively more than that in the mid-stage group (accordingly 0.00, 36.96, 23.91%) (p< 0.001); The ratio of patients with TNM grade III in the mid-stage group (73.91%) was more than that in the advanced group (35.37%) (p< 0.001). The levels of the five biomarkers: CA19-9, CA125, NLR, PLR, and BDNF were different among the three groups (p< 0.001).Conclusion:CA19-9, CA125, NLR, PLR, BDNF are five biomarkers related to the occurrence of ovarian cancer and are risk factors for it. These five biomarkers and their Combined-Value may be suitable to apply in the diagnosis and the identification of ovarian cancer in patients with intermediate-risk.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Wu, Wang and Ji."

The purpose of our study was to define (1) the laboratory tests that will contribute to the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 patients, (2) the differences between the laboratory-confirmed (LC), unconfirmed (LUC), and control (C) groups, and (3) the variation between groups of acute-phase reactants and biomarkers that can be used as an indicator of disease severity and inflammation.Materials and Methods A total of 102 patients undergoing treatment with COVID-19 interim guidelines were evaluated. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was positive in 56 (LC), classified as mild or severe, and negative in 46 (LUC) patients. In addition, 30 healthy subjects (C) with negative RT-PCR tests were also evaluated. All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS 22.0 program and thep-values for significant findings were less than 0.05. Parametric/nonparametric distribution was determined by performing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for all groups. Student'st-test was used for variables with parametric distribution and the Mann-Whitney U-test for variables with the nonparametric distribution. A cut-off level for biomarkers was determined using the ROC (receiver operator characteristic) curve.Results In the LC group, platelet, platecrit, mean platelet volume, platelet diameter width, white blood cell, lymphocyte, eosinophil, neutrophil, immature granulocyte, immature lymphocyte, immature monocyte, large immune cell, and atypical lymphocyte counts among the complete blood count parameters of mature and immature cell counts showed a significant difference according to the C and LUC groups. C-reactive protein, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) indices were significantly elevated in LC patients and were significantly higher in patients classified as severe compared to mild. When CAR optimal cutoff was determined as 0.475, area under the curve was 0.934, sensitivity was 90.91%, specificity was 86.21%, positive predictive value was 92.59%, and negative predictive value was 83.33%. The diagnostic accuracy for CAR was 89.29%.Conclusion The CAR index with the highest diagnostic value and the highest predictability could be the most useful biomarker in the diagnosis and evaluation of disease severity in COVID-19 patients.The Indian Association of Laboratory Physicians.

Identifying prognostic factors predictive of survival in these patients to guide further management is needed. The intratumoural lymphocytic response (ILR), peritumoural lymphocytic reaction (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PtLR) are correlated with the tumour microenvironment and cancer-related systemic inflammation. This study aimed to explore the ability of the ILR, PLR, NLR, and PtLR to predict survival in LARC patients without a complete response to NCRT.Sixty-nine patients who underwent NCRT and surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The ILR and PLR were assessed in surgical specimens, and the NLR and PtLR were calculated using pre- and post-NCRT blood count data. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analyses were performed for survival analysis.A high PLR and high post-NCRT NLR and PtLR were significantly associated with better prognosis. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI), post-NCRT neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count were significant predictors of overall survival. LVI and the PLR were independent predictors of disease-free survival.NCRT-induced local and systemic immune responses are favourable prognostic predictors in LARC patients without complete response to NCRT."

Therefore, we sought to investigate the effect and predictive value of the peripheral blood neutrophil percentage and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in the acute phase of ischemic stroke (AIS) in post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI).We selected 454 patients with mild AIS and acquired general clinical data. The patients were divided into PSCI and post-stroke no cognitive impairment (PSNCI) groups according to their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) scores. We assessed whether there were differences in clinical data, peripheral blood neutrophil percentage, and NLR values between the different groups. We also analyzed the independent influences on the occurrence of PSCI using a binary logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze the predictive value of the above inflammatory indicators and models containing different inflammatory indicators for PSCI.In total, 454 patients were included, of whom 253 (55.7%) patients were in the PSCI group, with a mean age of 62.15 ± 7.34 years and median neutrophil percentage and NLR of 0.64 (0.32-0.95) and 2.39 (0.71-54.46), respectively. Both neutrophil percentage (adjusted OR = 1.025; 95% confidence interval: 1.005-1.406) and NLR as a categorical variable (Q5, adjusted OR = 2.167; 95% CI: 1.127-4.166) were independent risk factors for PSCI, and the Q5 group (NLR ≥ 4.05) had significantly worse overall cognition and executive function.Neutrophil percentage and NLR in the acute phase of AIS were independently associated with PSCI, and a high NLR was strongly associated with executive function. In addition, neutrophil percentage and NLR have diagnostic values for PSCI.Copyright © 2022 Shang, Ma, Shen, Wei, Wang, Zhai, Li, Wang and Sun."

The pathophysiology of OA remains largely unclear, and currently no FDA-approved disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) are available. As has been acknowledged, aging is the primary independent risk factor for OA, but the mechanisms underlying such a connection are not fully understood. In this review, we first revisit the changes in OA chondrocytes from the perspective of cellular hallmarks of aging. It is concluded that OA chondrocytes share many alterations similar to cellular aging. Next, based on the findings from studies on other cell types and diseases, we propose methods that can potentially reverse osteoarthritic phenotype of chondrocytes back to a healthier state.

"36167771","Identification of unique DNA methylation sites in Kabuki syndrome using whole genome bisulfite sequencing and targeted hybridization capture followed by enzymatic methylation sequencing.","J Hum Genet","Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a congenital malformation syndrome caused by mutations in the KMT2D and KDM6A genes that encode histone modification enzymes. Although KS is considered a single gene disorder, its symptoms vary widely. Recently, disease-specific DNA methylation patterns, or episignatures, have been recognized and used as a diagnostic tool for KS. Because of various crosstalk mechanisms between histone modifications and DNA methylation, DNA methylation analysis may have high potential for investigations into the pathogenesis of KS.In this study, we investigated altered CpG-methylation sites that were specific to KS to find important genes associated with the various phenotypes or pathogenesis of KS. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed to select target CpG islands, and enzymatic conversion technology was applied after hybridization capture to confirm KS-specific episignatures of 130 selected differently methylated target regions (DMTRs) in DNA samples from the 65 participants, 31 patients with KS and 34 unaffected individuals, in this study. We identified 26 candidate genes in 22 DMTRs that may be associated with KS. Our results indicate that disease-specific methylation sites can be identified from a small number of WGBS samples, and hybridization capture followed by enzymatic methylation sequencing can simultaneously test the sites.Although DNA methylation can be tissue-specific, our results suggest that methylation profiling of DNA extracted from peripheral blood may be a powerful approach to study the pathogenesis of diseases.© 2022.

"36094316","HIV-1 Preintegration Complex Preferentially Integrates the Viral DNA into Nucleosomes Containing Trimethylated Histone 3-Lysine 36 Modification and Flanking Linker DNA.","J Virol","HIV-1 DNA is preferentially integrated into chromosomal hot spots by the preintegration complex (PIC). To understand the mechanism, we measured the DNA integration activity of PICs-extracted from infected cells-and intasomes, biochemically assembled PIC substructures using a number of relevant target substrates. We observed that PIC-mediated integration into human chromatin is preferred compared to genomic DNA. Surprisingly, nucleosomes lacking histone modifications were not preferred integration compared to the analogous naked DNA. Nucleosomes containing the trimethylated histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3), an epigenetic mark linked to active transcription, significantly stimulated integration, but the levels remained lower than the naked DNA. Notably, H3K36me3-modified nucleosomes with linker DNA optimally supported integration mediated by the PIC but not by the intasome. Interestingly, optimal intasome-mediated integration required the cellular cofactor LEDGF. Unexpectedly, LEDGF minimally affected PIC-mediated integration into naked DNA but blocked integration into nucleosomes. The block for the PIC-mediated integration was significantly relieved by H3K36me3 modification. Mapping the integration sites in the preferred substrates revealed that specific features of the nucleosome-bound DNA are preferred for integration, whereas integration into naked DNA was random. Finally, biochemical and genetic studies demonstrate that DNA condensation by the H1 protein dramatically reduces integration, providing further evidence that features inherent to the open chromatin are preferred for HIV-1 integration. Collectively, these results identify the optimal target substrate for HIV-1 integration, report a mechanistic link between H3K36me3 and integration preference, and importantly, reveal distinct mechanisms utilized by the PIC for integration compared to the intasomes.IMPORTANCEHIV-1 infection is dependent on integration of the viral DNA into the host chromosomes. The preintegration complex (PIC) containing the viral DNA, the virally encoded integrase (IN) enzyme, and other viral/host factors carries out HIV-1 integration. HIV-1 integration is not dependent on the target DNA sequence, and yet the viral DNA is selectively inserted into specific ""hot spots"" of human chromosomes. A growing body of literature indicates that structural features of the human chromatin are important for integration targeting. However, the mechanisms that guide the PIC and enable insertion of the PIC-associated viral DNA into specific hot spots of the human chromosomes are not fully understood. In this study, we describe a biochemical mechanism for the preference of the HIV-1 DNA integration into open chromatin. Furthermore, our study defines a direct role for the histone epigenetic mark H3K36me3 in HIV-1 integration preference and identify an optimal substrate for HIV-1 PIC-mediated viral DNA integration."

With the release of the new WHO air quality guidelines in 2021, there is an urgent need for China to contemplate a revision of air quality standards (AQS). In the recent decade, there has been an increase in epidemiological studies on PM in China. A comprehensive evaluation of such epidemiological evidence among the Chinese population is central for revision of the AQS in China and in other developing countries with similar air pollution problems. We thus conducted a systematic review on the epidemiological literature of PM published in the recent decade. In summary, we identified the following: (1) short-term and long-term PM exposure increase mortality and morbidity risk without a discernible threshold, suggesting the necessity for continuous improvement in air quality; (2) the magnitude of long-term associations with mortality observed in China are comparable with those in developed countries, whereas the magnitude of short-term associations are appreciably smaller; (3) governmental clean air policies and personalized mitigation measures are potentially effective in protecting public and individual health, but need to be validated using mortality or morbidity outcomes; (4) particles of smaller size range and those originating from fossil fuel combustion appear to show larger relative health risks; and (5) molecular epidemiological studies provide evidence for the biological plausibility and mechanisms underlying the hazardous effects of PM. This updated review may serve as an epidemiological basis for China's AQS revision and proposes several perspectives in designing future health studies.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36084090","Tumor purity adjusted beta values improve biological interpretability of high-dimensional DNA methylation data.","PLoS One","A common issue affecting DNA methylation analysis in tumor tissue is the presence of a substantial amount of non-tumor methylation signal derived from the surrounding microenvironment. Although approaches for quantifying and correcting for the infiltration component have been proposed previously, we believe these have not fully addressed the issue in a comprehensive and universally applicable way. We present a multi-population framework for adjusting DNA methylation beta values on the Illumina 450/850K platform using generic purity estimates to account for non-tumor signal. Our approach also provides an indirect estimate of the aggregate methylation state of the surrounding normal tissue. Using whole exome sequencing derived purity estimates and Illumina 450K methylation array data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA), we provide a demonstration of this framework in breast cancer illustrating the effect of beta correction on the aggregate methylation beta value distribution, clustering accuracy, and global methylation profiles."

However, different studies have reported different subsets of epigenetic lesions that stratify patients according to the severity of infection symptoms, and more importantly, the significance of those epigenetic changes in the pathology of the infection is still not clear. We used methylomics and transcriptomics data from the largest so far cohort of COVID-19 patients from four geographically distant populations, to identify casual interactions of blood cells' methylome in pathology of the COVID-19 disease. We identified a subset of methylation changes that is uniformly present in all COVID-19 patients regardless of symptoms. Those changes are not present in patients suffering from upper respiratory tract infections with symptoms similar to COVID-19. Most importantly, the identified epigenetic changes affect the expression of genes involved in interferon response pathways and the expression of those genes differs between patients admitted to intensive care units and only hospitalized. In conclusion, the DNA methylation changes involved in pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are specific to COVID-19 patients, can not only be utilized as biomarkers in the disease management but also present a potential treatment target.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"36118877","Molecular mediators of the association between child obesity and mental health.","Front Genet","Biological mechanisms underlying the association between obesity and depression remain unclear. We investigated the role of metabolites and DNA methylation as mediators of the relationship between childhood obesity and subsequent poor mental health in the English Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Obesity was defined according to United Kingdom Growth charts at age 7 years and mental health through the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) completed at age 11 years. Metabolites and DNA methylation were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Illumina array in blood at the age of 7 years. The associations between obesity and SMFQ score, as continuous count data or using cut-offs to define depressive symptoms (SMFQ >7) or depression (SMFQ >11), were tested using adjusted Poisson and logistic regression. Candidate metabolite mediators were identified through metabolome-wide association scans for obesity and SMFQ score, correcting for false-discovery rate. Candidate DNA methylation mediators were identified through testing the association of putative BMI-associated CpG sites with SMFQ scores, correcting for look-up false-discovery rate. Mediation by candidate molecular markers was tested. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were additionally applied to test causal associations of metabolites with depression in independent adult samples. 4,018 and 768 children were included for metabolomics and epigenetics analyses, respectively. Obesity at 7 years was associated with a 14% increase in SMFQ score (95% CI: 1.04, 1.25) and greater odds of depression (OR: 1.46 (95% CI: 0.78, 2.38) at 11 years. Natural indirect effects (mediating pathways) between obesity and depression for tyrosine, leucine and conjugated linoleic acid were 1.06 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.13, proportion mediated (PM): 15%), 1.04 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.10, PM: 9.6%) and 1.06 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.12, PM: 13.9%) respectively. In MR analysis, one unit increase in tyrosine was associated with 0.13 higher log odds of depression (p= 0.1). Methylation at cg17128312, located in the FBXW9 gene, had a natural indirect effect of 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01,1.13, PM: 27%) as a mediator of obesity and SMFQ score. Potential biologically plausible mechanisms involving these identified molecular features include neurotransmitter regulation, inflammation, and gut microbiome modulation. These results require replication in further observational and mechanistic studies.Copyright © 2022 Handakas, Xu, Segal, Huerta, Bowman, Howe, Sassi and Robinson."
"36093112","Mini-review: Mitochondrial DNA methylation in type 2 diabetes and obesity.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are two of the most challenging public health problems of our time. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that contribute to these complex metabolic disorders is essential. An underlying pathophysiological condition of T2D and obesity is insulin resistance (IR), a reduced biological response to insulin in peripheral tissues such as the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Many factors contribute to IR, including lifestyle variables such as a high-fat diet and physical inactivity, genetics, and impaired mitochondrial function. It is well established that impaired mitochondria structure and function occur in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle volunteers with T2D or obesity. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that the mitochondrial abnormalities are due to epigenetic regulation of mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded genes that code for mitochondrial structure and function. In this review, we describe the normal function and structure of mitochondria and highlight some of the key studies that demonstrate mitochondrial abnormalities in skeletal muscle of volunteers with T2D and obesity. Additionally, we describe epigenetic modifications in the context of IR and mitochondrial abnormalities, emphasizing mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) methylation, an emerging area of research.Copyright © 2022 Rautenberg, Hamzaoui and Coletta."

"36051868","Genetically predicted telomere length and its relationship with neurodegenerative diseases and life expectancy.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Telomere length (TL) is a biomarker of biological aging. Shorter telomeres have been associated with mortality and increased rates of age-related diseases. However, observational studies are unable to conclude whether TL is causally associated with those outcomes. Mendelian randomization (MR) was developed for assessing causality using genetic variants in epidemiological research. The objective of this study was to test the potential causal role of TL in neurodegenerative disorders and life expectancy through MR analysis. Summary level data were extracted from the most recent genome-wide association studies for TL, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease, Frontotemporal dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and life expectancy. MR estimates revealed that longer telomeres inferred a protective effect on risk of AD (OR = 0.964; adjusted p-value = 0.039). Moreover, longer telomeres were significantly associated with increased life expectancy (βIVW = 0.011; adjusted p-value = 0.039). Sensitivity analyses suggested evidence for directional pleiotropy in AD analyses. Our results showed that genetically predicted longer TL may increase life expectancy and play a protective causal effect on AD. We did not observe significant causal relationships between longer TL and other neurodegenerative diseases. This suggests that the involvement of TL on specific biological mechanisms might differ between AD and life expectancy, with respect to that in other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, the presence of pleiotropy may reflect the complex interplay between TL homeostasis and AD pathophysiology. Further observational studies are needed to confirm these results.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36105093","Diagnostic and prognostic value of m5C regulatory genes in hepatocellular carcinoma.","Front Genet","Background:A high mortality rate makes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) one of the most common types of cancer globally. 5-methylcytosine (m5C) is an epigenetic modification that contributes to the prognosis of several cancers, but its relevance to HCC remains unknown. We sought to determine if the m5C-related regulators had any diagnostic or prognostic value in HCC.Methods:M5C regulatory genes were screened and compared between HCC and normal tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO) and univariate Cox regression analysis of differentially expressed genes were then performed to identify diagnostic markers. A LASSO prognostic model was constructed using M5C regulatory genes with prognostic values screened by TCGA expression data. HCC patients were stratified based on risk score, then clinical characteristics analysis and immune correlation analysis were performed for each subgroup, and the molecular functions of different subgroups were analyzed using both Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA). The prognostic model was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox analyses as well as a nomogram. Molecular typing was performed according to m5C regulatory genes and immune checkpoint genes expression respectively, and clinical characterization and immune correlation analysis were performed for each subgroup.Results:M5C regulatory genes are expressed differently in HCC patients with different clinical and pathological characteristics, and mutations in these genes are frequent. Based on five m5C regulators (NOP2, NSUN2, TET1, YBX1, and DNMT3B), we constructed a prognostic model with high predictive ability. The risk score was found to be an independent prognostic indicator. Additionally, risk scores can also be applied in subgroups with different clinical characteristics as prognostic indicators.Conclusion:The study combined data from TCGA and GEO for the first time to reveal the genetic and prognostic significance of m5C-related regulators in HCC, which provides new directions for identifying predictive biomarkers and developing molecularly targeted therapies for HCC.Copyright © 2022 Yang, Yang, Lan, Wen, Li and Sun."
"36092923","Characterization of chromatin regulators in hepatocellular carcinoma to guide clinical therapy.","Front Genet","Background:Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is notorious for its high mortality and incidence. Accumulating evidence confirms that chromatin regulators (CRs) have a significant impact on cancer. Therefore, exploring the mode of action and prognostic value of CRs is imminent for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.Method:Transcriptome and clinical data for this study have been downloaded from TCGA (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) and ICGC (https://dcc.icgc.org/). Univariate analysis was used to screen CRs with prognostic value, and our prognostic risk score signature was developed using least absolute shrinkage along with selection operator (lasso) Cox regression analysis. The CRs-based prognostic model was constructed in the TCGA dataset, and low-risk HCC patients had a better prognosis, which was finally validated in the ICGC dataset. We used the receiver operating characteristic curve to identify the accuracy of the prediction model and establish a line chart to prove the clinical effectiveness of the model. We also discussed the differences in drug sensitivityviaCellMiner database, tumor immune microenvironmentviassGSEA algorithm, and clinical characteristics among different risk groups.Results:A prognostic model consisting of seven CRs was constructed and verified in HCC patients. Furthermore, we found that this risk score prognostic signature could independently predict the prognosis of HCC patients. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that CRs are mainly associated with cancer-related signaling pathways and metabolic pathways. In addition, immune cell abundance correlates with risk score levelsConclusion:In brief, we systematically explored the mode of action of CRs in HCC patients and established a reliable prognostic prediction model.Copyright © 2022 Jia and Zhang."

Growing evidence has unmasked the crucial role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in cancer development and progression, while, as a relative newly found RNA modification, N7-methylguanosine (m7G) is also certified to participate in tumorigenesisviadifferent catalytic machinery from that of m6A. However, system analysis on m7G RNA modification-related regulator genes is lack. In this study, we first investigated the genetic alteration of m7G related regulator genes in 33 cancers, and found mRNA expression levels of most regulator genes were positively correlated with copy number variation (CNV) and negatively correlated with methylation in most cancers. We built a m7G RNA modification model based on the enrichment of the regulator gene scores to evaluate the m7G modification levels in 33 cancers, and investigated the connections of m7G scores to clinical outcomes. Furthermore, we paid close attention to the role of m7G in immunology due to the widely used immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our results showed the higher m7G scores related to immunosuppression of tumor cells. Further confirmation with phase 3 clinical data with application of anti-PDL1/PDL indicated the impact of m7G modification level on immunotherapy effect. Relevance of m7G regulator genes and drug sensitivity was also evaluated to provide a better treatment choice when treating cancers. In summary, our study uncovered the profile of m7G RNA modification through various cancers, and figured out the connection of m7G modification levels with therapeutical outcomes, providing potential better options of cancer treatment.Copyright © 2022 Li, Li, Shen, Shen and Li."

However, the prognostic value of DNA methylation remains to be further explored.Objectives.We sought to explore DNA methylation characteristics and develop a quantifiable criterion related to DNA methylation to improve survival prediction for LUAD patients.Methods:Illumina Human Methylation450K array data, level 3 RNA-seq data and corresponding clinical information were obtained from TCGA. Cox regression analysis and the Akaike information criterion were used to construct the best-prognosis methylation signature. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to validate the prognostic ability of the DNA methylation-related feature score. qPCR was used to measure the transcription levels of the identified genes upon methylation.Results:We identified a set of DNA methylation features composed of 11 genes (MYEOV,KCNU1,SLC27A6,NEUROD4,HMGB4,TACR3,GABRA5,TRPM8,NLRP13,EDN3andSLC34A1). The feature score, calculated based on DNA methylation features, was independent of tumor recurrence and TNM stage in predicting overall survival. Of note, the combination of this feature score and TNM stage provided a better overall survival prediction than either of them individually. The transcription levels of all the hypermethylated genes were significantly increased after demethylation, and the expression levels of 3 hypomethylated proteins were significantly higher in tumor tissues than in normal tissues, as indicated by immunohistochemistry data from the Human Protein Atlas. Our results suggested that these identified genes with prognostic features were regulated by DNA methylation of their promoters.Conclusion:Our studies demonstrated the potential application of DNA methylation markers in the prognosis of LUAD.Copyright © 2022 Xu, Huang, Zeng, Li, Xie and Xie."

Finding orthologues of these novel lncRNAs might facilitate clarification of their functional role in living organisms. However, lncRNAs exhibit low sequence conservation, so specific methods for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio were developed. Nevertheless, current methods such as transcriptomes comparison approaches or searches for conserved secondary structures are not applicable to novel, previously unannotated lncRNAs by design.We present ortho2align-a versatile sensitive synteny-based lncRNA orthologue search tool with statistical assessment of sequence conservation. This tool allows control of the specificity of the search process and optional annotation of found orthologues. ortho2align shows similar performance in terms of sensitivity and resource usage as the state-of-the-art method for aligning orthologous lncRNAs but also enables scientists to predict unannotated orthologous sequences for lncRNAs in question. Using ortho2align, we predicted orthologues of three distinct classes of novel human lncRNAs in six Vertebrata species to estimate their degree of conservation.Being designed for the discovery of unannotated orthologues of novel lncRNAs in distant species, ortho2align is a versatile tool applicable to any genomic regions, especially weakly conserved ones. A small amount of input files makes ortho2align easy to use in orthology studies as a single tool or in bundle with other steps that researchers will consider sensible. ortho2align is available as an Anaconda package with its source code hosted at https://github.com/dmitrymyl/ortho2align .© 2022.

However, a systemic study in animals or humans is still lacking. Using the Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip, we examined the DNA methylation status of white blood cells in male ApoE-/- mice after 14 weeks of electronic cigarette exposure with the InExpose system (2 hr/day, 5 days/week, 50% PG and 50% VG) with low (6 mg/ml) and high (36 mg/ml) nicotine concentrations. Our results indicate that electronic cigarette aerosol inhalation induces significant alteration of 8,985 CpGs in a dose-dependent manner (FDR<0.05); 7,389 (82.2%) of the CpG sites are annotated with known genes. Among the top 6 significant CpG sites (P-value<1e-8), 4 CpG sites are located in the known genes, and most (3/5) of these genes have been related to cigarette smoking. The other two CpGs are close to/associated with thePhc2gene that was recently linked to smoking in a transcriptome-wide associations study. Furthermore, the gene set enrichment analysis highlights the activation of MAPK and 4 cardiomyocyte/cardiomyopathy-related signaling pathways (including adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) following repeated electronic cigarette use. The MAPK pathway activation correlates well with our finding of increased cytokine mRNA expression after electronic cigarette exposure in the same batch of mice. Interestingly, two pathways related to mitochondrial activities, namely mitochondrial gene expression and mitochondrial translation, are also activated after electronic cigarette exposure. Elucidating the relationship between these pathways and the increased circulating mitochondrial DNA observed here will provide further insight into the cell-damaging effects of prolonged inhalation of e-cigarette aerosols.AJCR Copyright © 2022."

Recently, optical genome mapping (OGM) as a novel method proved to yield a genome-wide and detailed cytogenetic characterization at the time of diagnosis. A young female patient suffered from a rather unexpected aggressive disease course under FLT3 targeted therapy in combination with induction chemotherapy. By applying a ""next-generation diagnostic workup"" strategy with OGM and whole-exome sequencing (WES), aDDX3X: MLLT10gene fusion could be detected, otherwise missed by routine diagnostics. Furthermore, several aspects of lineage ambiguity not shown by standard diagnostics were unraveled such as deletions ofSUZ12andARPP21, as well as T-cell receptor recombination.

"36050314","JMJD family proteins in cancer and inflammation.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","The occurrence of cancer entails a series of genetic mutations that favor uncontrollable tumor growth. It is believed that various factors collectively contribute to cancer, and there is no one single explanation for tumorigenesis. Epigenetic changes such as the dysregulation of enzymes modifying DNA or histones are actively involved in oncogenesis and inflammatory response. The methylation of lysine residues on histone proteins represents a class of post-translational modifications. The human Jumonji C domain-containing (JMJD) protein family consists of more than 30 members. The JMJD proteins have long been identified with histone lysine demethylases (KDM) and histone arginine demethylases activities and thus could function as epigenetic modulators in physiological processes and diseases. Importantly, growing evidence has demonstrated the aberrant expression of JMJD proteins in cancer and inflammatory diseases, which might serve as an underlying mechanism for the initiation and progression of such diseases. Here, we discuss the role of key JMJD proteins in cancer and inflammation, including the intensively studied histone lysine demethylases, as well as the understudied group of JMJD members. In particular, we focused on epigenetic changes induced by each JMJD member and summarized recent research progress evaluating their therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases.© 2022.

"36109497","Transcriptional dynamics of murine motor neuron maturation in vivo and in vitro.","Nat Commun","Neurons born in the embryo can undergo a protracted period of maturation lasting well into postnatal life. How gene expression changes are regulated during maturation and whether they can be recapitulated in cultured neurons remains poorly understood. Here, we show that mouse motor neurons exhibit pervasive changes in gene expression and accessibility of associated regulatory regions from embryonic till juvenile age. While motifs of selector transcription factors, ISL1 and LHX3, are enriched in nascent regulatory regions, motifs of NFI factors, activity-dependent factors, and hormone receptors become more prominent in maturation-dependent enhancers. Notably, stem cell-derived motor neurons recapitulate ~40% of the maturation expression program in vitro, with neural activity playing only a modest role as a late-stage modulator. Thus, the genetic maturation program consists of a core hardwired subprogram that is correctly executed in vitro and an extrinsically-controlled subprogram that is dependent on the in vivo context of the maturing organism.© 2022.

Prenatal famine exposure may cause changes in DNA methylation levels of genes. Meanwhile, maternal nutrition during pregnancy is a pivotal environmental factor in the development of SCZ. DNA methylation may be an intermediate factor mediating exposure to famine during pregnancy and SCZ, and DNA methylation quantitative trait loci might serve as a promising tool for linking SCZ and prenatal famine.To analyze the association between prenatal famine exposure and SCZ risk in Northeast Han Chinese through analysis of DNA methylation related loci.A total of 954 Han Chinese from Northeast China were recruited, including 443 patients with SCZ and 511 healthy controls. The participants were further divided into famine (born in 1960-1962) and non-famine (born in 1963-1965) groups to investigate the effect of prenatal famine exposure. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected according to the relevant literature were genotyped, namely, rs11917047 inPTPRG, rs2239681 inIGF2, rs3842756 inINSIGF,and rs61955196 inABCB9. DNA were extracted from peripheral blood samples, and the genotypes of these SNP loci were detected using the improved Multiple Ligase Detection Reaction multiple SNP typing technique. The associations of the DNA methylation related SNPs with SCZ risk and prenatal famine, and their interactions were analyzed using logistic regression analysis and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) software.Based on the sequencing data, genotype distributions and allele frequencies of the four selected SNPs were determined. All genotype frequencies of the four SNPs in the healthy control group were tested for deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P> 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that rs61955196 was significantly associated with SCZ risk in the log-additive model [odds ratio (OR): 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.48;P= 0.040]. We also found that the rs61955196 allele was related with an enhanced risk of SCZ (G>C, OR: 1.22; 95%CI: 1.01-1.47;P= 0.042). However, no associations were observed between rs11917047, rs2239681, or rs3842756 and SCZ risk. Under the optimal genetic model, no significant association of famine with the four SNPs was seen. Though the gene-gene interactions between rs2239681 and rs61955196 were found in GMDR analysis, none of the gene-gene interactions and gene-famine interactions were associated with the risk of SCZ.Our study suggested that rs61955196 inABCB9is associated with SCZ susceptibility in Northeast Han Chinese, providing insight into genetic effects on SCZ.©The Author(s) 2022.

Although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, epigenetics has emerged as a key link between environment and health. The genomic effects of stress are thought to be mediated by the action of glucocorticoid stress hormones, primarily cortisol in humans, which act via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). To dissect how chronic stress-driven GR activation influences epigenetic and cell states, human fibroblasts underwent prolonged exposure to physiological stress levels of cortisol and/or a selective GR antagonist. Cortisol was found to drive robust changes in cell proliferation, migration, and morphology, which were abrogated by concomitant GR blockade. The GR-driven cell phenotypes were accompanied by widespread, yet genomic context-dependent, changes in DNA methylation and mRNA expression, including gene loci with known roles in cell proliferation and migration. These findings provide insights into how chronic stress-driven functional epigenomic patterns become established to shape key cell phenotypes.© 2022 The Author(s)."

Here, a synthesis of genetic concepts and variations relevant for individual genetic constitution is provided. All the different levels of genetic information and variation are covered, ranging from whether an organism is unmixed or hybrid, has variations in genome, chromosomes, and more locally in DNA regions, to epigenetic variants or alterations in selfish genetic elements. Genetic constitution and heterogeneity of microbiota are highly relevant for health and wellbeing of an individual. Mutation rates vary widely for variation types, e.g., due to the sequence context. Genetic information guides numerous aspects in organisms. Types of inheritance, whether Mendelian or non-Mendelian, zygosity, sexual reproduction, and sex determination are covered. Functions of DNA and functional effects of variations are introduced, along with mechanism that reduce and modulate functional effects, including TARAR countermeasures and intraindividual genetic conflict. TARAR countermeasures for tolerance, avoidance, repair, attenuation, and resistance are essential for life, integrity of genetic information, and gene expression. The genetic composition, effects of variations, and their expression are considered also in diseases and personalized medicine.

HR is facilitated by RAD51 which is loaded onto DNA by either BRCA2-BRCA1-PALB2 or RAD52. In human culture cells, double-knockdowns of RAD52 and genes in the BRCA1-BRCA2-PALB2 axis are lethal. Mutations in BRCA2, BRCA1 or PALB2 significantly impairs error free HR as RAD51 loading relies on RAD52 which is not as proficient as BRCA2-BRCA1-PALB2. RAD52 also facilitates Single Strand Annealing (SSA) that produces intra-chromosomal deletions. Some RAD52 mutations that affect the SSA function or decrease RAD52 association with DNA can suppress certain BRCA2 associated phenotypes in breast cancers. In this report we did a pan-cancer analysis using data reported on the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancers (COSMIC) to identify double mutants between RAD52 and BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 that occur in cancer cells. We find that co-occurring mutations are likely in certain cancer tissues but not others. However, all mutations occur in a heterozygous state. Further, using computational and machine learning tools we identified only a handful of pathogenic or driver mutations predicted to significantly affect the function of the proteins. This supports previous findings that co-inactivation of RAD52 with any members of the BRCA2-BRCA1-PALB2 axis is lethal. Molecular modeling also revealed that pathogenic RAD52 mutations co-occurring with mutations in BRCA2-BRCA1-PALB2 axis are either expected to attenuate its SSA function or its interaction with DNA. This study extends previous breast cancer findings to other cancer types and shows that co-occurring mutations likely destabilize HR by similar mechanisms as in breast cancers."

Tumors in the latter group include those with ""pure"" NE phenotype and those ""combined"" with other elements, most often squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We performed comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of MCPyV+ and MCPyV- (pure and combined) tumors, to better understand their mutational profiles and shed light on their pathogenesis. Supplemental immunohistochemistry for Rb expression was also undertaken. After eliminating low quality samples, 37 tumors were successfully analyzed (14 MCPyV+, 8 pure MCPyV- and 15 combined MCPyV-). The SCC and NE components were sequenced separately in 5 combined tumors. Tumor mutational burden was lower in MCPyV+ tumors (mean 1.66 vs. 29.9/Mb, P < 0.0001). MCPyV- tumors featured frequent mutations in TP53 (95.6%), RB1 (87%), and NOTCH family genes (95.6%). No recurrently mutated genes were identified in MCPyV+ tumors. Mutational overlap in the NE and SCC components of combined tumors was substantial ('similarity index' >24% in 4/5 cases). Loss of Rb expression correlated with RB1 mutational (P < 0.0001) and MCPyV- status (P < 0.0001) in MCCs and it was observed more frequently in the SCC component of combined MCC than in a control group of conventional cutaneous SCC (P = 0.0002).

"36068219","The mutational signatures of formalin fixation on the human genome.","Nat Commun","Clinical archives of patient material near-exclusively consist of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks. The ability to precisely characterise mutational signatures from FFPE-derived DNA has tremendous translational potential. However, sequencing of DNA derived from FFPE material is known to be riddled with artefacts. Here we derive genome-wide mutational signatures caused by formalin fixation. We show that the FFPE-signature is highly similar to signature 30 (the signature of Base Excision Repair deficiency due to NTHL1 mutations), and chemical repair of DNA lesions leads to a signature highly similar to signature 1 (clock-like signature due to spontaneous deamination of methylcytosine). We demonstrate that using uncorrected mutational catalogues of FFPE samples leads to major mis-assignment of signature activities. To correct for this, we introduce FFPEsig, a computational algorithm to rectify the formalin-induced artefacts in the mutational catalogue. We demonstrate that FFPEsig enables accurate mutational signature analysis both in simulated and whole-genome sequenced FFPE cancer samples. FFPEsig thus provides an opportunity to unlock additional clinical potential of archival patient tissues.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36050548","The genomic landscape of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","Nat Genet","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer. Here, using whole-genome, exome and transcriptome sequencing of 2,754 childhood patients with ALL, we find that, despite a generally low mutation burden, ALL cases harbor a median of four putative somatic driver alterations per sample, with 376 putative driver genes identified varying in prevalence across ALL subtypes. Most samples harbor at least one rare gene alteration, including 70 putative cancer driver genes associated with ubiquitination, SUMOylation, noncoding transcripts and other functions. In hyperdiploid B-ALL, chromosomal gains are acquired early and synchronously before ultraviolet-induced mutation. By contrast, ultraviolet-induced mutations precede chromosomal gains in B-ALL cases with intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21. We also demonstrate the prognostic significance of genetic alterations within subtypes. Intriguingly, DUX4- and KMT2A-rearranged subtypes separate into CEBPA/FLT3- or NFATC4-expressing subgroups with potential clinical implications. Together, these results deepen understanding of the ALL genomic landscape and associated outcomes.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc."

Height is positively associated with general health and success on various levels (e.g. quality of life, earnings or happiness). The aim of this study was to investigate whether different subgroups show different trends across birth cohorts. We wanted to know whether taller individuals considered themselves as healthier and their quality of life as better than shorter individuals. We included 19,435 participants from the Swiss population-based Health Survey 2017. GAM were used to assess nonlinear associations between height and birth year. Multinomial logistic regression was used to predict probabilities of self-rated health in relation to height. The increase in average height slows down from the 1970s birth cohorts. Participants with parents from Central/Northern/Western Europe (men 177.9 cm, women: 165.1 cm) or Eastern Europe (men 178.7 cm, women: 165.7 cm) were taller than participants with parents from South America (men 174.3 cm, women: 161. cm) and Asia (men 173.2 cm, women: 160.1 cm). Participants with tertiary education were taller than participants from education levels (mean difference men: 4.5 cm, women: 5.0 cm). Height was positively associated with self-declared aspects of health and life satisfaction. These results support the conclusion that body height as a co-factor of health aspects should be considered in public health research. Although adult body height can no longer be influenced, nutritional status and thus also healthy growth can be influenced in childhood by public health programs, by eliminating social inequalities, and by strengthen healthy living conditions.© 2022 The Author(s)."

However, this has come at the neglect of systematic identification of regulatory (non-coding) variants, which have recently been identified as putative somatic drivers and key germline risk factors for cancer development. Comprehensive understanding of non-coding mutations requires understanding their role in the disruption of regulatory elements, which then disrupt key biological functions such as gene expression.We describe how advancements in sequencing technologies have led to the identification of a large number of non-coding mutations with uncharacterized biological significance. We summarize the strategies that have been developed to interpret and prioritize the biological mechanisms impacted by non-coding mutations, focusing on recent annotation of cancer non-coding variants utilizing chromatin states, eQTLs, and chromatin conformation data.We believe that a better understanding of how to apply different regulatory data types into the study of non-coding mutations will enhance the discovery of novel mechanisms driving cancer.© 2022.

Besides regulating tissue-specific and cell-type-specific transcription of target genes, enhancers themselves can be transcribed. By jointly analyzing large-scale cell-type-specific transcriptome and regulome data, we cataloged 30,795 neuronal and 23,265 non-neuronal candidate transcribed enhancers. Examination of the transcriptome in 1,382 brain samples identified robust expression of transcribed enhancers. We explored gene-enhancer coordination and found that enhancer-linked genes are strongly implicated in neuropsychiatric disease. We identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for both genes and enhancers and found that enhancer eQTLs mediate a substantial fraction of neuropsychiatric trait heritability. Inclusion of enhancer eQTLs in transcriptome-wide association studies enhanced functional interpretation of disease loci. Overall, our study characterizes the gene-enhancer regulome and genetic mechanisms in the human cortex in both healthy and diseased states.© 2022.

However, current lncRNA studies were mainly performed at the individual level and the significance of it is not well understood in wheat.In this study, the lncRNA landscape of wheat spike was characterized through analysing a total of 186 spike RNA-seq datasets from 93 wheat genotypes. A total of 35,913 lncRNAs as well as 1,619 lncRNA-mRNA pairs comprised of 443 lncRNAs and 464 mRNAs were obtained. Compared to coding genes, these lncRNAs displayed rather low conservation among wheat and other gramineous species. Based on re-sequencing data, the genetic variations of these lncRNA were investigated and obvious genetic bottleneck were found on them during wheat domestication process. Furthermore, 122 lncRNAs were found to act as ceRNA to regulate endogenous competition. Finally, association and co-localization analysis of the candidate lncRNA-mRNA pairs identified 170 lncRNAs and 167 target mRNAs significantly associated with spike-related traits, including lncRNA.127690.1/TraesCS2A02G518500.1 (PMEI) and lncRNA.104854.1/TraesCS6A02G050300.1 (ATG5) associated with heading date and spike length, respectively.This study reported the lncRNA landscape of wheat spike through the population transcriptome analysis, which not only contribute to better understand the wheat evolution from the perspective of lncRNA, but also lay the foundation for revealing roles of lncRNA playing in spike development.© 2022.

CeD affects multiple organs and systems in the body, and environmental factors play a key role in its complex pathogenesis. Although gluten exposure is known to be the causative agent, many unknown environmental factors can trigger or exacerbate CeD. In this study, we investigated the influence of genetic and environmental factors on CeD. Data from a CeD genome-wide association study that included 12,041 CeD cases and 12,228 controls were used to conduct a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using FUSION software. Gene expression reference data were obtained for the small intestine, whole blood, peripheral blood, and lymphocytes. We performed Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses using the significant genes identified by the TWAS and conducted a protein-protein interaction network analysis based on the STRING database to detect the function of TWAS-identified genes for CeD. We also performed a chemical-related gene set enrichment analysis (CGSEA) using the TWAS-identified genes to test the relationships between chemicals and CeD. The TWAS identified 8,692 genes, including 101 significant genes (padjusted< 0.05). The CGSEA identified 2,559 chemicals, including 178 chemicals that were significantly correlated with CeD. This study performed a TWAS (for genetic factors) and CGSEA (for environmental factors) and identified several CeD-associated genes and chemicals.

However, only limited drugs are available for psychiatric disorders and the efficacy of most currently used drugs is poor for many patients. To identify novel therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders, we performed genome-wide Mendelian randomization analyses by integrating brain-derived molecular quantitative trait loci (mRNA expression and protein abundance quantitative trait loci) of 1263 actionable proteins (targeted by approved drugs or drugs in clinical phase of development) and genetic findings from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Using transcriptome data, we identified 25 potential drug targets for psychiatric disorders, including 12 genes for schizophrenia, 7 for bipolar disorder, 7 for depression, and 1 (TIE1) for attention deficit and hyperactivity. We also identified 10 actionable drug targets by using brain proteome data, including 4 (HLA-DRB1, CAMKK2, P2RX7, and MAPK3) for schizophrenia, 1 (PRKCB) for bipolar disorder, 6 (PSMB4, IMPDH2, SERPINC1, GRIA1, P2RX7 and TAOK3) for depression. Of note, MAPK3 and HLA-DRB1 were supported by both transcriptome and proteome-wide MR analyses, suggesting that these two proteins are promising therapeutic targets for schizophrenia. Our study shows the power of integrating large-scale GWAS findings and transcriptomic and proteomic data in identifying actionable drug targets. Besides, our findings prioritize actionable novel drug targets for development of new therapeutics and provide critical drug-repurposing opportunities for psychiatric disorders.© 2022.

"36109769","Genetic regulation of RNA splicing in human pancreatic islets.","Genome Biol","Non-coding genetic variants that influence gene transcription in pancreatic islets play a major role in the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D), and likely also contribute to type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk. For many loci, however, the mechanisms through which non-coding variants influence diabetes susceptibility are unknown.We examine splicing QTLs (sQTLs) in pancreatic islets from 399 human donors and observe that common genetic variation has a widespread influence on the splicing of genes with established roles in islet biology and diabetes. In parallel, we profile expression QTLs (eQTLs) and use transcriptome-wide association as well as genetic co-localization studies to assign islet sQTLs or eQTLs to T2D and T1D susceptibility signals, many of which lack candidate effector genes. This analysis reveals biologically plausible mechanisms, including the association of T2D with an sQTL that creates a nonsense isoform in ERO1B, a regulator of ER-stress and proinsulin biosynthesis. The expanded list of T2D risk effector genes reveals overrepresented pathways, including regulators of G-protein-mediated cAMP production. The analysis of sQTLs also reveals candidate effector genes for T1D susceptibility such as DCLRE1B, a senescence regulator, and lncRNA MEG3.These data expose widespread effects of common genetic variants on RNA splicing in pancreatic islets. The results support a role for splicing variation in diabetes susceptibility, and offer a new set of genetic targets with potential therapeutic benefit.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In this study, we evaluate multi-omics models to predict four complex traits in barley (Hordeum vulgare); grain yield, thousand kernel weight, protein content, and nitrogen uptake. Genomic, transcriptomic, and DNA methylation data were obtained from 75 spring barley lines tested in the RadiMax semi-field phenomics facility under control and water-scarce treatment. By integrating multi-omics data at genomic, transcriptomic, and DNA methylation regulatory levels, a higher proportion of phenotypic variance was explained (0.72-0.91) than with genomic models alone (0.55-0.86). The correlation between predictions and phenotypes varied from 0.17-0.28 for control plants and 0.23-0.37 for water-scarce plants, and the increase in accuracy was significant for nitrogen uptake and protein content compared to models using genomic information alone. Adding transcriptomic and DNA methylation information to the prediction models explained more of the phenotypic variance attributed to the environment in grain yield and nitrogen uptake. It furthermore explained more of the non-additive genetic effects for thousand kernel weight and protein content. Our results show the feasibility of multi-omics prediction for complex traits in barley."

Our integrated genomic analysis of up to 933 myelofibrosis cases identifies 6 germline susceptibility loci, 4 of which overlap with previously identified MPN loci. Virtual karyotyping identifies high frequencies of mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs), with enrichment at myelofibrosis GWAS susceptibility loci and recurrently somatically mutated MPN genes (e.g., JAK2). We replicate prior MPN associations showing germline variation at the 9p24.1 risk haplotype confers elevated risk of acquiring JAK2V617Fmutations, demonstrating with long-read sequencing that this relationship occurs in cis. We also describe recurrent 9p24.1 large mCAs that selectively retained JAK2V617Fmutations. Germline variation associated with longer telomeres is associated with increased myelofibrosis risk. Myelofibrosis cases with high-frequency JAK2 mCAs have marked reductions in measured telomere length - suggesting a relationship between telomere biology and myelofibrosis clonal expansion. Our results advance understanding of the germline-somatic interaction at JAK2 and implicate mCAs involving JAK2 as strong promoters of clonal expansion of those mutated clones.© 2022.

"36075890","Evidence of genetic overlap and causal relationships between blood-based biochemical traits and human cortical anatomy.","Transl Psychiatry","Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia are commonly associated with structural brain alterations affecting the cortex. Recent genetic evidence suggests circulating metabolites and other biochemical traits play a causal role in many psychiatric disorders which could be mediated by changes in the cerebral cortex. Here, we leveraged publicly available genome-wide association study data to explore shared genetic architecture and evidence for causal relationships between a panel of 50 biochemical traits and measures of cortical thickness and surface area. Linkage disequilibrium score regression identified 191 genetically correlated biochemical-cortical trait pairings, with consistent representation of blood cell counts and other biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), haemoglobin and calcium. Spatially organised patterns of genetic correlation were additionally uncovered upon clustering of region-specific correlation profiles. Interestingly, by employing latent causal variable models, we found strong evidence suggesting CRP and vitamin D exert causal effects on region-specific cortical thickness, with univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization further supporting a negative causal relationship between serum CRP levels and thickness of the lingual region. Our findings suggest a subset of biochemical traits exhibit shared genetic architecture and potentially causal relationships with cortical structure in functionally distinct regions, which may contribute to alteration of cortical structure in psychiatric disorders.© 2022.

Analyses of genotype-expression associations show pronounced enrichment of associations with genes of drug response. The associations are primarily consistent across the two RNA-Seq datasets, with some modest variation, indicating the importance of obtaining multiple datasets to produce a robust resource. We further used an empirical Bayesian model to compare eQTL patterns in liver and an additional 20 GTEx tissues, finding that MHC genes, and especially class II genes, are enriched for liver-specific eQTL patterns. To illustrate the utility of the resource to augment GWAS analysis with small sample sizes, we developed a novel meta-analysis technique to combine several liver eQTL data sources. We also illustrate its application using a transcriptome-enhanced re-analysis of a study of neutropenia in pancreatic cancer patients.

"36064847","Huntington's disease age at motor onset is modified by the tandem hexamer repeat in TCERG1.","NPJ Genom Med","Huntington's disease is caused by an expanded CAG tract in HTT. The length of the CAG tract accounts for over half the variance in age at onset of disease, and is influenced by other genetic factors, mostly implicating the DNA maintenance machinery. We examined a single nucleotide variant, rs79727797, on chromosome 5 in the TCERG1 gene, previously reported to be associated with Huntington's disease and a quasi-tandem repeat (QTR) hexamer in exon 4 of TCERG1 with a central pure repeat. We developed a method for calling perfect and imperfect repeats from exome-sequencing data, and tested association between the QTR in TCERG1 and residual age at motor onset (after correcting for the effects of CAG length in the HTT gene) in 610 individuals with Huntington's disease via regression analysis. We found a significant association between age at onset and the sum of the repeat lengths from both alleles of the QTR (p = 2.1 × 10-9), with each added repeat hexamer reducing age at onset by one year (95% confidence interval [0.7, 1.4]). This association explained that previously observed with rs79727797. The association with age at onset in the genome-wide association study is due to a QTR hexamer in TCERG1, translated to a glutamine/alanine tract in the protein. We could not distinguish whether this was due to cis-effects of the hexamer repeat on gene expression or of the encoded glutamine/alanine tract in the protein. These results motivate further study of the mechanisms by which TCERG1 modifies onset of HD.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We performed 10 genome-wide association studies of resting state network measures of intrinsic brain activity in up to 36,150 participants of European ancestry in the UK Biobank. We found that the heritability of global network efficiency was largely explained by blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) resting state fluctuation amplitudes (RSFA), which are thought to reflect the vascular component of the BOLD signal. RSFA itself had a significant genetic component and we identified 24 genomic loci associated with RSFA, 157 genes whose predicted expression correlated with it, and 3 proteins in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 4 in plasma. We observed correlations with cardiovascular traits, and single-cell RNA specificity analyses revealed enrichment of vascular related cells. Our analyses also revealed a potential role of lipid transport, store-operated calcium channel activity, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate binding in resting-state BOLD fluctuations. We conclude that that the heritability of global network efficiency is largely explained by the vascular component of the BOLD response as ascertained by RSFA, which itself has a significant genetic component.© 2022.

"36055211","Genetics-informed precision treatment formulation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.","Am J Hum Genet","Genetically informed drug development and repurposing is an attractive prospect for improving patient outcomes in psychiatry; however, the effectiveness of these endeavors is confounded by heterogeneity. We propose an approach that links interventions implicated by disorder-associated genetic risk, at the population level, to a framework that can target these compounds to individuals. Specifically, results from genome-wide association studies are integrated with expression data to prioritize individual ""directional anchor"" genes for which the predicted risk-increasing direction of expression could be counteracted by an existing drug. While these compounds represent plausible therapeutic candidates, they are not likely to be equally efficacious for all individuals. To account for this heterogeneity, we constructed polygenic scores restricted to variants annotated to the network of genes that interact with each directional anchor gene. These metrics, which we call a pharmagenic enrichment score (PES), identify individuals with a higher burden of genetic risk, localized in biological processes related to the candidate drug target, to inform precision drug repurposing. We used this approach to investigate schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and reveal several compounds targeting specific directional anchor genes that could be plausibly repurposed. These genetic risk scores, mapped to the networks associated with target genes, revealed biological insights that cannot be observed in undifferentiated genome-wide polygenic risk score (PRS). For example, an enrichment of these partitioned scores in schizophrenia cases with otherwise low PRS. In summary, genetic risk could be used more specifically to direct drug repurposing candidates that target particular genes implicated in psychiatric and other complex disorders.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

The role of folate is particularly important in pregnancy, where there is rapid cellular and tissue growth. Maternal folate deficiencies secondary to inadequate dietary supplementation are known to produce defects in the neural tube and spinal cord, yet the exact mechanism of folate in neurodevelopment is unknown. The consequences of maternal folate deficiency on offspring brain development and function beyond gestation are not well defined. The objective of this review is to investigate the role of folate deficiency in offspring neurodevelopment, and the complications that arise post-gestation. This was accomplished through a comprehensive review of the data presented in both clinical and preclinical studies. Evidence supports that folate deficiency is associated with altered offspring neurodevelopment, including smaller total brain volume, altered cortical thickness and cerebral white matter, altered neurogenesis, and neuronal apoptosis. Some of these changes have been associated with altered brain function in offspring with memory, motor function, language skills, and psychological issues. This review of literature also presents potential mechanisms of folate deficiency in neurodevelopment with altered metabolism, neuroinflammation, epigenetic modification through DNA methylation, and a genetic deficiency in one-carbon metabolism."

They may be combined with other medications as an additional treatment or used alone as a monotherapy. In addition to insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and metformin, these molecules appear as possible therapeutic options. Oxadiazole rings have been employed in numerous different ways during drug development efforts. It has been shown that including them in the pharmacophore increases the amount of ligand that may be bound. The exceptional hydrogen bond acceptor properties of oxadiazoles and the distinct hydrocarbon bonding potential of their regioisomers have been established. Beside their anti-diabetic effects, oxadiazoles display a wide range of pharmacological properties. In this study, we made the assumption that molecules containing oxadiazole rings may afford a different approach to the treatment of diabetes, not only for controlling glycemic levels but also for preventing atherosclerosis progression and other complications associated with diabetes. It was observed that oxadiazole fusion with benzothiazole, 5-(2,5,2-trifluoroethoxy) phenyl, β-homophenylalanine, 2-methyl-2-{5-(4-chlorophenyl), diamine-bridgedbis-coumarinyl, 5-aryl-2-(6'-nitrobenzofuran-2'-yl), nitrobenzofuran, and/or oxindole leads to potential anti-diabetic activity."

"36097183","Independent phenotypic plasticity axes define distinct obesity sub-types.","Nat Metab","Studies in genetically 'identical' individuals indicate that as much as 50% of complex trait variation cannot be traced to genetics or to the environment. The mechanisms that generate this 'unexplained' phenotypic variation (UPV) remain largely unknown. Here, we identify neuronatin (NNAT) as a conserved factor that buffers against UPV. We find that Nnat deficiency in isogenic mice triggers the emergence of a bi-stable polyphenism, where littermates emerge into adulthood either 'normal' or 'overgrown'. Mechanistically, this is mediated by an insulin-dependent overgrowth that arises from histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent β-cell hyperproliferation. A multi-dimensional analysis of monozygotic twin discordance reveals the existence of two patterns of human UPV, one of which (Type B) phenocopies the NNAT-buffered polyphenism identified in mice. Specifically, Type-B monozygotic co-twins exhibit coordinated increases in fat and lean mass across the body; decreased NNAT expression; increased HDAC-responsive gene signatures; and clinical outcomes linked to insulinemia. Critically, the Type-B UPV signature stratifies both childhood and adult cohorts into four metabolic states, including two phenotypically and molecularly distinct types of obesity.© 2022.

Neuroanatomical studies done by the authors have shown decreased total dendritic length, intersections, dendritic length per branch order and nodes in the CA1 hippocampal region of the diabetic brain as compared to its normal control group, indicating reduced dendritic arborization of the hippocampal CA1 neurons. Epigenetic alterations in the brain are well known to affect age-associated disorders, however its association with the evolving diabetes-induced damage in the brain is still not fully understood. DNA hypermethylation within the neurons, tend to silent the gene expression of several regulatory proteins. The findings in the study have shown an increase in global DNA methylation in palmitic acid-induced lipotoxic Neuro-2a cells as well as within the diabetic mice brain. Inhibiting DNA methylation, restored the levels of HSF1 and certain HSPs, suggesting plausible effect of DNMTs in maintaining the proteostasis and synaptic fidelity. Neuroinflammation, as exhibited by the astrocyte activation (GFAP), were further significantly decreased in the 5-azadeoxycytidine group (DNMT inhibitor). This was further evidenced by decrease in proinflammatory cytokines TNF⍺, IL-6, and mediators iNOS and Phospho-NFkB. Our results suggest that changes in DNA methylation advocate epigenetic dysregulation and its involvement in disrupting the synaptic exactitude in the hippocampus of diabetic mice model, providing an insight into the pathophysiology of diabetes-induced neuroepigenetic changes.© 2022.

"36163277","Identification of shared and differentiating genetic architecture for autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and case subgroups.","Nat Genet","Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are highly heritable neurodevelopmental conditions, with considerable overlap in their genetic etiology. We dissected their shared and distinct genetic etiology by cross-disorder analyses of large datasets. We identified seven loci shared by the disorders and five loci differentiating them. All five differentiating loci showed opposite allelic directions in the two disorders and significant associations with other traits, including educational attainment, neuroticism and regional brain volume. Integration with brain transcriptome data enabled us to identify and prioritize several significantly associated genes. The shared genomic fraction contributing to both disorders was strongly correlated with other psychiatric phenotypes, whereas the differentiating portion was correlated most strongly with cognitive traits. Additional analyses revealed that individuals diagnosed with both ASD and ADHD were double-loaded with genetic predispositions for both disorders and showed distinctive patterns of genetic association with other traits compared with the ASD-only and ADHD-only subgroups. These results provide insights into the biological foundation of the development of one or both conditions and of the factors driving psychopathology discriminatively toward either ADHD or ASD.© 2022.

"36114277","Leveraging interindividual variability of regulatory activity for refining genetic regulation of gene expression in schizophrenia.","Mol Psychiatry","Schizophrenia is a polygenic psychiatric disorder with limited understanding about the mechanistic changes in gene expression regulation. To elucidate on this, we integrate interindividual variability of regulatory activity (ChIP-sequencing for H3K27ac histone mark) with gene expression and genotype data captured from the prefrontal cortex of 272 cases and controls. By measuring interindividual correlation among proximal chromatin peaks, we show that regulatory element activity is structured into 10,936 and 10,376 cis-regulatory domains in cases and controls, respectively. The schizophrenia-specific cis-regulatory domains are enriched for fetal-specific (p = 0.0014, OR = 1.52) and depleted of adult-specific regulatory activity (p = 3.04 × 10-50, OR = 0.57) and are enriched for SCZ heritability (p = 0.001). By studying the interplay among genetic variants, gene expression, and cis-regulatory domains, we ascertain that changes in coordinated regulatory activity tag alterations in gene expression levels (p = 3.43 × 10-5, OR = 1.65), unveil case-specific QTL effects, and identify regulatory machinery changes for genes affecting synaptic function and dendritic spine morphology in schizophrenia. Altogether, we show that accounting for coordinated regulatory activity provides a novel mechanistic approach to reduce the search space for unveiling genetically perturbed regulation of gene expression in schizophrenia.© 2022.

"36093044","Genetic association and Mendelian randomization for hypothyroidism highlight immune molecular mechanisms.","iScience","We carried out a genome-wide association analysis including 51,194 cases of hypothyroidism and 443,383 controls. In total, 139 risk loci were associated to hypothyroidism with genes involved in lymphocyte function. Candidate genes associated with hypothyroidism were identified by using molecular quantitative trait loci, colocalization, and enhancer-promoter chromatin looping. Mendelian randomization (MR) identified 42 blood expressed genes and circulating proteins as candidate causal molecules in hypothyroidism. Drug-gene interaction analysis provided evidence that immune checkpoint and tyrosine kinase inhibitors used in cancer therapy increase the risk of hypothyroidism. Hence, integrative mapping and MR support that expression of genes and proteins enriched in lymphocyte function are associated with the risk of hypothyroidism and provide genetic evidence for drug-induced hypothyroidism and identify actionable potential drug targets.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36068241","Multimodal single cell sequencing implicates chromatin accessibility and genetic background in diabetic kidney disease progression.","Nat Commun","The proximal tubule is a key regulator of kidney function and glucose metabolism. Diabetic kidney disease leads to proximal tubule injury and changes in chromatin accessibility that modify the activity of transcription factors involved in glucose metabolism and inflammation. Here we use single nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing to show that diabetic kidney disease leads to reduced accessibility of glucocorticoid receptor binding sites and an injury-associated expression signature in the proximal tubule. We hypothesize that chromatin accessibility is regulated by genetic background and closely-intertwined with metabolic memory, which pre-programs the proximal tubule to respond differently to external stimuli. Glucocorticoid excess has long been known to increase risk for type 2 diabetes, which raises the possibility that glucocorticoid receptor inhibition may mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of diabetic kidney disease.© 2022.

"36067235","Polygenic signals of sex differences in selection in humans from the UK Biobank.","PLoS Biol","Sex differences in the fitness effects of genetic variants can influence the rate of adaptation and the maintenance of genetic variation. For example, ""sexually antagonistic"" (SA) variants, which are beneficial for one sex and harmful for the other, can both constrain adaptation and increase genetic variability for fitness components such as survival, fertility, and disease susceptibility. However, detecting variants with sex-differential fitness effects is difficult, requiring genome sequences and fitness measurements from large numbers of individuals. Here, we develop new theory for studying sex-differential selection across a complete life cycle and test our models with genotypic and reproductive success data from approximately 250,000 UK Biobank individuals. We uncover polygenic signals of sex-differential selection affecting survival, reproductive success, and overall fitness, with signals of sex-differential reproductive selection reflecting a combination of SA polymorphisms and sexually concordant polymorphisms in which the strength of selection differs between the sexes. Moreover, these signals hold up to rigorous controls that minimise the contributions of potential confounders, including sequence mapping errors, population structure, and ascertainment bias. Functional analyses reveal that sex-differentiated sites are enriched in phenotype-altering genomic regions, including coding regions and loci affecting a range of quantitative traits. Population genetic analyses show that sex-differentiated sites exhibit evolutionary histories dominated by genetic drift and/or transient balancing selection, but not long-term balancing selection, which is consistent with theoretical predictions of effectively weak SA balancing selection in historically small populations. Overall, our results are consistent with polygenic sex-differential-including SA-selection in humans. Evidence for sex-differential selection is particularly strong for variants affecting reproductive success, in which the potential contributions of nonrandom sampling to signals of sex differentiation can be excluded."

Several studies show that long-term exercise improves spatial learning and memory, enhances hypothalamic leptin sensitivity, and regulates energy balance. However, the effect of exercise on the hippocampus and hypothalamus is not fully understood. The study aimed to find epigenetic modifications or changes in gene expression of the hippocampus and hypothalamus due to exercise.Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into sedentary and exercise groups. All mice in the exercise group were subjected to treadmill exercise 5 days per week for 1 h each day. After the 12-week exercise intervention, the hippocampus and hypothalamus tissue were used for RNA-sequencing or molecular biology experiments.In both groups, numerous differentially expressed genes of the hippocampus (up-regulated: 53, down-regulated: 49) and hypothalamus (up-regulated: 24, down-regulated: 40) were observed. In the exercise group, increased level of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) was observed in the hippocampus and hypothalamus (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) of the hippocampus and hypothalamus were down-regulated in the exercise group (p < 0.001). In addition, the Fto co-expression genes of the mouse brain were studied and analyzed using database to determine the potential roles of exercise-downregulated FTO in the brain.The findings demonstrate that long-term exercise might elevates the levels of m6A-tagged transcripts in the hippocampus and hypothalamus via down-regulation of FTO. Hence, exercise might be an effective intervention for epigenetic modification.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36115924","Deficiency of Irx5 protects mice from obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities.","Int J Obes (Lond)","Obesity, a leading cause of several metabolic abnormalities, is mainly caused by imbalanced energy homeostasis. IRX3 and IRX5 have been suggested as genetic determinants of obesity in connection with the intronic variants of the FTO gene, the strongest genetic risk factor of polygenic obesity in humans. Although the causal effects of Irx3 and its cooperation with Irx5 in obesity and associated metabolic abnormalities have been demonstrated in vivo, the function of Irx5 in energy homeostasis remains unclear. Here we aim to decipher the actions of Irx5 in the regulation of obesity and metabolic abnormalities.We employed a mouse model homozygous for an Irx5-knockout (Irx5KO) allele and determined its metabolic phenotype in the presence or absence of a high-fat diet challenge. To investigate the function of Irx5 in the regulation of energy homeostasis, adipose thermogenesis and hypothalamic leptin response were assessed, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in the hypothalamic arcuate-median eminence (ARC-ME) was conducted.Irx5KOmice were leaner and resistant to diet-induced obesity as well as associated metabolic abnormalities, primarily through loss of adiposity. Assessments of energy expenditure and long-term dietary intake revealed that an increase in basal metabolic rate with adipose thermogenesis and a reduction of food intake with improved hypothalamic leptin response in Irx5KOmice may contribute to the anti-obesity effects. Utilizing scRNA-seq and marker gene analyses, we demonstrated the number of ARC-ME neurons was elevated in Irx5KOmice, suggesting a direct role for Irx5 in hypothalamic feeding control.Our study demonstrates that Irx5 is a genetic factor determining body mass/composition and obesity and regulates both energy expenditure and intake.© 2022.

Their association, based on common metabolic risk factors (obesity, insulin resistance (IR), unhealthy lifestyle), brings an additional risk of both hepatic and cardiovascular (CV) adverse clinical outcomes. The terminology of ""NAFLD"" is stigmatizing to some but not all patients, and a more practical one should be announced soon. Medical strategies can address both diseases simultaneously, as they have crossing pathophysiological mechanisms, mainly IR. Strategies vary from lifestyle intervention and pharmacological options, as more molecules designated for T2DM treatment may be helpful in NAFLD, to surgical procedures. This review focuses on the coexistence of NAFLD and T2DM, pointing out the utility of the appropriate terminology, its prevalence, and mortality rates among the diabetic population. Briefly, we have discussed the main pathophysiological mechanisms and the risk stratification algorithm for the development of NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as well as the tools for evaluation of fibrosis. Finally, we have focused on the current therapeutic options for the treatment of NAFLD associated with T2DM."

To date, plenty of articles related to the progress and applications of GE have been published globally, but the objective, quantitative and comprehensive investigations of them are relatively few. Here, 13,980 research articles and reviews published since 1999 were collected by using GE-related queries in the Web of Science. We used bibliometric analysis to investigate the competitiveness and cooperation of leading countries, influential affiliations, and prolific authors. Text clustering methods were used to assess technical trends and research hotspots dynamically. The global application status and regulatory framework were also summarized. This analysis illustrates the bottleneck of the GE innovation and provides insights into the future trajectory of development and application of the technology in various fields, which will be helpful for the popularization of gene editing technology."

In this study, we assessed whether the supplementation of human white adipocytes, differentiated from human adipose tissue-derived stem cells, with nicotinamide riboside (NR), a potent NAD + precursor, can shift differentiation to beige adipocytes (beiging). NR induced mitochondrial biogenesis and the expression of beige markers (TBX1 and UCP1) in white adipocytes demonstrating that NR can declutch beiging. NR did not induce PARP activity but supported SIRT1 induction, which plays a key role in beiging. NR induced etomoxir-resistant respiration, suggesting increases in the oxidation of carbohydrates, carbohydrate breakdown products, or amino acids. Furthermore, NR boosted oligomycin-resistant respiration corresponding to uncoupled respiration. Enhanced etomoxir and oligomycin-resistant respiration were dependent on mitochondrial reactive-species production. Taken together, NR supplementation can induce beiging and uncoupled respiration, which are beneficial for combatting metabolic diseases.Copyright © 2022 Nagy, Rauch, Szerafin, Uray, Tóth and Bai."
"36052370","1,000 ancient genomes uncover 10,000 years of natural selection in Europe.","bioRxiv","Ancient DNA has revolutionized our understanding of human population history. However, its potential to examine how rapid cultural evolution to new lifestyles may have driven biological adaptation has not been met, largely due to limited sample sizes. We assembled genome-wide data from 1,291 individuals from Europe over 10,000 years, providing a dataset that is large enough to resolve the timing of selection into the Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Historical periods. We identified 25 genetic loci with rapid changes in frequency during these periods, a majority of which were previously undetected. Signals specific to the Neolithic transition are associated with body weight, diet, and lipid metabolism-related phenotypes. They also include immune phenotypes, most notably a locus that confers immunity toSalmonellainfection at a time when ancientSalmonellagenomes have been shown to adapt to human hosts, thus providing a possible example of human-pathogen co-evolution. In the Bronze Age, selection signals are enriched near genes involved in pigmentation and immune-related traits, including at a key human protein interactor of SARS-CoV-2. Only in the Historical period do the selection candidates we detect largely mirror previously-reported signals, highlighting how the statistical power of previous studies was limited to the last few millennia. The Historical period also has multiple signals associated with vitamin D binding, providing evidence that lactase persistence may have been part of an oligogenic adaptation for efficient calcium uptake and challenging the theory that its adaptive value lies only in facilitating caloric supplementation during times of scarcity. Finally, we detect selection on complex traits in all three periods, including selection favoring variants that reduce body weight in the Neolithic. In the Historical period, we detect selection favoring variants that increase risk for cardiovascular disease plausibly reflecting selection for a more active inflammatory response that would have been adaptive in the face of increased infectious disease exposure. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for the high prevalence of these deadly diseases in modern societies today and highlight the unique power of ancient DNA in elucidating biological change that accompanied the profound cultural transformations of recent human history."
"36151087","Pairwise genetic meta-analyses between schizophrenia and substance dependence phenotypes reveals novel association signals with pharmacological significance.","Transl Psychiatry","Almost half of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia also present with a substance use disorder, however, little is known about potential molecular mechanisms underlying this comorbidity. We used genetic analyses to enhance our understanding of the molecular overlap between these conditions. Our analyses revealed a positive genetic correlation between schizophrenia and the following dependence phenotypes: alcohol (rg = 0.368, SE = 0.076, P = 1.61 × 10-6), cannabis use disorder (rg = 0.309, SE = 0.033, P = 1.97 × 10-20) and nicotine (rg = 0.117, SE = 0.043, P = 7.0 × 10-3), as well as drinks per week (rg = 0.087, SE = 0.021, P = 6.36 × 10-5), cigarettes per day (rg = 0.11, SE = 0.024, P = 4.93 × 10-6) and life-time cannabis use (rg = 0.234, SE = 0.029, P = 3.74 × 10-15). We further constructed latent causal variable (LCV) models to test for partial genetic causality and found evidence for a potential causal relationship between alcohol dependence and schizophrenia (GCP = 0.6, SE = 0.22, P = 1.6 × 10-3). This putative causal effect with schizophrenia was not seen using a continuous phenotype of drinks consumed per week, suggesting that distinct molecular mechanisms underlying dependence are involved in the relationship between alcohol and schizophrenia. To localise the specific genetic overlap between schizophrenia and substance use disorders (SUDs), we conducted a gene-based and gene-set pairwise meta-analysis between schizophrenia and each of the four individual substance dependence phenotypes in up to 790,806 individuals. These bivariate meta-analyses identified 44 associations not observed in the individual GWAS, including five shared genes that play a key role in early central nervous system development. The results from this study further supports the existence of underlying shared biology that drives the overlap in substance dependence in schizophrenia, including specific biological systems related to metabolism and neuronal function.© 2022.

Detecting the evidence of AM has been challenging due to the lack of large-scale datasets that include phenotypic data on both partners, especially in populations of non-European ancestries. Gametic phase disequilibrium between trait-associated alleles is a signature of parental AM on a polygenic trait, which can be detected even without partner data. Here, using polygenic scores for 81 traits in the Japanese population using BioBank Japan Project genome-wide association studies data (n = 172,270), we found evidence of AM on the liability to type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease, as well as on dietary habits. In cross-population comparison using United Kingdom Biobank data (n = 337,139) we found shared but heterogeneous impacts of AM between populations.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36131119","Depression and bipolar disorder subtypes differ in their genetic correlations with biological rhythms.","Sci Rep","Major Depression and Bipolar Disorder Type I (BIP-I) and Type II (BIP-II), are characterized by depressed, manic, and hypomanic episodes in which specific changes of physical activity, circadian rhythm, and sleep are observed. It is known that genetic factors contribute to variation in mood disorders and biological rhythms, but unclear to what extent there is an overlap between their underlying genetics. In the present study, data from genome-wide association studies were used to examine the genetic relationship between mood disorders and biological rhythms. We tested the genetic correlation of depression, BIP-I, and BIP-II with physical activity (overall physical activity, moderate activity, sedentary behaviour), circadian rhythm (relative amplitude), and sleep features (sleep duration, daytime sleepiness). Genetic correlations of depression, BIP-I, and BIP-II with biological rhythms were compared to discover commonalities and differences. A gene-based analysis tested for associations of single genes and common circadian genes with mood disorders. Depression was negatively correlated with overall physical activity and positively with sedentary behaviour, while BIP-I showed associations in the opposite direction. Depression and BIP-II had negative correlations with relative amplitude. All mood disorders were positively correlated with daytime sleepiness. Overall, we observed both genetic commonalities and differences across mood disorders in their relationships with biological rhythms: depression and BIP-I differed the most, while BIP-II was in an intermediate position. Gene-based analysis suggested potential targets for further investigation. The present results suggest shared genetic underpinnings for the clinically observed associations between mood disorders and biological rhythms. Research considering possible joint mechanisms may offer avenues for improving disease detection and treatment.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The aim of the present study was to untangle this relationship using genetically based approaches.By leveraging large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of T2D and COVID-19 severity, linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were utilized to quantify the genetic correlations and causal relationships between the two traits. Gene-based association and enrichment analysis were further applied to identify putative functional pathways shared between T2D and COVID-19 severity.Significant, moderate genetic correlations were detected between T2D and COVID-19 hospitalization (rg = 0.156, SE = 0.057, p = 0.005) or severe disease (rg = 0.155, SE = 0.057, p = 0.006). MR analysis did not support evidence for a causal effect of T2D on COVID-19 hospitalization (OR 1.030, 95% CI 0.979, 1.084, p = 0.259) or severe disease (OR 0.999, 95% CI 0.934, 1.069, p = 0.982). Genes having pgene < 0.05 for both T2D and COVID-19 severe were significantly enriched for biological pathways, such as response to type I interferon, glutathione derivative metabolic process and glutathione derivative biosynthetic process.Our findings further confirm the comorbidity of T2D and COVID-19 severity, but a non-causal impact of T2D on severe COVID-19.

A significant causal effect of smoking on schizophrenia has been reported in European populations using the Mendelian randomization approach; however, no evidence of causality was found in participants from East Asia. Using Taiwan Biobank (TWBB), we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify susceptibility loci for smoking behaviors, including smoking initiation (N = 79,989) and the onset age (N = 15,582). We then meta-analyzed GWAS from TWBB and Biobank Japan (BBJ) with the total sample size of 245,425 for smoking initiation and 46,000 for onset age of smoking. The GWAS for schizophrenia was taken from the East Asia Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, which included 22,778 cases and 35,362 controls. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization to estimate the causality of smoking behaviors on schizophrenia in East Asia. In TWBB, we identified one locus that met genome-wide significance for onset age. In a meta-analysis of TWBB and BBJ, we identified two loci for smoking initiation. In Mendelian randomization, genetically predicted smoking initiation (odds ratio (OR) = 4.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.89-18.01, P = 0.071) and onset age (OR for a per-year increase = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.91-1.01, P = 0.098) were not significantly associated with schizophrenia; the direction of effect was consistent with European Ancestry samples, which had higher statistical power.

"36085328","Socioeconomic and genomic roots of verbal ability from current evidence.","NPJ Sci Learn","This research examines how the human genome and SES jointly and interactively shape verbal ability among youth in the U.S. The youth are aged 12-18 when the study starts. The research draws on findings from the latest GWAS as well as a rich set of longitudinal SES measures at individual, family and neighborhood levels from Add Health (N = 7194). Both SES and genome measures predict verbal ability well separately and jointly. More interestingly, the inclusion of both sets of predictors in the same model corrects for about 20% upward bias in the effect of the education PGS, and implies that about 20-30% of the effects of parental SES are not environmental, but parentally genomic. The three incremental R2s that measure the relative contributions of the two PGSs, the genomic component in parental SES, and the environmental component in parental SES are estimated to be about 1.5%, 1.5%, and 7.8%, respectively. The total environmental R2and the total genomic R2are, thus, 7.8% and 3%, respectively. These findings confirm the importance of SES environment and also pose challenges to traditional social-science research. Not only does an individual's genome have an important direct influence on verbal ability, parental genomes also influence verbal ability through parental SES. The decades-long blueprint of including SES in a model and interpreting their effects as those of SES needs to be amended accordingly. A straightforward solution is to routinely collect DNA data for large social-science studies granted that the primary purpose is to understand social and environmental influences.© 2022.

"36075892","Pharmacogenomics polygenic risk score for drug response prediction using PRS-PGx methods.","Nat Commun","Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have been successfully developed for the prediction of human diseases and complex traits in the past years. For drug response prediction in randomized clinical trials, a common practice is to apply PRS built from a disease genome-wide association study (GWAS) directly to a corresponding pharmacogenomics (PGx) setting. Here, we show that such an approach relies on stringent assumptions about the prognostic and predictive effects of the selected genetic variants. We propose a shift from disease PRS to PGx PRS approaches by simultaneously modeling both the prognostic and predictive effects and further make this shift possible by developing a series of PRS-PGx methods, including a novel Bayesian regression approach (PRS-PGx-Bayes). Simulation studies show that PRS-PGx methods generally outperform the disease PRS methods and PRS-PGx-Bayes is superior to all other PRS-PGx methods. We further apply the PRS-PGx methods to PGx GWAS data from a large cardiovascular randomized clinical trial (IMPROVE-IT) to predict treatment related LDL cholesterol reduction. The results demonstrate substantial improvement of PRS-PGx-Bayes in both prediction accuracy and the capability of capturing the treatment-specific predictive effects while compared with the disease PRS approaches.© 2022.

CHB-CVDC currently includes 96 308 patients. The cohort is part of CHB initiated in 2009 in the Capital Region of Denmark. CHB is continuously growing with ~40 000 samples/year. Patients in CHB were included in CHB-CVDC if they were above 18 years of age and assigned at least one cardiovascular diagnosis. Additionally, up-to 110 000 blood donors can be analysed jointly with CHB-CVDC. Linkage with the Danish National Health Registries, Electronic Patient Records, and Clinical Quality Databases allow up-to 41 years of medical history. All individuals are genotyped using the Infinium Global Screening Array from Illumina and imputed using a reference panel consisting of whole-genome sequence data from 8429 Danes along with 7146 samples from North-Western Europe. Currently, 39 539 of the patients are deceased.Here, we demonstrate the utility of the cohort by showing concordant effects between known variants and selected CVDs, that is, >93% concordance for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and cholesterol measurements and 85% concordance for hypertension. Furthermore, we evaluated multiple study designs and the validity of using Danish blood donors as part of CHB-CVDC. Lastly, CHB-CVDC has already made major contributions to studies of sick sinus syndrome and the role of phytosterols in development of atherosclerosis.In addition to genetics, electronic patient records, national socioeconomic and health registries extensively characterise each patient in CHB-CVDC and provides a promising framework for improved understanding of risk and protective variants.

QT interval abnormalities are associated with potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Using genome-wide multi-ancestry analyses (>250,000 individuals) we identify 177, 156 and 121 independent loci for QT, JT and QRS, respectively, including a male-specific X-chromosome locus. Using gene-based rare-variant methods, we identify associations with Mendelian disease genes. Enrichments are observed in established pathways for QT and JT, and previously unreported genes indicated in insulin-receptor signalling and cardiac energy metabolism. In contrast for QRS, connective tissue components and processes for cell growth and extracellular matrix interactions are significantly enriched. We demonstrate polygenic risk score associations with atrial fibrillation, conduction disease and sudden cardiac death. Prioritization of druggable genes highlight potential therapeutic targets for arrhythmia.

Mania and psychosis were associated with the shared liability component (mania β = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.23-0.34; P = 3.04 × 10-25; psychosis β = 0.05; 95% CI, 0.04-0.07; P = 2.33 × 10-13) and the components that differentiate each of schizophrenia (mania β = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03-0.14; P = .002; psychosis β = 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.04; P = 1.0 × 10-4) and BD (mania β = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.09-0.20; P = 1.99 × 10-7; psychosis β = 0.02; 95% CI, 0.01-0.03; P = .006) from the other disorders. The BD differentiating component was associated with mania independently of effects on psychosis (β = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.08-0.20; P = 4.32 × 10-6) but not with psychosis independently of mania. Conversely, the schizophrenia differentiating component was associated with psychosis independently of effects on mania (β = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.003-0.03; P = .02), but not with mania independently of psychosis. Mood incongruence of psychosis was associated only with the schizophrenia differentiating component (β = 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.05; P = .005). Depression was associated with higher MDD differentiating component (β = 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.12; P = .01) but lower BD differentiating component (β = -0.11; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.06; P = 7.06 × 10-5).In this study of BD, clinical heterogeneity reflected the burden of liability to BD and the contribution of alleles that have differentiating effects on risk for other disorders; mania, psychosis, and depression were associated with the components of genetic liability differentiating BD, MDD, and schizophrenia, respectively. Understanding the basis of this etiological heterogeneity will be critical for identifying the different pathophysiological processes underlying BD, stratifying patients, and developing precision therapeutics."

Yet, how the three-dimensional (3D) genome organization underlies the development and functions of ILCs is unknown. Herein, we carried out an integrative analysis of the 3D genome structure, chromatin accessibility and gene expression in mature ILCs. Our results revealed that the local 3D configuration of the genome is rewired specifically at loci associated with ILC biology to promote their development and functional differentiation. Importantly, we demonstrated that the ontogenesis of ILC2s and the progression of allergic airway inflammation are determined by a unique local 3D configuration of the region containing the ILC-lineage-defining factor Id2, which is characterized by multiple interactions between the Id2 promoter and distal regulatory elements bound by the transcription factors GATA-3 and RORα, unveiling the mechanism whereby the Id2 expression is specifically controlled in group 2 ILCs.© 2022.

"36114195","The evolving view of thermogenic fat and its implications in cancer and metabolic diseases.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","The incidence of metabolism-related diseases like obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus has reached pandemic levels worldwide and increased gradually. Most of them are listed on the table of high-risk factors for malignancy, and metabolic disorders systematically or locally contribute to cancer progression and poor prognosis of patients. Importantly, adipose tissue is fundamental to the occurrence and development of these metabolic disorders. White adipose tissue stores excessive energy, while thermogenic fat including brown and beige adipose tissue dissipates energy to generate heat. In addition to thermogenesis, beige and brown adipocytes also function as dynamic secretory cells and a metabolic sink of nutrients, like glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids. Accordingly, strategies that activate and expand thermogenic adipose tissue offer therapeutic promise to combat overweight, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders through increasing energy expenditure and enhancing glucose tolerance. With a better understanding of its origins and biological functions and the advances in imaging techniques detecting thermogenesis, the roles of thermogenic adipose tissue in tumors have been revealed gradually. On the one hand, enhanced browning of subcutaneous fatty tissue results in weight loss and cancer-associated cachexia. On the other hand, locally activated thermogenic adipocytes in the tumor microenvironment accelerate cancer progression by offering fuel sources and is likely to develop resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we enumerate current knowledge about the significant advances made in the origin and physiological functions of thermogenic fat. In addition, we discuss the multiple roles of thermogenic adipocytes in different tumors. Ultimately, we summarize imaging technologies for identifying thermogenic adipose tissue and pharmacologic agents via modulating thermogenesis in preclinical experiments and clinical trials.© 2022.

"36064597","Histone deacetylation primes self-propagation of heterochromatin domains to promote epigenetic inheritance.","Nat Struct Mol Biol","Heterochromatin assembly, involving histone H3 lysine-9 methylation (H3K9me), is nucleated at specific genomic sites but can self-propagate across extended domains and, indeed, generations. Self-propagation requires Clr4/Suv39h methyltransferase recruitment by pre-existing H3K9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) to perpetuate H3K9me deposition and is dramatically affected by chromatin context. However, the mechanism priming self-propagation of heterochromatin remains undefined. We show that robust chromatin association of fission yeast class II histone deacetylase Clr3 is necessary and sufficient to support heterochromatin propagation in different chromosomal contexts. Efficient targeting of Clr3, which suppresses histone turnover and maintains H3K9me3, enables self-propagation of an ectopic heterochromatin domain via the Clr4/Suv39h read-write mechanism requiring methylated histones. The deacetylase activity of Clr3 is necessary and, when inactivated, heterochromatin propagation can be recapitulated by removing two major histone acetyltransferases. Our results show that histone deacetylation, a conserved heterochromatin feature, preserves H3K9me3 that transmits epigenetic memory for stable propagation of silenced chromatin domains through multiple generations.© 2022.

Dynamic control of DNA methylation is therefore vital for embryogenesis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.Here we report a single-cell transcriptomic atlas from Dnmt and Tet mutant mouse embryos during early organogenesis. We show that both the maintenance and de novo methyltransferase enzymes are dispensable for the formation of all major cell types at E8.5. However, DNA methyltransferases are required for silencing of prior or alternative cell fates such as pluripotency and extraembryonic programmes. Deletion of all three TET enzymes produces substantial lineage biases, in particular, a failure to generate primitive erythrocytes. Single-cell multi-omics profiling moreover reveals that this is linked to a failure to demethylate distal regulatory elements in Tet triple-knockout embryos.This study provides a detailed analysis of the effects of perturbing DNA methylation on mouse organogenesis at a whole organism scale and affords new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of cell fate decisions.© 2022.

"36050461","Dynamic genome evolution in a model fern.","Nat Plants","The large size and complexity of most fern genomes have hampered efforts to elucidate fundamental aspects of fern biology and land plant evolution through genome-enabled research. Here we present a chromosomal genome assembly and associated methylome, transcriptome and metabolome analyses for the model fern species Ceratopteris richardii. The assembly reveals a history of remarkably dynamic genome evolution including rapid changes in genome content and structure following the most recent whole-genome duplication approximately 60 million years ago. These changes include massive gene loss, rampant tandem duplications and multiple horizontal gene transfers from bacteria, contributing to the diversification of defence-related gene families. The insertion of transposable elements into introns has led to the large size of the Ceratopteris genome and to exceptionally long genes relative to other plants. Gene family analyses indicate that genes directing seed development were co-opted from those controlling the development of fern sporangia, providing insights into seed plant evolution. Our findings and annotated genome assembly extend the utility of Ceratopteris as a model for investigating and teaching plant biology.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36131801","A microRNA-microRNA crosstalk network inferred from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism variants in natural populations of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>.","Front Plant Sci","To adapt to variable natural conditions, plants have evolved several strategies to respond to different environmental stresses. MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated gene regulation is one of such strategies. Variants, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the mature miRNAs or their target sites may cause the alteration of regulatory networks and serious phenotype changes. In this study, we proposed a novel approach to construct a miRNA-miRNA crosstalk network inArabidopsis thalianabased on the notion that two cooperative miRNAs toward common targets are under a strong pressure to be inherited together across ecotypes. By performing a genome-wide scan of the SNPs within the mature miRNAs and their target sites, we defined a ""regulation fate profile"" to describe a miRNA-target regulation being static (kept) or dynamic (gained or lost) across 1,135 ecotypes compared with the reference genome of Col-0. The cooperative miRNA pairs were identified by estimating the similarity of their regulation fate profiles toward the common targets. The reliability of the cooperative miRNA pairs was supported by solid expressional correlation, high PPImiRFS scores, and similar stress responses. Different combinations of static and dynamic miRNA-target regulations account for the cooperative miRNA pairs acting on various biological characteristics of miRNA conservation, expression, homology, and stress response. Interestingly, the targets that are co-regulated dynamically by both cooperative miRNAs are more likely to be responsive to stress. Hence, stress-related genes probably bear selective pressures in a certain group of ecotypes, in which miRNA regulations on the stress genes reprogram. Finally, three case studies showed that reprogramming miRNA-miRNA crosstalk toward the targets in specific ecotypes was associated with these ecotypes' climatic variables and geographical locations. Our study highlights the potential of miRNA-miRNA crosstalk as a genetic basis underlying environmental adaptation in natural populations.Copyright © 2022 Wu, Wang, Chen, Liu, Lin, Wang, Liu and Meng."

We studied the proteome of Rett cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to identify consensus Rett proteome and ontologies shared across three species. Rett CSF proteomes enriched proteins annotated to HDL lipoproteins, complement, mitochondria, citrate/pyruvate metabolism, synapse compartments, and the neurosecretory protein VGF. We used shared Rett ontologies to select analytes for orthogonal quantification and functional validation. VGF and ontologically selected CSF proteins had genotypic discriminatory capacity as determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis inMecp2-/yandMecp2-/+.Differentially expressed CSF proteins distinguished Rett from a related neurodevelopmental disorder, CDKL5 deficiency disorder. We propose thatMecp2mutant CSF proteomes and ontologies inform putative mechanisms and biomarkers of disease.

As many body fluids can be collected non-invasively in a one-off and serial fashion, this reservoir can be tapped to develop assays for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of wide-ranging pathologies, such as solid tumors, fetal genetic abnormalities, rejected organ transplants, infections, and potentially many others. The translation of cfDNA research into useful clinical tests is gaining momentum, with recent progress being driven by rapidly evolving preanalytical and analytical procedures, integrated bioinformatics, and machine learning algorithms. Yet, despite these spectacular advances, cfDNA remains a very challenging analyte due to its immense heterogeneity and fluctuation in vivo. It is increasingly recognized that high-fidelity reconstruction of the information stored in cfDNA, and in turn the development of tests that are fit for clinical roll-out, requires a much deeper understanding of both the physico-chemical features of cfDNA and the biological, physiological, lifestyle, and environmental factors that modulate it. This is a daunting task, but with significant upsides. In this review we showed how expanded knowledge on cfDNA biology and faithful reverse-engineering of cfDNA samples promises to (i) augment the sensitivity and specificity of existing cfDNA assays; (ii) expand the repertoire of disease-specific cfDNA markers, thereby leading to the development of increasingly powerful assays; (iii) reshape personal molecular medicine; and (iv) have an unprecedented impact on genetics research."

Still, the cellular origin of PanNETs is uncertain and the associated mechanisms remain largely unknown. DAXX/ATRX and MEN1 are the three most frequently altered genes that drive PanNETs. They are recognized as a link between genetics and epigenetics. Moreover, the acknowledged impact on DNA methylation by somatic mutations in MEN1 is a valid hallmark of epigenetic mechanism. DAXX/ATRX and MEN1 can be studied at the immunohistochemical level as a reliable surrogate for sequencing. DAXX/ATRX mutations promote alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) activation, determined by specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. ALT phenotype is considered a significant predictor of worse prognosis and a marker of pancreatic origin. Additionally, ARX/PDX1 expression is linked to important epigenomic alterations and can be used as lineage associated immunohistochemical marker. Herein, ARX/PDX1 association with DAXX/ATRX/MEN1 and ALT can be studied through pathological assessment, as these biomarkers may provide important clues to the mechanism underlying disease pathogenesis.

However, the etiology behind PCOS remains incomplete. Available evidence suggests a potential genetic correlation between PCOS and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The publicly available data may provide an opportunity to enhance the understanding of the PCOS etiology. Here, we quantified the polygenic overlap between PCOS and T2D using summary statistics of PCOS and T2D and then identified the novel genetic variants associated with PCOS behind this phenotypic association. A bivariate causal mixture model (MiXeR model) found a moderate genetic overlap between PCOS and T2D (Dice coefficient = 44.1% and after adjusting for body mass index, 32.1%). The conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate method identified 11 potential risk variants of PCOS conditional on associations with T2D, 9 of which were novel and 6 of which were jointly associated with two phenotypes. The functional annotation of these genetic variants supports a significant role for genes involved in lipid metabolism, immune response, and the insulin signaling pathway. An expression quantitative trait locus functionality analysis successfully repeated that 5 loci were significantly associated with the expression of candidate genes in many tissues, including the whole blood, subcutaneous adipose, adrenal gland, and cerebellum. We found thatSCN2Agene is co-localized with PCOS in subcutaneous adipose using GWAS-eQTL co-localization analyses. A total of 11 candidate genes were differentially expressed in multiple tissues of the PCOS samples.

Although this process is largely controlled at the transcriptional level, whether the main transcription factors involved have all been identified has remained elusive. Here, we report multi-omics analyses unraveling Basonuclin 2 (BNC2) as a myofibroblast identity transcription factor. Using liver fibrosis as a model for in-depth investigations, we first show that BNC2 expression is induced in both mouse and human fibrotic livers from different etiologies and decreases upon human liver fibrosis regression. Importantly, we found that BNC2 transcriptional induction is a specific feature of myofibroblastic activation in fibrotic tissues. Mechanistically, BNC2 expression and activities allow to integrate pro-fibrotic stimuli, including TGFβ and Hippo/YAP1 signaling, towards induction of matrisome genes such as those encoding type I collagen. As a consequence, Bnc2 deficiency blunts collagen deposition in livers of mice fed a fibrogenic diet. Additionally, our work establishes BNC2 as potentially druggable since we identified the thalidomide derivative CC-885 as a BNC2 inhibitor. Altogether, we propose that BNC2 is a transcription factor involved in canonical pathways driving myofibroblastic activation in fibrosis.© 2022. The Author(s)."

As common risk variants often fall within large haplotype blocks covering long stretches of the noncoding genome, the causal variants within an associated locus are often unknown. Similarly, the effect of rare noncoding risk variants identified by whole genome sequencing on molecular traits is seldom known without functional assays. A massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) is an assay that can functionally validate thousands of regulatory elements simultaneously using high-throughput sequencing and barcode technology. MPRA has been adapted to various experimental designs that measure gene regulatory effects of genetic variants within cis- and trans-regulatory elements as well as posttranscriptional processes. This review discusses different MPRA designs that have been or could be used in the future to experimentally validate genetic variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Though MPRA has limitations such as it does not model genomic context, this assay can help narrow down the underlying genetic causes of neurodevelopmental disorders by screening thousands of sequences in one experiment. We conclude by describing future directions of this technique such as applications of MPRA for gene-by-environment interactions and pharmacogenetics.© 2022. The Author(s)."

There exists a gap to investigate whether and how the spatial modularity of the chromatin is related to the functional modularity resulting from chromatin activity. Despite histone modifications reflecting chromatin activity, inferring spatial modularity of the genome directly from the histone modification patterns has not been well explored. Here, we report that histone modifications show a modular pattern (referred to as regulation associated modules, RAMs) that reflects spatial chromatin modularity. Enhancer-promoter interactions, loop anchors, super-enhancer clusters and extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs) are found to occur more often within the same RAMs than within the same TADs. Consistently, compared to the TAD boundaries, deletions of RAM boundaries perturb the chromatin structure more severely (may even cause cell death) and somatic variants in cancer samples are more enriched in RAM boundaries. These observations suggest that RAMs reflect a modular organization of the 3D genome at a scale better aligned with chromatin activity, providing a bridge connecting the structural and functional modularity of the genome.© 2022.

This massive multiplexing of CRISPR is enabled by means of multi-target guide RNAs (mgRNAs), degenerate guide RNAs that direct Cas9 to a pre-determined number of well-mapped sites. mgRNAs uncovered generalizable insights into Cas9 binding and cleavage, revealing rapid post-cleavage Cas9 departure and repair factor loading at protospacer adjacent motif-proximal genomic DNA. Moreover, by bypassing confounding effects from guide RNA sequence, mgRNAs unveiled that Cas9 binding is enhanced at chromatin-accessible regions, and cleavage by bound Cas9 is more efficient near transcribed regions. Combined with light-mediated activation and deactivation of Cas9 activity, mgRNAs further enabled high-throughput study of the cellular response to double-strand breaks with high temporal resolution, revealing the presence, extent (under 2 kb) and kinetics (~1 h) of reversible DNA damage-induced chromatin decompaction. Altogether, this work establishes mgRNAs as a generalizable platform for multiplexing CRISPR and advances our understanding of intracellular Cas9 activity and the DNA damage response at endogenous loci.© 2022.

An additional barcode incorporated during reverse transcription enables simultaneous transcriptome measurement in a facile and affordable protocol. We demonstrate that barcoded self-reporting transposons recoverin vitrobinding sites for four basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors with important roles in cell fate specification: ASCL1, MYOD1, NEUROD2 and NGN1. Further, simultaneous calling cards and transcriptional profiling during transcription factor overexpression identified both binding sites and gene expression changes for two of these factors. Lastly, we demonstrated barcoded calling cards can record bindingin vivoin the mouse brain.

Advanced sequencing- and imaging-based technologies, together with powerful computational methods, enabling comprehensive characterization of regulatory DNA interactions, have substantially improved our understanding of the three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture.

In this review, we discuss the most recent evidence for IgE in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps(CRSwNP), including the local IgE's characteristics, the modulation of its synthesis, and its function. The levels of local IgE are significantly elevated in polyps independently of IgE serum levels and atopic status. Local IgE, which is correlated with type 2 inflammation, is polyclonal and functional. IgE is produced by active B cells and is dependent on the class switch recombination(CSR). In NPs, this process is triggered by not only allergens but also microbial colonization, especially the superantigen-Staphylococcus aureus. The production of local IgE is modulated by lymphocytes(such as Tfh, ILC2s, iTreg), cytokines(such as IL-4, IL-13, IFN-γ, TGF-β, IL-2, IL-21), transcription factors, and B cell-intrinsic factor. Due to the central role of IgE in NPs, it is regarded as an ideal target for therapy and has been proved to be clinically successful. Based on this knowledge, we believe that exploring the trigger and regulatory factors for the activation of local B cells and CSR to IgE will provide more valuable information for us to recognize the pathological mechanisms of local IgE and offer the possible option for new therapeutic targets of nasal polyps.Copyright © 2022 Shen, Zhang, Yang, Hong and Bachert."

Novel and minimally invasive biomarkers for the risk evaluation of CHD are urgently needed. Previous study has revealed that blood-based hypomethylation of β-actin (ACTB) was associated with increased risk of stroke, but not reported in CHD yet.We aimed to explore the association between blood-basedACTBmethylation and the risk of CHD in a case-control study in the Chinese population.The methylation level ofACTBwas quantitatively determined by mass spectrometry in 281 CHD patients and 272 controls. The association betweenACTBmethylation and CHD risk was estimated by logistic regression analyses adjusted for possible confounding effects.We found a significant association between hypermethylation ofACTBin peripheral blood and increased risk of CHD (odds ratios (ORs) per +10% methylation: 1.19-1.45,p< 0.013 for nine out of thirteen CpG sites), especially in male subjects and heart failure (HF) patients (ORs per +10% methylation: 1.20-1.43, 1.38-1.46;p< 0.030, 1.52 × 10-4, respectively). Hypermethylation of ACTB_CpG_2.3, ACTB_CpG_7.8, and ACTB_CpG_9.10 was observed in the CHD patients with minor to medium cardiac function impairment (NYHA I&II CHD cases) (ORs per +10% methylation: 1.38-1.44;p< 0.001). The combination of ACTB_CpG_2.3, ACTB_CpG_7.8, and ACTB_CpG_9.10 methylation levels could efficiently discriminate CHD cases, male CHD patients, HF and NYHA I&II CHD patients from controls (area under curve (AUC) = 0.75, 0.74, 0.73, and 0.77, respectively).Our study reveals a strong association between blood-basedACTBhypermethylation and CHD risk. The combination ofACTBmethylation and conventional risk factors might provide a novel strategy to improve risk assessment of CHD.Copyright © 2022 Jin, Zhu, Wang, Zhao and Yang."
"36119517","Expression and prognosis analysis of PAQR5 in kidney cancer.","Front Oncol","Progestin and adipoQ receptor 5 (PAQR5) affects the development of various malignancies and is specifically expressed in kidney. However, the role of PAQR5 in renal carcinoma remains unclear. We assessed the state of PAQR5 expression in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) by The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Moreover, immunohistochemistry was performed to observe the expressions of PAQR5 protein in tumor tissues. The relationships between PAQR5 expression and clinical characteristics were investigated by UALCAN. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and Kaplan-Meier plotter were used to analyze the effect of PAQR5 expression levels on overall survival and relapse-free survival (RFS). The re lationships between clinical characteristics and survival were also evaluated by univariate and multifactorial Cox regression. Gene Ontology term analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis were performed on PAQR5 to explain the enrichment pathways and functions. Protein and protein interactions were explained by GeneMANIA and STRING. We also explored the relevance of PAQR5 to tumor immune cell infiltration and immunomodulatory molecules by TIMER and GEPIA. Finally, we explored the correlation of PAQR5 with the pathway proteins STATs, HIF-1α, and mTOR using the GSE40435 dataset. PAQR5 expression was low in KIRC and correlated significantly with clinical characteristics including cancer stage, tumor grade, and nodal metastasis status. Low PAQR5 expression was significantly associated with poorer survival. Cox regression analysis indicated that upregulation of PAQR5 was an independent factor for a good prognosis of KIRC. PAQR5 downregulation was associated mainly with STAT3 target upregulation, tumorigenesis, and poor differentiation. PAQR5 expression also correlated positively with B cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells and negatively with the infiltration of FOXP3+Treg cells and the immune checkpoint molecules PD-1, CTLA4, and LAG3. Moreover, PAQR5 expression in KIRC was negatively correlated with the pathway proteins STAT1/2/3/4/5A, HIF-1α, and mTOR. PAQR5 is an excellent predictor of KIRC prognosis and may be a potential molecular therapeutic target.Copyright © 2022 Lu, Xu, Dong and Dong."

Despite the identification of a large number of aberrant mutations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), attempts to create effective therapeutic agents based on identified genetic or epigenetic variations have not been succesful. The role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in tumor progression is currently a popular topic. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) are the main components of the tumor stroma and play an important role in the proliferation, invasiveness and metastasis of cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying the effect of CAFs and ECM on cancer progression are still unclear. Recent studies on stromal components and blockage of signaling pathways have brought some optimism to this area. New information on the role of TME will lead to the development of targeted therapies or combinations with modern chemotherapy for PDAC.© 2022.

"36051601","Genetic variables of the glutamatergic system associated with treatment-resistant depression: A review of the literature.","World J Psychiatry","Depression is a common, recurrent mental disorder and one of the leading causes of disability and global burden of disease worldwide. Up to 15%-40% of cases do not respond to diverse pharmacological treatments and, thus, can be defined as treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The development of biomarkers predictive of drug response could guide us towards personalized and earlier treatment. Growing evidence points to the involvement of the glutamatergic system in the pathogenesis of TRD. Specifically, the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), which are targeted by ketamine and esketamine, are proposed as promising pathways. A literature search was performed to identify studies on the genetics of the glutamatergic system in depression, focused on variables related to NMDARs and AMPARs. Our review highlightsGRIN2B, which encodes the NR2B subunit of NMDAR, as a candidate gene in the pathogenesis of TRD. In addition, several studies have associated genes encoding AMPAR subunits with symptomatic severity and suicidal ideation. These genes encoding glutamatergic receptors could, therefore, be candidate genes for understanding the etiopathogenesis of TRD, as well as for understanding the pharmacodynamic mechanisms and response to ketamine and esketamine treatment.©The Author(s) 2022.

"36100161","Differences in integration frequencies and APOBEC3 profiles of five high-risk HPV types adheres to phylogeny.","Tumour Virus Res","Persistent infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for almost all cases of cervical cancers, and HPV16 and HPV18 associated with the majority of these. These types differ in the proportion of viral minor nucleotide variants (MNVs) caused by APOBEC3 mutagenesis as well as integration frequencies. Whether these traits extend to other types remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate and compare genomic variability and chromosomal integration in the two phylogenetically distinct Alpha-7 and Alpha-9 clades of carcinogenic HPV types. The TaME-seq protocol was employed to sequence cervical cell samples positive for HPV31, HPV33 or HPV45 and combine these with data from a previous study on HPV16 and HPV18. APOBEC3 mutation signatures were found in Alpha-9 (HPV16/31/33) but not in Alpha-7 (HPV18/45). HPV45 had significantly more MNVs compared to the other types. Alpha-7 had higher integration frequency compared to Alpha-9. An increase in integration frequency with increased diagnostic severity was found for Alpha-7. The results highlight important differences and broaden our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind cervical cancer induced by high-risk HPV types from the Alpha-7 and Alpha-9 clades.Copyright © 2022.

Part I: Targeting Immunosenescence of Innate Immunity Cells.","Int J Mol Sci","Vaccination, being able to prevent millions of cases of infectious diseases around the world every year, is the most effective medical intervention ever introduced. However, immunosenescence makes vaccines less effective in providing protection to older people. Although most studies explain that this is mainly due to the immunosenescence of T and B cells, the immunosenescence of innate immunity can also be a significant contributing factor. Alterations in function, number, subset, and distribution of blood neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer and dendritic cells are detected in aging, thus potentially reducing the efficacy of vaccines in older individuals. In this paper, we focus on the immunosenescence of the innate blood immune cells. We discuss possible strategies to counteract the immunosenescence of innate immunity in order to improve the response to vaccination. In particular, we focus on advances in understanding the role and the development of new adjuvants, such as TLR agonists, considered a promising strategy to increase vaccination efficiency in older individuals."
"36076918","Advances of Epigenetic Biomarkers and Epigenome Editing for Early Diagnosis in Breast Cancer.","Int J Mol Sci","Epigenetic modifications are known to regulate cell phenotype during cancer progression, including breast cancer. Unlike genetic alterations, changes in the epigenome are reversible, thus potentially reversed by epi-drugs. Breast cancer, the most common cause of cancer death worldwide in women, encompasses multiple histopathological and molecular subtypes. Several lines of evidence demonstrated distortion of the epigenetic landscape in breast cancer. Interestingly, mammary cells isolated from breast cancer patients and cultured ex vivo maintained the tumorigenic phenotype and exhibited aberrant epigenetic modifications. Recent studies indicated that the therapeutic efficiency for breast cancer regimens has increased over time, resulting in reduced mortality. Future medical treatment for breast cancer patients, however, will likely depend upon a better understanding of epigenetic modifications. The present review aims to outline different epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and ncRNAs with their impact on breast cancer, as well as to discuss studies highlighting the central role of epigenetic mechanisms in breast cancer pathogenesis. We propose new research areas that may facilitate locus-specific epigenome editing as breast cancer therapeutics."

However, previous studies mostly relied on FI measurement at a single point of time. We aimed to investigate the association of frailty with mortality according to longitudinal repeated measurements of FI in a large population-based cohort study in Germany.Among 9912 men and women aged 50-75 years living in Saarland, Germany and recruited in the ESTHER study in 2000-2002, a FI based on 30 deficits was determined at baseline, 2-, 5-, 8-, and 11-year follow-up. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated to assess the associations of FI with all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality during 14 years of follow-up using Cox proportional hazards models that included FI as a time-varying covariate.During the 14-year follow-up, a total of 2483 deaths were observed, of which 859 and 863 were due to cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), respectively. The time-varying FI showed consistently strong associations with mortality throughout 14 years of follow-up, with HRs (95% confidence intervals) for frail (FI≥ 0·35) versus non-frail (FI≤ 0·11) participants of 4·72 (4.05-5.51), 2·55 (1·95-3·34) and 7·52 (5·69-9·94) for all-cause, cancer, and CVD mortality, respectively. Gradually decreasing associations with increasing length of follow-up would have been obtained by using baseline FI only.Longitudinal repeated measures of FI show strong, consistent associations with mortality, especially CVD mortality, throughout extended periods of follow-up among community-dwelling older adults.The ESTHER study was funded by grants from the Baden-Württemberg state Ministry of Science, Research and Arts (Stuttgart, Germany), the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Berlin, Germany), the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (Berlin, Germany), and the Saarland State Ministry of Health, Social Affairs, Women and the Family (Saarbrücken, Germany).© 2022 The Authors."

In order to evaluate and reduce possible pathological reactions triggered by space environments, we conducted bioinformatics analyses on the methylation data of the Mars 520 mission and human transcriptome data in the experiment simulating gravity changes. The results suggest that gene expression levels and DNA methylation levels were changed under the conditions of isolation and gravity changes, and multiple viral infection-related pathways were found in the enrichment analysis results of changed genes including Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KHSV) infection. In this study, we found that Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and vitamin D are helpful in reducing viral infection risk. In addition, the causal associations between nutrients and viral infections were calculated using Two sample Mendelian Randomization (2SMR) method, the results indicated that vitamin D can reduce EBV infection and HBV infection risk. In summary, our study suggests that space environments increase the risk of human viral infection, which may be reduced by supplementing EGCG and vitamin D. These results can be used to formulate medical plans for astronauts, which have practical application value for future space exploration."
"36059478","Immunosenescence in atherosclerosis: A role for chronic viral infections.","Front Immunol","Immune system is a versatile and dynamic body organ which offers survival and endurance of human beings in their hostile living environment. However, similar to other cells, immune cells are hijacked by senescence. The ageing immune cells lose their beneficial functions but continue to produce inflammatory mediators which draw other immune and non-immune cells to the senescence loop. Immunosenescence has been shown to be associated with different pathological conditions and diseases, among which atherosclerosis has recently come to light. There are common drivers of both immunosenescence and atherosclerosis; e.g. inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), chronic viral infections, genomic damage, oxidized-LDL, hypertension, cigarette smoke, hyperglycaemia, and mitochondrial failure. Chronic viral infections induce inflammaging, sustained cytokine signaling, ROS generation and DNA damage which are associated with atherogenesis. Accumulating evidence shows that several DNA and RNA viruses are stimulators of immunosenescence and atherosclerosis in an interrelated network. DNA viruses such as CMV, EBV and HBV upregulate p16, p21 and p53 senescence-associated molecules; induce inflammaging, metabolic reprogramming of infected cells, replicative senescence and telomere shortening. RNA viruses such as HCV and HIV induce ROS generation, DNA damage, induction of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), metabolic reprogramming of infected cells, G1 cell cycle arrest, telomere shortening, as well as epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones. The newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus is also a potent inducer of cytokine storm and SASP. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 promotes senescence phenotype in endothelial cells by augmenting p16, p21, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) and adhesion molecules expression. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 mega-inflammation on atherogenesis, however, remains to be investigated. In this review we focus on the common processes in immunosenescence and atherogenesis caused by chronic viral infections and discuss the current knowledge on this topic.Copyright © 2022 Ghamar Talepoor and Doroudchi."

"36092375","Biological ageing with HIV infection: evaluating the geroscience hypothesis.","Lancet Healthy Longev","Although people with HIV are living longer, as they age they remain disproportionately burdened with multimorbidity that is exacerbated in resource-poor settings. The geroscience hypothesis postulates that a discrete set of between five and ten hallmarks of biological ageing drive multimorbidity, but these processes have not been systematically examined in the context of people with HIV. We examine four major hallmarks of ageing (macromolecular damage, senescence, inflammation, and stem-cell dysfunction) as gerodrivers in the context of people with HIV. As a counterbalance, we introduce healthy ageing, physiological reserve, intrinsic capacity, and resilience as promoters of geroprotection that counteract gerodrivers. We discuss emerging geroscience-based diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies, and provide examples based on recent advances in cellular senescence, and other, non-pharmacological approaches. Finally, we present a conceptual model of biological ageing in the general population and in people with HIV that integrates gerodrivers and geroprotectors as modulators of homoeostatic reserves and organ function over the lifecourse."

This multicenter, cross-sectional study recruited hospitalized children with UC. Methylation ofRUNX3 P2was measured with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes in the whole blood DNA. Sixty-four children were enrolled, with a mean age of 14.5 ± 2.8 years. Half of them were female (51.6%), and the average BMI Z-score was -0.44 ± 1.14. The mean methylation ofRUNX3 P2was 54.1 ± 13.3%. The methylation level ofRUNX3 P2did not correlate with age, sex, nutritional status, CRP, albumin, PUCAI, or the extent of colitis (Paris E1-E4).RUNX3 P2methylation did not differ between patients recruited within two and a half months of diagnosis and children who had UC for at least a year. Current or past exposure to biologics, immunosuppressants, or steroids was not associated withRUNX3 P2methylation.

Untargeted metabolomics analysis to assess circulating metabolites offers the potential to characterize biochemical pathways by which early life exposures influence the development of cardiometabolic risk during childhood and adolescence, prior to becoming evident in clinical markers.Among mother-child dyads from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to ENvironmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) birth cohort, we measured 9 phthalate metabolites and bisphenol A in maternal spot urine samples obtained during each trimester of pregnancy, corrected for urinary specific gravity and natural log-transformed. In 110 boys and 124 girls aged 8-14 years, we used a mass-spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics platform to measure fasting serum metabolites, yielding 572 annotated metabolites. We estimated the associations between trimester-specific urinary toxicants and each serum metabolite, among all children or stratified by sex and adjusting for child age, BMI z-score, and pubertal onset. We accounted for multiple comparisons using a 10% false discovery rate (q<0.1).Associations between exposures and metabolites were observed among all children and in sex-stratified analyses (q<0.1). First trimester MEP, MiBP, and MCPP were associated with decreased 2-deoxy-D-glucose among all children. Among girls, third trimester concentrations of MECPP, MEHHP, MEHP, and MCPP were associated with 15, 13, 1, and 10 metabolites, respectively, including decreased choline and increased acylcarnitines and saturated FAs (FA). Among boys, third trimester MIBP was positively associated with 9 features including long chain saturated FAs, and second trimester MBzP was inversely associated with thyroxine.Metabolomics biomarkers may reflect sex- and exposure timing-specific responses to prenatal phthalate exposures manifesting in childhood that may not be detected using standard clinical markers of cardiometabolic risk."
"36082605","Aging is associated with increased chromatin accessibility and reduced polymerase pausing in liver.","Mol Syst Biol","Regulation of gene expression is linked to the organization of the genome. With age, chromatin alterations occur on all levels of genome organization, accompanied by changes in the gene expression profile. However, little is known about the changes in the level of transcriptional regulation. Here, we used a multi-omics approach and integrated ATAC-, RNA- and NET-seq to identify age-related changes in the chromatin landscape of murine liver and to investigate how these are linked to transcriptional regulation. We provide the first systematic inventory of the connection between aging, chromatin accessibility, and transcriptional regulation in a whole tissue. Aging in murine liver is characterized by an increase in chromatin accessibility at promoter regions, but not in an increase in transcriptional output. Instead, aging is accompanied by a decrease in promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), while initiation of transcription is not decreased as assessed by RNA polymerase mapping using CUT&RUN. Based on the data reported, we propose that these age-related changes in transcriptional regulation are due to a reduced stability of the pausing complex.© 2022 The Authors.

Melatonin-mediated biological effects include the regulation of circadian rhythms, which is important for optimal human health. Also, melatonin has a broad range of immunoenhancing actions. Moreover, its oncostatic properties, especially regarding breast cancer, involve a variety cancer-inhibitory processes and are well documented. Due to their promising effects on the prognosis of cancer patients, anti-cancer drugs with epigenetic actions have attracted a significant amount of attention in recent years. Epigenetic modifications of cancers are categorized into three major processes including non-coding RNAs, histone modification, and DNA methylation. Hence, the modification of the latter epigenetic event is currently considered an effective strategy for treatment of cancer patients. Thereby, this report summarizes the available evidence that investigated melatonin-induced effects in altering the status of DNA methylation in different cancer cells and models, e.g., malignant glioma and breast carcinoma.

"36143337","The Role of 4-Phenylbutyric Acid in Gut Microbial Dysbiosis in a Mouse Model of Simulated Microgravity.","Life (Basel)","The altered gut microbes of astronauts during space travel may contribute to health issues after their return to Earth. Previously, an association between the elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and gut microbial dysbiosis has been described. Herein, we induced gut microbial changes in mice under a simulated microgravity environment in an established model of hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. The intestinal metabolomic profiles under microgravity conditions using the HU model were examined, along with the potential role of 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), a potent ER stress inhibitor. For a microgravity environment, the mice were suspended in special cages individually for three weeks. Mice were sacrificed, and gut dissections were performed, followed by amplicon sequencing analysis of bacterial species via DNA extraction and 16S rRNA analysis. The results indicate that the gut bacterial communities of mice differed under gravity and microgravity conditions. Principal component analyses revealed differences in the bacterial community structure in all groups. Around 434 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were specific to mice seen in controls, while 620 OTUs were specific to HU mice. Additionally, 321 bacterial OTUs were specific to HU mice treated with 4-PBA. When the relative abundance of taxa was analyzed, Bacteroidetes dominated the gut of control and HU mice treated with 4-PBA.. In contrast, the untreated HU mice were dominated by Firmicutes. At the genus level, a reduction in beneficial species ofAkkermansiaandLactobacilluswas observed in HU but not the unloaded-treated and control mice. Furthermore, an increase in the relative abundance ofLachnospiraceaeandEnterorhabdus, associated with inflammation, was observed in HUmice but not in controls and unloaded-treated mice. Following treatment with 4-PBA, the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes was restored in unloaded-treated mice, comparable to controls. Of note, beneficial microbes such asAkkermansiaandLactobacilluswere observed in unloaded-treated mice but not or in lesser relative abundance in HU mice. Nonetheless, microbial diversity was reduced in unloaded-treated mice compared to controls, and future studies are needed to mitigate this finding. These may comprise the addition of pre-/pro- and postbiotic species in the diet to increase microbial diversity. Overall, the findings suggest that 4-PBA, a potent ER stress inhibitor, may have therapeutic value in treating patients on prolonged bed rest or astronauts during spaceflight."

Microgravity resulted in a significant 21% increase in flow stasis index, a 22-23% decrease in WSS magnitude and a 16-26% increase in relative residence time in all bifurcation branches, while preserving WSS unidirectionality. In two anatomies, however, microgravity not only promoted flow stasis but also subjected the convex region of the external carotid arterial wall to a moderate increase in WSS bidirectionality, which contrasted with the population average trend. This study suggests that long-term exposure to microgravity has the potential to subject the vasculature to atheroprone hemodynamics and this effect is modulated by subject-specific anatomical features. The exploration of the biological impact of those microgravity-induced WSS aberrations is needed to better define the risk posed by long spaceflights on cardiovascular health.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36061033","Comparison of biological measurement and physical estimates of space radiation in the International Space Station.","Heliyon","Nowadays, ordinary people can travel in space, and the possibility of extended durations in an environment such as moon of the Earth and Mars with higher space radiation exposures compared to past missions, is increasing. Until now, the physical doses of space radiation have been measured, but measurement of direct biological effects has been hampered by its low dose and low dose-rate effect. To assess the biological effects of space radiation, we launched and kept frozen mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in minus eighty degree Celsius freezer in ISS (MELFI) on the International Space Station (ISS) for a maximum of 1,584 days. The passive dosimeter for life science experiments in space (PADLES) was attached on the surface of the sample case of the ES cells. The physical dosimeter measured the absorbed dose in water. After return, the frozen cells were thawed and cultured and their chromosome aberrations were analyzed. Comparative experiments with proton and iron ion irradiation were performed at particle accelerators on Earth. Thewild-typeES cells showed no differences in chromosomal aberrations between the ground control and ISS exposures. However, we detected an increase of chromosome aberrations in radio-sensitized histone H2AX heterozygous-deficient mouse ES cells and found that the rate of increase against the absorbed dose was 1.54-fold of proton irradiation at an accelerator. On the other hand, we estimated the quality factor of space radiation as 1.48 ± 0.2. using formulas of International Commission of Radiation Protection (ICRP) 60. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) observed from our experiments (1.54-fold of proton) was almost equal (1.04-fold) to the physical estimation (1.48 ± 0.2). It should be important to clarify the relation between biological effect and physical estimates of space radiation. This comparative study paves a way to reveal the complex radiation environments to reduce the uncertainty for risk assessment of human stay in space.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36142151","Significance of Hypermethylation of Tumor-Suppressor Genes PTGER4 and ZNF43 at CpG Sites in the Prognosis of Colorectal Cancer.","Int J Mol Sci","The status of DNA methylation in primary tumor tissue and adjacent tumor-free tissue is associated with the occurrence of aggressive colorectal cancer (CRC) and can aid personalized cancer treatments at early stages. Tumor tissue and matched adjacent nontumorous tissue were extracted from 208 patients with CRC, and the correlation between the methylation levels ofPTGER4andZNF43at certain CpG loci and the prognostic factors of CRC was determined using the MassARRAY System testing platform. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test, a Chi-square test, and McNemar's test were used for group comparisons, and Kaplan-Meier curves and a log-rank test were used for prediction. The hypermethylation ofPTGER4at the CpG_4, CpG_5, CpG_15, and CpG_17 tumor tissue sites was strongly correlated with shorter recurrence-free survival (RFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) = 3.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.38-7.73 for RFS, HR = 2.35 and 95% CI = 1.17-4.71 for PFS, HR = 4.32 and 95% CI = 1.8-10.5 for OS]. By contrast, RFS and PFS were significantly longer in the case of increased methylation ofZNF43at the CpG_5 site of normal tissue [HR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.07-5.08 for RFS, HR = 2.42 and 95% CI = 1.19-4.91 for PFS]. Aberrant methylation at specific CpG sites indicates tissue with aggressive behavior. Therefore, the differential methylation ofPTGER4andZNF43at specific loci can be employed for the prognosis of patients with CRC."
"36139061","Transcriptome Analyses Identify Deregulated <i>MYC</i> in Early Onset Colorectal Cancer.","Biomolecules","Despite a global decrease in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence, the prevalence of early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), or those occurring in individuals before the age of 50, has steadily increased over the past several decades. When compared to later onset colorectal cancer (LOCRC) in individuals over 50, our understanding of the genetic and molecular underpinnings of EOCRCs is limited. Here, we conducted transcriptomic analyses of patient-matched normal colonic segments and tumors to identify gene expression programs involved in carcinogenesis. Amongst differentially expressed genes, we found increased expression of thec-MYCproto-oncogene (MYC) and its downstream targets in tumor samples. We identified tumors with high and low differentialMYCexpression and found patients with high-MYCtumors were older and overweight or obese. We also detected elevated expression of thePVT1long-non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in most tumors and found gains in copy number for bothMYCandPVT1gene loci in 35% of tumors evaluated. Our transcriptome analyses indicate that EOCRC can be sub-classified into groups based on differentialMYCexpression and suggest that deregulatedMYCcontributes to CRCs that develop in younger patients."

This study aimed to discover the transcriptional signatures of BCL2 family genes that reflect regulatory dynamics, which can guide individualized therapeutic strategies.From three AML RNA-seq cohorts (BeatAML, LeuceGene, and TCGA; n = 451, 437, and 179, respectively), we constructed the BCL2 family signatures (BFSigs) by applying an innovative gene-set selection method reflecting biological knowledge followed by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). To demonstrate the significance of the BFSigs, we conducted modelling to predict response to BCL2 family inhibitors, clustering, and functional enrichment analysis. Cross-platform validity of BFSigs was also confirmed using NanoString technology in a separate cohort of 47 patients.We established BFSigs labeled as the BCL2, MCL1/BCL2, and BFL1/MCL1 signatures that identify key anti-apoptotic proteins. Unsupervised clustering based on BFSig information consistently classified AML patients into three robust subtypes across different AML cohorts, implying the existence of biological entities revealed by the BFSig approach. Interestingly, each subtype has distinct enrichment patterns of major cancer pathways, including MAPK and mTORC1, which propose subtype-specific combination treatment with apoptosis modulating drugs. The BFSig-based classifier also predicted response to venetoclax with remarkable performance (area under the ROC curve, AUROC = 0.874), which was well-validated in an independent cohort (AUROC = 0.950). Lastly, we successfully confirmed the validity of BFSigs using NanoString technology.This study proposes BFSigs as a biomarker for the effective selection of apoptosis targeting treatments and cancer pathways to co-target in AML.© 2022.

"36163326","Graphdiyne oxide nanosheets display selective anti-leukemia efficacy against DNMT3A-mutant AML cells.","Nat Commun","DNA methyltransferase 3 A (DNMT3A) is the most frequently mutated gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although chemotherapy agents have improved outcomes for DNMT3A-mutant AML patients, there is still no targeted therapy highlighting the need for further study of how DNMT3A mutations affect AML phenotype. Here, we demonstrate that cell adhesion-related genes are predominantly enriched in DNMT3A-mutant AML cells and identify that graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) display an anti-leukemia effect specifically against these mutated cells. Mechanistically, GDYO directly interacts with integrin β2 (ITGB2) and c-type mannose receptor (MRC2), which facilitate the attachment and cellular uptake of GDYO. Furthermore, GDYO binds to actin and prevents actin polymerization, thus disrupting the actin cytoskeleton and eventually leading to cell apoptosis. Finally, we validate the in vivo safety and therapeutic potential of GDYO against DNMT3A-mutant AML cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that GDYO is an efficient and specific drug candidate against DNMT3A-mutant AML.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36160043","Experimental reproducibility limits the correlation between mRNA and protein abundances in tumor proteomic profiles.","Cell Rep Methods","Large-scale studies of human proteomes have revealed only a moderate correlation between mRNA and protein abundances. It is unclear to what extent this moderate correlation reflects post-transcriptional regulation and to what extent it reflects measurement error. Here, by analyzing replicate profiles of tumors and cell lines, we show that there is considerable variation in the reproducibility of measurements of transcripts and proteins from individual genes. Proteins with more reproducible measurements tend to have a higher mRNA-protein correlation, suggesting that measurement reproducibility accounts for a substantial fraction of the unexplained variation between mRNA and protein abundances. The reproducibility of individual proteins is somewhat consistent across studies, and we exploit this to develop an aggregate reproducibility score that explains a substantial amount of the variation in mRNA-protein correlations across multiple studies. Finally, we show that pathways previously reported to have a higher-than-average mRNA-protein correlation may simply contain members that can be more reproducibly quantified.© 2022 The Authors."
"36148016","Comprehensive Analysis of the Immune Implication of AKAP12 in Stomach Adenocarcinoma.","Comput Math Methods Med","A kinase anchor protein 12 (AKAP12) as a tumor suppressor in various cancers has been extensively studied and confirmed. However, its immune implication in stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) remains uncertain. Here, using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Human Protein Atlas (HPA), Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), integrated repository portal for tumor-immune system interactions (TISIDB), and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interaction Gene/Proteins (STRING) database, we systematically analyzed the immune correlation of AKAP12 from three aspects including immune infiltration cells, immune-related pathways, and immunomodulators and developed a AKAP12-related 4-gene signature for prognosis prediction. Our results showed that AKAP12 mRNA and protein levels were downregulated in STAD patients, and its expression was positively related to CD4+ T cells and macrophages. In addition, the immune cell infiltration levels were associated with AKAP12 gene copy number deletion in STAD. Based on CCLE database, we found that AKAP12 coexpressed genes were enriched in several immune- and cancer-related pathways, which was further validated by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Moreover, we identified 46 immunomodulators that were significantly related to AKAP12 expression using TISIDB database, and these immunomodulators were involved in immune-related pathways including Th17 cell differentiation and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Additionally, based on the 46 AKAP12-related immunomodulators, a 4-gene risk prediction signature was developed using the Cox regression model. The risk signature was identified as an independent prognostic factor, which can accurately predict the prognosis of patients with STAD, showing good predictive performance. Furthermore, we constructed a prognostic nomogram and calibration to predict and assess patient survival probabilities by integrating the risk score and other clinical factors. In conclusion, our study provides strong evidence that AKAP12 is closely related to tumor immunity in STAD from three aspects: immune infiltration cells, immune pathways, and immunomodulators. More importantly, the AKAP12-related prognostic signature may have a good application prospect for clinical practice.Copyright © 2022 Zhiquan Xu et al."
"36147673","Challenges in genomic analysis of model systems and primary tumors of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. Recent next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genomic studies have provided novel treatment modes for pancreatic cancer via the identification of cancer driver variants and molecular subtypes in PDAC. Genome-wide approaches have been extended to model systems such as patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), organoids, and cell lines for pre-clinical purposes. However, the genomic characteristics vary in the model systems, which is mainly attributed to the clonal evolution of cancer cells during their construction and culture. Moreover, fundamental limitations such as low tumor cellularity and the complex tumor microenvironment of PDAC hinder the confirmation of genomic features in the primary tumor and model systems. The occurrence of these phenomena and their associated complexities may lead to false insights into the understanding of mechanisms and dynamics in tumor tissues of patients. In this review, we describe various model systems and discuss differences in the results based on genomics and transcriptomics between primary tumors and model systems. Finally, we introduce practical strategies to improve the accuracy of genomic analysis of primary tissues and model systems.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36142576","High-Content Drug Discovery Targeting Molecular Bladder Cancer Subtypes.","Int J Mol Sci","Molecular subtypes of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) display differential survival and drug sensitivities in clinical trials. To date, they have not been used as a paradigm for phenotypic drug discovery. This study aimed to discover novel subtype-stratified therapy approaches based on high-content screening (HCS) drug discovery. Transcriptome expression data of CCLE and BLA-40 cell lines were used for molecular subtype assignment in basal, luminal, and mesenchymal-like cell lines. Two independent HCSs, using focused compound libraries, were conducted to identify subtype-specific drug leads. We correlated lead drug sensitivity data with functional genomics, regulon analysis, and in-vitro drug response-based enrichment analysis. The basal MIBC subtype displayed sensitivity to HDAC and CHK inhibitors, while the luminal subtype was sensitive to MDM2 inhibitors. The mesenchymal-like cell lines were exclusively sensitive to the ITGAV inhibitor SB273005. The role of integrins within this mesenchymal-like MIBC subtype was confirmed via its regulon activity and gene essentiality based on CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out data. Patients with high ITGAV expression showed a significant decrease in the median overall survival. Phenotypic high-content drug screens based on bladder cancer cell lines provide rationales for novel stratified therapeutic approaches as a framework for further prospective validation in clinical trials."

In particular, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy could induce durable tumor remissions and improve the prognosis of patients to a certain extent. However, PD-L1, as a promising biomarker, has limited knowledge about its relevance to tumor microenvironment (TME) characterization and endogenous inflammatory immune responses. In this study, we systematically investigated and characterized the important intercommunication of PD-L1 with immunosuppressive TME and inflammatory response activity in HCC and predicted promising therapeutic drugs to improve the current therapeutic strategy for specific patients. We identified aberrant expression patterns of PD-L1 in HCC and completely different clinical and molecular characteristics among the PD-L1 subgroups. PD-L1 positively associated with immunosuppressive macrophages and macrophage-derived cytokines, which may contribute to the polarization of macrophages. Moreover, inflammatory response activity exhibited significant differences between high and low PD-L1 expression groups and had robust positive correlativity of the infiltration level of tumor-associated macrophages. Notably, given the immunosuppressive and inflammatory microenvironment in HCC, we screened four candidate drugs, including dasatinib, vemurafenib, topotecan and AZD6482, and corroborated in two pharmacogenomics databases, which might have potential therapeutic implications in specific HCC patients. Our results enhanced the understanding of linkage in PD-L1 expression patterns with macrophages and inflammation, which may provide new insight into the pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategy for HCC."

One member of this family, MCM3, is reportedly active in most cancers. To systematically elucidate the mechanisms affected by aberrant MCM3 expression and evaluate its clinical significance, we analyzed multi-omics data from the GEO database and validated them in cell lines and tumor samples. First, we showed the upregulation of MCM3 in medulloblastoma (MB) at bulk and single-cell RNA sequence levels and revealed the potential role of MCM3viaDNA replication. Then we found the dysregulation of MCM3 might result from abnormal methylation of MCM3. Moreover, we discovered that MCM3 might affect varied biological processes such as apoptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis and that MCM3 was correlated with immune components such as fibroblast and neutrophils, which were associated with overall survival in different medulloblastoma subtypes. Furthermore, we found that MCM3 expression was correlated with the IC50values of cisplatin and etoposide. The nomogram of MCM3-related genes showed the reliable and better prediction of 1- and 5-year survival compared to current histological and molecular classifications. Overall, the results of our study demonstrated that MCM3 might serve as a potential biomarker with clinical significance and better guidance than current histological and molecular classifications for clinical decision-making.Copyright © 2022 Cao, Zhao, Liang, Yang, Wang, Tian, Wang, Wang, Zhao, Jiang and Ma."
"36131208","Metabolic collateral lethal target identification reveals MTHFD2 paralogue dependency in ovarian cancer.","Nat Metab","Recurrent loss-of-function deletions cause frequent inactivation of tumour suppressor genes but often also involve the collateral deletion of essential genes in chromosomal proximity, engendering dependence on paralogues that maintain similar function. Although these paralogues are attractive anticancer targets, no methodology exists to uncover such collateral lethal genes. Here we report a framework for collateral lethal gene identification via metabolic fluxes, CLIM, and use it to reveal MTHFD2 as a collateral lethal gene in UQCR11-deleted ovarian tumours. We show that MTHFD2 has a non-canonical oxidative function to provide mitochondrial NAD+, and demonstrate the regulation of systemic metabolic activity by the paralogue metabolic pathway maintaining metabolic flux compensation. This UQCR11-MTHFD2 collateral lethality is confirmed in vivo, with MTHFD2 inhibition leading to complete remission of UQCR11-deleted ovarian tumours. Using CLIM's machine learning and genome-scale metabolic flux analysis, we elucidate the broad efficacy of targeting MTHFD2 despite distinct cancer genetic profiles co-occurring with UQCR11 deletion and irrespective of stromal compositions of tumours.© 2022.

"36124662","The high mobility group protein HMG20A cooperates with the histone reader PHF14 to modulate TGFβ and Hippo pathways.","Nucleic Acids Res","High mobility group (HMG) proteins are chromatin regulators with essential functions in development, cell differentiation and cell proliferation. The protein HMG20A is predicted by the AlphaFold2 software to contain three distinct structural elements, which we have functionally characterized: i) an amino-terminal, intrinsically disordered domain with transactivation activity; ii) an HMG box with higher binding affinity for double-stranded, four-way-junction DNA than for linear DNA; and iii) a long coiled-coil domain. Our proteomic study followed by a deletion analysis and structural modeling demonstrates that HMG20A forms a complex with the histone reader PHF14, via the establishment of a two-stranded alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. siRNA-mediated knockdown of either PHF14 or HMG20A in MDA-MB-231 cells causes similar defects in cell migration, invasion and homotypic cell-cell adhesion ability, but neither affects proliferation. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrate that PHF14 and HMG20A share a large subset of targets. We show that the PHF14-HMG20A complex modulates the Hippo pathway through a direct interaction with the TEAD1 transcription factor. PHF14 or HMG20A deficiency increases epithelial markers, including E-cadherin and the epithelial master regulator TP63 and impaired normal TGFβ-trigged epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Taken together, these data indicate that PHF14 and HMG20A cooperate in regulating several pathways involved in epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity.© The Author(s) 2022.

However, in glioma microenvironment, the role of necroptosis-related lncRNAs (NRLs) remains unknown.In this study, the RNA-seq and clinical annotation of glioma patients were analyzed using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. To investigate prognosis and tumor microenvironment of NRLs in gliomas, we conducted a prediction model based on the training cohort. The accuracy of the model was verified in the verification cohort.A signature composed of 13 NRLs was identified, and all glioma patients were divided into two groups. We found that each group has unique survival outcomes, biological behaviors, and immune infiltrating status. The necroptosis-related lncRNA signature (NRLS) model was found to be an independent risk factor in multivariate Cox analysis. Immunosuppressive microenvironment was positively correlated with the high-risk group. Due to significantly different IC50 between risk groups, NRLS could be used as a guide for chemotherapeutic treatment. Further, the entire cohort was divided into two clusters depending on NRLs. Consensus clustering method and the risk scoring system were basically similar. Survival probability was higher in Cluster 2, while Cluster 1 has stronger immunologic infiltration.The predictive signature could be a prognostic factor independently and serve to detect the role of NRLs in glioma immunotherapy response.Copyright © 2022 Guanghao Zhang et al."
"36109798","A novel molecular signature identifies mixed subtypes in renal cell carcinoma with poor prognosis and independent response to immunotherapy.","Genome Med","Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogeneous disease comprising histologically defined subtypes. For therapy selection, precise subtype identification and individualized prognosis are mandatory, but currently limited. Our aim was to refine subtyping and outcome prediction across main subtypes, assuming that a tumor is composed of molecular features present in distinct pathological subtypes.Individual RCC samples were modeled as linear combination of the main subtypes (clear cell (ccRCC), papillary (pRCC), chromophobe (chRCC)) using computational gene expression deconvolution. The new molecular subtyping was compared with histological classification of RCC using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n = 864; ccRCC: 512; pRCC: 287; chRCC: 65) as well as 92 independent histopathologically well-characterized RCC. Predicted continuous subtypes were correlated to cancer-specific survival (CSS) in the TCGA cohort and validated in 242 independent RCC. Association with treatment-related progression-free survival (PFS) was studied in the JAVELIN Renal 101 (n = 726) and IMmotion151 trials (n = 823). CSS and PFS were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis.One hundred seventy-four signature genes enabled reference-free molecular classification of individual RCC. We unambiguously assign tumors to either ccRCC, pRCC, or chRCC and uncover molecularly heterogeneous tumors (e.g., with ccRCC and pRCC features), which are at risk of worse outcome. Assigned proportions of molecular subtype-features significantly correlated with CSS (ccRCC (P = 4.1E - 10), pRCC (P = 6.5E - 10), chRCC (P = 8.6E - 06)) in TCGA. Translation into a numerical RCC-R(isk) score enabled prognosis in TCGA (P = 9.5E - 11). Survival modeling based on the RCC-R score compared to pathological categories was significantly improved (P = 3.6E - 11). The RCC-R score was validated in univariate (P = 3.2E - 05; HR = 3.02, 95% CI: 1.8-5.08) and multivariate analyses including clinicopathological factors (P = 0.018; HR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.14-4.04). Heterogeneous PD-L1-positive RCC determined by molecular subtyping showed increased PFS with checkpoint inhibition versus sunitinib in the JAVELIN Renal 101 (P = 3.3E - 04; HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.36 - 0.75) and IMmotion151 trials (P = 0.047; HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.48 - 1). The prediction of PFS significantly benefits from classification into heterogeneous and unambiguous subtypes in both cohorts (P = 0.013 and P = 0.032).Switching from categorical to continuous subtype classification across most frequent RCC subtypes enables outcome prediction and fosters personalized treatment strategies.© 2022.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as RNA molecules of around 200 nucleotides or more, which are not translated into proteins. As well-known regulatory factors, lncRNAs are considered as biomarkers for prognosis and treatment response in GC. It is of importance to identify FGF/FGFR-related lncRNAs in GC. Here, some FGF/FGFR-related lncRNAs were identified in GC based on the data from public databases, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Then a four-lncRNAs (FGF10-AS1,MIR2052HG,POU6F2-AS2, andDIRC1) risk score (RS) model was established for predicting GC's prognosis by using Cox analysis. According to the median value of RS, GC patients were divided into low and high RS group. Low RS group displayed high tumor mutation burden and infiltration of immune cells, as well as more sensitivity to immunotherapy or chemotherapy. High RS group showed high infiltration of stromal cells and more oncogenic signatures. In addition, a comprehensive analysis was carried out and found that high RS group may exhibit specific sensitivity to Panobinostat (histone deacetylases inhibitor) and Tivantinib (MET inhibitor). In summary, our study not only offers a novel personalized prognostication classification model according to FGF/FGFR-related lncRNAs, but also provides a new strategy for subclass-specific precision treatment in GC.Copyright © 2022 Chen and Du."

PS is genetically characterized by genetic instability and diversity and histologically characterized by morphological pleomorphism. PS is one of the most common soft tissue sarcomas. The only curative treatment for PS is complete surgical resection, in which neoadjuvant radiotherapy is frequently combined. PS demonstrates both local recurrence and metastasis after surgical treatment, and effective systemic chemotherapy has not yet been established. Patient-derived cancer cell lines are critical tools for basic and preclinical studies in the development of chemotherapy. However, only six PS cell lines are available from the public cell bank, and none of them are derived from PS after neoadjuvant radiotherapy, despite the fact that radiotherapy causes changes in the posttreatment cancer genome. Here, we reported a novel cell line of PS from a primary tumor specimen resected after neoadjuvant radiotherapy and named it NCC-PS1-C1. NCC-PS1-C1 cells showed a variety of copy number alterations and pathological mutations in TP53. NCC-PS1-C1 cells demonstrated constant proliferation, spheroid formation, and invasion capability in vitro. The screening of antitumor agents in NCC-PS1-C1 cells showed that bortezomib and romidepsin were effective against PS. In conclusion, we report a novel PS cell line from a primary tumor resected after neoadjuvant radiotherapy. We believe that NCC-PS1-C1 will be a useful tool for the development of novel chemotherapies for PS, especially for recurrent cases after neoadjuvant radiotherapy.© 2022.

In this study, we performed integrative analysis on G4 multi-omics data from in-silicon prediction and ChIP-seq in human genome. Potential G4 sites were classified into three distinguished groups, such as one group of high-confidence G4-forming locations (G4-II) and groups only containing either ChIP-seq detected G4s (G4-I) or predicted G4 motif candidates (G4-III). We explored the associations of different-confidence G4 groups with other epigenetic regulatory elements, including CpG islands, chromatin status, enhancers, super-enhancers, G4 locations compared to the genes, and DNA methylation. Our elastic net regression model revealed that G4 structures could correlate with gene expression in two opposite ways depending on their locations to the genes as well as G4-forming DNA strand. Some transcription factors were identified to be over-represented with G4 emergence. The motif analysis discovered distinct consensus sequences enriched in the G4 feet, the flanking regions of two groups of G4s. We found high GC content in the feet of high-confidence G4s (G4-II) when compared to high TA content in solely predicted G4 feet of G4-III. Overall, we uncovered the comprehensive associations of G4 formations or predictions with other epigenetic and transcriptional elements which potentially coordinate gene transcription.Copyright © 2022 Fang, Liu, Yang, Yang, Hu and Wan."

Meanwhile, enhancers transcript non-coding RNAs, known as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), which may serve as potential diagnosis markers and therapeutic targets in Ewing sarcoma.Materials and methods:Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between 85 Ewing sarcoma samples downloaded from the Treehouse database and 3 normal bone samples downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive database. Included in DEGs, differentially expressed eRNAs (DEeRNAs) and target genes corresponding to DEeRNAs (DETGs), as well as the differentially expressed TFs, were annotated. Then, cell type identification by estimating relative subsets of known RNA transcripts (CIBERSORT) was used to infer portions of infiltrating immune cells in Ewing sarcoma and normal bone samples. To evaluate the prognostic value of DEeRNAs and immune function, cross validation, independent prognosis analysis, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were implemented using sarcoma samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Next, hallmarks of cancer by gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and immune gene sets by single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were identified to be significantly associated with Ewing sarcoma. After screening by co-expression analysis, most significant DEeRNAs, DETGs and DETFs, immune cells, immune gene sets, and hallmarks of cancer were merged to construct a co-expression regulatory network to eventually identify the key DEeRNAs in tumorigenesis of Ewing sarcoma. Moreover, Connectivity Map Analysis was utilized to identify small molecules targeting Ewing sarcoma. External validation based on multidimensional online databases and scRNA-seq analysis were used to verify our key findings.Results:A six-different-dimension regulatory network was constructed based on 17 DEeRNAs, 29 DETFs, 9 DETGs, 5 immune cells, 24 immune gene sets, and 8 hallmarks of cancer. Four key DEeRNAs (CCR1, CD3D, PHLDA1, and RASD1) showed significant co-expression relationships in the network. Connectivity Map Analysis screened two candidate compounds, MS-275 and pyrvinium, that might target Ewing sarcoma. PHLDA1 (key DEeRNA) was extensively expressed in cancer stem cells of Ewing sarcoma, which might play a critical role in the tumorigenesis of Ewing sarcoma.Conclusion:PHLDA1 is a key regulator in the tumorigenesis and progression of Ewing sarcoma.

"36092720","Comprehensive analysis of GINS subunits prognostic value and ceRNA network in sarcoma.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Background:The GINS complex, composed of GINS1/2/3/4 subunits, is an essential structure of Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase and plays a vital role in establishing the DNA replication fork and chromosome replication. Meanwhile, GINS genes have been associated with the poor prognosis of various malignancies. However, the abnormal expression of GINS genes and their diagnostic and prognostic value in sarcomas (SARC) remain unclear.Methods:Oncomine, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), Kaplan-Meier Plotter, Cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE), The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal (UALCAN), R studio, and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) were used to analyze the expression profiles, prognostic value, biological function, ceRNA, and immune infiltration associated with GINS genes in sarcomas.Results:We found that GINS1/2/3/4 genes exhibited significantly upregulated transcription levels in SARC samples compared to non-tumor tissues and exhibited high expression levels in sarcoma cell lines. In addition, SARC patients with increased expression levels of GINS1/2/3/4 showed poorer survival rates. Immune infiltration analysis showed that GINS subunits were closely associated with the infiltration of immune cells in sarcomas.Conclusion:Our research identified GINS subunits as potential diagnostic and prognostic biological targets in SARC and elucidated their underlying effects in the genesis and progression of SARC. These results may provide new opportunities and research directions for targeted sarcoma therapy.Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Chen, Xiao, Xiang, Li, Zhao and Li."
"36091160","Comprehensive analysis to identify a novel PTEN-associated ceRNA regulatory network as a prognostic biomarker for lung adenocarcinoma.","Front Oncol","Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the most prevalent forms of lung cancer. Competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the most frequently deleted tumour suppressor genes in LUAD. The present study aimed to identify a novel PTEN-associated-ceRNA regulatory network and identify potential prognostic markers associated with LUAD. Transcriptome sequencing profiles of 533 patients with LUAD were obtained from TCGA database, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in LUAD samples with PTEN high- (PTENhigh) and low- (PTENlow) expression. Eventually, an important PTEN-related marker was identified, namely, the LINC00460/miR-150-3p axis. Furthermore, the predicted target genes (EME1/HNRNPAB/PLAUR/SEMA3A) were closely related to overall survival and prognosis. The LINC00460/miR-150-3p axis was identified as a clinical prognostic factor through Cox regression analysis. Methylation analyses suggested that abnormal regulation of the predicted target genes might be caused by hypomethylation. Furthermore, immune infiltration analysis showed that the LINC00460/miR-150-3p axis could alter the levels of immune infiltration in the tumour immune microenvironment, and promote the clinical progression of LUAD. To specifically induce PTEN deletion in the lungs, we constructed an STP mouse model (SFTPC-rtTA/tetO-cre/Ptenflox/+). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis were used to detect predicted target genes. Therefore, we revealed that the PTEN-related LINC00460/miR-150-3p axis based on ceRNA mechanism plays an important role in the development of LUAD and provides a new direction and theoretical basis for its targeted therapy.Copyright © 2022 Xin, Shen, Jiang, Liu, Li, Hou, Wu, Jia, Wu, Fu, Ma and Jiang."

Here we present the Bioteque, a resource of unprecedented size and scope that contains pre-calculated biomedical descriptors derived from a gigantic knowledge graph, displaying more than 450 thousand biological entities and 30 million relationships between them. The Bioteque integrates, harmonizes, and formats data collected from over 150 data sources, including 12 biological entities (e.g., genes, diseases, drugs) linked by 67 types of associations (e.g., 'drug treats disease', 'gene interacts with gene'). We show how Bioteque descriptors facilitate the assessment of high-throughput protein-protein interactome data, the prediction of drug response and new repurposing opportunities, and demonstrate that they can be used off-the-shelf in downstream machine learning tasks without loss of performance with respect to using original data. The Bioteque thus offers a thoroughly processed, tractable, and highly optimized assembly of the biomedical knowledge available in the public domain.© 2022. The Author(s)."

"36044844","CHAMP1 binds to REV7/FANCV and promotes homologous recombination repair.","Cell Rep","A critical determinant of DNA repair pathway choice is REV7, an adaptor that binds to various DNA repair proteins through its C-terminal seatbelt domain. The REV7 seatbelt binds to either REV3, activating translesion synthesis, or to SHLD3, activating non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. Recent studies have identified another REV7 seatbelt-binding protein, CHAMP1 (chromosome alignment-maintaining phosphoprotein 1), though its possible role in DNA repair is unknown. Here, we show that binding of CHAMP1 to REV7 activates homologous recombination (HR) repair. Mechanistically, CHAMP1 binds directly to REV7 and reduces the level of the Shieldin complex, causing an increase in double-strand break end resection. CHAMP1 also interacts with POGZ in a heterochromatin complex further promoting HR repair. Importantly, in human tumors, CHAMP1 overexpression promotes HR, confers poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor resistance, and correlates with poor prognosis. Thus, by binding to either SHLD3 or CHAMP1 through its seatbelt, the REV7 protein can promote either NHEJ or HR repair, respectively.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

"36104480","A (GCC) repeat in SBF1 reveals a novel biological phenomenon in human and links to late onset neurocognitive disorder.","Sci Rep","The human SBF1 (SET binding factor 1) gene, alternatively known as MTMR5, is predominantly expressed in the brain, and its epigenetic dysregulation is linked to late-onset neurocognitive disorders (NCDs), such as Alzheimer's disease. This gene contains a (GCC)-repeat at the interval between + 1 and + 60 of the transcription start site (SBF1-202 ENST00000380817.8). We sequenced the SBF1 (GCC)-repeat in a sample of 542 Iranian individuals, consisting of late-onset NCDs (N = 260) and controls (N = 282). While multiple alleles were detected at this locus, the 8 and 9 repeats were predominantly abundant, forming > 95% of the allele pool across the two groups. Among a number of anomalies, the allele distribution was significantly different in the NCD group versus controls (Fisher's exact p = 0.006), primarily as a result of enrichment of the 8-repeat in the former. The genotype distribution departed from the Hardy-Weinberg principle in both groups (p < 0.001), and was significantly different between the two groups (Fisher's exact p = 0.001). We detected significantly low frequency of the 8/9 genotype in both groups, higher frequency of this genotype in the NCD group, and reverse order of 8/8 versus 9/9 genotypes in the NCD group versus controls. Biased heterozygous/heterozygous ratios were also detected for the 6/8 versus 6/9 genotypes (in favor of 6/8) across the human samples studied (Fisher's exact p = 0.0001). Bioinformatics studies revealed that the number of (GCC)-repeats may change the RNA secondary structure and interaction sites at least across human exon 1. This STR was specifically expanded beyond 2-repeats in primates. In conclusion, we report indication of a novel biological phenomenon, in which there is selection against certain heterozygous genotypes at a STR locus in human. We also report different allele and genotype distribution at this STR locus in late-onset NCD versus controls. In view of the location of this STR in the 5' untranslated region, RNA/RNA or RNA/DNA heterodimer formation of the involved genotypes and alternative RNA processing and/or translation should be considered.© 2022.

To address this issue, we administered a 50 µg/kg dexamethasone (DEX) to dams subcutaneously from gestational days 16 to 18 and a series of behavioral assessments were performed in the offspring. Prenatal exposure to dexamethasone (PN-DEX) induced schizophrenia (SCZ)-relevant behaviors in male mice and depressive-like behavior in female mice. SCZ-relevant behavioral patterns occurred in 10-week-old (10 W) male mice but not in 4-week-old (4 W) male mice. Microglia in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the striatum (STR) of 10 W males prenatally treated with dexamethasone (10 W PN-DEX-M) showed hyper-ramified morphology and dramatically reduced spine density in mPFC. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that microglia in the mPFC of the 10 W PN-DEX-M group interacted with pre-synaptic Bassoon and post-synaptic density 95 (PSD95) puncta. PN-DEX-M also showed significantly changed dopamine system proteins. However, a testosterone surge during adolescence was not a trigger on SCZ-relevant behavior occurrence in 10 W PN-DEX-M. Furthermore, females prenatally treated with dexamethasone (PN-DEX-F) displayed depressive-like behavior, in addition to HPA-axis activation and inflammatory microglial phenotypes in their hippocampus (HPC). We propose that altered microglial function, such as increased synaptic pruning, may be involved in the occurrence of SCZ-relevant behavior in PN-DEX-M and sex-biased abnormal behavior in the PN-DEX model.© 2022.

"36159397","<i>CAMTA1</i> gene affects the ischemia-reperfusion injury by regulating <i>CCND1</i>.","Front Cell Neurosci","Epigenetic modulations lead to changes in gene expression, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and noncoding RNAs. In recent years, epigenetic modifications have been related to the pathogenesis of different types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and other diseases. Emerging evidence indicates that DNA methylation could be associated with ischemic stroke (IS) and plays a role in pathological progression, but the underlying mechanism has not yet been fully understood. In this study, we used human methylation 850K BeadChip to analyze the differences in gene methylation status in the peripheral blood samples from two groups (3 IS patients vs. 3 healthy controls). According to their bioinformatics profiling, we found 278 genes with significantly different methylation levels. Seven genes with the most significant methylation modifications were validated in two expanded groups (100 IS patients vs. 100 healthy controls). TheCAMTA1gene had significantly different methylation changes in patients compared to the controls. To understand the CAMTA1 function in stroke, we generatedCAMTA1knockout in SH-SY5Y cells. RNA seq results inCAMTA1knockout cells revealed the pathways and gene set enrichments involved in cellular proliferation and cell cycle. Furthermore, a series of experiments demonstrated that in the oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) model system, the expression of cyclin D1, an essential regulator of cell cycle progression, was increased in SH-SY5YCAMTA1KO cells. Increasing evidence demonstrated that ischemic stress could inappropriately raise cyclin D1 levels in mature neurons. However, the molecular signals leading to an increased cyclin D1 level are unclear. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that theCAMTA1gene could regulate cyclin D1 expression and implicate their role in strokes.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Shang, Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Li, Jia, Xu, Zhang, Yang, Zhou, Luan, Huang, Peng, Han, He and Zheng."
"36124797","Linking cells across single-cell modalities by synergistic matching of neighborhood structure.","Bioinformatics","A wide variety of experimental methods are available to characterize different properties of single cells in a complex biosample. However, because these measurement techniques are typically destructive, researchers are often presented with complementary measurements from disjoint subsets of cells, providing a fragmented view of the cell's biological processes. This creates a need for computational tools capable of integrating disjoint multi-omics data. Because different measurements typically do not share any features, the problem requires the integration to be done in unsupervised fashion. Recently, several methods have been proposed that project the cell measurements into a common latent space and attempt to align the corresponding low-dimensional manifolds.In this study, we present an approach, Synmatch, which produces a direct matching of the cells between modalities by exploiting information about neighborhood structure in each modality. Synmatch relies on the intuition that cells which are close in one measurement space should be close in the other as well. This allows us to formulate the matching problem as a constrained supermodular optimization problem over neighborhood structures that can be solved efficiently. We show that our approach successfully matches cells in small real multi-omics datasets and performs favorably when compared with recently published state-of-the-art methods. Further, we demonstrate that Synmatch is capable of scaling to large datasets of thousands of cells.The Synmatch code and data used in this manuscript are available at https://github.com/Noble-Lab/synmatch.© The Author(s) 2022.

"36089615","Unraveling the epigenomic and transcriptomic interplay during alcohol-induced anxiolysis.","Mol Psychiatry","Positive effects of alcohol drinking such as anxiolysis and euphoria appear to be a crucial factor in the initiation and maintenance of alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, the mechanisms that lead from chromatin reorganization to transcriptomic changes after acute ethanol exposure remain unknown. Here, we used Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin followed by high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq to investigate epigenomic and transcriptomic changes that underlie anxiolytic effects of acute ethanol using an animal model. Analysis of ATAC-seq data revealed an overall open or permissive chromatin state that was associated with transcriptomic changes in the amygdala after acute ethanol exposure. We identified a candidate gene, Hif3a (Hypoxia-inducible factor 3, alpha subunit), that had 'open' chromatin regions (ATAC-seq peaks), associated with significantly increased active epigenetic histone acetylation marks and decreased DNA methylation at these regions. The mRNA levels of Hif3a were increased by acute ethanol exposure, but decreased in the amygdala during withdrawal after chronic ethanol exposure. Knockdown of Hif3a expression in the central nucleus of amygdala attenuated acute ethanol-induced increases in Hif3a mRNA levels and blocked anxiolysis in rats. These data indicate that chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic signatures in the amygdala after acute ethanol exposure underlie anxiolysis and possibly prime the chromatin for the development of AUD.© 2022.

To evaluate sarcoplasmic and secreted miR expression in human skeletal muscle in response to exercise-mimetic contractile activity, we utilized a three-dimensional tissue-engineered model of human skeletal muscle (""myobundles""). Myobundles were subjected to three culture conditions: no electrical stimulation (CTL), chronic low frequency stimulation (CLFS), or intermittent high frequency stimulation (IHFS) for 7 days. RNA was isolated from myobundles and from extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by myobundles into culture media; miR abundance was analyzed by miRNA-sequencing. We used edgeR and a within-sample design to evaluate differential miR expression and Pearson correlation to evaluate correlations between myobundle and EV populations within treatments with statistical significance set atp< 0.05. Numerous miRs were differentially expressed between myobundles and EVs; 116 miRs were differentially expressed within CTL, 3 within CLFS, and 2 within IHFS. Additionally, 25 miRs were significantly correlated (18 in CTL, 5 in CLFS, 2 in IHFS) between myobundles and EVs. Electrical stimulation resulted in differential expression of 8 miRs in myobundles and only 1 miR in EVs. Several KEGG pathways, known to play a role in regulation of skeletal muscle, were enriched, with differentially overrepresented miRs between myobundle and EV populations identified using miEAA. Together, these results demonstrate thatin vitroexercise-mimetic contractile activity of human engineered muscle affects both their expression of miRs and number of secreted EVs. These results also identify novel miRs of interest for future studies of the role of exercise in organ-organ interactionsin vivo.Copyright © 2022 Vann, Zhang, Khodabukus, Orenduff, Chen, Corcoran, Truskey, Bursac and Kraus."

However, the prognostic value of ferroptosis-related epigenetic features such as DNA methylation in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) needs to be studied. Ferroptosis-related genes are collected from the FerrDb database, and the methylation data of these related genes in LUSC methylation data downloaded from the TCGA are retrieved. The DNA methylation data (362 LUSC samples) were analyzed to screen prognostic ferroptosis-related methylation sites. After patients with complete overall survival (OS) information were randomly separated into training cohort (n= 200) and validation cohort (n= 162), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the Cox regression were used to establish and validate the prognostic signature. The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier survival curve analyses, Harrell's concordance index (C-index), calibration analysis, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were performed to evaluate the risk signature and related nomogram. A series of other bioinformatics approaches such as mexpress, cbioportal, maftools, string, metascape, TIMER, and Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis were also used to determine the methylation, mutation status, protein interaction network or functional enrichment, effects on immune cell infiltration, or expression level prognosis of those signature-related genes. A total of 137 DNA methylation sites were identified as prognostic predictors corresponding to 109 ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs). The methylation signature containing 31 methylation sites proved to be superior predictive efficiency in predicting the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS. 8 out of 28 signature-related genes were significantly related to OS time or OS state in patients with LUSC. In addition, DUSP1, ZFN36, and ALOX5 methylation status also correlated with pathologicalMand ALOX5 methylation correlated with pathologicalN. The prognostic prediction efficiency ofT,N,M, and the stage was inferior to that of the DNA methylation signature. LUSC patients in the high-risk group own a significantly larger number of variants of FRGs than those in the low-risk group. In addition, negative or positive correlation patterns were presented among the different infiltrating immune cells with risk scores or signature-related genes in patients with LUSC. The expression level of 15 signature-related genes showed a significant relationship with OS of LUSC patients. A novel prognostic nomogram survival model containing 4 factors including age, pathologicT, stage, and risk group was constructed and validated, AndC-index, decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration analysis demonstrated its excellent predictive performance. The FRG DNA methylation data-based prognostic model acts as a powerful prognostic prediction indicator in LUSC patients and is advantageous over the traditional model based onT,N,M, and stage.Copyright © 2022 Xuequan Wang et al."

We started by exploring the potential carcinogenic role of SMARCA1 across 33 carcinomas using the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) databases. The expression of SMARCA1 was significantly elevated in some tumor types but not in others. There was a distinct relationship between SMARCA1 expression and patient prognosis. S116 phosphorylation levels were up-regulated in both lung adenocarcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. The expression level of SMARCA1 was positively correlated with cancer-associated fibroblasts infiltration in a number of tumors, such as colon adenocarcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma. It was also associated with CD8+ T-cell infiltration in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, SMARCA1 is involved in chromatin remodeling and protein processing-associated mechanisms.

SLC22A8 plays a key role in renal excretion of organic anions. However, its role in ccRCC remains unclear; therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the relationship between SLC22A8 and ccRCC. The The Cancer Genome Atlas-kidney renal clear cell carcinoma cohort was included in this study. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and logistic regression were used to analyze the relationship between SLC22A8 expression and clinicopathological characteristics. Multifactorial analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were adopted for correlation between SLC22A8 expression and clinicopathological parameters and overall survival. Utilizing the UALCAN database, the correlation of the expression levels of SLC22A8 DNA methylation in ccRCC was explored. Immunological characterization of SLC22A8 regarding the ccRCC tumor microenvironment was carried out by the single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis algorithm and the CIBERSORT algorithm. With the CellMiner database, the analysis of the association between SLC22A8 gene expression and drug sensitivity was further performed. Eventually, gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome enrichment analyses were applied to identify the functional and signaling pathways involved in SLC22A8. SLC22A8 expression is associated with age, grade, stage, and tumor status. SLC22A8 protein expression levels, phosphorylated protein levels, and DNA methylation expression levels were lower in ccRCC tissues than in normal tissues, and low methylation levels predicted poor overall survival. Comprehensive analysis of tumor immune infiltration and the tumor microenvironment indicated a higher level of overall immunity in the SLC22A8 low expression group. Gene Enrichment Analysis results showed that low expression of SLC22A8 was associated with immune pathways, such as phagocytosis recognition and humoral immune response. SLC22A8 expression was significantly correlated with survival and immune infiltration in ccRCC and can be used as a prognostic biomarker for ccRCC.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

Therefore, comprehensive analyses ofNPRL2in STAD may provide a potential prognostic marker and clinical target for the management of gastric cancer.Genomic expression and methylation were analysed based on data from the Human Protein Atlas, Gene Expression Omnibus and Oncomine database. Survival analyses were conducted with the Kaplan-Meier method, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Immune correlation analyses and prediction of response to immunotherapy were performed using the online Immune Cell Abundance Identifier. Co-expression analyses, functional clustering analyses and construction of a prognostic risk model were conducted in R, with the clinical covariates balanced by the inverse probability treatment weighting method.NPRL2was abnormally downregulated in STAD (P<0.05). Survival analysis highlighted a positive association between the expression ofNPRL2and clinical outcomes for patients (P<0.05). Based on co-expression analyses, we found thatNPRL2may be involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, gastric cancer stem cells, and responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents in STAD (P<0.05). Furthermore, functional clustering analysis revealed thatNPRL2was involved in the mTOR signalling pathway, autophagy, and the amino acid starvation response (adjust P<0.05). In addition,NPRL2was negatively associated with tumour-infiltrating immune cells while positively associated with immunotherapeutic biomarkers in STAD (P<0.05). Meanwhile, patients with highNPRL2expression were predicted to have a better response to immunotherapy (P<0.05). Finally, a prognostic model constructed based onNPRL2-related genes could predict the prognosis of STAD patients (AUC =0.641), and the risk score was an independent prognostic factor for STAD patients (HR =4.855, 95% CI: 2.683-8.785, P<0.001).The present study provided a comprehensive analysis of the role and potential mechanisms of NPRL2 in STAD, suggesting that NPRL2 is a potential biomarker for the survival and prediction of immunotherapy response in STAD.2022 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

"36065306","Methylation Drives SLC2A1 Transcription and Ferroptosis Process Decreasing Autophagy Pressure in Colon Cancer.","J Oncol","Colon cancer is a common malignant tumor in the digestive tract, with relatively high rates of morbidity and mortality. It is the third most common type of tumor in the world. The effective treatment of advanced colon cancer is limited, so it is particularly important to study the new pathogenesis of colon cancer. Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic regulated cell death mode driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, a process which has been discovered in recent years. Autophagy involves lysosomal degradation pathways that promote or prevent cell death. High levels of autophagy are associated with ferroptosis, but a clear association has not yet been made between ferroptosis and autophagy in colon cancer. Through the analysis of transcriptome expression profiling data in colon cancer, we obtained the common upregulated genes and downregulated genes by recording the intersection of the differentially expressed genes in each dataset. Solute Carrier Family 2 Member 1 (SLC2A1) was identified by combining autophagy genes obtained from GeneCards and ferroptosis genes obtained from FerrDb. In order to explore the clinical significance and prognostic value of SLC2A1, we utilized massive databases to conduct an in-depth exploration of the methylation of SLC2A1, and we also investigated the differences in immune infiltration between tumor and normal tissues. We found that there are abundant methylation sites in SLC2A1 and that the methylation of SLC2A1 is correlated with the immunosuppression of tumor tissue. We discovered that during the induction of environmental factors, the transcription and methylation levels of SLC2A1 were greatly increased, autophagy and ferroptosis were inhibited, and the immune system was defective, resulting in a poor prognosis for patients. These results suggest that the autophagy and ferroptosis-related gene SLC2A1 is involved in the tumor immune regulation of colon cancer, and SLC2A1 may become a new therapeutic target for colon cancer.Copyright © 2022 Junwei Zou et al."

The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic and pathogenetic roles of nectins in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).The expression levels of the nectin family in HCC and their role in prognosis were analyzed by bioinformatics analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) liver hepatocellular carcinoma database. The correlations between nectins and immune cells were analyzed using TIMER. The functional enrichment of the nectin-1 coexpression network was evaluated in TCGA cohort, and the expression levels of nectin-1 were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. A Transwell kit was used for cell migration experiments. Cell proliferation was analyzed using Cell Counting Kit-8.The expression levels of nectin-1 protein in the cancer tissues of 28 patients with HCC were higher than those in paracancerous tissues. The Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis showed that the high expression of all nectin family numbers was related to the poor prognosis of HCC patients. The abnormal expression of nectin-1 effectively distinguished the prognosis at different stages and grades of HCC. The high expression of 17 methylation sites of the nectin-1 gene was related to the high overall survival of HCC patients. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis of genes negatively correlated with nectin-1, revealing their close relation to the regulation of the immune-effector process. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that nectin-1 was significantly positively correlated with multiple immune genes and B cells, CD4+T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cell infiltration. Cell proliferation of the knockdown (KD) group decreased significantly compared to the NC-KD group. The number of metastatic cells in the KD group decreased significantly compared to that in the NC-KD group.Abnormal expression of nectins and multiple methylation sites closely correlates with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Nectins are related to immune cell infiltration and immune-related genes. In particular, nectin-1 can promote the proliferation and migration of liver cancer cells and distinguish the prognosis at different stages and grades of HCC. Nectin-1 might be a new potential molecular marker for prognostic evaluation and also a therapeutic target for HCC.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Xing, Chen, Yang, Wang and Xing."

The purpose of this study was to identify DNA methylation-related biomarkers and explore the immune-infiltrate characteristics of AS based on methylation data.Methods:DNA methylation data of 15 atherosclerotic and paired healthy tissues were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differential methylation positions (DMPs) and differential methylation regions (DMRs) were screened by the ChAMP R package. The methylation levels of DMPs located on CpG islands of gene promoter regions were averaged. The limma R package was used to screen differentially methylated genes in the CpG islands of the promoter regions.

Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of monocyte markers.Results:A total of 110, 695 DMPs, and 918 DMRs were screened in the whole genome. Also, six genes with significant methylation differences in the CpG islands of the promoter regions were identified, including 49 DMPs. In total, three genes (GRIK2, HOXA2, and HOXA3) had delta beta greater than 0.2. The infiltration level of monocytes was significantly upregulated in AS tissues. MS-PCR assay confirmed the methylation status of the aforementioned three genes in AS samples. The Western blot results showed that the expression levels of the monocyte marker CD14 and M1-type macrophage marker CD86 were significantly increased in AS while M2-type macrophage marker protein CD206 was significantly decreased.Conclusion:This study identified potential DNA methylation-related biomarkers and revealed the role of monocytes in early AS.Copyright © 2022 Xu, Sun, Wei and Chang."
"36142137","Impact of G-Quadruplex Structures on Methylation of Model Substrates by DNA Methyltransferase Dnmt3a.","Int J Mol Sci","In mammals, de novo methylation of cytosines in DNA CpG sites is performed by DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a. Changes in the methylation status of CpG islands are critical for gene regulation and for the progression of some cancers. Recently, the potential involvement of DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) in methylation control has been found. Here, we provide evidence for a link between G4 formation and the function of murine DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a and its individual domains. As DNA models, we used (i) an isolated G4 formed by oligonucleotide capable of folding into parallel quadruplex and (ii) the same G4 inserted into a double-stranded DNA bearing several CpG sites. Using electrophoretic mobility shift and fluorescence polarization assays, we showed that the Dnmt3a catalytic domain (Dnmt3a-CD), in contrast to regulatory PWWP domain, effectively binds the G4 structure formed in both DNA models. The G4-forming oligonucleotide displaced the DNA substrate from its complex with Dnmt3a-CD, resulting in a dramatic suppression of the enzyme activity. In addition, a direct impact of G4 inserted into the DNA duplex on the methylation of a specific CpG site was revealed. Possible mechanisms of G4-mediated epigenetic regulation may include Dnmt3a sequestration at G4 and/or disruption of Dnmt3a oligomerization on the DNA surface."
"36110994","Role of gga-miR-29b-3p in suppressing the proliferation, invasion and migration of MSB1 Marek's disease tumor cells by the targeting of the <i>DNMT3B</i> gene.","Ann Transl Med","Marek's disease (MD), a class II infectious, lymphoproliferative disease that mainly afflicts poultry, has been shown to cause wasting, limb paralysis, and often acute death. It is a neoplastic disease caused by a cell-binding herpesvirus that leads to the formation of tumors in various organs and tissues. Our previous reports have found that the microRNA, gga-miR-29b-3p, showed abnormal expression in MD lymphoma. However, it remains unknown whether gga-miR-29b-3p affects MD tumorigenesis.The MD tumor cell line MSB1 was chosen to analyze the characteristics of gga-miR-29b-3p in tumors. Cell proliferation and migration were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and Transwell, respectively, and cell apoptosis and cycle were analyzed via fluorescent staining and flow cytometry, respectively. The regulation between gga-miR-29b-3p and its potential target genes was verified by dual luciferase results and loss-of-function assays. The effect of target genes was verified by examining the degree of RNA interference on MSB1 cells.Analysis revealed that gga-miR-29b-3p impaired the proliferation of the MSB1 MD tumor cell line, induced apoptosis without obvious effects on the cell cycle, and suppressed the expression of the invasion-associatedMMP2andMMP9genes. It was concluded thatDNMT3Bis the direct target of gga-miR-29b-3p. As expected, the effects ofDNMT3Bknockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA) on MSB1 cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cycle were associated with gga-miR-29b-3p overexpression. Moreover,BCL2andBCL2L1were downregulated andTNFSF10was upregulated in both the gga-miR-29b-3p overexpression andDNMT3Bknockdown groups. The expression levels of invasion-related genes were decreased post-DNMT3Bknockdown. In both the gga-miR-29b-3p overexpression andDNMT3Bknockdown conditions, a decrease inMEQoncogene expression in MD virus was observed.Overall, gga-miR-29b-3p was demonstrated to have a suppressive effect in MD lymphoma progression via the targeting of theDNMT3Bgene. Gga-miR-29b-3p overexpression andDNMT3Bknockdown inhibited MSB1 cell proliferation through suppressing the pro-apoptotic gene expression and elevating the anti-apoptotic gene expression in the apoptosis pathway. Our study provides a theoretical basis for targeted treatment of MD.2022 Annals of Translational Medicine. All rights reserved."
"36091786","Emerging role of different DNA methyltransferases in the pathogenesis of cancer.","Front Pharmacol","DNA methylation is one of the most essential epigenetic mechanisms to regulate gene expression. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) play a vital role in DNA methylation in the genome. In mammals, DNMTs act with some elements to regulate the dynamic DNA methylation patterns of embryonic and adult cells. Conversely, the aberrant function of DNMTs is frequently the hallmark in judging cancer, including total hypomethylation and partial hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), which improve the malignancy of tumors, aggravate the ailment for patients, and significantly exacerbate the difficulty of cancer therapy. Since DNA methylation is reversible, currently, DNMTs are viewed as an important epigenetic target for drug development. However, the impression of DNMTs on cancers is still controversial, and therapeutic methods targeting DNMTs remain under exploration. This review mainly summarizes the relationship between the main DNMTs and cancers as well as regulatory mechanisms and clinical applications of DNMTs in cancer and highlights several forthcoming strategies for targeting DNMTs.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Yang, Zhang, Hu, Chen, Wang, Su, Wu and Chen."
"36110870","Maternal testosterone affects offspring telomerase activity in a long-lived seabird.","Ecol Evol","Androgens are a group of steroid hormones that have long been proposed as a mechanism underpinning intergenerational plasticity. In birds, maternally allocated egg testosterone, one of the main androgens in vertebrates, affects a wide variety of offspring phenotypic traits but the mechanisms underlying this form of intergenerational plasticity are not yet well understood. Recent in vitro and animal model studies have shown that telomerase expression and activity are important targets of androgen signaling. The telomerase enzyme is known for its repair function on telomeres, the DNA-protein complexes at the ends of chromosomes that are involved in genomic integrity and cell aging. However, the role of maternal testosterone in influencing offspring telomerase levels in natural populations and its consequences on telomere length and potentially on offspring development is still unknown. Here, by experimentally modifying the level of egg testosterone in a natural population of yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), we show that chicks hatched from testosterone-treated eggs had higher average levels of telomerase and faster growth than controls during the first week of life. While testosterone-treated chicks also tended to have longer telomeres than controls at hatching this difference disappeared by day 6 of age. Overall, our results suggest that maternal testosterone may have a potential adaptive value by promoting offspring growth and presumably telomerase levels, as this enzyme plays other important physiological functions (e.g., stress resistance, cell signaling, or tissue genesis) besides telomere lengthening. Nonetheless, our knowledge of the potential adaptive function of telomerase in natural populations is scarce and so the potential pathways linking maternal hormones, offspring telomerase, and fitness should be further investigated.© 2022 The Authors.

We describe the development and technical validation of an automated Liquid Biopsy for Breast Cancer Methylation (LBx-BCM) prototype, a DNA methylation detection cartridge assay that is simple to perform and quantitatively detects nine methylated markers within 4.5 h. LBx-BCM demonstrated high interassay reproducibility when analyzing exogenous methylated DNA (75-300 DNA copies) spiked into plasma (Coefficient of Variation, CV = 7.1 - 10.9%) and serum (CV = 19.1 - 36.1%). It also demonstrated high interuser reproducibility (Spearmanr= 0.887,P< 0.0001) when samples of metastatic breast cancer (MBC,N= 11) and normal control (N= 4) were evaluated independently by two users. Analyses of interplatform reproducibility indicated very high concordance between LBx-BCM and the reference assay, cMethDNA, among 66 paired plasma samples (MBCN= 40, controlsN= 26; Spearmanr= 0.891; 95% CI = 0.825 - 0.933,P< 0.0001). LBx-BCM achieved a ROC AUC = 0.909 (95% CI = 0.836 - 0.982), 83% sensitivity and 92% specificity; cMethDNA achieved a ROC AUC = 0.896 (95% CI = 0.817 - 0.974), 83% sensitivity and 92% specificity in test set samples. The automated LBx-BCM cartridge prototype is fast, with performance levels equivalent to the highly sensitive, manual cMethDNA method. Future prospective clinical studies will evaluate LBx-BCM detection sensitivity and its ability to monitor therapeutic response during treatment for advanced breast cancer."

This novel technique provides the unprecedented opportunity to explore the cellular composition of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of the horse, a species for which cell type markers are poorly described. Here, scRNA-seq technology was applied to cryopreserved equine BALF cells. Analysis of 4,631 cells isolated from three asthmatic horses in remission identified 16 cell clusters belonging to six major cell types: monocytes/macrophages, T cells, B/plasma cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils and mast cells. Higher resolution analysis of the constituents of the major immune cell populations allowed deep annotation of monocytes/macrophages, T cells and B/plasma cells. A significantly higher lymphocyte/macrophage ratio was detected with scRNA-seq compared to conventional cytological differential cell count. For the first time in horses, we detected a transcriptomic signature consistent with monocyte-lymphocyte complexes. Our findings indicate that scRNA-seq technology is applicable to cryopreserved equine BALF cells, allowing the identification of its major (cytologically differentiated) populations as well as previously unexplored T cell and macrophage subpopulations. Single-cell gene expression analysis has the potential to facilitate understanding of the immunological mechanisms at play in respiratory disorders of the horse, such as equine asthma.Copyright © 2022 Sage, Nicholson, Peters, Leeb, Jagannathan and Gerber."
"36072310","Cell types as species: Exploring a metaphor.","Front Plant Sci","The concept of ""cell type,"" though fundamental to cell biology, is controversial. Cells have historically been classified into types based on morphology, physiology, or location. More recently, single cell transcriptomic studies have revealed fine-scale differences among cells with similar gross phenotypes. Transcriptomic snapshots of cells at various stages of differentiation, and of cells under different physiological conditions, have shown that in many cases variation is more continuous than discrete, raising questions about the relationship between cell type and cell state. Some researchers have rejected the notion of fixed types altogether. Throughout the history of discussions on cell type, cell biologists have compared the problem of defining cell type with the interminable and often contentious debate over the definition of arguably the most important concept in systematics and evolutionary biology, ""species."" In the last decades, systematics, like cell biology, has been transformed by the increasing availability of molecular data, and the fine-grained resolution of genetic relationships have generated new ideas about how that variation should be classified. There are numerous parallels between the two fields that make exploration of the ""cell types as species"" metaphor timely. These parallels begin with philosophy, with discussion of both cell types and species as being either individuals, groups, or something in between (e.g., homeostatic property clusters). In each field there are various different types of lineages that form trees or networks that can (and in some cases do) provide criteria for grouping. Developing and refining models for evolutionary divergence of species and for cell type differentiation are parallel goals of the two fields. The goal of this essay is to highlight such parallels with the hope of inspiring biologists in both fields to look for new solutions to similar problems outside of their own field.Copyright © 2022 Doyle."

While constitutional BRCA1 promoter methylation has been observed in normal tissues of some individuals, the potential role of normal tissue methylation as a risk factor for incident TNBC or HGSOC is unknown.To assess the potential association between white blood cell BRCA1 promoter methylation and subsequent risk of incident TNBC and HGSOC.This case-control study included women who were participating in the Women's Health Initiative study who had not received a diagnosis of either breast or ovarian cancer before study entrance. A total of 637 women developing incident TNBC and 511 women developing incident HGSOC were matched with cancer-free controls (1841 and 2982, respectively) in a nested case-control design. Cancers were confirmed after central medical record review. Blood samples, which were collected at entry, were analyzed for BRCA1 promoter methylation by massive parallel sequencing. The study was performed in the Mohn Cancer Research Laboratory (Bergen, Norway) between 2019 and 2022.Associations between BRCA1 methylation and incident TNBC and incident HGSOC were analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression.Of 2478 cases and controls in the TNBC group and 3493 cases and controls in the HGSOC group, respectively, 7 (0.3%) and 3 (0.1%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 46 (1.9%) and 30 (0.9%) were Asian, 1 (0.04%) and 1 (0.03%) was Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, 326 (13.2%) and 125 (3.6%) were Black or African, 56 (2.3%) and 116 (3.3%) were Hispanic, 2046 (82.6%) and 3257 (93.2%) were White, and 35 (1.4%) and 35 (1.0%) were multiracial. Median (range) age at entry was 62 (50-79) years, with a median interval to diagnosis of 9 (TNBC) and 10 (HGSOC) years. Methylated BRCA1 alleles were present in 194 controls (5.5%). Methylation was associated with risk of incident TNBC (12.4% methylated; HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.70-3.23; P < .001) and incident HGSOC (9.4% methylated; HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.36-2.73; P < .001). Restricting analyses to individuals with more than 5 years between sampling and cancer diagnosis yielded similar results (TNBC: HR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.75-3.63; P < .001; HGSOC: HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.22-2.72; P = .003). Across individuals, methylation was not haplotype-specific, arguing against an underlying cis-acting factor. Within individuals, BRCA1 methylation was observed on the same allele, indicating clonal expansion from a single methylation event. There was no association found between BRCA1 methylation and germline pathogenic variant status.The results of this case-control suggest that constitutional normal tissue BRCA1 promoter methylation is significantly associated with risk of incident TNBC and HGSOC, with potential implications for prediction of these cancers. These findings warrant further research to determine if constitutional methylation of tumor suppressor genes are pancancer risk factors."

PPIs can be analyzed with network approaches. Construction of a PPI network requires prediction of the interactions. All PPIs form a network. Different biases such as lack of data, recurrence of information, and false interactions make the network unstable. Integrated strategies allow solving these different challenges. These approaches have shown encouraging results for the understanding of molecular mechanisms, drug action mechanisms, and identification of target genes. In order to give more importance to an interaction, it is evaluated by different confidence scores. These scores allow the filtration of the network and thus facilitate the representation of the network, essential steps to the identification and understanding of molecular mechanisms. In this review, we will discuss the main computational methods for predicting PPI, including ones confirming an interaction as well as the integration of PPIs into a network, and we will discuss visualization of these complex data.Copyright © 2022 Robin, Bodein, Scott-Boyer, Leclercq, Périn and Droit."

This comorbidity might be due to a pleiotropic effect of genetic variants shared between CD and AD/D. Here, we validated comorbidity of CD and AD/D based on diagnostic records from millions of patients in Korea and the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center (odds ratio 11.5 [8.5-15.5, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)]). By integrating a comprehensive human disease-SNP association database (VARIMED, VARiants Informing MEDicine) and whole-exome sequencing of 50 brains from individuals with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD), we identified missense variants in coding regions including APOB, a known risk factor for CD and AD/D, which potentially have a pleiotropic role in both diseases. Of the identified variants, site-directed mutation of ADIPOQ (268 G > A; Gly90Ser) in neurons produced abnormal aggregation of tau proteins (p = 0.02), suggesting a functional impact for AD/D. The association of CD and ADIPOQ variants was confirmed based on domain deletion in cardiac cells. Using the UK Biobank including data from over 500000 individuals, we examined a pleiotropic effect of the ADIPOQ variant by comparing CD- and AD/D-associated phenotypic evidence, including cardiac hypertrophy and cognitive degeneration. These results indicate that convergence of health care records and genetic evidences may help to dissect the molecular underpinnings of heart disease and associated cognitive impairment, and could potentially serve a prognostic function. Validation of disease-disease associations through health care records and genomic evidence can determine whether health conditions share risk factors based on pleiotropy.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Obesity causes vascular disruptions, including early increased arterial stiffness and high blood pressure. This study's aim is to assess the reliability of pulse wave analysis (PWA) in obese children and how additional risk factors influence the evaluated parameters. We analyzed 55 children aged 6-18 years old by measuring their pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx), peripheral blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate, central blood pressure (cSBP, cDBP) and central pulse pressure (cPP). We used the oscillometric IEM Mobil-O-Graph and performed a single-point brachial measurement. The subjects were divided into two groups: obese (n= 30) and normal-weight (n= 25) and were clinically and anamnestically assessed. BMI and waist circumference are significantly correlated to higher values for PWV, SBP, DBP, cSBP, and cDBP. Weight significantly predicts PWV, SBP, DBP and cPP. The risk factors that significantly influence the PWA and BP values are: a cardiometabolically risky pregnancy (higher PWV, AIx, SBP), active and passive smoking (higher PWV, SBP, cSBP, cDBP), sleep deprivation (higher PWV, SBP, cSBP) and sedentariness (higher PWV, AIx, peripheral and central BP). We conclude that obese children with specific additional cardiometabolic risk factors present increased arterial stiffness and higher blood pressure values."

Sixty-three healthy volunteers, who were either categorized as the Hepatonia (HEP, n = 32) or Pulmotonia (PUL, n = 31) constitution, were enrolled. HEP and PUL are two contrasting ECM types representing the dominant liver and lung phenotypes, respectively. SNPs were analyzed from the oral mucosa DNA using a commercially available microarray chip that can identify 820,000 SNPs. We conducted GWAS using logistic regression analysis and additive mode genotypes and constructed phylogenetic trees using the SNPhylo program with 8 SNPs specific for the liver phenotype and 15 SNPs for the lung phenotype. Although genome-wide significant SNPs were not found, the phylogenetic tree showed a clear difference between the two constitutions.

The GSE21257 and GSE39055 served as the validation set to verify the predictive value of the signature. CIBERSORT was performed to show immune infiltration and the immune microenvironment. The NMF algorithm was used to construct OS molecular subtypes.Results:In this study, we developed a ubiquitin-related gene signature including seven genes (UBE2L3, CORO6, DCAF8, DNAI1, FBXL5, UHRF2, and WDR53), and the gene signature had a good performance in predicting prognosis for OS patients (AUC values at 1/3/5 years were 0.957, 0.890, and 0.919). Multivariate Cox regression indicated that the risk score model and prognosis stage were also independent prognostic prediction factors. Moreover, analyses of immune cells and immune-related functions showed a significant difference in different risk score groups and the three clusters. The drug sensitivity suggested that IC50 of proteasome inhibitor (MG-132) showed a notable significance between the risk score groups (p< 0.05).

Cuproptosis is a newly identified programmed cell death process that has been connected to tumor therapeutic sensitivity, patient outcomes, and the genesis of cancer. Cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) are involved in breast cancer, although their roles and potential mechanisms are still unclear. First, we examined the effect of gene mutations and copy number changes on overall survival in 1168 breast cancer samples. Breast cancer patients were split into two molecular categories as determined by the variation in CRG based on clinicopathological traits, overall survival, and cell-infiltrating traits in tumor microenvironments. In addition, we created and validated a CRG score to calculate breast cancer patients' OS. Finally, we created a comprehensive nomogram for the clinical use of the CRG score. Patients whose CRG scores were low showed increased odds of developing OS, a larger mutation load, and immunological activation than those with high CRG scores. The CRG score, the cancer stem cell index, and the responsiveness to chemotherapy or targeted therapies were also shown to be statistically significantly correlated. Our thorough examination of CRGs in breast cancer patients demonstrated that they may be useful predictors of prognosis, clinical characteristics, and tumor microenvironment. These findings provide fresh insight into CRGs in breast cancer and might inspire brand-new approaches to both diagnosing and treating patients there.Copyright © 2022 Li, Zhang, Wang, Wang, Xue, Shi, Wang, Wang and Zhang."

Programmed cell death (PCD) performs an integral function in the origin and treatment of cancer. Some PCD-related effective signatures for predicting prognosis in LUAD patients could provide potential therapeutic options in LUAD. A copper-dependent cell death referred to as cuproptosis is distinct from known PCD. However, whether cuproptosis is associated with LUAD patients' prognoses and the potential roles of cuproptosis-related genes involved is still unknown. For the prediction of LUAD prognosis, we developed a unique cuproptosis-associated gene signature. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, the score derived from the risk signature on the basis of six cuproptosis-related genes was found to independently serve as a risk factor for anticipating lung cancer-related death. The differentially expressed genes between the high- and low-risk groups were linked to the cilium-related function. LUAD patients' prognoses may now be predicted by a unique gene signature identified in this work.

The differentially expressed necroptosis-related genes (DENRGs) were sorted out between tumor and normal tissues. Univariate Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selectionator operator (LASSO) analysis were applied to selected DENRGs concerning patients' overall survival and to construct a prognostic biomarker. The effectiveness of this biomarker was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier curve and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The GSE39582 dataset was utilized as external validation for the prognostic signature. Moreover, using univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, independent prognostic factors were identified to construct a prognostic nomogram. Next, signaling pathways regulated by the signature were explored through the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm and tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) were used to explore immune correlation in the two groups, high-risk and low-risk ones. Finally, prognostic genes' expression was examined in the GSE41258 dataset.Results:In total, 27 DENRGs were filtered, and a necroptosis-related prognostic signature based on 6 DENRGs was constructed, which may better understand the overall survival (OS) of CRC. The Kaplan-Meier curve manifested the effectiveness of the prognostic signature, and the ROC curve showed the same result. In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that age, pathology T, and risk score were independent prognostic factors, and a nomogram was established. Furthermore, the prognostic signature was most significantly associated with the apoptosis pathway. Meanwhile, 24 immune cells represented significant differences between two groups, like the activated B cell. Furthermore, 32 immune checkpoints, TIDE scores, PD-L1 scores, and T-cell exclusion scores were significantly different between the two groups. Finally, a 6-gene prognostic signature represented different expression levels between tumor and normal samples significantly in the GSE41258 dataset.Conclusion:Our study established a signature including 6 genes and a prognostic nomogram that could significantly assess the prognosis of patients with CRC.Copyright © 2022 Liang, Cheng, Chen and Li."
"36158666","Four methylation-driven genes detected by linear discriminant analysis model from early-stage colorectal cancer and their methylation levels in cell-free DNA.","Front Oncol","The process of colorectal cancer (CRC) formation is considered a typical model of multistage carcinogenesis in which aberrant DNA methylation plays an important role. In this study, 752 methylation-driven genes (MDGs) were identified by theMethylMixpackage based on methylation and gene expression data of CRC in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Iterative recursive feature elimination (iRFE) based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to determine the minimum MDGs (iRFE MDGs), which could distinguish between cancer and cancer-adjacent tissues. Further analysis indicated that the changes in methylation levels of the four iRFE MDGs, ADHFE1-Cluster1, CNRIP1-Cluster1, MAFB, and TNS4, occurred in adenoma tissues, while changes did not occur until stage IV in cell-free DNA. Furthermore, the methylation levels of iRFE MDGs were correlated with the genes involved in the reprogramming process of somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells, which is considered the common signature of cancer cells and embryonic stem cells. The above results indicated that the four iRFE MDGs may play roles in the early stage of colorectal carcinogenesis and highlighted the complicated relationship between tissue DNA and cell-free DNA (cfDNA).Copyright © 2022 Zhan, Sun, Zhang, Zhang, Jia, Wang, Li, Li, Wang, Yu, Zhang and Li."
"36068552","Serum level of total histone 3, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac after non-emergent cardiac surgery suggests the persistence of smoldering inflammation at 3 months in an adult population.","Clin Epigenetics","Despite clinical relevance of immunological activation due to histone leakage into the serum following cardiac surgery, long-term data describing their longitudinal dynamic are lacking. Therefore, this study examines the serum levels of histone 3 (tH3) and its modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac) alongside immune system activation during the acute and convalescence phases of cardiac surgery.Blood samples from fifty-nine individuals were collected before non-emergent cardiac surgery (tpre-op) and 24 h (t24hr), seven days (t7d), and three months (t3m) post-procedure to examine serum levels of tH3, H3K4me3, and H3K27ac. Serum heat shock protein-60 (HSP-60) was a surrogate of the cellular damage marker. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) assessed smoldering inflammation. TNFα and IL-6 production by whole blood in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) evaluated immunological activation. Electronic medical records provided demographic, peri-operative, and clinical information. Paired longitudinal analyses were employed with data expressed as mean and standard deviation (X ± SD) or median and interquartile range (Me[IQ25; 75%].Compared to pre-operative levels (tH3Pre-op = 1.6[0.33;2.4]), post-operative serum tH3 significantly (p > 0.0001) increased after heart surgery (tH324hr = 2.2[0.3;28]), remained elevated at 7 days (tH37d = 2.4[0.37;5.3]), and at 3 months (tH33m = 2.0[0.31;2.9]). Serum H3K27ac was elevated at 24 h (H3K27ac24hr = 0.66 ± 0.51; p = 0.025) and seven days (H3K27ac7d = 0.94 ± 0.95; p = 0.032) as compared to baseline hours (H3K27acPre-op = 0.55 ± 0.54). Serum H3K4me3 was significantly diminished at three months (H3K4me3Pre-op = 0.94 ± 0.54 vs. H3K27ac3m = 0.59 ± 0.89; p = 0.008). tH3 correlated significantly with the duration of anesthesia (r2 = 0.38). In contrast, HSP-60 normalized seven days after surgery. Peri-operative intake of acetaminophen, but no acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), acid, ketorolac or steroids, resulted in the significant depression of serum H3K4me3 at 24 h (H3K4me3acetom- = 1.26[0.71; 3.21] vs H3K4me3acetom+ = 0.54[0.07;1.01]; W[50] = 2.26; p = 0.021). CRP, but not IL-6, remained elevated at 3 months compared to pre-surgical levels and correlated with tH324hrs(r2 = 0.43), tH37d(r2 = 0.71; p < 0.05), H3K4me37d(r2 = 0.53), and H3K27ac7d(r2 = 0.49). Production of TNFα by whole blood in response to LPS was associated with serum tH324hrs(r2 = 0.67). Diminished H3K4me324hrs,H3K27ac24hrs, and H3K27ac3m, accompanied the emergence of liver failure.We demonstrated a prolonged elevation in serum histone 3 three months after cardiac surgery. Furthermore, histone 3 modifications had a discrete time evolution indicating differential immune activation.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36105358","Know when to fold 'em: Polycomb complexes in oncogenic 3D genome regulation.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Chromatin is spatially and temporally regulated through a series of orchestrated processes resulting in the formation of 3D chromatin structures such as topologically associating domains (TADs), loops and Polycomb Bodies. These structures are closely linked to transcriptional regulation, with loss of control of these processes a frequent feature of cancer and developmental syndromes. One such oncogenic disruption of the 3D genome is through recurrent dysregulation of Polycomb Group Complex (PcG) functions either through genetic mutations, amplification or deletion of genes that encode for PcG proteins. PcG complexes are evolutionarily conserved epigenetic complexes. They are key for early development and are essential transcriptional repressors. PcG complexes include PRC1, PRC2 and PR-DUB which are responsible for the control of the histone modifications H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3. The spatial distribution of the complexes within the nuclear environment, and their associated modifications have profound effects on the regulation of gene transcription and the 3D genome. Nevertheless, how PcG complexes regulate 3D chromatin organization is still poorly understood. Here we glean insights into the role of PcG complexes in 3D genome regulation and compaction, how these processes go awry during tumorigenesis and the therapeutic implications that result from our insights into these mechanisms.Copyright © 2022 Doyle, Morey and Conway."
"36161068","The Public's Perceptions of Air Pollution. What's in a Name?","Environ Health Insights","Air pollution is a major global health threat. There is growing evidence for a negative effect of air pollution on health and well-being. Relationships between air pollution and health are mediated by health risk perceptions and play a crucial role in public response to it. Air pollution in the public's mind is often different from air pollution defined by the scientific community. Therefore, in order to develop successful prevention and alleviation strategies, an understanding of public risk perceptions is key. The central question of this paper is: 'How does ""the public"" (in Brussels) perceive air pollution?' This research is an attempt to enrich the limited body of qualitative research in the field, approaching the topic of perception from 4 different, complementary angles: definition, association, categorisation and problematisation. About 51 interviews were conducted in the Brussels-Capital Region. Consistent with earlier research, this research illustrates that perceptions of air pollution are diverse, subjective, context-dependent and often deviate from conceptualisations and definitions in the scientific community. Respondents underestimate the potential harm and problematisation depends on comparative strategies and perceived avoidability. The novel aspect of this paper is the identification of 5 mental schemes by which specific elements are categorised as being air pollution: (1) the source of the element, (2) its health impact, (3) its climate impact, (4) its functionality and (5) sensory perceptions. The insights gained from this research contribute to the field of environmental epidemiology through a better understanding of how 'the public' perceives air pollution and in what way this may deviate from how it is perceived by experts. We hope to raise the awareness among experts and policy makers that air pollution perceptions are far from universal and consensual but on the contrary individual and contested.© The Author(s) 2022."

However, the use of the telomere length as a biomarker of depressive states is ambiguous, which is due to the effect of various environmental factors on both the psychoemotional state and cellular aging of an organism. In order to identify the possible use of the relative telomere length (RTL) measured in peripheral blood leukocytes as a biomarker of enhanced liability to depression prior to the clinical symptoms, as well as to determine the link between telomere length, sociodemographic factors, allelic variants of the genes involved in the regulation of telomere elongation, and depression level, the association analysis of reverse transcriptase (TERTrs7726159), telomerase RNA component (TERCrs1317082), and the CST complex encoding protein (OBFC1rs2487999) gene polymorphisms was performed with RTL and depression level in mentally healthy individuals (N= 1065) aged 18-25 years. Together with genetic variants, the examined regression models included various sociodemographic parameters as predictors. As a result of statistical analysis, we failed to observe the association between RTL and individual differences in depression level in the studied sample. Nevertheless, multiple regression analysis allowed us to construct a statistically significant model of individual variance in RTL (P= 4.3е-4;r2= 0.018), which included rs7726159 in theTERTgene (P= 0.020; β = 0.078) and such environmental predictors as age (P= 0.001; β = -0.027) and place of residence in childhood (urban/rural area) (P= 0.048; β = 0.063). The data obtained confirm the involvement ofTERTgene variants and age in telomere length in mentally healthy individuals aged 18-25 years and indicate a negative effect of urban residency on telomere length shortening, which reflects the cellular aging of an organism.© Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2022, ISSN 1022-7954, Russian Journal of Genetics, 2022, Vol. 58, No. 9, pp. 1135–1144. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc., 2022.Russian Text © The Author(s), 2022, published in Genetika, 2022, Vol. 58, No. 9, pp. 1074–1084."

However, only DNA damage repair (DDR) genes have been investigated thoroughly in prostate cancer. To determine the comprehensive germline mutation landscape in Chinese prostate cancer patients, we performed whole exome sequencing in 100 Han Chinese patients with prostate cancer in Hong Kong and identified deleterious germline mutations. A total of 36 deleterious germline variants in 25 genes were identified in 29% patients. Variants were found in eight pathways, including DNA methylation, DDR, and tyrosine-protein kinase. These findings were validated in an independent Chinese cohort of 167 patients with prostate cancer in Shanghai. Seven common deleterious-variant-containing genes were found in discovery cohort (7/25, 28%) and validation cohort (7/28, 25%) with three genes not described before (LDLR, MYH7 and SUGCT) and four genes previously reported (FANCI, ITGA6, PABPC1 and RAD54B). When comparing with that of a cohort of East Asian healthy individuals, 12 non-DDR novel potential predisposition genes (ADGRG1, CHD4, DNMT3A, ERBB3, GRHL1, HMBS, LDLR, MYH7, MYO6, NT5C2, NUP98 and SUGCT) were identified using the discovery and validation cohorts, which have not been previously reported in prostate cancer patients in all ethnic groups. Taken together, this study reveals a comprehensive germline mutation landscape in Chinese prostate cancer patients and discovers 12 novel non-DDR predisposition genes to lay the groundwork for the optimization of genetic screening."
"36107322","Genomic Insights into Non-steroidal Nuclear Receptors in Prostate and Breast Cancer.","Adv Exp Med Biol","Alterations in transcriptional programs are a fundamental feature of prostate (PCa) and breast cancer (BrCa), and frequently target the actions of the principal steroidal nuclear receptors (NRs), namely the androgen receptor (AR) and the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), respectively. Indeed, the functions of AR and ERα are central to both prostate and mammary gland biology. The genomic interactions of these NRs become highly distorted in part by changing how they functionally interact with a cohort of non-steroidal Type II NRs, which are by contrast relatively understudied compared to their steroidal cousins. For example, the AR cistrome overlaps with cistromes of different Type II NRs, which suggests a high potential for integrated NR functions to tailor transcriptional signals. Over recent years the cistromes of these Type II NRs, including HNF4s, RARs, PPARs and VDR, have been studied in PCa and BrCa revealing convergence and functional consequences, and are reviewed in the current chapter.© 2022.

They encapsulate a variety of molecular cargo such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids including miRNAs, lncRNAs, circular RNAs, and mRNAs, and through transfer of these molecular signals can alter the metabolic phenotype in recipient cells. Emerging studies show the important role of extracellular vesicle signaling in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases and associated risk factors such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is hyperglycemia that develops during pregnancy and increases the future risk of developing obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, and cardiovascular disease in both the mother and infant. Available evidence shows that changes in maternal metabolism and exposure to the hyperglycemic intrauterine environment can reprogram the fetal genome, leaving metabolic imprints that define life-long health and disease susceptibility. Understanding the factors that contribute to the increased susceptibility to metabolic disorders of children born to GDM mothers is critical for implementation of preventive strategies in GDM. In this review, we discuss the current literature on the fetal programming of cardiovascular diseases in GDM and the impact of extracellular vesicle (EV) signaling in epigenetic programming in cardiovascular disease, to determine the potential link between EV signaling in GDM and the development of cardiovascular disease in infants.© 2022.

Copy number variation (CNV) is a form of rare genetic variation that has been implicated in the etiology of psychiatric disorders, but no large-scale investigation of CNV in PTSD has been performed. We present an association study of CNV burden and PTSD symptoms in a sample of 114,383 participants (13,036 cases and 101,347 controls) of European ancestry. CNVs were called using two calling algorithms and intersected to a consensus set. Quality control was performed to remove strong outlier samples. CNVs were examined for association with PTSD within each cohort using linear or logistic regression analysis adjusted for population structure and CNV quality metrics, then inverse variance weighted meta-analyzed across cohorts. We examined the genome-wide total span of CNVs, enrichment of CNVs within specified gene-sets, and CNVs overlapping individual genes and implicated neurodevelopmental regions. The total distance covered by deletions crossing over known neurodevelopmental CNV regions was significant (beta = 0.029, SE = 0.005, P = 6.3 × 10-8). The genome-wide neurodevelopmental CNV burden identified explains 0.034% of the variation in PTSD symptoms. The 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion region was significantly associated with PTSD (beta = 0.0206, SE = 0.0056, P = 0.0002). No individual significant genes interrupted by CNV were identified. 22 gene pathways related to the function of the nervous system and brain were significant in pathway analysis (FDR q < 0.05), but these associations were not significant once NDD regions were removed. A larger sample size, better detection methods, and annotated resources of CNV are needed to explore this relationship further.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36110941","Systematic assessment of microRNAs associated with lung cancer and physical exercise.","Front Oncol","It has long been evident that physical exercise reduces the risk of cancer and improves treatment efficacy in tumor patients, particularly in lung cancer (LC). Several molecular mechanisms have been reported, but the mechanisms related to microRNAs (miRNAs) are not well understood. MiRNAs modulated various basic biological processes by negatively regulating gene expression and can be transmitted between cells as signaling molecules. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs are actively released into the circulation during exercise, and are deeply involved in cancer pathology. Hence, the role of exercise intervention in LC treatment may be further understood by identifying miRNAs associated with LC and physical activity. Here, miRNAs expression datasets related to LC and exercise were collected to screen altered miRNAs. Further bioinformatic approaches were performed to analyze the value of the selected miRNAs. The results identified 42 marker miRNAs in LC, of which three core-miRNAs (has-miR-195, has-miR-26b, and has-miR-126) were co-regulated by exercise and cancer, mainly involved in cell cycle and immunity. Our study supports the idea that using exercise intervention as adjuvant therapy for LC patients. These core-miRNAs, which are down-regulated in cancer but elevated by exercise, may act as suppressors in LC and serve as non-invasive biomarkers for cancer prevention.Copyright © 2022 Liu, He and Wang."

We comprehensively identify the eRNA-mediated immune infiltration patterns of gastric cancer (GC) samples. We creatively proposed a random forest machine-learning (ML) algorithm to map eRNA to mRNA expression patterns. The eRNA score was constructed using principal component analysis algorithms and validated in an independent cohort. Three subtypes with distinct eRNA expression patterns were determined in GC. There were significant differences between the three subtypes in the overall survival rate, immune cell infiltration characteristics, and immunotherapy response indicators. The patients in the high eRNA score group have a higher overall survival rate and might benefit from immunotherapy. This work revealed that eRNA regulation might be a new prognostic index and might offer a potential biomarker in the response of immunotherapy. Evaluating the eRNA regulation manner of GC will contribute to guiding more effective immunotherapy strategies.© 2022 The Author(s)."

Despite their multipotency, MPPs display poorly understood lineage bias. Here, we examine whether lineage-specifying transcription factors, such as the B-lineage determinant EBF1, regulate lineage preference in early progenitors. We detect low-level EBF1 expression in myeloid-biased MPP3 and lymphoid-biased MPP4 cells, coinciding with expression of the myeloid determinant C/EBPα. Hematopoietic deletion of Ebf1 results in enhanced myelopoiesis and reduced HSC repopulation capacity. Ebf1-deficient MPP3 and MPP4 cells exhibit an augmented myeloid differentiation potential and a transcriptome with an enriched C/EBPα signature. Correspondingly, EBF1 binds the Cebpa enhancer, and the deficiency and overexpression of Ebf1 in MPP3 and MPP4 cells lead to an up- and downregulation of Cebpa expression, respectively. In addition, EBF1 primes the chromatin of B-lymphoid enhancers specifically in MPP3 cells. Thus, our study implicates EBF1 in regulating myeloid/lymphoid fate bias in MPPs by constraining C/EBPα-driven myelopoiesis and priming the B-lymphoid fate.© 2022 Lenaerts et al."

Circadian rhythm disorders aggravate the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brains of AD patients. Therefore, improving the circadian rhythm of AD patients might slow down the pathological development of neurodegeneration. Circadian regulation is driven by a master clock in suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and peripheral clock located in peripheral organs. The rhythmic feeding-fasting cycle has been proved to dominant cue to entrain peripheral clocks. We hypothesized that dietary intervention to a certain period of time during the dark phase might entrain the clock and reset the disrupted daily rhythms of AD mice. In this study, exogenous glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) treatment, time-restricted feeding (TRF), and the combination were used to examine the effect of overall circadian rhythm and neurodegenerative pathogenesis of transgenic AD mice. It was confirmed that GLP-1 administration together with time-restricted feeding improves circadian rhythm of 5 × FAD mice including the physiological rhythm of the activity-rest cycle, feeding-fasting cycle, core body temperature, and hormone secretion. Furthermore, GLP-1 and TRF treatments improved the diurnal metabolic homeostasis, spatial cognition, and learning of 5 × FAD mice. The aberrant expression of clock genes, includingBaml1,Clock,andDbp, was improved in the hypothalamus, and pathological changes in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation were also observed in AD mice with dual treatment.Copyright © 2022 Dong, Cheng and Zhao."

Despite the incredible efforts and recent advances in lung cancer treatments, patients affected by this condition still have a poor prognosis. Therefore, novel diagnostic biomarkers are needed. Recently, a class of transposable elements called human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) has been found to be implicated in cancer development and later employed as novel biomarkers for several tumor types. In this study, we first ever characterized the expression of HERVs at genomic locus-specific resolution in both LUAD and LUSC cohorts available in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Precisely, (i) we profiled the expression of HERVs in TCGA-LUAD and TCGA-LUSC cohorts; (ii) we identified the dysregulated HERVs in both lung cancer subtypes; (iii) we evaluated the impact of the dysregulated HERVs on signaling pathways using neural network-based predictions; and (iv) we assessed their association with overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). In conclusion, we believe this study may help elucidate another layer of dysregulation that occurs in lung cancer involving HERVs, paving the way for identifying novel lung cancer biomarkers."
"36077528","Sources of Cancer Neoantigens beyond Single-Nucleotide Variants.","Int J Mol Sci","The success of checkpoint blockade therapy against cancer has unequivocally shown that cancer cells can be effectively recognized by the immune system and eliminated. However, the identity of the cancer antigens that elicit protective immunity remains to be fully explored. Over the last decade, most of the focus has been on somatic mutations derived from non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion/deletion mutations (indels) that accumulate during cancer progression. Mutated peptides can be presented on MHC molecules and give rise to novel antigens or neoantigens, which have been shown to induce potent anti-tumor immune responses. A limitation with SNV-neoantigens is that they are patient-specific and their accurate prediction is critical for the development of effective immunotherapies. In addition, cancer types with low mutation burden may not display sufficient high-quality [SNV/small indels] neoantigens to alone stimulate effective T cell responses. Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of alternative sources of cancer neoantigens, such as gene fusions, alternative splicing variants, post-translational modifications, and transposable elements, which may be attractive novel targets for immunotherapy. In this review, we describe the recent technological advances in the identification of these novel sources of neoantigens, the experimental evidence for their presentation on MHC molecules and their immunogenicity, as well as the current clinical development stage of immunotherapy targeting these neoantigens."

Although Oxaliplatin is considered more superior to cisplatin, the former has been better for colorectal cancer while cisplatin is widely used for treating gynaecological cancers. Carcinoma imposes a heavy toll on mortality rates worldwide despite the novel treatment strategies and detection methods that have been introduced; nanomedicine combined with precision medicine, immunotherapy, volume-regulated anion channels, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography. Millions of deaths occur annually from metastatic cancers which escape early detection and the concomitant diseases caused by highly toxic chemotherapy that causes organ damage. It continues due to insufficient knowledge of the debilitative mechanisms induced by cancer biology. To overcome chemoresistance and to attenuate the adverse effects of cisplatin therapy, bothin vitroandin vivomodels of cisplatin-treated cancers and a few multi-centred, multi-phasic, randomized clinical trials in pursuant with recent novel strategies have been tested. They include plant-based phytochemical compounds,de novodrug delivery systems, biochemical/immune pathways, 2D and 3D cell culture models using small molecule inhibitors and genetic/epigenetic mechanisms, that have contributed to further the understanding of cisplatin's role in modulating the tumour microenvironment. Cisplatin was beneficial in cancer therapy for modulating the putative cellular mechanisms; apoptosis, autophagy, cell cycle arrest and gene therapy of micro RNAs. Specific importance of drug influx, efflux, systemic circulatory toxicity, half-maximal inhibition, and the augmentation of host immunometabolism have been identified.

These syndromes caused by mutations in theLMNAgene encoding A-type lamins belong to a group of disorders called laminopathies. Lamins are implicated in the architecture and function of the nucleus and chromatin. Patients affected with progeroid laminopathies display accelerated aging of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-derived tissues associated with nuclear morphological abnormalities. To identify pathways altered in progeroid patients' MSCs, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) from patients affected with classical Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS, c.1824C>T-p.G608G), HGPS-like syndrome (HGPS-L; c.1868C>G-p.T623S) associated with farnesylated prelamin A accumulation, or atypical progeroid syndromes (APS; homozygous c.1583C> T-p.T528M; heterozygous c.1762T>C-p.C588R; compound heterozygous c.1583C>T and c.1619T>C-p.T528M and p.M540T) without progerin accumulation. By comparative analysis of the transcriptome and methylome of hiPSC-derived MSCs, we found that patient's MSCs display specific DNA methylation patterns and modulated transcription at early stages of differentiation. We further explored selected biological processes deregulated in the presence ofLMNAvariants and confirmed alterations of age-related pathways during MSC differentiation. In particular, we report the presence of an altered mitochondrial pattern; an increased response to double-strand DNA damage; and telomere erosion in HGPS, HGPS-L, and APS MSCs, suggesting converging pathways, independent of progerin accumulation, but a distinct DNA methylation profile in HGPS and HGPS-L compared with APS cells.© 2022 Trani et al."

Here, we profiled pharmacogenetic variation in fourteen clinically relevant genes in a representative sample set of 1577 unrelated sequenced Sardinians, an ancient island population that accounts for genetic variation in Europe as a whole, and, at the same time is enriched in genetic variants that are very rare elsewhere. To this end, we used PGxPOP, a PGx allele caller based on the guidelines created by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), to identify the main phenotypes associated with the PGx alleles most represented in Sardinians. We estimated that 99.43% of Sardinian individuals might potentially respond atypically to at least one drug, that on average each individual is expected to have an abnormal response to about 17 drugs, and that for 27 drugs the fraction of the population at risk of atypical responses to therapy is more than 40%. Finally, we identified 174 pharmacogenetic variants for which the minor allele frequency was at least 10% higher among Sardinians as compared to other European populations, a fact that may contribute to substantial interpopulation variability in drug response phenotypes. This study provides baseline information for further large-scale pharmacogenomic investigations in the Sardinian population and underlines the importance of PGx characterization of diverse European populations, such as Sardinians."

Oxidative damage can be induced in cells by chemical species contained in smoke through the generation of pro-inflammatory compounds and the modulation of intracellular pro-inflammatory pathways, resulting in a pathological condition. Cessation of smoking reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with cigarette use. Next-generation products (NGPs), as alternatives to combustible cigarettes, such as electronic cigarettes (e-cig) and tobacco heating products (THPs), have been proposed as a harm reduction strategy to reduce the deleterious impacts of cigarette smoking. In this review, we examine the impact of tobacco smoke and MRPs on oxidative stress in different pathologies, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and tumors. The impact of tobacco cigarette smoke on oxidative stress signaling in human health is well established, whereas the safety profile of MRPs seems to be higher than tobacco cigarettes, but further, well-conceived, studies are needed to better understand the oxidative effects of these products with long-term exposure."

We investigated the potential of methylene blue photodynamic therapy (MB-PDT) to induce ICD in human lung cancer. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and primary human lung cancer organoids were evaluated in co-culture killing assays with MB-PDT and light emitting diodes (LEDs). ICD was characterised using immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Phototherapy with MB treatment and low energy LEDs decreased the proliferation of NSCLC cell lines inducing early necrosis associated with reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl2 and increased expression of ICD markers, calreticulin (CRT), intercellular cell-adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) in NSCLC cells. MB-PDT also potentiated CD8+T cell-mediated cytolysis of lung cancer via granzyme B in lung cancer cells and primary human lung cancer organoids."

Unbiased proteomics using biological specimens can lead to improved risk stratification and discover pathophysiological mechanisms. Using measurements of ∼4000 plasma proteins in two cohorts of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we discovered and validated markers of COVID-associated AKI (stage 2 or 3) and long-term kidney dysfunction. In the discovery cohort (N= 437), we identified 413 higher plasma abundances of protein targets and 40 lower plasma abundances of protein targets associated with COVID-AKI (adjusted p <0.05). Of these, 62 proteins were validated in an external cohort (p <0.05, N =261). We demonstrate that COVID-AKI is associated with increased markers of tubular injury (NGAL) and myocardial injury. Using estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) measurements taken after discharge, we also find that 25 of the 62 AKI-associated proteins are significantly associated with decreased post-discharge eGFR (adjusted p <0.05). Proteins most strongly associated with decreased post-discharge eGFR included desmocollin-2, trefoil factor 3, transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 10, and cystatin-C indicating tubular dysfunction and injury. Using clinical and proteomic data, our results suggest that while both acute and long-term COVID-associated kidney dysfunction are associated with markers of tubular dysfunction, AKI is driven by a largely multifactorial process involving hemodynamic instability and myocardial damage."

However, epidemiologic studies of the association between fruit and vegetable intake and breast cancer risk have produced mixed results. Measurement error, confounding, and an emphasis on diet in later adulthood may contribute to weak associations. This paper describes a randomized controlled diet intervention trial in breastfeeding women to examine the effect of high fruit and vegetable intake on breast cancer risk factors, including weight, DNA methylation and inflammatory markers.Eligible breastfeeding women who reside within a 35-mile radius of Amherst, MA are enrolled at five to six weeks postpartum and randomly assigned to a Fruit and Vegetable Intervention Arm (target n = 200) or to a USDA MyPlate Control Arm (target n = 200). The Fruit and Vegetable Intervention group receives weekly telephone or video-based counseling to encourage intake of at least eight to ten daily servings of fruits and vegetables and a weekly delivery of a supplemental box of fruits and vegetables for 20 weeks, and less intensive counseling for up to one year. Breastmilk and infant fecal specimens are collected at baseline, 10 and 20 weeks. Anthropometric measurements are obtained at these timepoints and at the 1-year follow-up. The primary outcomes are change in DNA methylation in breast epithelial cells and change in inflammatory markers in breastmilk from randomization to 20 weeks; and change in weight, waist circumference, and fruit and vegetable intake for the period from randomization to 20 weeks and 1 year.This 1-year randomized diet intervention trial in breastfeeding women will assess whether intake of at least eight to ten daily servings of fruits and vegetables per day improves biomarkers of breast cancer risk directly in the breast (i.e., DNA methylation and inflammatory markers) and helps women maintain a healthy weight.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04374747.

The mechanisms underlying these disparities are poorly understood. Using data from 84 ancestry-informative markers in US participants from the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses (PEAR) and PEAR-2 trials, the GWAA proportion was estimated. Using multivariable linear regression, the baseline levels of 886 metabolites were compared between PEAR participants with GWAA &lt; 45% and those with GWAA ≥ 45% to identify differential metabolites and metabolic clusters. Metabolites with a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.2 were used to create metabolic clusters, and a cluster analysis was conducted. Differential clusters were then tested for replication in PEAR-2 participants. We identified 353 differential metabolites (FDR &lt; 0.2) between PEAR participants with GWAA &lt; 45% (n= 383) and those with GWAA ≥ 45% (n= 250), which were used to create 24 metabolic clusters. Of those, 13 were significantly different between groups (Bonferronip&lt; 0.002). Four clusters, plasmalogen and lysoplasmalogen, sphingolipid metabolism and ceramide, cofactors and vitamins, and the urea cycle, were replicated in PEAR-2 (Bonferronip&lt; 0.0038) and have been previously linked to HTN and CVD. Our findings may give insights into the mechanisms underlying HTN racial disparities."

The phenotypic variability of LEAD is correlated with its complex, multifactorial etiology. In addition to traditional risk factors, it has been shown that the interaction between genetic factors (epistasis) or between genes and the environment potentially have an independent role in the development and progression of LEAD. In recent years, progress has been made in identifying genetic variants associated with LEAD, by Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) studies, and epigenetic profiling. The aim of this review is to present the current knowledge about the genetic factors involved in the etiopathogenic mechanisms of LEAD, as well as possible directions for future research. We analyzed data from the literature, starting with candidate gene-based association studies, and then continuing with extensive association studies, such as GWAS and WES. The results of these studies showed that the genetic architecture of LEAD is extremely heterogeneous. In the future, the identification of new genetic factors will allow for the development of targeted molecular therapies, and the use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) to identify individuals at an increased risk of LEAD will allow for early prophylactic measures and personalized therapy to improve their prognosis."

At single-cell resolution, TDL is comprised primarily of immune cells, which is completely different from glioma. The integrated analysis reveals a TDL-specific microglial subset involving in B cell activation and proliferation. Comparative analysis highlights remyelination function of glial cells and demyelination function of T cells in TDL. Subclustering and pseudotime trajectory analysis of T cells in TDL reveal their heterogeneity and diverse functions involving in TDL pathogenesis and recovery process.

"36046623","A genetic tool for the longitudinal study of a subset of post-inflammatory reactive astrocytes.","Cell Rep Methods","Astrocytes are vital support cells that ensure proper brain function. In brain disease, astrocytes reprogram into a reactive state that alters many of their cellular roles. A long-standing question in the field is whether downregulation of reactive astrocyte (RA) markers during resolution of inflammation is because these astrocytes revert back to a non-reactive state or die and are replaced. This has proven difficult to answer mainly because existing genetic tools cannot distinguish between healthy versus RAs. Here we describe the generation of an inducible genetic tool that can be used to specifically target and label a subset of RAs. Longitudinal analysis of an acute inflammation model using this tool revealed that the previously observed downregulation of RA markers after inflammation is likely due to changes in gene expression and not because of cell death. Our findings suggest that cellular changes associated with astrogliosis after acute inflammation are largely reversible.© 2022 The Author(s)."

However, this trend is not accompanied by an increase in quality of life, and this population is vulnerable to most illnesses, especially to infectious diseases. Vaccination is the best strategy to prevent this fact, but older people present a less efficient response, as their immune system is weaker due mainly to a phenomenon known as immunosenescence. The adaptive immune system is constituted by two types of lymphocytes, T and B cells, and the function and fitness of these cell populations are affected during ageing. Here, we review the impact of ageing on T and B cells and discuss the approaches that have been described or proposed to modulate and reverse the decline of the ageing adaptive immune system."
"36151511","Local data commons: the sleeping beauty in the community of data commons.","BMC Bioinformatics","Public Data Commons (PDC) have been highlighted in the scientific literature for their capacity to collect and harmonize big data. On the other hand, local data commons (LDC), located within an institution or organization, have been underrepresented in the scientific literature, even though they are a critical part of research infrastructure. Being closest to the sources of data, LDCs provide the ability to collect and maintain the most up-to-date, high-quality data within an organization, closest to the sources of the data. As a data provider, LDCs have many challenges in both collecting and standardizing data, moreover, as a consumer of PDC, they face problems of data harmonization stemming from the monolithic harmonization pipeline designs commonly adapted by many PDCs. Unfortunately, existing guidelines and resources for building and maintaining data commons exclusively focus on PDC and provide very little information on LDC.This article focuses on four important observations. First, there are three different types of LDC service models that are defined based on their roles and requirements. These can be used as guidelines for building new LDC or enhancing the services of existing LDC. Second, the seven core services of LDC are discussed, including cohort identification and facilitation of genomic sequencing, the management of molecular reports and associated infrastructure, quality control, data harmonization, data integration, data sharing, and data access control. Third, instead of commonly developed monolithic systems, we propose a new data sharing method for data harmonization that combines both divide-and-conquer and bottom-up approaches. Finally, an end-to-end LDC implementation is introduced with real-world examples.Although LDCs are an optimal place to identify and address data quality issues, they have traditionally been relegated to the role of passive data provider for much larger PDC. Indeed, many LDCs limit their functions to only conducting routine data storage and transmission tasks due to a lack of information on how to design, develop, and improve their services using limited resources. We hope that this work will be the first small step in raising awareness among the LDCs of their expanded utility and to publicize to a wider audience the importance of LDC.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36117173","Single-cell and WGCNA uncover a prognostic model and potential oncogenes in colorectal cancer.","Biol Proced Online","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) can provide accurate gene expression data for individual cells. In this study, a new prognostic model was constructed by scRNA-seq and bulk transcriptome sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) data of CRC samples to develop a new understanding of CRC.CRC scRNA-seq data were downloaded from the GSE161277 database, and CRC bulk RNA-seq data were downloaded from the TCGA and GSE17537 databases. The cells were clustered by the FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions in scRNA-seq data. CIBERSORTx was applied to detect the abundance of cell clusters in the bulk RNA-seq expression matrix. WGCNA was performed with the expression profiles to construct the gene coexpression networks of TCGA-CRC. Next, we used a tenfold cross test to construct the model and a nomogram to assess the independence of the model for clinical application. Finally, we examined the expression of the unreported model genes by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. A clone formation assay and orthotopic colorectal tumour model were applied to detect the regulatory roles of unreported model genes.A total of 43,851 cells were included after quality control, and 20 cell clusters were classified by the FindCluster () function. We found that the abundances of C1, C2, C4, C5, C15, C16 and C19 were high and the abundances of C7, C10, C11, C13, C14 and C17 were low in CRC tumour tissues. Meanwhile, the results of survival analysis showed that high abundances of C4, C11 and C13 and low abundances of C5 and C14 were associated with better survival. The WGCNA results showed that the red module was most related to the tumour and the C14 cluster, which contains 615 genes. Lasso Cox regression analysis revealed 8 genes (PBXIP1, MPMZ, SCARA3, INA, ILK, MPP2, L1CAM and FLNA), which were chosen to construct a risk model. In the model, the risk score features had the greatest impact on survival prediction, indicating that the 8-gene risk model can better predict prognosis. qPCR and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the expression levels of MPZ, SCARA3, MPP2 and PBXIP1 were high in CRC tissues. The functional experiment results indicated that MPZ, SCARA3, MPP2 and PBXIP1 could promote the colony formation ability of CRC cells in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo.We constructed a risk model to predict the prognosis of CRC patients based on scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data, which could be used for clinical application. We also identified 4 previously unreported model genes (MPZ, SCARA3, MPP2 and PBXIP1) as novel oncogenes in CRC. These results suggest that this model could potentially be used to evaluate the prognostic risk and provide potential therapeutic targets for CRC patients.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, dropout events distort the gene expression levels and underlying biological signals, misleading the downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data.We develop a statistical model-based multidimensional imputation algorithm, scMTD, that identifies local cell neighbors and specific gene co-expression networks based on the pseudo-time of cells, leveraging information on cell-level, gene-level, and transcriptome dynamic to recover scRNA-seq data. Compared with the state-of-the-art imputation methods through several real-data-based analytical experiments, scMTD effectively recovers biological signals of transcriptomes and consistently outperforms the other algorithms in improving FISH validation, trajectory inference, differential expression analysis, clustering analysis, and identification of cell types.scMTD maintains the gene expression characteristics, enhances the clustering of cell subpopulations, assists the study of gene expression dynamics, contributes to the discovery of rare cell types, and applies to both UMI-based and non-UMI-based data. Overall, scMTD's reliability, applicability, and scalability make it a promising imputation approach for scRNA-seq data.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Cooccurring clones were isolated under immunohistochemical guidance using laser-capture microdissection, and cell signaling activation portraits were measured using the reverse-phase protein microarray. To increase the translational potential of this work and capture druggable vulnerabilities within different clones, we measured expression/activation of a panel of key drug targets and downstream substrates of FDA-approved or investigational agents.

To reliably distinguish CRC patients from healthy controls, we determined cutoffs for the detection of ctDNA based on global and regional cfDNA fragmentation patterns, transcriptionally active chromatin sites, and somatic copy number alterations. We further combined global and regional fragmentation pattern into a machine learning (ML) classifier to accurately predict ctDNA for cancer detection. By following individual patients throughout their course of disease, we show that LIFE-CNA enables the reliable prediction of response or resistance to treatment up to 3.5 months before commonly used CEA.In summary, we developed and validated a sensitive and cost-effective method for untargeted ctDNA detection at diagnosis as well as for treatment monitoring of all CRC patients based on genetic as well as non-genetic tumor-specific cfDNA features. Thus, once sensitivity and specificity have been externally validated, LIFE-CNA has the potential to be implemented into clinical practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to consider multiple genetic and non-genetic cfDNA features in combination with ML classifiers and to evaluate their potential in both cancer detection and treatment monitoring.

Therefore, these two variants occur in the early stage of malignant clonal origin to mediate the malignant transformation of proplasmacytes or plasmacytes to MM cells. Tumor cell stemness index score and pseudo-sequential clonal evolution analysis can be used to divide the evolution model of MM into two clonal origins: types I and IX. Notably, clonal evolution and the tumor microenvironment showed an interactive relationship, in which the evolution process is not only selected by but also reacts to the microenvironment; thus, vesicle secretion enriches immune cells with malignant-labeled mRNA for depletion. Interestingly, microenvironmental modification exhibited significant heterogeneity among patients.This characterization of the malignant clonal evolution pattern of MM at the single-cell level provides a theoretical basis and scientific evidence for a personalized precision therapy strategy and further development of a potential new adjuvant strategy combining epigenetic agent and immune checkpoint blockade.© 2022.

A molecular evolutionary analysis of tumor variation provides a way to retrospectively infer metastatic migration histories and answer questions such as whether the majority of metastases are seeded from clones within primary tumors or seeded from clones within pre-existing metastases, as well as whether the evolution of metastases is generally consistent with any proposed models. We seek answers to these fundamental questions through a systematic patient-centric retrospective analysis that maps the dynamic evolutionary history of tumor cell migrations in many cancers. We analyzed tumor genetic heterogeneity in 51 cancer patients and found that most metastatic migration histories were best described by a hybrid of models of metastatic tumor evolution. Synthesizing across metastatic migration histories, we found new tumor seedings arising from clones of pre-existing metastases as often as they arose from clones from primary tumors. There were also many clone exchanges between the source and recipient tumors. Therefore, a molecular phylogenetic analysis of tumor variation provides a retrospective glimpse into general patterns of metastatic migration histories in cancer patients."

All patients underwent the three-cycle (21 days/cycle) treatment except for one patient who underwent two cycles. The primary endpoints were tumor major pathology response (MPR) and other events of tumor response assessed by the RECIST 1.1 and Becker criteria. Moreover, we constructed a few-shot learning model to predict the probability of MPR, which could screen those patients who might benefit from the neoadjuvant immunotherapy-chemotherapy scheme.

The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 91.4% and the 1-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was 90.0%. Adverse events occurred in 24 patients (65.6%) and grade III-IV adverse events were observed in 4 patients (12.5%) during the neoadjuvant period. Furthermore, we found commonly used preoperative assessment tools such as CT and EUS, which presented limited accuracy of tumor therapeutic response in this study; thus, we developed a therapeutic response predictive model that consisted of TNFα, IFNγ, IL-10, CD4, and age of patient, and the AUC of this FSL model was 0.856 (95% CI: 0.823-0.884).Our study showed that the neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitor tislelizumab combined with SOX had promising application potential and presented no increasing treatment-related adverse events in patients with advanced G/GEJ cancer.

We have applied genome editing to show that region-specific DNA methylation can be effectively introduced by a fusion protein, TALE, which recognizes pericentromeres, and SssI, a bacterial CpG methyltransferase. This makes it possible to increase the DNA methylation state of the pericentromeres, which is normally about 20%, to about 60-75%, enabling comparative analysis of the developmental processes of normal embryos with hypomethylated pericentromeres and embryos that have been epigenetically edited to be hypermethylated.

Additionally, RNAi-based therapy withMbd2siRNA-loaded liposomes was conducted in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation mouse model.Asthmatic patients and mice challenged with OVA exhibited upregulated MBD2 expression in macrophages, especially in alternatively activated (M2) macrophages.

Notably, intratracheal administration of liposomes carryingMbd2siRNA decreased the expression of Mbd2 and prevented OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation in mice, as indicated by the attenuated airway inflammation and mucus production.The above data indicate that Mbd2 implicates in the pathogenesis of asthma predominantly by regulating the polarization of M2 macrophages, which supports that Mbd2 could be a viable target for treatment of asthma in clinical settings.Copyright © 2022 Wu, Zhou, Wang, Zhou, Zhang, He, Zhang, Yu, Xu, Zhao, Xiong and Wang."

Accordingly, we direct readers attention to the continuing value of allele frequency data from Genome-Wide Association Surveys (GWAS) and single gene surveys in well-defined ethnic populations as a guide for best practice in diagnosis, therapy, and prescription. Supporting evidence is drawn from our experiences working with Austronesian volunteer subjects across the Western Pacific. In general, these studies show that their gene pool has been shaped by natural selection and become highly diverged from those of Europeans and Asians. These uniquely evolved patterns of genetic variation underlie contrasting schedules of disease incidence and drug response. Thus, recognition of historical bonds of kinship among Austronesian population groups across the Asia Pacific has distinct public health advantages from a One Health perspective. Other than diseases that are common among them like gout and diabetes, Austronesian populations face a wide range of climate-dependent infectious diseases including vector-borne pathogens as they are now scattered across the Pacific and Indian Oceans. However, we caution that the value of genetic survey data in Austronesians (and other groups too) is critically dependent on the accuracy of attached descriptive information in associated metadata, including ethnicity and admixture.Copyright © 2022 Edinur, Mat-Ghani and Chambers."

Current management and breeding strategies heavily rely on the knowledge of regulative mechanisms underlying disease resistance. Though the intestinal microbial community was linked with disease infection, there is little knowledge about the roles of intestinal microbes in fish disease resistance. Cynoglossus semilaevis is an economically important and widely cultivated flatfish species in China. However, it suffers from outbreaks of vibriosis, which results in huge mortalities and economic loss.Here, we used C. semilaevis as a research model to investigate the host-microbiome interactions in regulating vibriosis resistance. The resistance to vibriosis was reflected in intestinal microbiome on both taxonomic and functional levels. Such differences also influenced the host gene expressions in the resistant family. Moreover, the intestinal microbiome might control the host immunological homeostasis and inflammation to enhance vibriosis resistance through the microbe-intestine-immunity axis. For example, Phaeobacter regulated its hdhA gene and host cyp27a1 gene up-expressed in bile acid biosynthesis pathways, but regulated its trxA gene and host akt gene down-expressed in proinflammatory cytokines biosynthesis pathways, to reduce inflammation and resist disease infection in the resistant family. Furthermore, the combination of intestinal microbes and host genes as biomarkers could accurately differentiate resistant family from susceptible family.Our study uncovered the regulatory patterns of the microbe-intestine-immunity axis that may contribute to vibriosis resistance in C. semilaevis. These findings could facilitate the disease control and selective breeding of superior germplasm with high disease resistance in fish aquaculture. Video Abstract.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36171217","Alternative ANKHD1 transcript promotes proliferation and inhibits migration in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma.","NPJ Genom Med","Alternative splicing (AS) is common in gene expression, and abnormal splicing often results in several cancers. Overall survival-associated splicing events (OS-SEs) have been used to predict prognosis in cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and function of OS-SEs in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Based on TCGA and TCGASpliceSeq databases, gene expression and the AS data of UCEC samples were retrieved. An alternate terminator of ANKHD1 transcripts named ANKHD1-BP3 was found to be significantly related to metastasis and OS in UCEC and significantly associated with HSPB1. The upregulated expression of HSPB1 induced downregulation of ANKHD1-BP3 and promoted tumor metastasis. These findings indicate that HSPB1, a splicing factor, regulates the expression of ANKHD1-BP3 to promote metastasis in UCEC.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36039747","RNA helicase-dependent gene looping impacts messenger RNA processing.","Nucleic Acids Res","DDX5 and DDX17 are DEAD-box RNA helicase paralogs which regulate several aspects of gene expression, especially transcription and splicing, through incompletely understood mechanisms. A transcriptome analysis of DDX5/DDX17-depleted human cells confirmed the large impact of these RNA helicases on splicing and revealed a widespread deregulation of 3' end processing. In silico analyses and experiments in cultured cells showed the binding and functional contribution of the genome organizing factor CTCF to chromatin sites at or near a subset of DDX5/DDX17-dependent exons that are characterized by a high GC content and a high density of RNA Polymerase II. We propose the existence of an RNA helicase-dependent relationship between CTCF and the dynamics of transcription across DNA and/or RNA structured regions, that contributes to the processing of internal and terminal exons. Moreover, local DDX5/DDX17-dependent chromatin loops spatially connect RNA helicase-regulated exons with their cognate promoter, and we provide the first direct evidence that de novo gene looping modifies alternative splicing and polyadenylation. Overall our findings uncover the impact of DDX5/DDX17-dependent chromatin folding on pre-messenger RNA processing.© The Author(s) 2022.

"36123506","Analysis of viral integration reveals new insights of oncogenic mechanism in HBV-infected intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma.","Hepatol Int","Integration of HBV DNA into the human genome could progressively contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis. Both intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) are known to be associated with HBV infection. However, the integration of HBV and mechanism of HBV-induced carcinogenesis in ICC and CHC remains unclear.41 patients with ICC and 20 patients with CHC were recruited in the study. We conducted HIVID analysis on these 61 samples to identify HBV integration sites in both the tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. To further explore the effect of HBV integration on gene alteration, we selected paired tumors and adjacent non-tumor liver tissues from 3 ICC and 4 CHC patients for RNA-seq and WGS.We detected 493 HBV integration sites in ICC patients, of which 417 were from tumor samples and 76 were from non-tumor samples. And 246 HBV integration sites were detected in CHC patients, of which 156 were located in the genome of tumor samples and 90 were in non-tumor samples. Recurrent HBV integration events were detected in ICC including TERT, ZMAT4, MET, ANKFN1, PLXNB2, and in CHC like TERT, ALKBH5. Together with our established data of HBV-infected hepatocellular carcinoma, we found that HBV preferentially integrates into the specific regions which may affect the gene expression and regulation in cells and involved in carcinogenesis. We further performed genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of three ICC and four CHC patients, and found that HBV fragments could integrate near some important oncogene like TERT, causing large-scale genome variations on nearby genomic sequences, and at the same time changing the expression level of the oncogenes.Comparative analysis demonstrates numerous newly discovered mutational events in ICC and CHC resulting from HBV insertions in the host genome. Our study provides an in-depth biological and clinical insights into HBV-induced ICC and CHC.© 2022. The Author(s)."

This study describes the topics addressed by European birth cohorts, the interaction between these cohort interests and aims, and describes the scientific publications deriving from the cohorts.A previous study found 66 pregnancy and 45 birth cohorts in Europe. In this study, between August and October 2020, the predominant key areas addressed by the 45 birth cohorts identified in the previous study were evaluated, as were the publications found in PubMed that were associated with the 45 cohorts. A network analysis was performed to show the connections between the 13 key areas identified. A focus on a topic in common between two areas was provided, describing the related publications.A total of 1512 references were found in PubMed (148 publications per cohort). Thirteen predominant key areas were identified, the most common of which was ""Environmental"" (addressed by 20 cohorts). The Environmental, Genes, and Lifestyle exposure areas were the prevalent topics characterizing the network figure. The Environmental area had the largest number of interactions with the other areas, while the Prematurity area (4 cohorts) the least. The focus provided on smoking led to the comparison of 35 publications from the Environmental group of cohorts and 22 from the Prematurity group, but their objectives did not overlap.The results of this descriptive study show that the environment is a priority research area for cohorts in Europe and that cohorts with different research areas may have study issues in common, but may approach them from different viewpoints. Birth cohorts have wide-ranging aims and it would be almost impossible, and undesirable, to have perfectly overlapping and comparable objectives, but joining efforts would permit maximum use of available resources.© 2022.

"36095183","Cooperative learning for multiview analysis.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","We propose a method for supervised learning with multiple sets of features (""views""). The multiview problem is especially important in biology and medicine, where ""-omics"" data, such as genomics, proteomics, and radiomics, are measured on a common set of samples. ""Cooperative learning"" combines the usual squared-error loss of predictions with an ""agreement"" penalty to encourage the predictions from different data views to agree. By varying the weight of the agreement penalty, we get a continuum of solutions that include the well-known early and late fusion approaches. Cooperative learning chooses the degree of agreement (or fusion) in an adaptive manner, using a validation set or cross-validation to estimate test set prediction error. One version of our fitting procedure is modular, where one can choose different fitting mechanisms (e.g., lasso, random forests, boosting, or neural networks) appropriate for different data views. In the setting of cooperative regularized linear regression, the method combines the lasso penalty with the agreement penalty, yielding feature sparsity. The method can be especially powerful when the different data views share some underlying relationship in their signals that can be exploited to boost the signals. We show that cooperative learning achieves higher predictive accuracy on simulated data and real multiomics examples of labor-onset prediction. By leveraging aligned signals and allowing flexible fitting mechanisms for different modalities, cooperative learning offers a powerful approach to multiomics data fusion."

We examined the experiences of parents from diverse backgrounds with enrolling their children in clinical genomics research on rare diseases. We explored the barriers and facilitators parents encountered and possible impacts of sociodemographic factors on their access to research.Methods:We utilized semi-structured interviews with parents of children participating in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network. Interview data were analyzed using comparative content analysis.Results:We interviewed 13 Hispanic, 11 non-Hispanic White, four Asian, and two biracial parents. Participants discussed different pathways to clinical genomics research for rare disease as well as how sociodemographic factors shaped families' access. Themes focused on variation in: 1) reliance on providers to access research; 2) cultural norms around health communication; 3) the role of social capital in streamlining access; and 4) the importance of language-concordant research engagement.Conclusion:Our findings suggest that variables beyond race/ethnicity may influence access in clinical genomics research.

"36130957","Intrinsic bias estimation for improved analysis of bulk and single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles using SELMA.","Nat Commun","Genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility by DNase-seq or ATAC-seq has been widely used to identify regulatory DNA elements and transcription factor binding sites. However, enzymatic DNA cleavage exhibits intrinsic sequence biases that confound chromatin accessibility profiling data analysis. Existing computational tools are limited in their ability to account for such intrinsic biases and not designed for analyzing single-cell data. Here, we present Simplex Encoded Linear Model for Accessible Chromatin (SELMA), a computational method for systematic estimation of intrinsic cleavage biases from genomic chromatin accessibility profiling data. We demonstrate that SELMA yields accurate and robust bias estimation from both bulk and single-cell DNase-seq and ATAC-seq data. SELMA can utilize internal mitochondrial DNA data to improve bias estimation. We show that transcription factor binding inference from DNase footprints can be improved by incorporating estimated biases using SELMA. Furthermore, we show strong effects of intrinsic biases in single-cell ATAC-seq data, and develop the first single-cell ATAC-seq intrinsic bias correction model to improve cell clustering. SELMA can enhance the performance of existing bioinformatics tools and improve the analysis of both bulk and single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing data.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In recent years, substantial evidence has revealed that the inflammatory response is closely related to cardiovascular diseases. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway which is activated by cytoplasmic DNA promotes the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) or nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), thus leading to upregulation of the levels of inflammatory factors and interferons (IFNs). Therefore, studying the role of inflammation caused by cGAS-STING pathway in cardiovascular diseases could provide a new therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases. This review focuses on that cGAS-STING-mediated inflammatory response in the progression of cardiovascular diseases and the prospects of cGAS or STING inhibitors for treatment of cardiovascular diseases.Copyright © 2022 Du, Zhang, Nie, Qi, Shi, Han, Zhou, He and Wang."

Despite deep evolutionary conservation of the cerebral cortex and its foundational six-layered architecture, significant variations in cortical size and folding can be found across mammals, including a disproportionate expansion of the prefrontal cortex in humans. Yet our mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental processes is derived overwhelmingly from rodent models, which fail to capture many human-enriched features of cortical development. With the advent of pluripotent stem cells and technologies for differentiating three-dimensional cultures of neural tissue in vitro, cerebral organoids have emerged as an experimental platform that recapitulates several hallmarks of human brain development. In this review, we discuss the merits and limitations of cerebral organoids as experimental models of the developing human brain. We highlight innovations in technology development that seek to increase its fidelity to brain development in vivo and discuss recent efforts to use cerebral organoids to study regeneration and brain evolution as well as to develop neurological and neuropsychiatric disease models."

Using a systems biology method called MAPSD (Markov Affinity-based Proteogenomic Signal Diffusion) for joint modeling of proteome dynamics and a wide array of omics datasets, we identified a list of candidate ASD risk genes. Leveraging the collected biological signals as well as a large-scale protein-protein interaction network adjusted based on single cell resolution proteome properties in four brain regions, we observed an agreement between the known and the newly identified candidate genes that are spatially enriched in neuronal cells within cerebral cortex at the protein level. Moreover, we created a detailed subcellular localization enrichment map of the known and the identified genes across 32 micro-domains and showed that neuronal cells and neuropils share the largest fraction of signal enrichment in cerebral cortex. Notably, we showed that the identified genes are among the transcriptional biomarkers of inhibitory and excitatory neurons in human frontal cortex. Intersecting the identified genes with a single cell RNA-seq data on ASD brains further evidenced that 20 candidate genes, including GRIK1, EMX2, STXBP6, and KCNJ3 are disrupted in distinct cell-types. Moreover, we showed that ASD risk genes are predominantly distributed in certain human interactome modules, and that the identified genes may act as the regulator for some of the known ASD loci. In summary, our study demonstrated how tissue-wide cell-specific proteogenomic modeling can reveal candidate genes for brain disorders that can be supported by convergent lines of evidence.© 2022.

Several clinical trials in Huntington disease (HD), an inherited, progressive neurodegenerative disease, are currently ongoing. Therefore, we examine whether peripheral tissues can serve as a source of readily accessible biological signatures at the RNA and protein level in HD patients.We generate large, high-quality human datasets from skeletal muscle, skin and adipose tissue to probe molecular changes in human premanifest and early manifest HD patients-those most likely involved in clinical trials. The analysis of the transcriptomics and proteomics data shows robust, stage-dependent dysregulation. Gene ontology analysis confirms the involvement of inflammation and energy metabolism in peripheral HD pathogenesis. Furthermore, we observe changes in the homeostasis of extracellular vesicles, where we find consistent changes of genes and proteins involved in this process. In-depth single nucleotide polymorphism data across the HTT gene are derived from the generated primary cell lines.Our 'omics data document the involvement of inflammation, energy metabolism, and extracellular vesicle homeostasis. This demonstrates the potential to identify biological signatures from peripheral tissues in HD suitable as biomarkers in clinical trials. The generated data, complemented by the primary cell lines established from peripheral tissues, and a large panel of iPSC lines that can serve as human models of HD are a valuable and unique resource to advance the current understanding of molecular mechanisms driving HD pathogenesis.© 2022.

"36048826","TNF-α and NF-κB signaling play a critical role in cigarette smoke-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of retinal pigment epithelial cells in proliferative vitreoretinopathy.","PLoS One","Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is characterized by the growth and contraction of cellular membranes within the vitreous cavity and on both surfaces of the retina, resulting in recurrent retinal detachments and poor visual outcomes. Proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) have been associated with PVR and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Cigarette smoke is the only known modifiable risk factor for PVR, but the mechanisms are unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of cigarette smoke on the proinflammatory TNFα/NF-κB/Snail pathway in RPE cells to better understand the mechanisms through which cigarette smoke increases the risk of PVR. Human ARPE-19 cells were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE), for 4 to 24-hours and TNFα, Snail, IL-6, IL-8, and α-SMA levels were analyzed by qPCR and/or Western blot. The severity of PVR formation was assessed in a murine model of PVR after intravitreal injection of ARPE-19 cells pre-treated with CSE or not. Fundus imaging, OCT imaging, and histologic analysis 4 weeks after injection were used to examine PVR severity. ARPE-19 cells exposed to CSE expressed higher levels of TNFα, SNAIL, IL6 and IL8 mRNA as well as SNAIL, Vimentin and α-SMA protein. Inhibition of TNFα and NF-κB pathways blocked the effect of CSE. In vivo, intravitreal injection of ARPE-19 cells treated with CSE resulted in more severe PVR compared to mice injected with untreated RPE cells. These studies suggest that the TNFα pathway is involved in the mechanism whereby cigarette smoke increases PVR. Further investigation into the role of TNFα/NF-κB/Snail in driving PVR and pharmacological targeting of these pathways in disease are warranted."

Existing studies on the proteomic signature profiles of CRC are relatively limited. Therefore, we herein aimed to provide a more comprehensive proteomic signature profile and discover new prognostic markers and therapeutic targets by performing proteomic analysis of CRC and paired normal tissues.To investigate the proteomic signature and identify novel protein prognostic biomarkers of CRC.Cancer tissues and paired normal tissues were collected from 48 patients who underwent surgical removal at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital from January 2020 to June 2021. Data independent acquisition (DIA) quantitative proteomic analysis was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (nano-UHPLC-MS/MS) to identify differentially expressed proteins, among which those with aPadj value (ttest, BH correction) < 0.05 and an absolute fold change (|log2FC|) > 2 were identified as potential markers. Differentially expressed proteins were selected by bioinformatics analysis and validated by immunohistochemical tissue microarrays, and their association with prognosis was further analyzed with the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database to identify prognostic protein biomarkers of CRC.Significantly differential protein expression was observed between cancer tissues and normal tissues. Compared with normal tissues, 1115 proteins were upregulated and 705 proteins were downregulated in CRC based onPadj < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 2, and bioinformatics analysis revealed that the differentially expressed proteins were involved in multiple biological processes associated with tumorigenesis, including ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, focal adhesion, extracellular matrix-receptor interactions and other tumor metabolism processes. Moreover, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) expression was markedly upregulated in CRC, as validated by immunohistochemistry (0.228vs0.364,P= 0.0044), and was significantly enriched in tumor proliferation and signal transduction pathways such as the cell cycle and p53 signaling pathways. High CDKN2A expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis (P= 0.021). These results demonstrated that CDKN2A functions as a driver of CRC.Our study provides a comprehensive proteomic signature of CRC and highlights CDKN2A as a potential powerful prognostic marker and precision therapeutic target.©The Author(s) 2022.

Given these robust relationships, neuroscientists have attempted to elucidate how socioeconomic-based adversity ""gets under the skin."" Historically, this work emphasized individual proxies of socioeconomic position (e.g., income, education), ignoring the effects of broader socioeconomic contexts (e.g., neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage) which may uniquely contribute to chronic stress. This omission represented a disconnect between neuroscience and other allied fields that have recognized health is undeniably linked to interactions between systems of power and individual characteristics. More recently, neuroscience work has considered how sociopolitical context affects brain structure and function; however, the products of this exciting line of research have lacked critical sociological and historical perspectives. While empirical evidence on this topic is burgeoning, the cultural, ethical, societal, and legal implications of this work have been elusive. Although the mechanisms by which socioeconomic circumstances impact brain structure and function may be similar across people, not everyone is exposed to these factors at similar rates. Individuals from ethnoracially minoritized groups are disproportionally exposed to neighborhood disadvantage. Thus, socioeconomic inequities examined in neuroscience research are undergirding with other forms of oppression, namely structural racism. We utilize a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to interpret findings from neuroscience research and interweave relevant theories from the fields of public health, social sciences, and Black feminist thought. In this perspective piece, we discuss the complex relationship that continues to exist between academic institutions and underserved surrounding communities, acknowledging the areas in which neuroscience research has historically harmed and/or excluded structurally disadvantaged communities. We conclude by envisioning how this work can be used; not just to inform policymakers, but also to engage and partner with communities and shape the future direction of human neuroscience research.Copyright © 2022 Webb, Cardenas-Iniguez and Douglas."

Among these techniques, single-cell cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes (CITE-seq) allows simultaneous quantification of gene expression and surface proteins. Clustering CITE-seq data have the great potential of providing us with a more comprehensive and in-depth view of cell states and interactions. However, CITE-seq data inherit the properties of scRNA-seq data, being noisy, large-dimensional, and highly sparse. Moreover, representations of RNA and surface protein are sometimes with low correlation and contribute divergently to the clustering object. To overcome these obstacles and find a combined representation well suited for clustering, we proposed scCTClust for multiomics data, especially CITE-seq data, and clustering analysis. Two omics-specific neural networks are introduced to extract cluster information from omics data. A deep canonical correlation method is adopted to find the maximumly correlated representations of two omics. A novel decentralized clustering method is utilized over the linear combination of latent representations of two omics. The fusion weights which can account for contributions of omics to clustering are adaptively updated during training. Extensive experiments over both simulated and real CITE-seq data sets demonstrated the power of scCTClust. We also applied scCTClust on transcriptome-epigenome data to illustrate its potential for generalizing.Copyright © 2022 Yuan, Chen and Deng."

The study included 7,944,248 children, out of whom 171,774 children were born after use of ART (2.2%) and 7,772,474 children were born after spontaneous conception, representing all children born between the years 1994 to 2014 in Denmark, 1990 to 2014 in Finland, 1984 to 2015 in Norway, and 1985 to 2015 in Sweden. Rates for any cancer and specific cancer groups in children born after each conception method were determined by cross-linking national ART registry data with national cancer and health data registries and population registries. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the risk of any cancer, with age as the time scale. After a mean follow-up of 9.9 and 12.5 years, the incidence rate (IR) of cancer before age 18 years was 19.3/100,000 person-years for children born after ART (329 cases) and 16.7/100,000 person-years for children born after spontaneous conception (16,184 cases). Adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.21, p = 0.18. Adjustment was performed for sex, plurality, year of birth, country of birth, maternal age at birth, and parity. Children born after FET had a higher risk of cancer (48 cases; IR 30.1/100,000 person-years) compared to both fresh embryo transfer (IR 18.8/100,000 person-years), aHR 1.59, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.20, p = 0.005, and spontaneous conception, aHR 1.65, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.19, p = 0.001. Adjustment either for macrosomia, birth weight, or major birth defects attenuated the association marginally. Higher risks of epithelial tumors and melanoma after any assisted reproductive method and of leukemia after FET were observed. The main limitation of this study is the small number of children with cancer in the FET group.Children born after FET had a higher risk of childhood cancer than children born after fresh embryo transfer and spontaneous conception. The results should be interpreted cautiously based on the small number of children with cancer, but the findings raise concerns considering the increasing use of FET, in particular freeze-all strategies without clear medical indications.Trial registration number: ISRCTN 11780826."

However, 5hmC is also cell-type specific, and its variability may exist between differentiated tumor cells and cancer stem cells. Thus, cancer-associated changes in 5hmC may be contributed by distinct sets of tumor cells within the tumor tissues.Here, we applied a sensitive immunoprecipitation-based method (hMeDIP-seq) to analyze 5hmC changes during genitourinary carcinogenesis (including prostate, urothelial and kidney). We confirmed the tissue-specific distribution of 5hmC in genitourinary tissues and identified regional gain and global loss of 5hmC coexisting in genitourinary cancers. The genes with gain of 5hmC during tumorigenesis were functionally enriched in regulating stemness and hypoxia, whereas were associated with poor clinical prognosis irrespective of their differences in tumor type. We identified that gain of 5hmC occurred in soft fibrin gel-induced 3D tumor spheres with a tumor-repopulating phenotype in two prostate cancer cell lines, 22RV1 and PC3, compared with conventional two-dimensional (2D) rigid dishes. Then, we defined a malignant signature derived from the differentially hydroxymethylated regions affected genes of cancer stem-like cells, which could predict a worse clinical outcome and identified phenotypically malignant populations of cells from prostate cancer tumors. Notably, an oxidation-resistant vitamin C derivative, ascorbyl phosphate magnesium, restored 5hmC and killed the cancer stem cell-like cells leading to apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines.Collectively, our study dissects the regional gain of 5hmC in maintaining cancer stem-like cells and related to poor prognosis, which provides proof of concept for an epigenetic differentiation therapy with vitamin C by 5hmC reprogramming.© 2022.

"36071173","RNA m<sup>6</sup>A regulates transcription via DNA demethylation and chromatin accessibility.","Nat Genet","Transcriptional regulation, which integrates chromatin accessibility, transcription factors and epigenetic modifications, is crucial for establishing and maintaining cell identity. The interplay between different epigenetic modifications and its contribution to transcriptional regulation remains elusive. Here, we show that METTL3-mediated RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) formation leads to DNA demethylation in nearby genomic loci in normal and cancer cells, which is mediated by the interaction between m6A reader FXR1 and DNA 5-methylcytosine dioxygenase TET1. Upon recognizing RNA m6A, FXR1 recruits TET1 to genomic loci to demethylate DNA, leading to reprogrammed chromatin accessibility and gene transcription. Therefore, we have characterized a regulatory mechanism of chromatin accessibility and gene transcription mediated by RNA m6A formation coupled with DNA demethylation, highlighting the importance of the crosstalk between RNA m6A and DNA modification in physiologic and pathogenic process.© 2022.

Among various pathophysiological aspects, microglia are considered to play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) showed that the majority of AD risk genes are highly or exclusively expressed in microglia, underscoring the critical roles of microglia in AD pathogenesis. Recently, omics technologies have greatly advanced our knowledge of microglia biology in AD. Omics approaches, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics/lipidomics, present remarkable opportunities to delineate the underlying mechanisms, discover novel diagnostic biomarkers, monitor disease progression, and shape therapeutic strategies for diseases. In this review, we summarized research based on microglial ""omics"" analysis in AD, especially the recent research advances in the identification of AD-associated microglial subsets. This review reinforces the important role of microglia in AD and advances our understanding of the mechanism of microglia in AD pathogenesis.

Bioinformatics analysis was subsequently performed to investigate Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enriched signaling pathways of these DEPs. Six proteins (AZU1, COX4I1, EDF1, KRT31, MMP12, and PRG2) were selected for further validationviaenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).Compared with BM group and N group, HBM group had a higher whole CSF protein level (5.6 ± 2.7 vs. 1.7 ± 1.0 vs. 1.2 ± 0.5 g/l) and lower whole CSF glucose level (0.8 ± 0.6 vs. 1.8 ± 0.7 vs. 3.3 ± 0.8 mmol/l) (bothP< 0.05). Over 300 DEPs were differentially expressed in HBM group compared with BM group and BM compared with N group, of which 78% were common to both. Cluster analysis indicated that the levels of 226 proteins were increased in BM group compared with N group and were decreased in HBM group compared with BM group. Bioinformatics analysis indicated the involvement of the cell adhesion, immune response and extracellular exosome signaling were significantly enriched in HBM compared with BM group and BM compared with N group. 267 DEPs were identified between HBM group with N group, KEGG analysis indicated that DEPs mainly involved in filament cytoskeleton and immune response. The ELISA results further verified that the expression levels of AZU1 were significantly different from among three groups (bothP< 0.05).This is the first reported characterization of quantitative proteomics from the CSF of infants with HBM. Our study also demonstrated that AZU1 could be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of hydrocephalus in bacterial meningitis.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Huang, Zhang, Peng, Yang, Yang, Su, Wang and Zhou."

"36091137","Circular RNAs regulate parental gene expression: A new direction for molecular oncology research.","Front Oncol","CircRNAs have been the focus of research in recent years. They are differentially expressed in various human tumors and can regulate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes expression through various mechanisms. The diversity, stability, evolutionary conservatism and cell- or tissue-specific expression patterns of circRNAs also endow them with important regulatory roles in promoting or inhibiting tumor cells malignant biological behaviors progression. More interestingly, emerging studies also found that circRNAs can regulate not only other genes expression, but also their parental gene expression and thus influence tumors development. Apart from some conventional features, circRNAs have a certain specificity in the regulation of parental gene expression, with a higher proportion affecting parental gene transcription and easier translation into protein to regulate parental gene expression. CircRNAs are generally thought to be unable to produce proteins and therefore the protein-coding ability exhibited by circRNAs in regulating parental gene expression is unique and indicates that the regulatory effects of parental gene expression by circRNAs are not only a competitive binding relationship, but also a more complex molecular relationship between circRNAs and parental gene, which deserves further study. This review summarizes the molecular mechanisms of circRNAs regulating parental gene expression and their biological roles in tumorigenesis and development, aiming to provide new ideas for the clinical application of circRNAs in tumor-targeted therapy.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Gao, Yu, Wang, Liu, Jiang and Sun."
"36077577","Retinal Ganglion Cell Survival and Axon Regeneration after Optic Nerve Injury: Role of Inflammation and Other Factors.","Int J Mol Sci","The optic nerve, like most pathways in the mature central nervous system, cannot regenerate if injured, and within days, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that extend axons through the optic nerve, begin to die. Thus, there are few clinical options to improve vision after traumatic or ischemic optic nerve injury or in neurodegenerative diseases such as glaucoma, dominant optic neuropathy, or optic pathway gliomas. Research over the past two decades has identified several strategies to enable RGCs to regenerate axons the entire length of the optic nerve, in some cases leading to modest reinnervation of di- and mesencephalic visual relay centers. This review primarily focuses on the role of the innate immune system in improving RGC survival and axon regeneration, and its synergy with manipulations of signal transduction pathways, transcription factors, and cell-extrinsic suppressors of axon growth. Research in this field provides hope that clinically effective strategies to improve vision in patients with currently untreatable losses could become a reality in 5-10 years."
"36075976","Comparative roadmaps of reprogramming and oncogenic transformation identify Bcl11b and Atoh8 as broad regulators of cellular plasticity.","Nat Cell Biol","Coordinated changes of cellular plasticity and identity are critical for pluripotent reprogramming and oncogenic transformation. However, the sequences of events that orchestrate these intermingled modifications have never been comparatively dissected. Here, we deconvolute the cellular trajectories of reprogramming (via Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/c-Myc) and transformation (via Ras/c-Myc) at the single-cell resolution and reveal how the two processes intersect before they bifurcate. This approach led us to identify the transcription factor Bcl11b as a broad-range regulator of cell fate changes, as well as a pertinent marker to capture early cellular intermediates that emerge simultaneously during reprogramming and transformation. Multiomics characterization of these intermediates unveiled a c-Myc/Atoh8/Sfrp1 regulatory axis that constrains reprogramming, transformation and transdifferentiation. Mechanistically, we found that Atoh8 restrains cellular plasticity, independent of cellular identity, by binding a specific enhancer network. This study provides insights into the partitioned control of cellular plasticity and identity for both regenerative and cancer biology.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36066650","The heterogeneity of microglial activation and its epigenetic and non-coding RNA regulations in the immunopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.","Cell Mol Life Sci","Microglia are resident immune cells in the brain and play a central role in the development and surveillance of the nervous system. Extensive gliosis is a common pathological feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia. Microglia can respond to multiple inflammatory insults and later transform into different phenotypes, such as pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes, thereby exerting different functions. In recent years, an increasing number of studies based on both traditional bulk sequencing and novel single-cell/nuclear sequencing and multi-omics analysis, have shown that microglial phenotypes are highly heterogeneous and dynamic, depending on the severity and stage of the disease as well as the particular inflammatory milieu. Thus, redirecting microglial activation to beneficial and neuroprotective phenotypes promises to halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. To this end, an increasing number of studies have focused on unraveling heterogeneous microglial phenotypes and their underlying molecular mechanisms, including those due to epigenetic and non-coding RNA modulations. In this review, we summarize the epigenetic mechanisms in the form of DNA and histone modifications, as well as the general non-coding RNA regulations that modulate microglial activation during immunopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases and discuss promising research approaches in the microglial era.© 2022.

"36061149","Human Brain Organoid: A Versatile Tool for Modeling Neurodegeneration Diseases and for Drug Screening.","Stem Cells Int","Clinical trials serve as the fundamental prerequisite for clinical therapy of human disease, which is primarily based on biomedical studies in animal models. Undoubtedly, animal models have made a significant contribution to gaining insight into the developmental and pathophysiological understanding of human diseases. However, none of the existing animal models could efficiently simulate the development of human organs and systems due to a lack of spatial information; the discrepancy in genetic, anatomic, and physiological basis between animals and humans limits detailed investigation. Therefore, the translational efficiency of the research outcomes in clinical applications was significantly weakened, especially for some complex, chronic, and intractable diseases. For example, the clinical trials for human fragile X syndrome (FXS) solely based on animal models have failed such as mGluR5 antagonists. To mimic the development of human organs more faithfully and efficiently translate in vitro biomedical studies to clinical trials, extensive attention to organoids derived from stem cells contributes to a deeper understanding of this research. The organoids are a miniaturized version of an organ generated in vitro, partially recapitulating key features of human organ development. As such, the organoids open a novel avenue for in vitro models of human disease, advantageous over the existing animal models. The invention of organoids has brought an innovative breakthrough in regeneration medicine. The organoid-derived human tissues or organs could potentially function as invaluable platforms for biomedical studies, pathological investigation of human diseases, and drug screening. Importantly, the study of regeneration medicine and the development of therapeutic strategies for human diseases could be conducted in a dish, facilitating in vitro analysis and experimentation. Thus far, the pilot breakthrough has been made in the generation of numerous types of organoids representing different human organs. Most of these human organoids have been employed for in vitro biomedical study and drug screening. However, the efficiency and quality of the organoids in recapitulating the development of human organs have been hindered by engineering and conceptual challenges. The efficiency and quality of the organoids are essential for downstream applications. In this article, we highlight the application in the modeling of human neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as FXS, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), and organoid-based drug screening. Additionally, challenges and weaknesses especially for limits of the brain organoid models in modeling late onset NDDs such as AD and PD., and future perspectives regarding human brain organoids are addressed.Copyright © 2022 Cuili Ma et al."

The association of Ladybird Homeobox 1 (LBX1) polymorphisms with IS has been proven in multiple studies. However, the epigenetic mechanisms have not been evaluated. This study aimed to evaluate theLBX1methylation level in deep paravertebral muscles in order to analyze its association with IS occurrence and/or IS severity. Fifty-seven IS patients and twenty non-IS patients were examined for the paravertebral muscles' methylation level of theLBX1promoter region. There was no significant difference in methylation level within paravertebral muscles between patients vs. controls, except for one CpG site. The comparison of the paravertebral muscles'LBX1promoter region methylation level between patients with a major curve angle of ≤70° vs. &gt;70° revealed significantly higher methylation levels in 17 of 23 analyzed CpG sequences at the convex side of the curvature in patients with a major curve angle of &gt;70° for the reverse strand promoter region. The association betweenLBX1promoter methylation and IS severity was demonstrated. In patients with severe IS, the deep paravertebral muscles show an asymmetricLBX1promoter region methylation level, higher at the convex scoliosis side, which reveals the role of locally acting factors in IS progression."
"36077928","Genome-Wide Identification and Characterization of Circular RNAs during Skeletal Muscle Development in Meat Rabbits.","Animals (Basel)","Skeletal muscle development plays a vital role in muscle quality and yield in meat rabbits. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a new type of single-stranded endogenous non-coding RNAs involved in different biological processes. However, our knowledge of circRNAs regulating skeletal muscle development remains largely unknown in meat rabbits. In this study, we collected the leg muscle tissues of ZIKA rabbits at three key growth stages. By performing whole-transcriptome sequencing, we found the sequential expression of day 0- (D0-), D35-, and D70-selective mRNAs mainly functioned in muscle development, nervous development, and immune response during skeletal muscle development, respectively. Then, a combination of circRNA assembly from a circRNA-seq library and the whole-transcriptome sequencing data identified 6845 credible circRNAs in our samples. Most circRNAs were transcribed from exons of known genes, contained few exons, and showed short length, and these circRNAs were more conserved between rabbits and humans than between rabbits and mice. The upregulated circRNAs, which were synchronously changed with host genes, primarily played roles in MAPK signaling pathways and fatty acid biosynthesis. The prediction of circRNA-microRNA-mRNAs networks revealed that circRNAs might be the regulators that mainly functioned in rabbits' muscle neuron development and metabolic processes. Our work provides a catalog of circRNAs regulating skeletal muscle development at key growth stages in rabbits and might give a new insight into rabbit breeding."
"36140326","DNA Methylation Profiling in Rare Sellar Tumors.","Biomedicines","The histologic diagnosis of sellar masses can be challenging, particularly in rare neoplasms and tumors without definitive biomarkers. Moreover, there is significant inter-observer variability in the histopathological diagnosis of many tumors of the CNS, and some rare tumors risk being misclassified. DNA methylation has recently emerged as a useful diagnostic tool. To illustrate the clinical utility of machine-learning-based DNA methylation classifiers, we report a rare case of primary sellar esthesioneuroblastoma histologically mimicking a non-functioning pituitary adenoma. The patient had multiple recurrences, and the resected specimens had unusual histopathology. A portion of the resected sellar lesion was profiled using clinically validated whole-genome DNA methylation and classification. DNA was extracted from the tissue, hybridized on DNA methylation chips, and analyzed using a clinically validated classifier. DNA methylation profiling of the lesion showed that the tumor classified best with the esthesioneuroblastoma reference cohort. This case highlights the difficulty in diagnosing atypical sellar lesions by standard histopathological methods. However, when phenotypic analyses were nonconclusive, DNA methylation profiling resulted in a change in diagnosis. We discuss the growing role of DNA methylation profiling in the classification and diagnosis of CNS tumors, finding that utilization of DNA methylation studies in cases of atypical presentation or diagnostic uncertainty may improve diagnostic accuracy with therapeutic and prognostic implications."
"36061196","eQTL analysis of laying hens divergently selected for feather pecking identifies KLF14 as a potential key regulator for this behavioral disorder.","Front Genet","Feather pecking in chickens is a damaging behavior, seriously impacting animal welfare and leading to economic losses. Feather pecking is a complex trait, which is partly under genetic control. Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the etiology of feather pecking and notably, several studies have identified similarities between feather pecking and human mental disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and schizophrenia. This study uses transcriptomic and phenotypic data from 167 chickens to map expression quantitative trait loci and to identify regulatory genes with a significant effect on this behavioral disorder using an association weight matrix approach. From 70 of the analyzed differentially expressed genes, 11,790 genome wide significantly associated variants were detected, of which 23 showed multiple associations (≥15). These were located in proximity to a number of genes, which are transcription regulators involved in chromatin binding, nucleic acid metabolism, protein translation and putative regulatory RNAs. The association weight matrix identified 36 genes and the two transcription factors:SP6(synonym:KLF14) andENSGALG00000042129(synonym:CHTOP) as the most significant, with an enrichment of KLF14 binding sites being detectable in 40 differentially expressed genes. This indicates that differential expression between animals showing high and low levels of feather pecking was significantly associated with a genetic variant in proximity toKLF14. This multiallelic variant was located 652 bp downstream ofKLF14and is a deletion of 1-3 bp. We propose that a deletion downstream of the transcription factorKLF14has a negative impact on the level of T cells in the developing brain of high feather pecking chickens, which leads to developmental and behavioral abnormalities. The lack of CD4 T cells and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors are important factors for the increased propensity of laying hens to perform feather pecking. As such,KLF14is a clear candidate regulator for the expression of genes involved in the pathogenic development. By further elucidating the regulatory pathways involved in feather pecking we hope to take significant steps forward in explaining and understanding other mental disorders, not just in chickens.Copyright © 2022 Mott, Mott, Preuß, Bennewitz, Tetens and Falker-Gieske."

"36117919","Further Understanding of Neuro-Immune Interactions in Allergy: Implications in Pathophysiology and Role in Disease Progression.","J Asthma Allergy","The complicated interaction between the central and the autonomic (sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric) nervous systems on the one hand and the immune system and its components, on the other hand, seems to substantially contribute to allergy pathophysiology, uncovering an under-recognized association that could have diagnostic and therapeutic potentials. Neurons connect directly with and regulate the function of many immune cells, including mast cells, the cells that have a leading role in allergic disorders. Proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines, neurotrophins, chemokines, and neuropeptides are released by immune cells, which stimulate sensory neurons. The release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides caused by the activation of these neurons directly impacts the functional activity of immune cells and vice versa, playing a decisive role in this communication. Successful application of Pavlovian conditioning in allergic disorders supports the existence of a psychoneuroimmunological interplay in classical allergic hypersensitivity reactions. Activation of neuronal homeostatic reflexes, like sneezing in allergic rhinitis, coughing in allergic asthma, and vomiting in food allergy, offers additional evidence of a neuroimmunological interaction that aims to maintain homeostasis. Dysregulation of this interaction may cause overstimulation of the immune system that will produce profound symptoms and exaggerated hemodynamic responses that will lead to severe allergic pathophysiological events, including anaphylaxis. In this article, we have systematically reviewed and discussed the evidence regarding the role of the neuro-immune interactions in common allergic clinical modalities like allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic asthma, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, and urticaria. It is essential to understand unknown - to most of the immunology and allergy experts - neurological networks that not only physiologically cooperate with the immune system to regulate homeostasis but also pathogenetically interact with more or less known immunological pathways, contribute to what is known as neuroimmunological inflammation, and shift homeostasis to instability and disease clinical expression. This understanding will provide recognition of new allergic phenotypes/endotypes and directions to focus on specialized treatments, as the era of personalized patient-centered medicine, is hastening apace.© 2022 Konstantinou et al."

However, the mechanism of iHepSC self-renewal has not been elucidated. Active demethylation regulated by Tet1 plays an important role in the self-renewal of stem cells, including pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells. Here, we investigated the role and mechanism of Tet1-regulated demethylation in the self-renewal of iHepSCs.The methylation levels and the expression of Tet1 in iHepSCs and MEFs were analyzed by immunofluorescent staining, quantitative reverse transcription PCR and western blotting. Then, the effects of Tet1 knockdown on the proliferation and self-renewal of iHepSCs were analyzed by CCK8, colony formation, and sphere formation assays. The mechanism by which Tet1 regulates the self-renewal of iHepSCs was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation, bisulfite sequence PCR, and methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease-PCR.The high level of 5hmC and the low level of 5mC in iHepSCs were accompanied by high expression of Tet1. After Tet1 expression was knocked down by shRNA in iHepSCs, the proliferation and self-renewal capacities were inhibited, and the expression of Myc was also decreased. The higher expression level of Myc in iHepSCs maintained its self-renewal and was regulated by Tet1, which directly binds to CBS-1 and site A regions of the Myc promoter and demethylates the CpG cytosine. In addition, CTCF also binds to the CBS-1 and site A regions of the Myc promoter and regulates Myc expression along with TET1.The self-renewal of iHepSCs was maintained by the higher expression of Myc, which was coregulated by TET1 and CTCF. This study may provide new insights into the self-renewal of stem cells, which can promote the research and application of 'reprogrammed' stem cells.© 2022. The Author(s)."

To counter this, we create an improved activation system by coupling the catalytic domain of DNA demethylating enzyme TET1 with transcriptional activators (TETact). We show that TETact demethylation-coupled activation is able to induce transcription of suppressed genes, both individually and simultaneously in cells, and has utility across a number of cell types. Furthermore, we show that TETact can effectively reactivate embryonic haemoglobin genes in non-erythroid cells. We anticipate that TETact will expand the existing CRISPR toolbox and be valuable for functional studies, genetic screens and potential therapeutics.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, most obese subjects reflect the resistance to leptin even with elevated serum leptin. Considering that leptin must cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in several regions to enter the brain parenchyma, altered leptin transport through the BBB might play an important role in leptin resistance and other biological conditions. Here, we report the use of a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BBB model to explore mechanisms that influence leptin transport.iPSCs were differentiated into brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC)-like cells using standard methods. BMEC-like cells were cultured in Transwell filters, treated with ligands from a nuclear receptor agonist library, and assayed for leptin transport using an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay. RNA sequencing was further used to identify differentially regulated genes and pathways. The role of a select hit in leptin transport was tested with the competitive substrate assay and after gene knockdown using CRISPR techniques.Following a screen of 73 compounds, 17β-estradiol was identified as a compound that could significantly increase leptin transport. RNA sequencing revealed many differentially expressed transmembrane transporters after 17β-estradiol treatment. Of these, cationic amino acid transporter-1 (CAT-1, encoded by SLC7A1) was selected for follow-up analyses due to its high and selective expression in BMECs in vivo. Treatment of BMEC-like cells with CAT-1 substrates, as well as knockdown of CAT-1 expression via CRISPR-mediated epigenome editing, yielded significant increases in leptin transport.A major female sex hormone, as well as an amino acid transporter, were revealed as regulators of leptin BBB transport in the iPSC-derived BBB model. Outcomes from this work provide insights into regulation of hormone transport across the BBB.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss has been accepted as the definition of a functional HBV cure. Recent studies found that while covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is the predominant source of HBsAg in hepatitis B e antigen-positive (HBeAg-positive) patients, integrated HBV DNA (iDNA) is the main source in HBeAg-negative patients. Consequently, achieving a functional HBV cure will require not only silencing of cccDNA but also iDNA. Assays that distinguish the source of HBsAg are needed to evaluate emerging therapies. In this issue of the JCI, Grudda et al. developed a PCR-based assay that differentiated the source of HBsAg and explored the contributing sources of HBsAg in patients on nucleos(t)ide analog antivirals.

We aimed to identify a cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related transcriptomic signature, specifically, in peripheral blood tissue, based on differential expression (DE) and differential co-expression (DcoE) analyses. Publicly available blood sample datasets for coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) statuses were integrated to establish a co-expression network. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to construct modules that include genes with highly correlated expression values. The DE criterion is a linear regression with module eigengenes for module-specific genes calculated from principal component analysis and disease status as the dependent and independent variables, respectively. The DcoE criterion is a pairedt-test for intramodular connectivity between disease and matched control statuses. A total of 21 and 23 modules were established from CAD status- and ACS-related datasets, respectively, of which six modules per disease status (i.e., obstructive CAD and ACS) were selected based on the DE and DcoE criteria. For each module, gene-gene interactions with extremely high correlation coefficients were individually selected under the two conditions. Genes displaying a significant change in the number of edges (gene-gene interaction) were selected. A total of 6, 10, and 7 genes in each of the three modules were identified as potential CAD status-related genes, and 14 and 8 genes in each of the two modules were selected as ACS-related genes. Our study identified gene sets and genes that were dysregulated in CVD blood samples. These findings may contribute to the understanding of CVD pathophysiology."

Although several studies have profiled transcription in the developing human brain, there is a gap in understanding of accompanying translational regulation. In this study, we performed ribosome profiling on 73 human prenatal and adult cortex samples. We characterized the translational regulation of annotated open reading frames (ORFs) and identified thousands of previously unknown translation events, including small ORFs that give rise to human-specific and/or brain-specific microproteins, many of which we independently verified using proteomics. Ribosome profiling in stem-cell-derived human neuronal cultures corroborated these findings and revealed that several neuronal activity-induced non-coding RNAs encode previously undescribed microproteins. Physicochemical analysis of brain microproteins identified a class of proteins that contain arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) repeats and, thus, may be regulators of RNA metabolism.

Indeed, the effectiveness and/or impact of the majority of contemporary proteomics screens are hindered not by commonly considered technical limitations such as low proteome coverage but rather by insufficient analyses. Proteomic experimentation requires a careful methodological selection to account for variables from sample collection, through to database searches for peptide identification to standardised post-mass spectrometry options directed analysis workflow, which should be adjusted for each study, from determining when and how to filter proteomic data to choosing holistic versus trend-wise analyses for biologically relevant patterns. Finally, we highlight and discuss the difficulties inherent in the modelling and study of the majority of progressive neurodegenerative conditions. We provide evidence (in the context of neurodegenerative research) for the benefit of undertaking a comparative approach through the application of the above considerations in the alignment of publicly available pre-existing data sets to identify potential novel regulators of neuronal stability."

A comparison of the Fine-Gray model with Cox model.","Front Oncol","To evaluate the oncologic outcomes in patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I ovarian sex cord-stromal tumors (SCSTs) who underwent fertility-sparing surgery (FSS) and the independent risk factors affecting overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS).Data were acquired from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 1973 and 2018. A total of 240 patients diagnosed with stage I ovarian SCSTs were divided into the definitive surgery group (N=116) and FSS group (N=124). The Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox model were used to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of the two groups and assess the independent risk factors respectively. The Fine-Gray model evaluated cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and the independent risk factors that affected CSM.Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no statistically significant differences in OS and CSS between the two groups (P>0.05). Univariate analysis of the Fine-Gray model also showed that there was no difference in the CSS between the two groups (P>0.05). However, from the 15th year postoperatively, the CSS of the FSS group decreased by 13.21% compared with that of the control group and by 17.49% in the 20th and 25th years postoperatively. The Cox proportional hazards model found that surgical methods (""defined surgery"" vs ""FSS""; HR=0.03259, P=0.0196) and FIGO stage (""stage IA"" vs ""stage IC""; HR=0.03073, P=0.0300) were independent risk factors for OS. The multivariate analysis of Fine-Gray model showed that the cancer-specific mortality of patients receiving definitive surgery was 40.1% lower than that of patients receiving FSS (""definitive surgery"" vs ""FSS""; HR=0.599, P=0.005), indicating that FSS might lead to higher tumor-specific mortality and lower CSS. However, age, race, laterality, history, FIGO stage, and tumor size had no significant influence on the tumor-specific mortality (P>0.05).FSS is considered for patients with stage I SCSTs with reproductive needs, but the follow-up period should not be less than 15 years. For patients with stage IC disease, FSS should be selected carefully, and close follow-up is necessary. Perhaps, definitive surgery after birth is a means to improve long-term survival rates.Copyright © 2022 Sun, Zhi and Fan."
"36056446","Researcher perspectives on ethics considerations in epigenetics: an international survey.","Clin Epigenetics","Over the past decade, bioethicists, legal scholars and social scientists have started to investigate the potential implications of epigenetic research and technologies on medicine and society. There is growing literature discussing the most promising opportunities, as well as arising ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI). This paper explores the views of epigenetic researchers about some of these discussions. From January to March 2020, we conducted an online survey of 189 epigenetic researchers working in 31 countries. We questioned them about the scope of their field, opportunities in different areas of specialization, and ELSI in the conduct of research and knowledge translation. We also assessed their level of concern regarding four emerging non-medical applications of epigenetic testing-i.e., in life insurance, forensics, immigration and direct-to-consumer testing. Although there was strong agreement on DNA methylation, histone modifications, 3D structure of chromatin and nucleosomes being integral elements of the field, there was considerable disagreement on transcription factors, RNA interference, RNA splicing and prions. The most prevalent ELSI experienced or witnessed by respondents were in obtaining timely access to epigenetic data in existing databases, and in the communication of epigenetic findings by the media. They expressed high levels of concern regarding non-medical applications of epigenetics, echoing cautionary appraisals in the social sciences and humanities literature.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36117952","Vascular senescence in progeria: role of endothelial dysfunction.","Eur Heart J Open","Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a pre-mature aging disorder caused by the mutation of the LMNA gene leading to an irreversibly farnesylated lamin A protein: progerin. The major causes of death in HGPS are coronary and arterial occlusive disease. In the murine model of HGPS, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) loss is the primary vascular manifestation, which is different from the arterial occlusive disease seen in older patients.To identify the mechanisms of HGPS vascular disease in humans, we differentiated isogenic endothelial cells (ECs) and VSMCs from HGPS-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and control-iPSCs. Both HGPS-ECs and HGPS-VSMCs manifested cellular hallmarks of aging, including dysmorphic nuclei, impaired proliferation, increased β-galactosidase staining, shortened telomeres, up-regulated secretion of inflammatory cytokines, increased DNA damage, loss of heterochromatin, and altered shelterin protein complex (SPC) expression. However, at similar days after differentiation, even with lower levels of progerin, HGPS-ECs manifested more severe signs of senescence, as indicated in part by a higher percentage of β-galactosidase positive cells, shorter telomere length, and more DNA damage signals. We observed increased γH2A.X binding to RAP1 and reduced TRF2 binding to lamin A in HGPS-ECs but not in HGPS-VSMCs. The expression of γH2A.X was greater in HGPS-ECs than in HGPS-VSMCs and is associated with greater telomere shortening, impaired SPC interactions, and loss of heterochromatin.Although progerin expression has a deleterious effect on both ECs and VSMCs, the dysfunction is greater in HGPS-ECs compared with HGPS-VSMCs. This study suggests that an endothelial-targeted therapy may be useful for HGPS patients.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology."

Sleep disorders are very common in neurodegenerative diseases and are a key factor in the quality of life of patients and their families. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an insidious and irreversible neurodegenerative disease. Along with progressive cognitive impairment, sleep disorders and disturbances in circadian rhythms play a key role in the progression of AD. Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are more common in patients with AD than in the general population and can appear early in the course of the disease. Therefore, this review discusses the bidirectional relationships among circadian rhythm disturbances, sleep disorders, and AD.

There is a marked variability in frailty progression between men and women. This study aimed to investigate sex differences in the prevalence and factors associated with frailty in older outpatients with T2DM. This multicentre cross-sectional study included 638 outpatients (aged ≥ 60 years; median age 71 years [interquartile range, 66-77]; male, 55.5%) and was conducted from January 2019 to July 2020. Frailty was assessed using the Fried frailty phenotype. Factors associated with frailty were assessed using a logistic regression analysis. The overall frailty prevalence was 28.2% (men, 26.8%; women, 29.9%; P = 0.388). In the adjusted model, the factors associated with greater odds of being frail were older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.11; P < 0.001) and body mass index (BMI) less than 20 kg/m2(OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.16-3.32; P = 0.012). Higher education (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.98; P = 0.041) and productive work (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.03-0.36; P < 0.001) were protective factors against frailty. Frailty was associated with all four factors in women, but only with older age and productive work in men. Our study found that the prevalence of frailty in older outpatients with T2DM was 28.2%, though not significantly different between men and women. While older age and BMI less than 20 kg/m2can increase the odds of frailty, and higher education and productive work can decrease the odds of frailty in women, only age and productive work were associated with frailty in men with T2DM.© 2022.

To better understand underlying mechanisms, we compared targeted plasma inflammatory protein concentration (n = 92) between a cohort of 192 virally suppressed PLHIV, who were followed-up for five years, and 416 healthy controls (HC). Findings were validated in an independent cohort of 649 virally suppressed PLHIV and 98 HC. Compared to HC, PLHIV exhibited distinctively upregulated inflammatory proteins, including mucosal defense chemokines, CCR5 and CXCR3 ligands, and growth factors. Unsupervised clustering of inflammatory proteins clearly differentiated PLHIV with low (n = 123) and high inflammation (n = 65), the latter having a 3.4 relative risk (95% confidence interval 1.2-9.8) to develop malignancies and trend for cardiovascular events during a 5-year follow-up. The best protein predictors discriminating the two inflammatory endotypes were PD-L1, VEGFA, LAP TGF β-1, and TNFRSF9.

The association between ACE2 and clinical outcomes was analyzed.About 144 COVID-19 patients and 123 healthy controls data were analyzed, the mean age of patients was 62 years and 50% of them were males. The mean age of the control group was 55 years and 63% were males. ACE-II level was measured and compared between COVID-19 patients and controls and revealed no significant differences (P> .05). ACE-II level was measured in COVID-19 patients and compared between different patient's subgroups, ACE II level was not dependent on gender, smoking, ACE intake, or comorbidities (P> .05), and was significantly correlated with cardiovascular diseases (CVS) (P-value = .046) ICU admission (P-value = .0007) and Death (P-value = .0082).There was no significant difference between the COVID-19 and Control group, however, ACE2 serum level was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 who were critically ill or non-survivors, its increased level is also associated with length of stay. Elevated ACE2 level is associated with the severity of COVID-19 disease, and it has the potential to be a predictor of the severity of the disease.© The Author(s) 2022."
"36151395","In vivo CRISPR screens reveal the landscape of immune evasion pathways across cancer.","Nat Immunol","The immune system can eliminate tumors, but checkpoints enable immune escape. Here, we identify immune evasion mechanisms using genome-scale in vivo CRISPR screens across cancer models treated with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). We identify immune evasion genes and important immune inhibitory checkpoints conserved across cancers, including the non-classical major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) molecule Qa-1b/HLA-E. Surprisingly, loss of tumor interferon-γ (IFNγ) signaling sensitizes many models to immunity. The immune inhibitory effects of tumor IFN sensing are mediated through two mechanisms. First, tumor upregulation of classical MHC class I inhibits natural killer cells. Second, IFN-induced expression of Qa-1binhibits CD8+T cells via the NKG2A/CD94 receptor, which is induced by ICB. Finally, we show that strong IFN signatures are associated with poor response to ICB in individuals with renal cell carcinoma or melanoma. This study reveals that IFN-mediated upregulation of classical and non-classical MHC class I inhibitory checkpoints can facilitate immune escape.© 2022. Springer Nature America, Inc."

"36061113","Bored at home?-A systematic review on the effect of environmental enrichment on the welfare of laboratory rats and mice.","Front Vet Sci","Boredom is an emotional state that occurs when an individual has nothing to do, is not interested in the surrounding, and feels dreary and in a monotony. While this condition is usually defined for humans, it may very well describe the lives of many laboratory animals housed in small, barren cages. To make the cages less monotonous, environmental enrichment is often proposed. Although housing in a stimulating environment is still used predominantly as a luxury good and for treatment in preclinical research, enrichment is increasingly recognized to improve animal welfare. To gain insight into how stimulating environments influence the welfare of laboratory rodents, we conducted a systematic review of studies that analyzed the effect of enriched environment on behavioral parameters of animal well-being. Remarkably, a considerable number of these parameters can be associated with symptoms of boredom. Our findings show that a stimulating living environment is essential for the development of natural behavior and animal welfare of laboratory rats and mice alike, regardless of age and sex. Conversely, confinement and under-stimulation has potentially detrimental effects on the mental and physical health of laboratory rodents. We show that boredom in experimental animals is measurable and does not have to be accepted as inevitable.Copyright © 2022 Mieske, Hobbiesiefken, Fischer-Tenhagen, Heinl, Hohlbaum, Kahnau, Meier, Wilzopolski, Butzke, Rudeck, Lewejohann and Diederich."
"36149937","Machine learning for cell type classification from single nucleus RNA sequencing data.","PLoS One","With the advent of single cell/nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq), the field of cell phenotyping is now a data-driven exercise providing statistical evidence to support cell type/state categorization. However, the task of classifying cells into specific, well-defined categories with the empirical data provided by sc/snRNA-seq remains nontrivial due to the difficulty in determining specific differences between related cell types with close transcriptional similarities, resulting in challenges with matching cell types identified in separate experiments. To investigate possible approaches to overcome these obstacles, we explored the use of supervised machine learning methods-logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, neural networks, and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM)-as approaches to classify cell types using snRNA-seq datasets from human brain middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and human kidney. Classification accuracy was evaluated using an F-beta score weighted in favor of precision to account for technical artifacts of gene expression dropout. We examined the impact of hyperparameter optimization and feature selection methods on F-beta score performance. We found that the best performing model for granular cell type classification in both datasets is a multinomial logistic regression classifier and that an effective feature selection step was the most influential factor in optimizing the performance of the machine learning pipelines."
"36142141","An Innovative Approach to Tissue Processing and Cell Sorting of Fixed Cells for Subsequent Single-Cell RNA Sequencing.","Int J Mol Sci","Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is currently the gold standard for the analysis of cell-specific expression profiles, the options for processing, staining, and preserving fresh cells remain very limited. Immediate and correct tissue processing is a critical determinant of scRNA-seq success. One major limitation is the restricted compatibility of fixation approaches, which must not destabilize or alter antibody labeling or RNA content or interfere with cell integrity. An additional limitation is the availability of expensive, high-demand cell-sorting equipment to exclude debris and dead or unwanted cells before proceeding with sample sequencing. The goal of this study was to develop a method that allows cells to be fixed and stored prior to FACS sorting for scRNA-seq without compromising the quality of the results. Finally, the challenge of preserving as many living cells as possible during tissue processing is another crucial issue addressed in this study. Our study focused on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma samples, where the number of live cells is rather limited, as in many other tumor tissues. Harsh tissue dissociation methods and sample preparation for analysis can negatively affect cell viability. Using the murine pancreatic cancer model Pan02, we evaluated the semi-automated mechanical/enzymatic digestion of solid tumors by gentleMACS Dissociator and compared it with mechanical dissociation of the same tissue. Moreover, we investigated a type of cell fixation that is successful in preserving cell RNA integrity yet compatible with FACS and subsequent scRNA-sequencing. Our protocol allows tissue to be dissociated and stained in one day and proceeds to cell sorting and scRNA-seq later, which is a great advantage for processing clinical patient material."

Compared with the matched HC group, ALFF was increased in the right middle temporal gyrus and left pallidum in the older TRD group, whereas no significant differences were found in the younger TRD group. In addition, ALFF values in the left middle frontal gyrus in the younger TRD group and in the right middle temporal gyrus in the older TRD were both positively correlated with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score.Different neuropathological mechanisms may exist in TRD patients of different ages, especially in the left middle frontal gyrus and left caudate nucleus.

Neurodegenerative disorders are typically characterized by inclusions of misfolded proteins and since lysosomes are an important site for cellular debris clearance, lysosomal dysfunction has been closely linked to neurodegeneration. Consequently, many causal mutations or genetic risk variants implicated in neurodegenerative diseases encode proteins involved in endosomal-lysosomal function. As an integral lysosomal transmembrane protein, TMEM106B regulates several aspects of lysosomal function and multiple studies have shown that proper TMEM106B protein levels are crucial for maintaining lysosomal health. Yet, the precise function of TMEM106B at the lysosomal membrane is undetermined and it remains unclear how TMEM106B modulates disease risk. Unexpectedly, several independent groups recently showed that the C-terminal domain (AA120-254) of TMEM106B forms amyloid fibrils in the brain of patients with a diverse set of neurodegenerative conditions. The recognition that TMEM106B can form amyloid fibrils and is present across neurodegenerative diseases sheds new light on TMEM106B as a central player in neurodegeneration and brain health, but also raises important new questions. In this review, we summarize current knowledge and place a decade's worth of TMEM106B research into an exciting new perspective.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The repertoire of AR interactions at enhancers is dependent on tissue and cellular contexts and thus shape a spectrum of phenotypes through such epigenetic heterogeneity. Moreover, PCa is a multifocal disease and displays a high degree of intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity, adding to the phenotypic complexity. It is increasingly becoming clear that PCa may be considered an epigenetic disease caused by various molecular causes with profound consequences and clinical implications which are underpinned by enhancer interaction heterogeneity.In this review, we provide a detailed overview of molecular interactors that affect prostate cancer epigenetic heterogeneity, such as coding and non-coding somatic variants, large scale structural variations, pioneer factor binding at enhancers and various contexts that influence enhancer engagement heterogeneity in PCa development and progression. Finally, we explore how the vast heterogeneity in epigenetic profiles identified in recent omics studies results in distinct genomic subtypes which predict disease progression and thus offer opportunities in biomarker discovery and further personalizing cancer treatment. As such, heterogeneous enhancer interactions take center stage in elucidating mechanisms of prostate cancer progression, patient prognostication, therapy discovery and overcoming acquired treatment resistance.© 2022.

In the present study we applied Whole Genome DNA Sequencing (WGS) to a group of morphologically normal tissue (n = 51), including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and non-BPH samples, from men with and men without prostate cancer. We assess whether the observed genetic changes in morphologically normal tissue are linked to the development of cancer in the prostate.Single nucleotide variants (P = 7.0 × 10-03, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and small insertions and deletions (indels, P = 8.7 × 10-06) were significantly higher in morphologically normal samples, including BPH, from men with prostate cancer compared to those without. The presence of subclonal expansions under selective pressure, supported by a high level of mutations, were significantly associated with samples from men with prostate cancer (P = 0.035, Fisher exact test). The clonal cell fraction of normal clones was always higher than the proportion of the prostate estimated as epithelial (P = 5.94 × 10-05, paired Wilcoxon signed rank test) which, along with analysis of primary fibroblasts prepared from BPH specimens, suggests a stromal origin. Constructed phylogenies revealed lineages associated with benign tissue that were completely distinct from adjacent tumour clones, but a common lineage between BPH and non-BPH morphologically normal tissues was often observed. Compared to tumours, normal samples have significantly less single nucleotide variants (P = 3.72 × 10-09, paired Wilcoxon signed rank test), have very few rearrangements and a complete lack of copy number alterations.Cells within regions of morphologically normal tissue (both BPH and non-BPH) can expand under selective pressure by mechanisms that are distinct from those occurring in adjacent cancer, but that are allied to the presence of cancer. Expansions, which are probably stromal in origin, are characterised by lack of recurrent driver mutations, by almost complete absence of structural variants/copy number alterations, and mutational processes similar to malignant tissue. Our findings have implications for treatment (focal therapy) and early detection approaches.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We performed multi-omics approaches on FNH and paired normal liver tissues from 22 patients, followed by multi-level bioinformatic analyses and experimental validations. Generally, FNH had low mutation burden with low variant allele frequencies, and the mutation frequency significantly correlated with proliferation rate. Although no recurrently deleterious genomic events were found, some putative tumor suppressors or oncogenes were involved. Mutational signatures indicated potential impaired mismatch function and possible poison contact. Integrated analyses unveiled a group of FNH specific endothelial cells that uniquely expressed SOST and probably had strong interaction with fibroblasts through PDGFB/PDGFRB pathway to promote fibrosis. Notably, in one atypical FNH (patient No.11) with pronounced copy number variations, we observed a unique immune module.

Tumor microenvironment has been proven to be highly involved in tumor progression and prognosis. However, how m7G-associated genes affect the tumor microenvironment of patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains to be further clarified.Methods:The genetic alterations of m7G-associated genes and their associations with the prognosis and tumor microenvironment in LUAD patients were systemically analyzed. An m7G-Riskscore was established and analyzed for its performance in disease prognosis and association with patient response to immunotherapy. Expression of the model genes at the protein level was investigated throughex vivoexperiments. A nomogram was finally obtained based on the m7G-Riskscore and several significant clinical pathological features.Results:m7G-Associated genes were obtained from five LUAD datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases, and their expression pattern was determined. Based on the m7G-associated genes, three LUAD clusters were defined. The differentially expressed genes from the three clusters were screened and used to further divide the LUAD patients into two gene clusters. It was demonstrated that the alterations of m7G-associated genes were associated with the clinical pathological features, prognosis, and tumor immune infiltration in LUAD patients. An m7G-Riskscore including CAND1, RRM2, and SLC2A1 was obtained with robust and accurate prognostic performance. WB and cell immunofluorescence also showed significant dysregulation of CAND1, RRM2, and SLC2A1 in LUAD. In addition, a nomogram was established to improve the clinical feasibility of the m7G-Riskscore. Correlation analysis revealed that patients with a lower m7G-Riskscore had higher immune and stromal scores, responded well to chemotherapeutics and multiple targeted drugs, and survived longer. Patients with a higher m7G-Riskscore tended to suffer from a higher tumor mutation burden. Furthermore, the m7G-Riskscore exhibited significant associations with immune cell infiltration and cancer stemness.Conclusion:This study systemically analyzed m7G-associated genes and identified their potential role in tumor microenvironment and prognosis in patients with LUAD. The findings of the present study may help better understand LUAD from the m7G perspective and also provide a new thought toward the prognosis and treatment of LUAD.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Zhao, Li, Li, Zheng, Xu and Hong."
"36081905","Non-neutral clonal selection and its potential role in mammalian germline stem cell dysfunction with advancing age.","Front Cell Dev Biol","The concept of natural selection, or ""survival of the fittest"", refers to an evolutionary process in nature whereby traits emerge in individuals of a population through random gene alterations that enable those individuals to better adapt to changing environmental conditions. This genetic variance allows certain members of the population to gain an advantage over others in the same population to survive and reproduce in greater numbers under new environmental pressures, with the perpetuation of those advantageous traits in future progeny. Here we present that the behavior of adult stem cells in a tissue over time can, in many respects, be viewed in the same manner as evolution, with each stem cell clone being representative of an individual within a population. As stem cells divide or are subjected to cumulative oxidative damage over the lifespan of the organism, random genetic alterations are introduced into each clone that create variance in the population. These changes may occur in parallel to, or in response to, aging-associated changes in microenvironmental cues perceived by the stem cell population. While many of these alterations will be neutral or silent in terms of affecting cell function, a small fraction of these changes will enable certain clones to respond differently to shifts in microenvironmental conditions that arise with advancing age. In some cases, the same advantageous genetic changes that support survival and expansion of certain clones over others in the population (viz. non-neutral competition) could be detrimental to the downstream function of the differentiated stem cell descendants. In the context of the germline, such a situation would be devastating to successful propagation of the species across generations. However, even within a single generation, the ""evolution"" of stem cell lineages in the body over time can manifest into aging-related organ dysfunction and failure, as well as lead to chronic inflammation, hyperplasia, and cancer. Increased research efforts to evaluate stem cells within a population as individual entities will improve our understanding of how organisms age and how certain diseases develop, which in turn may open new opportunities for clinical detection and management of diverse pathologies.Copyright © 2022 Stolzenbach, Woods and Tilly."
"36077101","Targeted Mitochondrial Epigenetics: A New Direction in Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.","Int J Mol Sci","Mitochondrial epigenetic alterations are closely related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is described in this review. Reports of the alteration of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation in AD demonstrate that the disruption of the dynamic balance of mtDNA methylation and demethylation leads to damage to the mitochondrial electron transport chain and the obstruction of mitochondrial biogenesis, which is the most studied mitochondrial epigenetic change. Mitochondrial noncoding RNA modifications and the post-translational modification of mitochondrial nucleoproteins have been observed in neurodegenerative diseases and related diseases that increase the risk of AD. Although there are still relatively few mitochondrial noncoding RNA modifications and mitochondrial nuclear protein post-translational modifications reported in AD, we have reason to believe that these mitochondrial epigenetic modifications also play an important role in the AD process. This review provides a new research direction for the AD mechanism, starting from mitochondrial epigenetics. Further, this review summarizes therapeutic approaches to targeted mitochondrial epigenetics, which is the first systematic summary of therapeutic approaches in the field, including folic acid supplementation, mitochondrial-targeting antioxidants, and targeted ubiquitin-specific proteases, providing a reference for therapeutic targets for AD."

Perturbations of these states can lead to a variety of diseases through mechanisms that we are now beginning to understand. We define protein condensation diseases as conditions caused by the disruption of the normal behaviour of the condensed states of proteins. We analyze the problem of the identification of targets for pharmacological interventions for these diseases and explore opportunities for the regulation of the formation and organisation of aberrant condensed states of proteins.© 2022.

Several systematic reviews have investigated the possible determinants linked to ART, but results obtained have not been conclusive. The study aims to investigate whether the incidence of MZT differed among ART centers.This is a multicenter retrospective cohort study using the Italian ART National Registry database and involving the centers reporting data from individual ART cycles from 2015 to 2019. To investigate the incidence of MZT, only single embryo transfer cycles were considered. Women who had sex-discordant deliveries were excluded. MZT rate was calculated as the number of multiple pregnancies (more than one gestational sac at first ultrasound) out of the total number of clinical pregnancies. A binomial distribution model was used to determine the 95% CI of the frequency of MZT.Eighteen centers were included, and they provided data on 10,433 pregnancies. The total number of MZT was 162, corresponding to an incidence of 1.5% (95% CI: 1.3-1.8%). The rate of MZT among centers varied between 0% (95% CI: 0.0-25.9%) and 3.2% (95% CI: 1.3-8.1%). All the 95% CIs included 1.5%, rejecting the hypothesis that the MZT rate may significantly differ among centers.The rate of MZT did not significantly vary among ART centers. Local factors are unlikely to explain the increased rate of MZT in ART pregnancies.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"36097044","Semibulk RNA-seq analysis as a convenient method for measuring gene expression statuses in a local cellular environment.","Sci Rep","When biologically interpretation of the data obtained from the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis is attempted, additional information on the location of the single cells, behavior of the surrounding cells, and the microenvironment they generate, would be very important. We developed an inexpensive, high throughput application while preserving spatial organization, named ""semibulk RNA-seq"" (sbRNA-seq). We utilized a microfluidic device specifically designed for the experiments to encapsulate both a barcoded bead and a cell aggregate (a semibulk) into a single droplet. Using sbRNA-seq, we firstly analyzed mouse kidney specimens. In the mouse model, we could associate the pathological information with the gene expression information. We validated the results using spatial transcriptome analysis and found them highly consistent. When we applied the sbRNA-seq analysis to the human breast cancer specimens, we identified spatial interactions between a particular population of immune cells and that of cancer-associated fibroblast cells, which were not precisely represented solely by the single-cell analysis. Semibulk analysis may provide a convenient and versatile method, compared to a standard spatial transcriptome sequencing platform, to associate spatial information with transcriptome information.© 2022.

"36069787","Epigenetic remodeling by vitamin C potentiates plasma cell differentiation.","Elife","Ascorbate (vitamin C) is an essential micronutrient in humans. The severe chronic deficiency of ascorbate, termed scurvy, has long been associated with increased susceptibility to infections. How ascorbate affects the immune system at the cellular and molecular levels remained unclear. From a micronutrient analysis, we identified ascorbate as a potent enhancer for antibody response by facilitating the IL-21/STAT3-dependent plasma cell differentiation in mouse and human B cells. The effect of ascorbate is unique as other antioxidants failed to promote plasma cell differentiation. Ascorbate is especially critical during early B cell activation by poising the cells to plasma cell lineage without affecting the proximal IL-21/STAT3 signaling and the overall transcriptome. As a cofactor for epigenetic enzymes, ascorbate facilitates TET2/3-mediated DNA modification and demethylation of multiple elements at thePrdm1locus. DNA demethylation augments STAT3 association at thePrdm1promoter and a downstream enhancer, thus ensuring efficient gene expression and plasma cell differentiation. The results suggest that an adequate level of ascorbate is required for antibody response and highlight how micronutrients may regulate the activity of epigenetic enzymes to regulate gene expression. Our findings imply that epigenetic enzymes can function as sensors to gauge the availability of metabolites and influence cell fate decisions.© 2022, Chen, Almonte-Loya et al."
"36092733","It takes two to tango: Widening our understanding of the onset of schizophrenia from a neuro-angiogenic perspective.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Schizophrenia is a chronic debilitating mental disorder characterized by perturbations in thinking, perception, and behavior, along with brain connectivity deficiencies, neurotransmitter dysfunctions, and loss of gray brain matter. To date, schizophrenia has no cure and pharmacological treatments are only partially efficacious, with about 30% of patients describing little to no improvement after treatment. As in most neurological disorders, the main descriptions of schizophrenia physiopathology have been focused on neural network deficiencies. However, to sustain proper neural activity in the brain, another, no less important network is operating: the vast, complex and fascinating vascular network. Increasing research has characterized schizophrenia as a systemic disease where vascular involvement is important. Several neuro-angiogenic pathway disturbances have been related to schizophrenia. Alterations, ranging from genetic polymorphisms, mRNA, and protein alterations to microRNA and abnormal metabolite processing, have been evaluated in plasma, post-mortem brain, animal models, and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models. During embryonic brain development, the coordinated formation of blood vessels parallels neuro/gliogenesis and results in the structuration of the neurovascular niche, which brings together physical and molecular signals from both systems conforming to the Blood-Brain barrier. In this review, we offer an upfront perspective on distinctive angiogenic and neurogenic signaling pathways that might be involved in the biological causality of schizophrenia. We analyze the role of pivotal angiogenic-related pathways such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and HIF signaling related to hypoxia and oxidative stress events; classic developmental pathways such as the NOTCH pathway, metabolic pathways such as the mTOR/AKT cascade; emerging neuroinflammation, and neurodegenerative processes such as UPR, and also discuss non-canonic angiogenic/axonal guidance factor signaling. Considering that all of the mentioned above pathways converge at the Blood-Brain barrier, reported neurovascular alterations could have deleterious repercussions on overall brain functioning in schizophrenia.Copyright © 2022 Casas, Arancibia-Altamirano, Acevedo-La Rosa, Garrido-Jara, Maksaev, Pérez-Monje and Palma."

Pending formal cardiovascular outcome trials, we applied two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) to investigate the impact of GK activation on risk of cardiovascular diseases.We used independent genetic variants in or around the glucokinase gene meanwhile associated with HbA1cat genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8) in the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium study (N = 146,806; European ancestry) as instrumental variables (IVs) to mimic the effects of GK activation. We assessed the association between genetically proxied GK activation and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD; 122,733 cases and 424,528 controls), peripheral arterial disease (PAD; 7098 cases and 206,541 controls), stroke (40,585 cases and 406,111 controls) and heart failure (HF; 47,309 cases and 930,014 controls), using genome-wide association study summary statistics of these outcomes in Europeans. We compared the effect estimates of genetically proxied GK activation with estimates of genetically proxied lower HbA1con the same outcomes. We repeated our MR analyses in East Asians as validation.Genetically proxied GK activation was associated with reduced risk of CAD (OR 0.38 per 1% lower HbA1c, 95% CI 0.29-0.51, P = 8.77 × 10-11) and HF (OR 0.54 per 1% lower HbA1c, 95% CI 0.41-0.73, P = 3.55 × 10-5). The genetically proxied protective effects of GKA on CAD and HF exceeded those due to non-targeted HbA1clowering. There was no causal relationship between genetically proxied GK activation and risk of PAD or stroke. The estimates in sensitivity analyses and in East Asians were generally consistent.GKAs may protect against CAD and HF which needs confirmation by long-term clinical trials.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Despite the functional relevance of protein-coding regions, rare variants located here are less likely to completely explain the considerable numbers of acutely affected COVID-19 patients worldwide. Using an exome-wide association approach, with individuals of European descent, we sought to identify common coding variants linked with variation in COVID-19 severity. Herein,cohort 1compared non-hospitalized (controls) and hospitalized (cases) individuals, and incohort 2, hospitalized subjects requiring respiratory support (cases) were compared to those not requiring it (controls). 229 and 111 variants differed significantly between cases and controls incohorts 1and2, respectively. This includedFBXO34,CNTN2,andTMCC2previously linked with COVID-19 severity using association studies. Overall, we report SNPs in 26 known and 12 novel candidate genes with strong molecular evidence implicating them in the pathophysiology of life-threatening COVID-19 and post-recovery sequelae. Of these few notable known genes include,HLA-DQB1, AHSG, ALOX5AP, MUC5AC, SMPD1,SPG7, SPEG,GAS6,andSERPINA12.

"36131240","Predicting nicotine metabolism across ancestries using genotypes.","BMC Genomics","There is a need to match characteristics of tobacco users with cessation treatments and risks of tobacco attributable diseases such as lung cancer. The rate in which the body metabolizes nicotine has proven an important predictor of these outcomes. Nicotine metabolism is primarily catalyzed by the enzyme cytochrone P450 (CYP2A6) and CYP2A6 activity can be measured as the ratio of two nicotine metabolites: trans-3'-hydroxycotinine to cotinine (NMR). Measurements of these metabolites are only possible in current tobacco users and vary by biofluid source, timing of collection, and protocols; unfortunately, this has limited their use in clinical practice. The NMR depends highly on genetic variation near CYP2A6 on chromosome 19 as well as ancestry, environmental, and other genetic factors. Thus, we aimed to develop prediction models of nicotine metabolism using genotypes and basic individual characteristics (age, gender, height, and weight).We identified four multiethnic studies with nicotine metabolites and DNA samples. We constructed a 263 marker panel from filtering genome-wide association scans of the NMR in each study. We then applied seven machine learning techniques to train models of nicotine metabolism on the largest and most ancestrally diverse dataset (N=2239). The models were then validated using the other three studies (total N=1415). Using cross-validation, we found the correlations between the observed and predicted NMR ranged from 0.69 to 0.97 depending on the model. When predictions were averaged in an ensemble model, the correlation was 0.81. The ensemble model generalizes well in the validation studies across ancestries, despite differences in the measurements of NMR between studies, with correlations of: 0.52 for African ancestry, 0.61 for Asian ancestry, and 0.46 for European ancestry. The most influential predictors of NMR identified in more than two models were rs56113850, rs11878604, and 21 other genetic variants near CYP2A6 as well as age and ancestry.We have developed an ensemble of seven models for predicting the NMR across ancestries from genotypes and age, gender and BMI. These models were validated using three datasets and associate with nicotine dosages. The knowledge of how an individual metabolizes nicotine could be used to help select the optimal path to reducing or quitting tobacco use, as well as, evaluating risks of tobacco use.© 2022.

Association studies have proposed that rs2853677, a SNP localizing at intron region of TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), is significantly associated with TERT expression, telomere length and eventually lung cancer risk. However, functional genomics work indicates that rs2853677 is not with the ability to alter gene expression. All these facts make us hypothesize that some other genetic variation(s) are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs2853677 and influence TERT expression.LD pattern in rs2853677 nearby region was analyzed based on 1000 genomes data for three representative populations in the world and functional genomics research was performed for this locus.Only one SNP, rs2736099, is in strong LD with rs2853677 in East Asian. Dual-luciferase reporter assay verifies that rs2736099 can regulate gene expression and should be the causal SNP for this disease. Through chromosome conformation capture assay, it is disclosed that the enhancer surrounding rs2736099 can interact with TERT promoter. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation, the transcription factor SP1 (Sp1 transcription factor) is recognized for the chromatin segment spanning rs2736099.Our results provide the missing piece between genetic variation at this locus and lung cancer risk, which is also applied to tumorigenesis in other tissues and cell proliferation.© 2022.

Current research indicates that there are common features between AD and glaucoma in terms of epidemiology and pathophysiology. However, the understandings and explanations of their comorbidity and potential genetic overlaps are still limited and insufficient.Genetic pleiotropy analysis was performed using large genome-wide association studies summary statistics of AD and glaucoma, with an independent cohort of glaucoma for replication. Conditional and conjunctional false discovery rate methods were applied to identify the shared loci. Biological function and network analysis, as well as the expression level analysis were performed to investigate the significance of the shared genes.A significant positive genetic correlation between AD and glaucoma was identified, indicating that there were significant polygenetic overlaps. Forty-nine shared loci were identified and mapped to 11 shared protein-coding genes. Functional genomic analyses of the shared genes indicate their modulation of critical physiological processes in human cells, including those occurring in the mitochondria, nucleus, and cellular membranes. Most of the shared genes indicated a potential modulation of metabolic processes in human cells and tissues. Furthermore, human protein-protein interaction network analyses revealed that some of the shared genes, especiallyMTCH2,NDUFS3, andPTPMT1, as well asSPI1andMYBPC3, may function concordantly. The modulation of their expressions may be related to metabolic dysfunction and pathogenic processes.Our study identified a shared genetic architecture between AD and glaucoma, which may explain their shared features in epidemiology and pathophysiology. The potential involvement of these shared genes in molecular and cellular processes reflects the ""inter-organ crosstalk"" between AD and glaucoma. These results may serve as a genetic basis for the development of innovative and effective therapeutics for AD, glaucoma, and other neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2022 Zheng, Liu, Zhang, Hu, Shang, Zhu, Huang, Wu, Xiao, Du, Liang, Chen, Zang, Hu, He, Zhang and Yu."

The corresponding data for ischemic stroke (34,217 cases and 406,111 controls), large artery stroke (4,373 cases and 406,111 controls), cardioembolic stroke (7,193 cases and 406,111 controls), small vessel stroke (5,386 cases and 192,662 controls), coronary heart disease (122,733 cases and 424,528 controls), and myocardial infarction (43,676 cases and 128,199 controls) were obtained from the MR-Base platform. In the primary MR analyses, we applied the inverse variance weighted method to evaluate the associations. We performed a sensitivity analysis using weighted median, MR-Egger, weighted mode, simple mode, Mendelian Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO), and leave-one-out methods.Results:In the primary MR analyses, we found no causal association of genetically predicted AD with ischemic stroke [odds ratio (OR) = 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.95-1.06], large artery stroke (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.88-1.17), cardioembolic stroke (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.94-1.18), small vessel stroke (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.94-1.17), coronary heart disease (OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.94-1.05), and myocardial infarction (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.98-1.09). The results from the primary MR analyses were supported in sensitivity analyses using the weighted median, weighted mode, simple mode, and MR-Egger methods and multivariable MR analyses adjusting for asthma and several traditional risk factors for ischemic stroke and coronary heart disease. MR-Egger intercepts provided no evidence of directional pleiotropy. The MR-PRESSO and leave-one-out analyses did not indicate any outlier instruments.Conclusion:Our MR study does not support a causal association of genetically predicted AD with ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, cardioembolic stroke, small vessel stroke, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction.Copyright © 2022 Huang, Gui, Wu and Xie."

First, we present an overview of possible misspecifications that come with GWAS summary statistics. Then, in both simulations and real-data analyses, we show that additional information such as imputation INFO scores, allele frequencies, and per-variant sample sizes in GWAS summary statistics can be used to detect possible issues and correct for misspecifications in the GWAS summary statistics. One important motivation for us is to improve the predictive performance of polygenic scores built from these summary statistics. Unfortunately, owing to the lack of reporting standards for GWAS summary statistics, this additional information is not systematically reported. We also show that using well-matched linkage disequilibrium (LD) references can improve model fit and translate into more accurate prediction. Finally, we discuss how to make polygenic score methods such as lassosum and LDpred2 more robust to these misspecifications to improve their predictive power.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36091764","Examination on the risk factors of cholangiocarcinoma: A Mendelian randomization study.","Front Pharmacol","Background:Several risk factors have been identified for CCA, however, whether such associations were causal remains unknown.Methods:Mendelian randomization (MR) has been applied to examine the causal relationship between 26 putative risk factors and CCA. The genetic variants for each risk factor were extracted from their corresponding genome-wide association study (GWAS) if they reached the genome-wide significance (p-value < 5 × 10-8). The genetic associations with CCA were obtained from the publicly available GWAS with the largest sample size. Mainly, inverse-variance weighted (IVW) has been adopted to estimate the causal effect on CCA. Both multivariable and mediation MR analyses were carried out to detect independent factors.Results:Three putative risk factors can causally elevate the risk of CCA after FDR correction, including liver fat content (LFC), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cholelithiasis. The odds of CCA would increase per 1-SD increase in the liver fat content (LFC) (OR = 2.12 [1.66, 2.71]) and logOR of NAFLD. The genetic liability to cholelithiasis would increase the risk of CCA as well (OR = 2.17 [1.47, 3.20]). They were still significant in other methods. The multivariable MR analysis indicated that genetically-elevated LFC should increase the risk of CCA independently of cholelithiasis (OR = 1.88 [1.39, 2.55]). In the mediation MR analysis, the indirect effect was not significant when treating cholelithiasis as the mediator (indirect OR = 0.95 [0.85, 1.07]).Conclusion:This MR study identified that gallstone and liver fat accumulation are two independent risk factors of CCA, suggesting two modifiable ways of preventing CCA.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Fan, Sun, Qiu, Mu, Chai, Cao, Wang and Lv."

"36120601","Possible Involvement of DNA Methylation in TSC1 Gene Expression in Neuroprotection Induced by Hypoxic Preconditioning.","Oxid Med Cell Longev","It has been reported that ischemia and ischemic preconditioning (IPC) have different effects on the expression of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), which may contribute to the tolerance to ischemia/hypoxia with the increase of autophagy. The mechanisms of TSC1 differential expression are still unclear under ischemia/IPC conditions in hippocampal Cornu Ammon 1 (CA1) and Cornu Ammon 3 (CA3) area neuronal cells. While we have shown that 5-Aza-CdR, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, can upregulate TSC1 and increase hypoxic tolerance by autophagy in vivo and in vitro, in this study, we examined whether DNA methylation was involved in the differential expression of TSC1 in the CA1 and CA3 regions induced by hypoxic preconditioning (HPC).Level of rapamycin (mTOR) autophagy, a downstream molecular pathway of TSC1/TSC2 complex, was detected in HPC mouse hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas as well as in the HPC model of mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. DNA methylation level of TSC1 promoter (-720 bp~ -360 bp) was determined in CA1 and CA3 areas by bisulfite-modified DNA sequencing (BMDS). At the same time, autophagy was detected in HT22 cells transfected with GFP-LC3 plasmid. The role of TSC1 in neuroprotection was measured by cell viability and apoptosis, and the role of TSC1 in metabolism was checked by ATP assay and ROS assay in HT22 cells that overexpressed/knocked down TSC1.HPC upregulated the expression of TSC1, downregulated the level of P-mTOR (Ser2448) and P-p70S6K (Thr389), and enhanced the activity of autophagy in both in vivo and in vitro. The increased expression of TSC1 in HPC may depend on its DNA hypomethylation in the promoter region in vivo. HPC also could reduce energy consumption in HT22 cells. Overexpression and knockdown of TSC1 can affect cell viability, cell apoptosis, and metabolism in HT22 cells exposed to hypoxia.TSC1 expression induced by HPC may relate to the downregulation of its DNA methylation level with the increase of autophagy and the decrease of energy demand.Copyright © 2022 Ruifang Qi et al."

Currently, there exists no effective method for the early diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In this analysis, we incorporated multiple GEO datasets containing RNA profiles of hypertrophic cardiomyopathic patient tissues, identified 642 differentially expressed genes, and performed GO and KEGG analyses. Furthermore, we narrowed down 46 characteristic genes from these differentially expressed genes using random decision forests and conducted transcription factor regulation analysis on them. Using 40 genes that showed overlap between the training set and the verification set, the artificial neural network was trained, and the final MPS scoring model was constructed, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn. We used the MPS model to predict the verification dataset and drew the ROC curve, which demonstrated the good prediction performance of the model.

Multivariate Cox regression was used to assess whether cell-morphometrics prognosis score (CMPS) and our previously reported 12-gene expression prognosis score (GEPS) and 15-microbe abundance prognosis score (MAPS) were independent prognostic factors. iCEMIGE was built upon the sparse representation learning technique. The iCEMIGE scoring model performance was measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve compared to CMPS, GEPS, or MAPS alone. Nomogram models were created to predict overall survival (OS) and progress-free survival (PFS) rates at 5- and 10-year in the TCGA-BRCA cohort.We identified 39 CMBs that were used to create a CMPS system in BCs. CMPS, GEPS, and MAPS were found to be significantly independently associated with OS. We then established an iCEMIGE scoring system for risk stratification of BC patients. The iGEMIGE score has a significant prognostic value for OS and PFS independent of clinical factors (age, stage, and estrogen and progesterone receptor status) and PAM50-based molecular subtype. Importantly, the iCEMIGE score significantly increased the power to predict OS and PFS compared to CMPS, GEPS, or MAPS alone.Our study demonstrates a novel and generic artificial intelligence framework for multimodal data integration toward improving prognosis risk stratification of BC patients, which can be extended to other types of cancer.©The Author(s) 2022.

"36119479","Applying artificial intelligence technology to assist with breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis prediction.","Front Oncol","Breast cancer remains the most diagnosed cancer in women. Advances in medical imaging modalities and technologies have greatly aided in the early detection of breast cancer and the decline of patient mortality rates. However, reading and interpreting breast images remains difficult due to the high heterogeneity of breast tumors and fibro-glandular tissue, which results in lower cancer detection sensitivity and specificity and large inter-reader variability. In order to help overcome these clinical challenges, researchers have made great efforts to develop computer-aided detection and/or diagnosis (CAD) schemes of breast images to provide radiologists with decision-making support tools. Recent rapid advances in high throughput data analysis methods and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly radiomics and deep learning techniques, have led to an exponential increase in the development of new AI-based models of breast images that cover a broad range of application topics. In this review paper, we focus on reviewing recent advances in better understanding the association between radiomics features and tumor microenvironment and the progress in developing new AI-based quantitative image feature analysis models in three realms of breast cancer: predicting breast cancer risk, the likelihood of tumor malignancy, and tumor response to treatment. The outlook and three major challenges of applying new AI-based models of breast images to clinical practice are also discussed. Through this review we conclude that although developing new AI-based models of breast images has achieved significant progress and promising results, several obstacles to applying these new AI-based models to clinical practice remain. Therefore, more research effort is needed in future studies.Copyright © 2022 Jones, Islam, Faiz, Chen and Zheng."

To conduct co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis of countries, institutions, authors, references, and keywords in this field, VOSviewer (version 1.6.18), CiteSpace (version 5.8.R3), Microsoft Excel 2019, R 4.2, an online bibliometric platform (http://bibliometric.com/) and an online browser plugin (https://www.altmetric.com/) were used.A total of 918 papers were included, with 23,490 citations. 5,979 authors, 39,962 co-cited authors, and 42,992 co-cited papers were identified in the study. Most publications were from China (317). In terms of the H-index (45) and citations (9925), the United States topped the list. The journal ""New England Journal of Medicine"" of Medicine, General & Internal (IF = 91.25) published the most studies on this topic. The University of Amsterdam had the largest number of publications among all institutions. The past 22 years of research can be broadly divided into two periods. The 2000 to 2016 research period focused on the classification, identification and comparison of esophageal cancer. Recently (2017-2022), the application of artificial intelligence lies in endoscopy, diagnosis, and precision therapy, which have become the frontiers of this field. It is expected that closely esophageal cancer clinical measures based on big data analysis and related to precision will become the research hotspot in the future.An increasing number of scholars are devoted to artificial intelligence-related esophageal cancer research. The research field of artificial intelligence in esophageal cancer has entered a new stage. In the future, there is a need to continue to strengthen cooperation between countries and institutions. Improving the diagnostic accuracy of esophageal imaging, big data-based treatment and prognosis prediction through deep learning technology will be the continuing focus of research. The application of AI in esophageal cancer still has many challenges to overcome before it can be utilized.Copyright © 2022 Tu, Lin, Ye, Yang, Deng, Zhu, Wu and Zhang."

"36104784","Epigenetic machinery is functionally conserved in cephalopods.","BMC Biol","Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are divergent across the animal kingdom, yet these mechanisms are not well studied in non-model organisms. Unique features of cephalopods make them attractive for investigating behavioral, sensory, developmental, and regenerative processes, and recent studies have elucidated novel features of genome organization and gene and transposon regulation in these animals. However, it is not known how epigenetics regulates these interesting cephalopod features. We combined bioinformatic and molecular analysis of Octopus bimaculoides to investigate the presence and pattern of DNA methylation and examined the presence of DNA methylation and 3 histone post-translational modifications across tissues of three cephalopod species.We report a dynamic expression profile of the genes encoding conserved epigenetic regulators, including DNA methylation maintenance factors in octopus tissues. Levels of 5-methyl-cytosine in multiple tissues of octopus, squid, and bobtail squid were lower compared to vertebrates. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing of two regions of the brain and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing from a hatchling of O. bimaculoides revealed that less than 10% of CpGs are methylated in all samples, with a distinct pattern of 5-methyl-cytosine genome distribution characterized by enrichment in the bodies of a subset of 14,000 genes and absence from transposons. Hypermethylated genes have distinct functions and, strikingly, many showed similar expression levels across tissues while hypomethylated genes were silenced or expressed at low levels. Histone marks H3K27me3, H3K9me3, and H3K4me3 were detected at different levels across tissues of all species.Our results show that the DNA methylation and histone modification epigenetic machinery is conserved in cephalopods, and that, in octopus, 5-methyl-cytosine does not decorate transposable elements, but is enriched on the gene bodies of highly expressed genes and could cooperate with the histone code to regulate tissue-specific gene expression.© 2022.

"36139626","Unraveling the Structural Variations of Early-Stage Mycosis Fungoides-CD3 Based Purification and Third Generation Sequencing as Novel Tools for the Genomic Landscape in CTCL.","Cancers (Basel)","Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). At present, knowledge of genetic changes in early-stage MF is insufficient. Additionally, low tumor cell fraction renders calling of copy-number variations as the predominant mutations in MF challenging, thereby impeding further investigations. We show that enrichment of T cells from a biopsy of a stage I MF patient greatly increases tumor fraction. This improvement enables accurate calling of recurrent MF copy-number variants such asARID1AandCDKN2Adeletion andSTAT5amplification, undetected in the unprocessed biopsy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that application of long-read nanopore sequencing is especially useful for the structural variant rich CTCL. We detect the structural variants underlying recurrent MF copy-number variants and show phasing of multiple breakpoints into complex structural variant haplotypes. Additionally, we record multiple occurrences of templated insertion structural variants in this sample. Taken together, this study suggests a workflow to make the early stages of MF accessible for genetic analysis, and indicates long-read sequencing as a major tool for genetic analysis for MF."

This study intends to assess characteristics of DTC-GT users in China, estimate the price elasticity of demand, quantify monetary values of DTC-GT features, and discuss its implications to the development of precision public health.A total of 629 participants with an average age of 28.8 years were collected from an online survey conducted in November 2021. A discrete choice experiment and a mixed logit modelling approach were used to elucidate consumer preferences to DTC-GT services and evaluate monetary values of certain features.DTC-GT users were found to have a higher level of income on average. The price elasticity of DTC-GT services was estimated to be -0.72 (95% CI -0.73 to -0.70). The willingness-to-pay for genetic testing features of physical traits, personality, and dietary recommendation were estimated to be 90, 107, and 220 CNY, respectively.The nature of big genomic data makes DTC-GT have the potential to aid in the advancement of precision public health through more precise disease prevention and control strategies.

"36057580","Structural variants and tandem repeats in the founder individuals of four F<sub>2</sub> pig crosses and implications to F<sub>2</sub> GWAS results.","BMC Genomics","Structural variants and tandem repeats are relevant sources of genomic variation that are not routinely analyzed in genome wide association studies mainly due to challenging identification and genotyping. Here, we profiled these variants via state-of-the-art strategies in the founder animals of four F2pig crosses using whole-genome sequence data (20x coverage). The variants were compared at a founder level with the commonly screened SNPs and small indels. At the F2level, we carried out an association study using imputed structural variants and tandem repeats with four growth and carcass traits followed by a comparison with a previously conducted SNPs and small indels based association study.A total of 13,201 high confidence structural variants and 103,730 polymorphic tandem repeats (with a repeat length of 2-20 bp) were profiled in the founders. We observed a moderate to high (r from 0.48 to 0.57) level of co-localization between SNPs or small indels and structural variants or tandem repeats. In the association step 56.56% of the significant variants were not in high LD with significantly associated SNPs and small indels identified for the same traits in the earlier study and thus presumably not tagged in case of a standard association study. For the four growth and carcass traits investigated, many of the already proposed candidate genes in our previous studies were confirmed and additional ones were identified. Interestingly, a common pattern on how structural variants or tandem repeats regulate the phenotypic traits emerged. Many of the significant variants were embedded or nearby long non-coding RNAs drawing attention to their functional importance. Through which specific mechanisms the identified long non-coding RNAs and their associated structural variants or tandem repeats contribute to quantitative trait variation will need further investigation.The current study provides insights into the characteristics of structural variants and tandem repeats and their role in association studies. A systematic incorporation of these variants into genome wide association studies is advised. While not of immediate interest for genomic prediction purposes, this will be particularly beneficial for elucidating biological mechanisms driving the complex trait variation.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36104547","The spatial organization of transcriptional control.","Nat Rev Genet","In animals, the sequences for controlling gene expression do not concentrate just at the transcription start site of genes, but are frequently thousands to millions of base pairs distal to it. The interaction of these sequences with one another and their transcription start sites is regulated by factors that shape the three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome within the nucleus. Over the past decade, indirect tools exploiting high-throughput DNA sequencing have helped to map this 3D organization, have identified multiple key regulators of its structure and, in the process, have substantially reshaped our view of how 3D genome architecture regulates transcription. Now, new tools for high-throughput super-resolution imaging of chromatin have directly visualized the 3D chromatin organization, settling some debates left unresolved by earlier indirect methods, challenging some earlier models of regulatory specificity and creating hypotheses about the role of chromatin structure in transcriptional regulation.© 2022.

"36163358","Modeling tissue-specific breakpoint proximity of structural variations from whole-genomes to identify cancer drivers.","Nat Commun","Structural variations (SVs) in cancer cells often impact large genomic regions with functional consequences. However, identification of SVs under positive selection is a challenging task because little is known about the genomic features related to the background breakpoint distribution in different cancers. We report a method that uses a generalized additive model to investigate the breakpoint proximity curves from 2,382 whole-genomes of 32 cancer types. We find that a multivariate model, which includes linear and nonlinear partial contributions of various tissue-specific features and their interaction terms, can explain up to 57% of the observed deviance of breakpoint proximity. In particular, three-dimensional genomic features such as topologically associating domains (TADs), TAD-boundaries and their interaction with other features show significant contributions. The model is validated by identification of known cancer genes and revealed putative drivers in cancers different than those with previous evidence of positive selection.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Current methods can be replaced with targeted nano-drug delivery systems to overcome such side effects. In the present work, an intelligent nano-system consisting of Chitosan (Ch)/Gamma alumina (γAl)/Fe3O4and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) was synthesized and designed for the first time in order to influence the Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cell line in the treatment of breast cancer. Physico-chemical characterization of the nanocarriers was carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM analysis revealed smooth and homogeneous spherical nanoparticles. The high stability of the nanoparticles and their narrow size distribution was confirmed by DLS. The results of the loading study demonstrated that these nano-systems cause controlled, stable, and pH-sensitive release in cancerous environments with an inactive targeting mechanism. Finally, the results of MTT and flow cytometry tests indicated that this nano-system increased the rate of apoptosis induction on cancerous masses and could be an effective alternative to current treatments."
"36043395","The complex genetic basis of fibromuscular dysplasia, a systemic arteriopathy associated with multiple forms of cardiovascular disease.","Clin Sci (Lond)","Artery stenosis is a common cause of hypertension and stroke and can be due to atherosclerosis accumulation in the majority of cases and in a small fraction of patients to arterial fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Artery stenosis due to atherosclerosis is widely studied with known risk factors (e.g. increasing age, male gender, and dyslipidemia) to influence its etiology, including genetic factors. However, the causes of noninflammatory and nonatherosclerotic stenosis in FMD are less understood. FMD occurs predominantly in early middle-age women, a fraction of the population where cardiovascular risk is different and understudied. FMD arteriopathies are often diagnosed in the context of hypertension and stroke and co-occur mainly with spontaneous coronary artery dissection, an atypical cause of acute myocardial infarction. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the understanding of molecular origins of FMD. Data were obtained from genetic studies using complementary methodological approaches applied to familial, syndromic, and sporadic forms of this intriguing arteriopathy. Rare variation analyses point toward mechanisms related to impaired prostacyclin signaling and defaults in fibrillar collagens. The study of common variation, mainly through a recent genome-wide association study, describes a shared genetic link with blood pressure, in addition to point at potential risk genes involved in actin cytoskeleton and intracellular calcium homeostasis supporting impaired vascular contraction as a key mechanism. We conclude this review with future strategies and approaches needed to fully understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms related to FMD.© 2022 The Author(s)."

DNA SNPs, CNVs, and epigenomic modifications also contribute to ASD. Transcriptomics analysis of blood samples may offer clues for pathways dysregulated in ASD. To expand and validate published findings of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) studies, we performed RNA-seq of whole blood samples from an Israeli discovery cohort of eight children with ASD compared with nine age- and sex-matched neurotypical children. This revealed 10 genes with differential expression. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we compared RNAs from whole blood samples of 73 Israeli and American children with ASD and 26 matched neurotypical children for the 10 dysregulated genes detected by RNA-seq. This revealed higher expression levels of the pro-inflammatory transcriptsBATF2andLY6Eand lower expression levels of the anti-inflammatory transcriptsISG15andMT2Ain the ASD compared to neurotypical children.BATF2was recently reported as upregulated in blood samples of Japanese adults with ASD. Our findings support an involvement of these genes in ASD phenotypes, independent of age and ethnicity. Upregulation ofBATF2and downregulation ofISG15andMT2Awere reported to reduce cancer risk. Implications of the dysregulated genes for pro-inflammatory phenotypes, immunity, and cancer risk in ASD are discussed."

The potential impact of the abundance of A. muciniphila has been studied in major cardiovascular diseases including elevated blood pressure or hypertension (HTN). HTN is a major factor in premature death worldwide, and approximately 1.28 billion adults aged 30-79 years have hypertension.

"36142765","sncRNAs in Epididymosomes: The Contribution to Embryonic Development and Offspring Health.","Int J Mol Sci","Much progress has been made in determining that paternal environmental exposures can remodel their spermatozoa small noncoding RNAs (sncRANs) and, in turn, affect the phenotypes of their offspring. Studies have shown that changes in the spermatozoa sncRNAs profile occur during passing through the epididymis. Due to the absence of transcription and translation in the epididymis, spermatozoa remodel their sncRNAs profile through communication with the epididymal microenvironment. Since epididymosomes contribute to the process of spermatozoa maturation by mediating the crosstalk between the epididymis and the passing spermatozoa, they are considered to be the leading candidate to mediate these changes. Previous studies and reviews on the role of epididymal transfer proteins in sperm maturation and function are myriad. This review focuses on the role and mechanisms of epididymosome-mediated transfer of sncRNAs cargoes onembryonic development and offspring health."

Over the past few decades, our understanding of how our adult health can be shaped by events occurring before birth has developed into a well-supported concept, the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD). Supported by epidemiological data and experimental studies, specific mechanisms have been defined linking environmental perturbations, disrupted fetal and neonatal development and adult ill-health. Originally, such studies focused on the significance of poor maternal health during pregnancy. However, the role of the father in directing the development and well-being of his offspring has come into recent focus. Whereas these studies identify the individual role of each parent in shaping the long-term health of their offspring, few studies have explored the combined influences of both parents on offspring well-being. Such understanding is necessary as parental influences on offspring development extend beyond the direct genetic contributions from the sperm and oocyte. This article reviews our current understanding of the parental contribution to offspring health, exploring some of the mechanisms linking parental well-being with gamete quality, embryo development and offspring health."
"36158557","<i>Pitx3</i> deficiency promotes age-dependent alterations in striatal medium spiny neurons.","Front Aging Neurosci","The classical motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are tightly linked to the gradual loss of dopamine within the striatum. Concomitantly, medium spiny neurons (MSNs) also experience morphological changes, such as reduced dendritic complexity and spine density, which may be potentially associated with motor dysfunction as well. Thus, MSNs may serve as the emerging targets for PD therapy besides the midbrain dopaminergic neurons.To comprehensively examine pathological alterations of MSNs longitudinally, we established aTHCre/Pitx3fl/fl(Pitx3cKO) mouse model that developed canonical PD features, including a significant loss of SNc DAergic neurons and motor deficits. During aging, the targeted neurotransmitter, MSNs morphology and DNA methylation profile were significantly altered uponPitx3deficiency. Specifically, dopamine, GABA and glutamate decreased in the model at the early stage. While nuclear, soma and dendritic atrophy, as well as nuclear invaginations increased in the aged MSNs ofPitx3ckomice. Furthermore, more nuclear DNA damages were characterized in MSNs during aging, andPitx3deficiency aggravated this phenomenon, together with alterations of DNA methylation profiling associated with lipoprotein and nucleus pathway at the late stage.The early perturbations of the neurotransmitters within MSNs may potentially contribute to the alterations of metabolism, morphology and epigenetics within the striatum at the late stage, which may provide new perspectives on the diagnosis and pathogenesis of PD.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Yang, Shao, Kim, Wang, Wang, Wu, Xu and Le."
"36046837","Dopaminylation in Psychostimulant Use Disorder Protects Against Psychostimulant Seeking Behavior by Normalizing Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) Dopamine Expression.","Curr Psychopharmacol","Repeated cocaine administration changes histone acetylation and methylation on Lys residues and Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Recently Nestler's group explored histone Arg (R) methylation in reward processing models. Damez-Wernoet al.(2016) reported that during human investigations and animal self-administration experiments, the histone mark protein-R-methyltransferase-6 (PRMT6) and asymmetric dimethylation of R2 on histone H3 (H3R2me2a) decreased in the rodent and cocaine-dependent human NAc. Overexpression of PRMT6 in D2-MSNs in all NAc neurons increased cocaine seeking, whereas PRMT6 overexpression in D1-MSNs protects against cocaine-seeking.The hypothesis is that dopaminylation (H3R2me2a binding) occurs in psychostimulant use disorder (PSU), and the binding inhibitor Srcin1, like the major DRD2 A2 allelic polymorphism, protects against psychostimulant seeking behavior by normalizing nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine expression.Numerous publications confirmed the association between the DRD2Taq A1allele (30-40 lower D2 receptor numbers) and severe cocaine dependence. Lepacket al.(2020) found that acute cocaine increases dopamine in NAc synapses, and results in histone H3 glutamine 5 dopaminylation (H3Q5dop) and consequent inhibition of D2 expression. The inhibition increases with chronic cocaine use and accompanies cocaine withdrawal. They also found that the Src kinase signaling inhibitor 1 (Srcin1 or p140CAP) during cocaine withdrawal reduced H3R2me2a binding. Consequently, this inhibited dopaminylation induced a ""homeostatic brake.""The decrease in Src signaling in NAc D2-MSNs, (like the DRD2 Taq A2 allele, a well-known genetic mechanism protective against SUD) normalizes the NAc dopamine expression and decreases cocaine reward and motivation to self-administer cocaine. The Srcin1 may be an important therapeutic target."

The CSC hypothesis may provide a model to explain the tumor cell heterogeneity. Understand the biological mechanism of CSC will help the early detection and cure of cancer. The discovery of the dynamic changes in CSC will be possible by the using of bio-engineering techniques-lineage tracing. However, it is difficult to obtain real-time, continuous, and dynamic live-imaging information using the traditional approaches that take snapshots of time points from different animals. The goal of molecular imaging is to monitor the in situ, continuous molecular changes of cells in vivo. Therefore, the most advanced bioengineering lineage tracing approach, while using a variety of molecular detection methods, will maximize the presentation of CSC. In this review, we first introduce the method of lineage tracing, and then introduce the various components of molecular images to dynamic detect the CSC.

The 2016 WHO classification incorporates also prefibrotic PMF (pre-PMF) and overt PMF. This study aimed to discriminate the clinical features, genetic alterations, and outcomes in patients with prefibrotic, overt PMF, and secondary MF (SMF). This study included 229 patients with diagnosed myelofibrosis (MF). Among 229 patients, 67 (29%), 122 (53%), and 40 (18%) were confirmed as SMF, overt PMF, and pre-PMF, respectively. TheJAK2V617F mutation was differentially distributed in SMF and PMF, contradictory toCALRandMPLmutations. Regarding nondriver mutations, the occurrence ofASXL1mutations differed between PMF and SMF or pre-PMF. The three-year overall survival was 91.5%, 85.3%, and 94.8% in SMF, overt PMF, and pre-PMF groups. Various scoring systems could discriminate the overall survival in PMF but not in SMF and pre-PMF. Still, clinical features including anemia and thrombocytopenia were poor prognostic factors throughout the myelofibrosis, whereas mutations contributed differently. Molecular grouping by wild-typeSF3B1andSRSF2/RUNX1/U2AF1/ASXL1/TP53mutations showed inferior progression-free survival (PFS) in PMF, SMF, and pre-PMF.

Expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is elevated in patients with MPN as well as in Jak2V617F knock-in mice. Here, we show that genetic deletion of IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) normalizes peripheral blood counts, reduces splenomegaly and ameliorates bone marrow fibrosis in homozygous Jak2V617F mouse model of myelofibrosis. Deletion of IL-1R1 also significantly reduces Jak2V617F mutant hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Exogenous administration of IL-1β enhances myeloid cell expansion and accelerates the development of bone marrow fibrosis in heterozygous Jak2V617F mice. Furthermore, treatment with anti-IL-1R1 antibodies significantly reduces leukocytosis and splenomegaly, and ameliorates bone marrow fibrosis in homozygous Jak2V617F mice. Collectively, these results suggest that IL-1 signaling plays a pathogenic role in MPN disease progression, and targeting of IL-1R1 could be a useful strategy for the treatment of myelofibrosis.© 2022.

The two most prevalent driver mutations found in myeloproliferative neoplasms-JAK2V617FandCALRm-occur in hematopoietic stem cells, which are highly complex to observe in vivo. To circumvent this difficulty, we propose a method relying on mathematical modeling and statistical inference to determine disease initiation and dynamics. Our findings suggest thatCALRmmutations tend to occur later in life thanJAK2V617F. Our results confirm the higher proliferative advantage of theCALRmmalignant clone compared toJAK2V617F. Furthermore, we illustrate how mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference can be used for setting up early screening strategies."

The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened between eachJAK2V617F+MPN entity and HC. Subsequently, functional enrichment analyses, including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Reactome, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), were conducted to decipher the important biological effects of DEGs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the DEGs were constructed to identify hub genes and significant modules. Another two gene expression profiles of patients withJAK2V617F+MPN [n= 23, including PV, ET, secondary myelofibrosis (SMF), and PMF] and HC (n= 6) from GEO were used as external validation datasets to prove the reliability of the identified signatures.Results:KEGG analysis revealed the upregulated genes in threeJAK2V617F+MPN entities compared with HC were essentially enriched in inflammatory pathways and immune response signaling pathways, and the number of these pathways enriched in PMF was obviously more than that in PV and ET. Following the PPI analysis, 10 genes primarily related to inflammation and immune response were found upregulated in differentJAK2V617F+MPN entities. In addition, Reactome enrichment analysis indicated that interferon signaling pathways were enriched specifically in PMF but not in PV or ET. Furthermore, several interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes were identified to be uniquely upregulated inJAK2V617F+PMF. The external datasets validated the upregulation of four interferon-related genes (OAS1,IFITM3,GBP1, andGBP2) inJAK2V617F+myelofibrosis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicate that the four genes have high area under the ROC curve (AUC) values when distinguishingJAK2V617F+myelofibrosis from PV or ET.Conclusion:Four interferon-stimulated genes (OAS1,IFITM3,GBP1, andGBP2) exclusively upregulated inJAK2V617F+myelofibrosis might have the potential to be the auxiliary molecular diagnostic and predictive indicators of myelofibrosis.Copyright © 2022 Zhao, Wang, Liang, Xu, Shi and Tong."

Here we introduce a blood-based neutrophil dexamethasone methylation index (NDMI) that provides a measure of the epigenetic response of subjects to dexamethasone. This marker outperforms conventional approaches based on leukocyte composition as a marker of glucocorticoid response. The NDMI is associated with low CD4 T cells and the accumulation of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and also serves as prognostic factor in glioma survival. In a non-glioma population, the NDMI increases with a history of prednisone use. Therefore, it may also be informative in other conditions where glucocorticoids are employed. We conclude that DNA methylation remodeling within the peripheral immune compartment is a rich source of clinically relevant markers of glucocorticoid response.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36143200","The Role of Sphingomyelin and Ceramide in Motor Neuron Diseases.","J Pers Med","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA), and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) are motor neuron diseases (MNDs) characterised by progressive motor neuron degeneration, weakness and muscular atrophy. Lipid dysregulation is well recognised in each of these conditions and occurs prior to neurodegeneration. Several lipid markers have been shown to predict prognosis in ALS. Sphingolipids are complex lipids enriched in the central nervous system and are integral to key cellular functions including membrane stability and signalling pathways, as well as being mediators of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. This review highlights the metabolism of sphingomyelin (SM), the most abundant sphingolipid, and of its metabolite ceramide, and its role in the pathophysiology of neurodegeneration, focusing on MNDs. We also review published lipidomic studies in MNDs. In the 13 studies of patients with ALS, 12 demonstrated upregulation of multiple SM species and 6 demonstrated upregulation of ceramides. SM species also correlated with markers of clinical progression in five of six studies. These data highlight the potential use of SM and ceramide as biomarkers in ALS. Finally, we review potential therapeutic strategies for targeting sphingolipid metabolism in neurodegeneration."
"36060972","Research progress on the mechanism of beta-cell apoptosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) is regarded as one of the most severe chronic metabolic diseases worldwide, which poses a great threat to human safety and health. The main feature of T2DM is the deterioration of pancreatic beta-cell function. More and more studies have shown that the decline of pancreatic beta-cell function in T2DM can be attributable to beta-cell apoptosis, but the exact mechanisms of beta-cell apoptosis in T2DM are not yet fully clarified. Therefore, in this review, we will focus on the current status and progress of research on the mechanism of pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis in T2DM, to provide new ideas for T2DM treatment strategies.Copyright © 2022 You, Zheng, Chen and Huang."
"36078093","Update on the Molecular Aspects and Methods Underlying the Complex Architecture of FSHD.","Cells","Despite the knowledge of the main mechanisms involved in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), the high heterogeneity and variable penetrance of the disease complicate the diagnosis, characterization and genotype-phenotype correlation of patients and families, raising the need for further research and data. Thus, the present review provides an update of the main molecular aspects underlying the complex architecture of FSHD, including the genetic factors (related toD4Z4repeated units and FSHD-associated genes), epigenetic elements (D4Z4methylation status, non-coding RNAs and high-order chromatin interactions) and gene expression profiles (FSHD transcriptome signatures both at bulk tissue and single-cell level). In addition, the review will also describe the methods currently available for investigating the above-mentioned features and how the resulting data may be combined with artificial-intelligence-based pipelines, with the purpose of developing a multifunctional tool tailored to enhancing the knowledge of disease pathophysiology and progression and fostering the research for novel treatment strategies, as well as clinically useful biomarkers. In conclusion, the present review highlights how FSHD should be regarded as a disease characterized by a molecular spectrum of genetic and epigenetic factors, whose alteration plays a differential role inDUX4repression and, subsequently, contributes to determining the FSHD phenotype."
"36097220","Genetic risk factors have a substantial impact on healthy life years.","Nat Med","The impact of genetic variation on overall disease burden has not been comprehensively evaluated. We introduce an approach to estimate the effect of genetic risk factors on disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; 'lost healthy life years'). We use genetic information from 735,748 individuals and consider 80 diseases. Rare variants had the highest effect on DALYs at the individual level. Among common variants, rs3798220 (LPA) had the strongest individual-level effect, with 1.18 DALYs from carrying 1 versus 0 copies. Being in the top 10% versus the bottom 90% of a polygenic score for multisite chronic pain had an effect of 3.63 DALYs. Some common variants had a population-level effect comparable to modifiable risk factors such as high sodium intake and low physical activity. Attributable DALYs vary between males and females for some genetic exposures. Genetic risk factors can explain a sizable number of healthy life years lost both at the individual and population level.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36103948","The burden of viral infections in pediatric intensive care unit between endemic and pandemic coronavirus infections: A tertiary care center experience.","J Infect Chemother","To measure the prevalence of viral infections, length of stay (LOS), and outcome in children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) during the period preceding the COVID-19 pandemic in a MERS-CoV endemic country.A retrospective chart review of children 0-14 years old admitted to PICU with a viral infection.Of 1736 patients, 164 patients (9.45%) had a positive viral infection. The annual prevalence trended downward over a three-year period, from 11.7% to 7.3%. The median PICU LOS was 11.6 days. Viral infections were responsible for 1904.4 (21.94%) PICU patient-days. Mechanical ventilation was used in 91.5% of patients, including noninvasive and invasive modes. Comorbidities were significantly associated with intubation (P-value = 0.025). Patients infected with multiple viruses had median pediatric index of mortality 2 (PIM 2) scores of 4, as compared to 1 for patients with single virus infections (p < 0.001), and a median PICU LOS of 12 days, compared to 4 in the single-virus group (p < 0.001). Overall, mortality associated with viral infections in PICU was 7 (4.3%). Patients with viral infections having multiple organ failure were significantly more likely to die in the PICU (p = 0.001).Viral infections are responsible for one-fifth of PICU patient-days, with a high demand for mechanical ventilation. Patients with multiple viral infections had longer LOS, and higher PIM 2 scores. The downward trend in the yearly rate of PICU admissions for viral infections between the end of the MERS-CoV outbreak and the start of the COVID-19 pandemic may suggest viral interference that warrants further investigations.Copyright © 2022 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases.

"36118693","Quercetin targets VCAM1 to prevent diabetic cerebrovascular endothelial cell injury.","Front Aging Neurosci","Endothelial cells play important roles in neurodegenerative diseases caused by diabetes, therefore, we aimed at investigating the mechanisms through which endothelial cells are involved in diabetes development.Single cell analysis was performed to identify the major endothelial cell subtypes in cardiovascular tissues that are involved in diabetes development. A cell-cell communication approach was then used to identify ligand-receptor interaction pairs between these cell types. Differential expression analysis between the two experimental groups [standard chow diet group and diabetogenic diet with cholesterol (DDC) group] was used to identify diabetes-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The upregulated genes were used to identify candidate ligands or receptors, as well as the corresponding cell types. Cell trajectory inference was performed to identify the stage of cell development and changes in expression of candidate ligands or receptors during cell development. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to investigate the biological functions of genes of purpose. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs) were used to predict potential drugs with the ability to target the proteins of purpose.Seven cell types, including five endothelial cell subtypes (EC_1, EC_2, EC_3, EC_4, and EC_EndMT), were identified from endothelial cell-enriched single cell samples from the heart and aorta of mice. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed the potential ligand-receptor interactions between these cell types while five important ligand-receptor-associated genes, including Fn1, Vcam1, Fbn1, Col4a1, and Col4a2, were established by differential expression analysis. Among them, Vcam1 is mainly expressed in EC_EndMT and is involved in interactions between EC_EndMT and other cells. Cell trajectory extrapolation analysis revealed a shift from EC_2/EC_4 to EC_EndMT and a shift from EC_EndMT to EC_3/EC_1 during the progression of diabetes. GSEA analysis revealed that upregulation of VCAM1 may have inhibitory effects on cell growth and energy metabolism.EC_EndMT subtypes have a complex role in neurodegenerative diseases caused by diabetes. Through mechanisms involved in cell-cell communication, Vcam1 may play an important role in dysregulation of biological functions of EC_ EndMT. Molecular docking results of the quercetin-VCAM1 complex suggest that quercetin may be an effective drug for targeting this protein.Copyright © 2022 Huang, Lin, Sun, Wang, He, Han, Lu, Kang, Chen, Guo, Cui, Sun, Go, Wu, Yao, Cao and Xu."
"36163278","Single-cell genome sequencing of human neurons identifies somatic point mutation and indel enrichment in regulatory elements.","Nat Genet","Accurate somatic mutation detection from single-cell DNA sequencing is challenging due to amplification-related artifacts. To reduce this artifact burden, an improved amplification technique, primary template-directed amplification (PTA), was recently introduced. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 52 PTA-amplified single neurons using SCAN2, a new genotyper we developed to leverage mutation signatures and allele balance in identifying somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) in PTA data. Our analysis confirms an increase in nonclonal somatic mutation in single neurons with age, but revises the estimated rate of this accumulation to 16 SNVs per year. We also identify artifacts in other amplification methods. Most importantly, we show that somatic indels increase by at least three per year per neuron and are enriched in functional regions of the genome such as enhancers and promoters. Our data suggest that indels in gene-regulatory elements have a considerable effect on genome integrity in human neurons.© 2022.

"36051457","Somatic mutations in single human cardiomyocytes reveal age-associated DNA damage and widespread oxidative genotoxicity.","Nat Aging","The accumulation of somatic DNA mutations over time is a hallmark of aging in many dividing and nondividing cells but has not been studied in postmitotic human cardiomyocytes. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we identified and characterized the landscape of somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs) in 56 single cardiomyocytes from 12 individuals (aged from 0.4 to 82 years). Cardiomyocyte sSNVs accumulate with age at rates that are faster than in many dividing cell types and nondividing neurons. Cardiomyocyte sSNVs show distinctive mutational signatures that implicate failed nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair of oxidative DNA damage, and defective mismatch repair. Since age-accumulated sSNVs create many damaging mutations that disrupt gene functions, polyploidization in cardiomyocytes may provide a mechanism of genetic compensation to minimize the complete knockout of essential genes during aging. Age-related accumulation of cardiac mutations provides a paradigm to understand the influence of aging on cardiac dysfunction."
"36072796","Racial disparities in liver cancer: Evidence for a role of environmental contaminants and the epigenome.","Front Oncol","Liver cancer incidence has tripled since the early 1980s, making this disease one of the fastest rising types of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In the US, incidence varies by geographic location and race, with the highest incidence in the southwestern and southeastern states and among racial minorities such as Hispanic and Black individuals. Prognosis is also poorer among these populations. The observed ethnic disparities do not fully reflect differences in the prevalence of risk factors, e.g., for cirrhosis that may progress to liver cancer or from genetic predisposition. Likely substantial contributors to risk are environmental factors, including chemical and non-chemical stressors; yet, the paucity of mechanistic insights impedes prevention efforts. Here, we review the current literature and evaluate challenges to reducing liver cancer disparities. We also discuss the hypothesis that epigenetic mediators may provide biomarkers for early detection to support interventions that reduce disparities.Copyright © 2022 Vidal, Moylan, Wilder, Grant, Murphy and Hoyo."
"36133739","The Application of Liquid Biopsy Techniques in High-Risk Population for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.","Cancer Manag Res","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive system and has a 5-year overall survival rate of 14.1%. Many HCC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and thus early screening is essential for reducing the mortality of HCC. In addition to commonly used detection indicators such as serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3) and abnormal prothrombin (protein induced by vitamin K absence II, PIVKA-II), liquid biopsy techniques have been demonstrated to have diagnostic value in HCC detection. Compared with invasive procedures, liquid biopsy can detect circulatory metabolites of malignant neoplasms. Liquid biopsy techniques can detect circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, circulating RNA and exosomes and have been used in the early screening, diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of HCC. This paper reviews the molecular biological characteristics and application of different liquid biopsy techniques, and aim to highlight promising biomarkers that may be feasible options for early-stage HCC evaluation to improve early screening in populations at high risk for HCC.© 2022 Ding and Zhao."
