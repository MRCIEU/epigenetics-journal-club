"33848004","Age-Related Macular Degeneration: From Epigenetics to Therapeutic Implications.","Adv Exp Med Biol","Aberrant regulation of epigenetic mechanisms, including the two most common types; DNA methylation and histone modification have been implicated in common chronic progressive conditions, including Alzheimer disease, cardiovascular disease, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). All these conditions are complex, meaning that environmental factors, genetic factors, and their interactions play a role in disease pathophysiology. Although genome wide association studies (GWAS), and studies on twins demonstrate the genetic/hereditary component to these complex diseases, including AMD, this contribution is much less than 100%. Moreover, the contribution of the hereditary component decreases in the advanced, later onset forms of these chronic diseases including AMD. This underscores the need to elucidate how the genetic and environmental factors function to exert their influence on disease pathophysiology. By teasing out epigenetic mechanisms and how they exert their influence on AMD, therapeutic targets can be tailored to prevent and/or slow down disease progression. Epigenetic studies that incorporate well-characterized patient tissue samples (including affected tissues and peripheral blood), similar to those relevant to gene expression studies, along with genetic and epidemiological information, can be the first step in developing appropriate functional assays to validate findings and identify potential therapies."
"33846747","Evaluation of genome-wide DNA methylation profile of human embryos with different developmental competences.","Hum Reprod","Do embryos with different developmental competence exhibit different DNA methylation profiles at the blastocyst stage?We established genome-wide DNA methylome analysis for embryo trophectoderm (TE) biopsy samples and our findings demonstrated correlation of methylation profile of trophectoderm with euploidy status and with maternal age, indicating that genome-wide methylation level might be negatively correlated with embryo quality.DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic regulatory mechanism that affects differentiation of cells into their future lineages during pre-implantation embryo development. Currently there is no established approach available to assess the epigenetic status of the human preimplantation embryo during routine IVF treatment.In total, we collected trophectoderm biopsy samples from 30 randomly selected human blastocysts and conducted whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to evaluate their DNA methylation profile. Nested linear models were used to assess association between DNA methylation level and ploidy status (aneuploidy [n = 20] vs. euploidy [n = 10]), maternal age (29.4-42.5 years old), and time of blastulation (day 5 [n = 16] vs. day 6 [n = 14]), using embryo identity as a covariate.TE biopsy samples were obtained and submitted to bisulfite conversion. For WGBS, whole-genome sequencing libraries were then generated from the converted genome. An average of 75 million reads were obtained for each sample, and about 63% of the reads aligned to human reference. An average of 40 million reads used for the final analysis after the unconverted reads were filtered out.We revealed an increase of genome-wide DNA methylation level in aneuploid embryo TE biopsies compared to euploid embryos (25.4% ± 3.2% vs. 24.7% ± 3.2%, P < 0.005). We also found genome-wide DNA methylation level to be increased with the maternal age (P < 0.005). On a chromosomal scale, we found monosomic embryos have lower methylation levels on the involved chromosome while no drastic change was observed for the involved chromosome in trisomies. Additionally, we revealed that WGBS data precisely revealed the chromosome copy number variance.Though our results demonstrated a negative correlation of genome-wide methylation level and embryo quality, further WGBS analysis on a greater number of embryos and specific investigation of its correlation with implantation and live birth are needed before any practical use of this approach for evaluation of embryo competence.This study revealed a change in genome-wide DNA methylation profile among embryos with different developmental potentials, reinforcing the critical role of DNA methylation in early development.No external funding was received for this study.

"33845866","DNA methylation in cord blood in association with prenatal depressive symptoms.","Clin Epigenetics","Prenatal symptoms of depression (PND) and anxiety affect up to every third pregnancy. Children of mothers with mental health problems are at higher risk of developmental problems, possibly through epigenetic mechanisms together with other factors such as genetic and environmental. We investigated DNA methylation in cord blood in relation to PND, taking into consideration a history of depression, co-morbidity with anxiety and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) use, and stratified by sex of the child. Mothers (N = 373) prospectively filled out web-based questionnaires regarding mood symptoms and SSRI use throughout pregnancy. Cord blood was collected at birth and DNA methylation was measured using Illumina MethylationEPIC array at 850 000 CpG sites throughout the genome. Differentially methylated regions were identified using Kruskal-Wallis test, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values < 0.05 were considered significant.No differential DNA methylation was associated with PND alone; however, differential DNA methylation was observed in children exposed to comorbid PND with anxiety symptoms compared with healthy controls in ABCF1 (log twofold change - 0.2), but not after stratification by sex of the child. DNA methylation in children exposed to PND without SSRI treatment and healthy controls both differed in comparison with SSRI exposed children at several sites and regions, among which hypomethylation was observed in CpGs in the promoter region of CRBN (log2 fold change - 0.57), involved in brain development, and hypermethylation in MDFIC (log2 fold change 0.45), associated with the glucocorticoid stress response.Although it is not possible to assess if these methylation differences are due to SSRI treatment itself or to more severe depression, our findings add on to existing knowledge that there might be different biological consequences for the child depending on whether maternal PND was treated with SSRIs or not."
"33844651","Potential reversal of epigenetic age using a diet and lifestyle intervention: a pilot randomized clinical trial.","Aging (Albany NY)","Manipulations to slow biological aging and extend healthspan are of interest given the societal and healthcare costs of our aging population. Herein we report on a randomized controlled clinical trial conducted among 43 healthy adult males between the ages of 50-72. The 8-week treatment program included diet, sleep, exercise and relaxation guidance, and supplemental probiotics and phytonutrients. The control group received no intervention. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted on saliva samples using the Illumina Methylation Epic Array and DNAmAge was calculated using the online Horvath DNAmAge clock (2013). The diet and lifestyle treatment was associated with a 3.23 years decrease in DNAmAge compared with controls (p=0.018). DNAmAge of those in the treatment group decreased by an average 1.96 years by the end of the program compared to the same individuals at the beginning with a strong trend towards significance (p=0.066). Changes in blood biomarkers were significant for mean serum 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (+15%, p=0.004) and mean triglycerides (-25%, p=0.009). To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled study to suggest that specific diet and lifestyle interventions may reverse Horvath DNAmAge (2013) epigenetic aging in healthy adult males. Larger-scale and longer duration clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings, as well as investigation in other human populations."
"33844406","The interplay between DNA and histone methylation: molecular mechanisms and disease implications.","EMBO Rep","Methylation of cytosine in CpG dinucleotides and histone lysine and arginine residues is a chromatin modification that critically contributes to the regulation of genome integrity, replication, and accessibility. A strong correlation exists between the genome-wide distribution of DNA and histone methylation, suggesting an intimate relationship between these epigenetic marks. Indeed, accumulating literature reveals complex mechanisms underlying the molecular crosstalk between DNA and histone methylation. These in vitro and in vivo discoveries are further supported by the finding that genes encoding DNA- and histone-modifying enzymes are often mutated in overlapping human diseases. Here, we summarize recent advances in understanding how DNA and histone methylation cooperate to maintain the cellular epigenomic landscape. We will also discuss the potential implication of these insights for understanding the etiology of, and developing biomarkers and therapies for, human congenital disorders and cancers that are driven by chromatin abnormalities.© 2021 The Authors."
"33843425","Epigenetic regulation in Alzheimer's disease: is it a potential therapeutic target?","Expert Opin Ther Targets","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and the primary form of dementia in the elderly. Changes in DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histone tails are increasingly observed in AD tissues, and likely contribute to disease onset and progression. The reversibility of these epigenetic marks offers the potential for therapeutic interventions.After a concise and updated overview of DNA methylation and post-translational modifications of histone tails in AD tissues, this review provides an overview of the animal and cell culture studies investigating the potential of targeting these modifications to attenuate AD-like features. PubMed was searched for relevant literature between 2003 and 2021.Methyl donor compounds and drugs acting on histone tail modifications demonstrated attenuated AD-like features and improved cognition in several transgenic AD mice; however, there are concerns about safety and tolerability for long-term treatment in humans. The challenges will be to take advantage of recent epigenome-wide investigations to identify the principal targets for future interventions, and to design novel, selective and safer agents. Natural compounds exerting epigenetic properties could represent a promising opportunity to delay disease onset in middle-aged individuals at increased AD risk."
"33842983","Multi-omics analysis identifies CpGs near G6PC2 mediating the effects of genetic variants on fasting glucose.","Diabetologia","An elevated fasting glucose level in non-diabetic individuals is a key predictor of type 2 diabetes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of SNPs for fasting glucose but most of their functional roles in influencing the trait are unclear. This study aimed to identify the mediation effects of DNA methylation between SNPs identified as significant from GWAS and fasting glucose using Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses.We first performed GWAS analyses for three cohorts (Taiwan Biobank with 18,122 individuals, the Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study in Taiwan with 1989 individuals and the Stanford Asia-Pacific Program for Hypertension and Insulin Resistance with 416 individuals) with individuals of Han Chinese ancestry in Taiwan, followed by a meta-analysis for combining the three GWAS analysis results to identify significant and independent SNPs for fasting glucose. We determined whether these SNPs were methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) by testing their associations with DNA methylation levels at nearby CpG sites using a subsample of 1775 individuals from the Taiwan Biobank. The MR analysis was performed to identify DNA methylation with causal effects on fasting glucose using meQTLs as instrumental variables based on the 1775 individuals. We also used a two-sample MR strategy to perform replication analysis for CpG sites with significant MR effects based on literature data.Our meta-analysis identified 18 significant (p < 5 × 10-8) and independent SNPs for fasting glucose. Interestingly, all 18 SNPs were meQTLs. The MR analysis identified seven CpGs near the G6PC2 gene that mediated the effects of a significant SNP (rs2232326) in the gene on fasting glucose. The MR effects for two CpGs were replicated using summary data based on the European population, using an exonic SNP rs2232328 in G6PC2 as the instrument.Our analysis results suggest that rs2232326 and rs2232328 in G6PC2 may affect DNA methylation at CpGs near the gene and that the methylation may have downstream effects on fasting glucose. Therefore, SNPs in G6PC2 and CpGs near G6PC2 may reside along the pathway that influences fasting glucose levels. This is the first study to report CpGs near G6PC2, an important gene for regulating insulin secretion, mediating the effects of GWAS-significant SNPs on fasting glucose."
"33842534","Mining the Selective Remodeling of DNA Methylation in Promoter Regions to Identify Robust Gene-Level Associations With Phenotype.","Front Mol Biosci","Epigenetics is an essential biological frontier linking genetics to the environment, where DNA methylation is one of the most studied epigenetic events. In recent years, through the epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), researchers have identified thousands of phenotype-related methylation sites. However, the overlaps of identified phenotype-related DNA methylation sites between various studies are often quite small, and it might be due to the fact that methylation remodeling has a certain degree of randomness within the genome. Thus, the identification of robust gene-phenotype associations is crucial to interpreting pathogenesis. How to integrate the methylation values of different sites on the same gene and to mine the DNA methylation at the gene level remains a challenge. A recent study found that the DNA methylation difference of the gene body and promoter region has a strong correlation with gene expression. In this study, we proposed a Statistical difference of DNA Methylation between Promoter and Other Body Region (SIMPO) algorithm to extract DNA methylation values at the gene level. First, by choosing to smoke as an environmental exposure factor, our method led to significant improvements in gene overlaps (from 5 to 17%) between different datasets. In addition, the biological significance of phenotype-related genes identified by SIMPO algorithm is comparable to that of the traditional probe-based methods. Then, we selected two disease contents (e.g., insulin resistance and Parkinson's disease) to show that the biological efficiency of disease-related gene identification increased from 15.43 to 44.44% (p-value = 1.20e-28). In summary, our results declare that mining the selective remodeling of DNA methylation in promoter regions can identify robust gene-level associations with phenotype, and the characteristic remodeling of a given gene's promoter region can reflect the essence of disease.Copyright © 2021 Quan, Liang, Deng, Zhu, Chen and Xiong."
"33841921","Ancestral plastics exposure induces transgenerational disease-specific sperm epigenome-wide association biomarkers.","Environ Epigenet","Plastic-derived compounds are one of the most frequent daily worldwide exposures. Previously a mixture of plastic-derived toxicants composed of bisphenol A, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and dibutyl phthalate at low-dose exposures of a gestating female rats was found to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease to the offspring (F1 generation), grand-offspring (F2 generation), and great-grand-offspring (F3 generation). Epigenetic analysis of the male sperm was found to result in differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) in the transgenerational F3 generation male sperm. The current study is distinct and was designed to use an epigenome-wide association study to identify potential sperm DNA methylation biomarkers for specific transgenerational diseases. Observations indicate disease-specific DMRs called epimutations in the transgenerational F3 generation great-grand-offspring of rats ancestrally exposed to plastics. The epigenetic DMR biomarkers were identified for testis disease, kidney disease, and multiple (≥2) diseases. These disease sperm epimutation biomarkers were found to be predominantly disease-specific. The genomic locations and features of these DMRs were identified. Interestingly, the disease-specific DMR-associated genes were previously shown to be linked with each of the specific diseases. Therefore, the germline has ancestrally derived epimutations that potentially transmit transgenerational disease susceptibilities. Epigenetic biomarkers for specific diseases could be used as diagnostics to facilitate clinical management of disease and preventative medicine.© The Author(s) 2021.

"33840017","The effect of SiNPs on DNA methylation of genome in mouse spermatocytes.","Environ Sci Pollut Res Int","Silica nanoparticles (SiNPs), which are the main inorganic components of atmospheric particulate matter, have been proved to have certain male reproductive toxicity in previous studies. Spermatogenesis involves complex epigenetic regulation, but it is still unclear if SiNPs exposure will interfere with the DNA methylation patterns in mouse spermatocytes. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of SiNPs on DNA methylation in the mouse spermatocyte GC-2spd(ts). GC-2 cells were treated with 0 and 20 μg/mL SiNPs for 24 h. MeDIP-seq assay was then performed to analyze the differentially methylated genes related to spermatogenesis. The results showed that SiNPs induced extensive methylation changes in the genome of GC-2 cells, and 24a total of 428 hyper-methylated genes and 398 hypo-methylated genes were identified. Gene Ontology and pathway analysis showed that differential DNA methylation induced by SiNPs was probably involved with abnormal transcription and translation, mitochondrial damage, and cell apoptosis. Results from qRT-PCR verification showed that the expression of spermatogenesis-related genes Akap1, Crem, Spz1, and Tex11 were dysregulated by SiNPs exposure, which was consistent with the MeDIP-seq assay. In general, this study suggested that SiNPs caused genome-wide DNA methylation changes in GC-2 cells, providing valuable reference for the future epigenetic studies in SiNPs-induced male reproductive toxicity."
"33839117","LINE-1 Methylation Mediates the Inverse Association Between Body Mass Index and Breast Cancer Risk: a pilot study in the Lebanese population.","Environ Res","Lebanon is among the top countries worldwide in combined incidence and mortality of breast cancer, which raises concern about risk factors peculiar to this country. The underlying molecular mechanisms of breast cancer require elucidation, particularly epigenetics, which is recognized as a molecular sensor to environmental exposures.We aim to explore whether DNA methylation levels of AHRR (marker of cigarette smoking), SLC1A5 and TXLNA (markers of alcohol consumption), and LINE-1 (a genome-wide repetitive retrotransposon) can act as molecular mediators underlying putative associations between breast cancer risk and pertinent extrinsic (tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption) and intrinsic factors [age and body mass index (BMI)].This is a cross-sectional pilot study which includes breast cancer cases (N=65) and controls (N=54). DNA methylation levels were measured using bisulfite pyrosequencing on available peripheral blood samples (N= 119), and Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) was used to impute missing DNA methylation values in remaining samples. Multiplemediation analysis was performed to assess direct and indirect (via DNA methylation) effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on breast cancer risk.sIn relation to exposure, AHRR hypo-methylation was associated with cigarette but not waterpipe smoking, suggesting potentially different biomarkers of these two forms of tobacco use; SLC1A5 and TXLNA methylation were not associated with alcohol consumption; LINE-1 methylation was inversely associated with BMI (ß-value [95% confidence interval (CI)]= -0.04 [-0.07, -0.02]), which remained significant after adjustment for age, smoking and alcohol consumption. In relation to breast cancer, there was no detectable association between AHRR, SLC1A5 or TXLNA methylation and cancer risk, but LINE-1 methylation was significantly higher in breast cancer cases when compared to controls (mean ± SD: 72.00 ± 0.66 versus 70.89 ± 0.73, P= 4.67 x 10-14). This difference remained significant after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio (OR) [95% CI]= 9.75[3.74, 25.39]). Moreover, LINE-1 hypo-methylation mediated 83% of the inverse effect of BMI on breast cancer risk.This pilot study demonstrates that alterations in blood LINE-1 methylation mediate the inverse effect of BMI on breast cancer risk. This warrants large scale studies and stratification based on clinic-pathological types of breast cancer.Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Inc."
"33838873","Brain DNA Methylation Patterns in CLDN5 Associated With Cognitive Decline.","Biol Psychiatry","Cognitive trajectory varies widely and can distinguish people who develop dementia from people who remain cognitively normal. Variation in cognitive trajectory is only partially explained by traditional neuropathologies. We sought to identify novel genes associated with cognitive trajectory using DNA methylation profiles from human postmortem brain.We performed a brain epigenome-wide association study of cognitive trajectory in 636 participants from the ROS (Religious Orders Study) and MAP (Rush Memory and Aging Project) using DNA methylation profiles of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. To maximize our power to detect epigenetic associations, we used the recently developed Gene Association with Multiple Traits test to analyze the 5 measured cognitive domains simultaneously.We found an epigenome-wide association for differential methylation of sites in the CLDN5 locus and cognitive trajectory (p = 9.96 × 10-7) that was robust to adjustment for cell type proportions (p = 8.52 × 10-7). This association was primarily driven by association with declines in episodic (p = 4.65 × 10-6) and working (p = 2.54 × 10-7) memory. This association between methylation in CLDN5 and cognitive decline was significant even in participants with no or little signs of amyloid-β and neurofibrillary tangle pathology.Differential methylation of CLDN5, a gene that encodes an important protein of the blood-brain barrier, is associated with cognitive trajectory beyond traditional Alzheimer's disease pathologies. The association between CLDN5 methylation and cognitive trajectory in people with low pathology suggests an early role for CLDN5 and blood-brain barrier dysfunction in cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.Copyright © 2021 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

"33838111","Genome-wide programmable transcriptional memory by CRISPR-based epigenome editing.","Cell","A general approach for heritably altering gene expression has the potential to enable many discovery and therapeutic efforts. Here, we present CRISPRoff-a programmable epigenetic memory writer consisting of a single dead Cas9 fusion protein that establishes DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications. Transient CRISPRoff expression initiates highly specific DNA methylation and gene repression that is maintained through cell division and differentiation of stem cells to neurons. Pairing CRISPRoff with genome-wide screens and analysis of chromatin marks establishes rules for heritable gene silencing. We identify single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) capable of silencing the large majority of genes including those lacking canonical CpG islands (CGIs) and reveal a wide targeting window extending beyond annotated CGIs. The broad ability of CRISPRoff to initiate heritable gene silencing even outside of CGIs expands the canonical model of methylation-based silencing and enables diverse applications including genome-wide screens, multiplexed cell engineering, enhancer silencing, and mechanistic exploration of epigenetic inheritance.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we examined the epigenetic effects induced by in utero chlordecone (CD) exposure on human male cord blood as well as in blood-derived Ke-37 cell line. Genome-wide analysis of histone H3K4me3 distribution revealed that genes related to chromosome segregation, chromatin organization, and cell cycle have altered occupancy in their promoters. The affected regions were enriched in ESR1, SP family, and IKZF1 binding motifs. We also observed a global reduction in H3K9me3, markedly in repeated sequences of the genome. Decrease in H3K9me3 after CD exposure correlates with decreased methylation in LINE-1 promoters and telomere length extension. These observations on human cord blood were assessed in the Ke-37 human cell line. H3K4me3 and the expression of genes related to immune response, DNA repair, and chromatin organization, which were affected in human cord blood were also altered in CD-exposed Ke-37 cells. Our data suggest that developmental exposure to CD leads to profound changes in histone modification patterns and affects the processes controlled by them in human cord blood.© 2021 Legoff et al."
"33835050","Identification of novel functional CpG-SNPs associated with Type 2 diabetes and birth weight.","Aging (Albany NY)","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified hundreds of genetic loci for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and birth weight (BW); however, a large proportion of the total trait heritability remains unexplained. The previous studies were generally focused on individual traits and largely failed to identify the majority of the variants that play key functional roles in the etiology of the disease. Here, we aim to identify novel functional loci for T2D, BW and the pleiotropic variants shared between them by performing a targeted conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) analysis that integrates two independent GWASs with summary statistics for T2D (n= 26,676 cases and 132,532 controls) and BW (n= 153,781) which entails greater statistical power than individual trait analyses. In this analysis, we considered CpG-SNPs, which are SNPs that may influence DNA methylation status, and are therefore considered to be functionally important. We identified 103 novel CpG-SNPs for T2D, 182 novel CpG-SNPs for BW (cFDR < 0.05), and 52 novel pleiotropic loci for both (conjunction cFDR [ccFDR] < 0.05). Among the identified novel CpG-SNPs, 33 were annotated as methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) in whole blood, and 145 displayed at least some effects on meQTL, metabolic QTL (metaQTL), and/or expression QTL (eQTL). These findings may provide further insights into the shared biological mechanisms and functional genetic determinants that overlap between T2D and BW, thereby providing novel potential targets for treatment/intervention development."

Key enzymes responsible for deposition and removal of DNA methylation are known, but how they cooperate to regulate the methylation landscape remains a central question. Using a knockin DNA methylation reporter, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen in human embryonic stem cells to discover DNA methylation regulators. The top screen hit was an uncharacterized gene,QSER1, which proved to be a key guardian of bivalent promoters and poised enhancers of developmental genes, especially those residing in DNA methylation valleys (or canyons).

"33828860","Simplified MethylRAD Sequencing to Detect Changes in DNA Methylation at Enhancer Elements in Differentiating Embryonic Stem Cells.","Epigenomes","Differential DNA methylation is characteristic of gene regulatory regions, such as enhancers, which mostly constitute low or intermediate CpG content in their DNA sequence. Consequently, quantification of changes in DNA methylation at these sites is challenging. Given that DNA methylation across most of the mammalian genome is maintained, the use of genome-wide bisulfite sequencing to measure fractional changes in DNA methylation at specific sites is an overexertion which is both expensive and cumbersome. Here, we developed a MethylRAD technique with an improved experimental plan and bioinformatic analysis tool to examine regional DNA methylation changes in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) during differentiation. The transcriptional silencing of pluripotency genes (PpGs) during ESC differentiation is accompanied by PpG enhancer (PpGe) silencing mediated by the demethylation of H3K4me1 by LSD1. Our MethylRAD data show that in the presence of LSD1 inhibitor, a significant fraction of LSD1-bound PpGe fails to gain DNA methylation. We further show that this effect is mostly observed in PpGes with low/intermediate CpG content. Underscoring the sensitivity and accuracy of MethylRAD sequencing, our study demonstrates that this method can detect small changes in DNA methylation in regulatory regions, including those with low/intermediate CpG content, thus asserting its use as a method of choice for diagnostic purposes."

To better understand the molecular mechanisms of the growth of triploid sea cucumbers, we performed gene expression and genome-wide comparisons of DNA methylation using the body wall tissue of triploid sea cucumbers using RNA-seq and MethylRAD-seq technologies. We clarified the expression pattern of triploid sea cucumbers and found no dosage effect. DEGs were significantly enriched in the pathways of nucleic acid and protein synthesis, cell growth, cell division, and other pathways. Moreover, we characterized the methylation pattern changes and found 615 differentially methylated genes at CCGG sites and 447 differentially methylated genes at CCWGG sites. Integrative analysis identified 23 genes (such as Guf1, SGT, Col5a1, HAL, HPS1, etc.) that exhibited correlations between promoter methylation and expression. Altered DNA methylation and expression of various genes suggested their roles and potential functional interactions in the growth of triploid sea cucumbers. Our data provide new insights into the epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations of the body wall tissue of triploid sea cucumbers and preliminarily elucidate the molecular mechanism of their growth, which is of great significance for the breeding of fine varieties of sea cucumbers."
"33827917","Epigenetic reprogramming of tumor cell-intrinsic STING function sculpts antigenicity and T cell recognition of melanoma.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Lack or loss of tumor antigenicity represents one of the key mechanisms of immune escape and resistance to T cell-based immunotherapies. Evidence suggests that activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling in tumor cells can augment their antigenicity by triggering a type I IFN-mediated sequence of autocrine and paracrine events. Although suppression of this pathway in melanoma and other tumor types has been consistently reported, the mechanistic basis remains unclear. In this study, we asked whether this suppression is, in part, epigenetically regulated and whether it is indeed a driver of melanoma resistance to T cell-based immunotherapies. Using genome-wide DNA methylation profiling, we show that promoter hypermethylation ofcGASandSTINGgenes mediates their coordinated transcriptional silencing and contributes to the widespread impairment of the STING signaling function in clinically-relevant human melanomas and melanoma cell lines. This suppression is reversible through pharmacologic inhibition of DNA methylation, which can reinstate functional STING signaling in at least half of the examined cell lines. Using a series of T cell recognition assays with HLA-matched human melanoma tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), we further show that demethylation-mediated restoration of STING signaling in STING-defective melanoma cell lines can improve their antigenicity through the up-regulation of MHC class I molecules and thereby enhance their recognition and killing by cytotoxic T cells. These findings not only elucidate the contribution of epigenetic processes and specifically DNA methylation in melanoma-intrinsic STING signaling impairment but also highlight their functional significance in mediating tumor-immune evasion and resistance to T cell-based immunotherapies."
"33826720","Prediction of biological age and evaluation of genome-wide dynamic methylomic changes throughout human aging.","G3 (Bethesda)","The use of DNA methylation signatures to predict chronological age and aging rate is of interest in many fields, including disease prevention and treatment, forensics, and anti-aging medicine. Although a large number of methylation markers are significantly associated with age, most age-prediction methods use a few markers selected based on either previously published studies or datasets containing methylation information. Here, we implemented reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) regression and a ridge regression model in a Bayesian framework that utilized phenotypic and methylation profiles simultaneously to predict chronological age. We used over 450,000 CpG sites from the whole blood of a large cohort of 4,409 human individuals with a range of 10-101 years of age. Models were fitted using adjusted and un-adjusted methylation measurements for cell heterogeneity. Un-adjusted methylation scores delivered a significantly higher prediction accuracy than adjusted methylation data, with a correlation between age and predicted age of 0.98 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.54 years in un-adjusted data, and 0.90 (correlation) and 7.16 (RMSE) years in adjusted data. Reducing the number of predictors (CpG sites) through subset selection improved predictive power with a correlation of 0.98 and an RMSE of 2.98 years in the RKHS model. We found distinct global methylation patterns, with a significant increase in the proportion of methylated cytosines in CpG islands and a decreased proportion in other CpG types, including CpG shore, shelf, and open sea (p < 5e-06). Epigenetic drift seemed to be a widespread phenomenon as more than 97% of the age-associated methylation sites had heteroscedasticity. Apparent methylomic aging rate (AMAR) had a sex-specific pattern, with an increase in AMAR in females with age related to males.© The Author(s) (2021).

"33823916","Persistent variations of blood DNA methylation associated with treatment exposures and risk for cardiometabolic outcomes in long-term survivors of childhood cancer in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort.","Genome Med","It is well-established that cancer treatment substantially increases the risk of long-term adverse health outcomes among childhood cancer survivors. However, there is limited research on the underlying mechanisms. To elucidate the pathophysiology and a possible causal pathway from treatment exposures to cardiometabolic conditions, we conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) to identify the DNA methylation (DNAm) sites associated with cancer treatment exposures and examined whether treatment-associated DNAm sites mediate associations between specific treatments and cardiometabolic conditions.We included 2052 survivors (median age 33.7 years) of European ancestry from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study, a retrospective hospital-based study with prospective clinical follow-up. Cumulative doses of chemotherapy and region-specific radiation were abstracted from medical records. Seven cardiometabolic conditions were clinically assessed. DNAm profile was measured using MethylationEPIC BeadChip with blood-derived DNA.By performing multiple treatment-specific EWAS, we identified 935 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites mapped to 538 genes/regions associated with one or more cancer treatments at the epigenome-wide significance level (p < 9 × 10-8). Among the treatment-associated CpGs, 8 were associated with obesity, 63 with hypercholesterolemia, and 17 with hypertriglyceridemia (false discovery rate-adjusted p < 0.05). We observed substantial mediation by methylation at four independent CpGs (cg06963130, cg21922478, cg22976567, cg07403981) for the association between abdominal field radiotherapy (abdominal-RT) and risk of hypercholesterolemia (70.3%) and by methylation at three CpGs (cg19634849, cg13552692, cg09853238) for the association between abdominal-RT and hypertriglyceridemia (54.6%). In addition, three CpGs (cg26572901, cg12715065, cg21163477) partially mediated the association between brain-RT and obesity with a 32.9% mediation effect, and two CpGs mediated the association between corticosteroids and obesity (cg22351187, 14.2%) and between brain-RT and hypertriglyceridemia (cg13360224, 10.5%). Notably, several mediator CpGs reside in the proximity of well-established dyslipidemia genes: cg21922478 (ITGA1) and cg22976567 (LMNA).In childhood cancer survivors, cancer treatment exposures are associated with DNAm patterns present decades following the exposure. Treatment-associated DNAm sites may mediate the causal pathway from specific treatment exposures to certain cardiometabolic conditions, suggesting the utility of DNAm sites as risk predictors and potential mechanistic targets for future intervention studies."
"33821945","DNA Methylation and Blood Pressure Phenotypes: A Review of the Literature.","Am J Hypertens","Genetic studies of DNA have been unable to explain a significant portion of the variance of the estimated heritability of blood pressure (BP). Epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation, have helped explain additional biological processes linked to BP phenotypes and diseases. Candidate gene methylation studies and genome-wide methylation studies of BP have highlighted impactful cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) markers across different ethnicities. Furthermore, many of these BP-related CpG sites are also linked to metabolism-related phenotypes. Integrating epigenome-wide association study data with other layers of molecular data such as genotype data (from single nucleotide polymorphism arrays or sequencing), other epigenetic data, and/or transcriptome data can provide additional information about the significance and complexity of these relationships. Recent data suggest that epigenetic changes can be consequences rather than causes of BP variation. Finally, these data can give insight into downstream effects of long-standing high BP (due to target organ damage (TOD)). The current review provides a literature overview of epigenetic modifications in BP and TOD. Recent studies strongly support the importance of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, in BP and TOD for relevant biological insights, reliable biomarkers, and possible future therapeutics.© American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2021.

We conducted an epigenome-wide study of DNA methylation in CD14+ monocytes and long-term ambient air pollution exposure in adults participating in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). We also assessed the association between differentially methylated signals andcis-gene expression. Using spatiotemporal models, one-year average concentrations of outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and oxides of nitrogen (NOX) were estimated at participants' homes. We assessed DNA methylation and gene expression using Illumina 450k and HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips, respectively (n = 1,207). We used bump hunting and site-specific approaches to identify differentially methylated signals (false discovery rate of 0.05) and used linear models to assess associations between differentially methylated signals andcis-gene expression. Four differentially methylated regions (DMRs) located on chromosomes 5, 6, 7, and 16 (within or nearSDHAP3, ZFP57, HOXA5, andPRM1, respectively) were associated with PM2.5. The DMRs on chromosomes 5 and 6 also associated with NOX. The DMR on chromosome 5 had the smallest p-value for both PM2.5(p = 1.4×10-6) and NOX(p = 7.7×10-6). Three differentially methylated CpGs were identified for PM2.5, and cg05926640 (nearTOMM20) had the smallest p-value (p = 5.6×10-8). NOXsignificantly associated with cg11756214 withinZNF347(p = 5.6×10-8). Several differentially methylated signals were also associated withcis-gene expression. The DMR located on chromosome 7 was associated with the expression ofHOXA5, HOXA9, andHOXA10. The DMRs located on chromosomes 5 and 16 were associated with expression ofMRPL36andDEXI, respectively. The CpG cg05926640 was associated with expression ofARID4B, IRF2BP2, andTOMM20. We identified differential DNA methylation in monocytes associated with long-term air pollution exposure. Methylation signals associated with gene expression might help explain how air pollution contributes to cardiovascular disease."
"33816499","Pan-Cancer Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Analyses Revealed That Hypermethylation Influences 3D Architecture and Gene Expression Dysregulation in HOXA Locus During Carcinogenesis of Cancers.","Front Cell Dev Biol","DNA methylation dysregulation during carcinogenesis has been widely discussed in recent years. However, the pan-cancer DNA methylation biomarkers and corresponding biological mechanisms were seldom investigated. We identified differentially methylated sites and regions from 5,056 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples across 10 cancer types and then validated the findings using 48 manually annotated datasets consisting of 3,394 samples across nine cancer types from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). All samples' DNA methylation profile was evaluated with Illumina 450K microarray to narrow down the batch effect. Nine regions were identified as commonly differentially methylated regions across cancers in TCGA and GEO cohorts. Among these regions, a DNA fragment consisting of ∼1,400 bp detected inside the HOXA locus instead of the boundary may relate to the co-expression attenuation of genes inside the locus during carcinogenesis. We further analyzed the 3D DNA interaction profile by the publicly accessible Hi-C database. Consistently, the HOXA locus in normal cell lines compromised isolated topological domains while merging to the domain nearby in cancer cell lines. In conclusion, the dysregulation of the HOXA locus provides a novel insight into pan-cancer carcinogenesis.Copyright © 2021 Liu, Liu, Sun, Xia, Liu and Liu."

However, no study has specifically examinedANK1histone modifications in the disease. We use chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR to quantify tri-methylation at histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and 27 (H3K27me3) in theANK1gene in entorhinal cortex from donors with high (n = 59) or low (n = 29) Alzheimer's disease pathology. We demonstrate decreased levels of H3K4me3, a marker of active gene transcription, with no change in H3K27me3, a marker of inactive genes. H3K4me3 is negatively correlated with DNA methylation in specific regions of theANK1gene. Our study suggests that theANK1gene shows altered epigenetic marks indicative of reduced gene activation in Alzheimer's disease.© 2021 Katie Lunnon."
"33814129","Hemorrhage and saline resuscitation are associated with epigenetic and proteomic reprogramming in the rat lung.","Injury","Epigenetic changes have been described in trauma patients in the form of histone acetylation events, but whether DNA-methylation occurs remains unknown. We hypothesized that the combination of hemorrhage and saline resuscitation would alter DNA-methylation and associated proteomic profiles in the rat lung.Ten rats were subjected to a pressure-controlled hemorrhage and resuscitation model consisting of hemorrhage to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 35mmHg for 90 minutes, followed by saline resuscitation to a MAP >70mmHg for 90 minutes (n=5) or sham (only anesthesia and cannulation). Lungs were harvested and subjected to reduced genome wide DNA-methylation analysis through bisulphite sequencing as well as proteomics analysis. Data was analyzed for differentially methylated regions and associated alterations in proteomic networks through a weighted correlation network analysis (WCNA). Pathway analysis was used to establish biological relevance of findings.Hemorrhage and saline resuscitation were associated with differential methylation of 353 sites across the genome compared to the sham group. Of these, 30 were localized to gene promoter regions, 31 to exon regions and 87 to intron regions. Network analysis identified an association between hemorrhage/resuscitation and DNA-methylation events located to genes involved in areas of endothelial and immune response signaling. The associated proteomic response was characterized by activations of mRNA processing as well as endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) metabolism.We demonstrated an association between DNA-methylation and hemorrhage/saline resuscitation. These results suggest a potential role of DNA-methylation in the host response to injury.Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation can mediate these effects causing changes in gene expression leading to onset of obesity. Studies of genetic isolates have the potential to provide new epigenetic insights with advantages such as reduced genetic diversity and environmental exposures.This was an exploratory study of genome-wide DNA methylation in relation to body fat traits in 47 healthy adults from the genetic isolate of Norfolk Island. Quantitative body fat traits (body fat percentage, body mass index, hip circumference, waist circumference, waist-hip-ratio and weight) were carefully measured. DNA methylation data was obtained from peripheral blood using Illumina 450K arrays. Multi-trait analysis was performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). CpG by trait association testing was performed using stepwise linear regressions. Two components were identified that explained approximately 89% of the phenotypic variance. In total, 5 differential methylated positions (DMPs) were identified at genome-wide significance (P≤ 2.4 × 10-7), which mapped to GOT2-CDH8, LYSMD3, HIBADH, ADGRD1 and EBF4 genes. Gene set enrichment analysis of 848 genes containing suggestive DMPs (P≤ 1.0 × 10-4) implicated the Cadherin (28 genes, Padj = 6.76 × 10-7) and Wnt signaling pathways (38 genes, Padj = 7.78 × 10-6).This study provides new insights into the epigenetically influenced genes and pathways underlying body fat variation in a healthy cohort and provides targets for consideration in future studies of obesity risk.Copyright © 2021 The Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.

Consequently, the need for more reliable and objective markers are highly needed. The aim of this pilot study was to apply genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on a series of atypical meningiomas to evaluate the practical utility of this approach, examine whether prognostic subclasses are achieved and investigate whether there is an association between the methylation subclasses with poor prognosis and time to recurrence.NF1/2mutation analyses were also performed to explore the prognostic value of such mutations in these atypical meningiomas.Methods: Twenty intracranial WHO grade II atypical meningiomas from adult patients were included. They consisted of 10 cases with recurrence (group I), and 10 cases without recurrence (group II). The formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues underwent standardized genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, and the profiles were matched with the reference library and tumor classifier from Heidelberg.NF1/2somatic mutation analyses were performed using the CNSv1panel from Düsseldorf.Results: Eighteen out of 20 cases matched to the meningioma class using the common brain tumor classifier (v11b4). Four of these cases matched to a methylation subclass related to a prognostic subgroup based on a cut-off of 0.9.NF2mutations were detected in 55% of cases across both groups, and the most prominent copy number alterations were chromosomal losses of 22q, 1p and 14q. No significantNF1mutations were identified.Conclusions: Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling represents a useful tool in the diagnostics of meningiomas, however, methodological adjustments need to be addressed."

No curative treatments are available, but the follow-up in specialized centers has greatly improved the patient life expectancy. Robust biomarkers are required to monitor the disease, guide treatments, stratify patients, and provide outcome measures in clinical trials. In the present study, we outline a strategy to select putative DNA methylation biomarkers of lung disease severity in cystic fibrosis patients. In the discovery step, we selected seven potential biomarkers using a genome-wide DNA methylation dataset that we generated in nasal epithelial samples from the MethylCF cohort. In the replication step, we assessed the same biomarkers using sputum cell samples from the MethylBiomark cohort. Of interest, DNA methylation at the cg11702988 site (ATP11Agene) positively correlated with lung function and BMI, and negatively correlated with lung disease severity,P. aeruginosachronic infection, and the number of exacerbations. These results were replicated in prospective sputum samples collected at four time points within an 18-month period and longitudinally. To conclude, (i) we identified a DNA methylation biomarker that correlates with CF severity, (ii) we provided a method to easily assess this biomarker, and (iii) we carried out the first longitudinal analysis of DNA methylation in CF patients. This new epigenetic biomarker could be used to stratify CF patients in clinical trials."

Given the limitations of current diagnostic methods, the development of fast and accurate tests for the diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections would improve patient management and treatment, as well as contribute to reducing antibiotic misuse in clinical settings. In this scenario, analysis of host transcriptomics constitutes a promising target to develop new diagnostic tests based on the host-specific response to infections. We carried out a multi-cohort meta-analysis of blood transcriptomic data available in public databases, including 11 different studies and 1209 samples from virus- (n= 695) and bacteria- (n= 514) infected patients. We applied a Parallel Regularized Regression Model Search (PReMS) on a set of previously reported genes that distinguished viral from bacterial infection to find a minimum gene expression bio-signature. This strategy allowed us to detect three genes, namelyBAFT,ISG15andDNMT1, that clearly differentiate groups of infection with high accuracy (training set: area under the curve (AUC) 0.86 (sensitivity: 0.81; specificity: 0.87); testing set: AUC 0.87 (sensitivity: 0.82; specificity: 0.86)).BAFTandISG15are involved in processes related to immune response, whileDNMT1is related to the preservation of methylation patterns, and its expression is modulated by pathogen infections. We successfully tested this three-transcript signature in the 11 independent studies, demonstrating its high performance under different scenarios. The main advantage of this three-gene signature is the low number of genes needed to differentiate both groups of patient categories."

A promising frontier in the definition of glioma prognosis and treatment is represented by epigenetics. Furthermore, in this study, we developed a machine learning classification model based on epigenetic data (CpG probes) to separate patients according to their state of immunosuppression. We considered 573 cases of low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). First, from gene expression data, we derived a novel binary indicator to flag patients with a favorable immune state. Then, based on previous studies, we selected the genes related to the immune state of tumor microenvironment. After, we improved the selection with a data-driven procedure, based on Boruta. Finally, we tuned, trained, and evaluated both random forest and neural network classifiers on the resulting dataset. We found that a multi-layer perceptron network fed by the 338 probes selected by applying both expert choice and Boruta results in the best performance, achieving an out-of-sample accuracy of 82.8%, a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.657, and an area under the ROC curve of 0.9. Based on the proposed model, we provided a method to stratify glioma patients according to their epigenomic state."

Most breast cancer-specific circulating methylatedCCDC181,GCM2andITPRIPL1biomarkers were found in the plasma. An automatic analysis process of methylated ccfDNA was established. A combined analysis ofCCDC181,GCM2andITPRIPL1(CGIm) was performed in R using Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees to establish a new prediction model. Combined analysis ofCCDC181,GCM2andITPRIPL1(CGIm) was found to have a sensitivity level of 97% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.955 in the training set, and a sensitivity level of 100% and an AUC of 0.961 in the test set. The circulating methylatedCCDC181,GCM2andITPRIPL1was also significantly decreased after surgery (allp< 0.001). The aberrant methylation patterns of theCCDC181,GCM2andITPRIPL1genes means that they are potential biomarkers for the detection of early BC and can be combined with breast imaging data to achieve higher accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, facilitating breast cancer detection.

Excessive adipocyte hypertrophy causes fibrosis, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction in adipose tissue, as well as impaired adipogenesis. Similarly, disturbed ECM remodeling in SM has metabolic consequences such as decreased insulin sensitivity. Most of described ECM molecular alterations have been associated with DNA sequence variation, alterations in gene expression patterns, and epigenetic modifications. Among others, the most important epigenetic mechanism by which cells are able to modulate their gene expression is DNA methylation. Epigenome-Wide Association Studies (EWAS) have become a powerful approach to identify DNA methylation variation associated with biological traits in humans. Likewise, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and gene expression microarrays have allowed the study of whole-genome genetics and transcriptomics patterns in obesity and metabolic diseases. The aim of this review is to explore the molecular basis of ECM in WAT and SM remodeling in obesity and the consequences of metabolic complications. For that purpose, we reviewed scientific literature including all omics approaches reporting genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic (GWAS, EWAS, and RNA-seq or cDNA arrays) ECM-related alterations in WAT and SM as associated with metabolic dysfunction and obesity."

To facilitate future studies of the epigenetic underpinnings of aging effects in the female reproductive axis, several DNA methylation-based biomarkers of aging (epigenetic clocks) for bovine oocytes are presented. One such clock was germane to only oocytes, while a dual-tissue clock was highly predictive of age in both oocytes and blood. Dual species clocks that apply to both humans and cattle were also developed and evaluated. These epigenetic clocks can be used to accurately estimate the biological age of oocytes. Both epigenetic clock studies and epigenome-wide association studies revealed that blood and oocytes differ substantially with respect to aging and the underlying epigenetic signatures that potentially influence the aging process. The rate of epigenetic aging was found to be slower in oocytes compared to blood; however, oocytes appeared to begin at an older epigenetic age. The epigenetic clocks for oocytes are expected to address questions in the field of reproductive aging, including the central question: how to slow aging of oocytes.© 2021 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between transcriptomic and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a well-stratified, treatment-naïve severe UC patient population in order to define specific epigenetic changes that could be responsible for the grade of disease severity. Mucosal biopsies from treatment-naïve severe UC patients (n = 8), treatment-naïve mild UC (n = 8), and healthy controls (n = 8) underwent both whole transcriptome RNA-Seq and genome-wide DNA bisulfite- sequencing, and principal component analysis (PCA), cell deconvolutions and diverse statistical methods were applied to obtain a dataset of significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with correlation to DNA methylation for severe UC. DNA hypo-methylation correlated with approximately 80% of all DEGs in severe UC when compared to mild UC. Enriched pathways of annotated hypo-methylated genes revealed neutrophil degranulation, and immuno-regulatory interactions of the lymphoid system. Specifically, hypo-methylated anti-inflammatory genes found for severe UC were IL10, SIGLEC5, CD86, CLMP and members of inflammasomes NLRP3 and NLRC4. Hypo-methylation of anti-inflammatory genes during severe UC implies an interplay between the epithelium and lamina propria in order to mitigate inflammation in the gut. The specifically DNA hypo-methylated genes found for severe UC can potentially be useful biomarkers for determining disease severity and in the development of new targeted treatment strategies for severe UC patients."

The spontaneous canine model, which has clinical, epidemiological, and histological similarities with human HS and specific breed predispositions, provides a unique opportunity to unravel the genetic basis of this cancer. In this study, we aimed to identify germline risk factors associated with the development of HS in canine-predisposed breeds. We used a methodology that combined several genome-wide association studies in a multi-breed and multi-cancer approach as well as targeted next-generation sequencing, and imputation We combined several dog breeds (Bernese mountain dogs, Rottweilers, flat-coated retrievers, and golden retrievers), and three hematopoietic cancers (HS, lymphoma, and mast cell tumor). Results showed that we not only refined the previously identified HS risk CDKN2A locus, but also identified new loci on canine chromosomes 2, 5, 14, and 20. Capture and targeted sequencing of specific loci suggested the existence of regulatory variants in non-coding regions and methylation mechanisms linked to risk haplotypes, which lead to strong cancer predisposition in specific dog breeds. We also showed that these canine cancer predisposing loci appeared to be due to the additive effect of several risk haplotypes involved in other hematopoietic cancers such as lymphoma or mast cell tumors as well. This illustrates the pleiotropic nature of these canine cancer loci as observed in human oncology, thereby reinforcing the interest of predisposed dog breeds to study cancer initiation and progression."

However, it is unknown whether these signatures in ME/CFS include abnormal levels of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE and ACE2, the latter being the main receptor described for host-cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2. To investigate that, we first reviewed published case-control genome-wide association studies based on single nucleotide polymorphism data, case-control epigenome-wide association studies based on DNA methylation data, and case-control gene expression studies based on microarray data. From these published studies, we did not find any evidence for a difference between patients with ME/CFS and healthy controls in terms of genetic variation, DNA methylation, and gene expression levels ofACEandACE2. In line with this evidence, the analysis of a new data set on theACE/ACE2gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not find any differences between a female cohort of 37 patients and 34 age-matched healthy controls. Future studies should be conducted to extend this investigation to other potential receptors used by SARS-CoV-2. These studies will help researchers and clinicians to better assess the health risk imposed by this virus when infecting patients with this debilitating disease."

Biomarkers that can predict aggressive diseases independently of clinical features are needed to improve risk stratification of localized PCa patients and reduce overtreatment. We aimed to identify leukocyte DNA methylation differences between clinically defined aggressive and non-aggressive PCa. We performed whole genome DNA methylation profiling in leukocyte DNA from 287 PCa patients with Gleason Score (GS) 6 and ≥8 using Illumina 450k methylation arrays. We observed a global hypomethylation in GS≥8 patients compared to GS=6 PCa patients; in contrast, the methylation level in core promoter and exon 1 region was significantly higher in GS≥8 patients than GS=6 PCa. We then performed 5-fold cross validated random forest model training on 1,459 differentially methylated CpG Probes (DMPs) with false discovery rate (FDR) <0.01 between GS=6 and GS≥8 groups. The power of the predictive model was further reinforced by ranking the DMPs with Decreased Gini and re-train the model with the top 97 DMPs (Testing AUC=0.920, predict accuracy =0.847). In conclusion, we identified a CpG methylation signature in leukocyte DNA that is associated with aggressive clinical features of PCa at diagnosis.AJCR Copyright © 2021."

In this study, we analyzed genome-wide mRNA profiles in GBM patients derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases to identify mRNA-based signatures for GBM prognosis with survival analysis. Univariate Cox regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between the expression of mRNA and the prognosis of patients with GBM. We established a risk score model that consisted of six mRNA (AACS, STEAP1, STEAP2, G6PC3, FKBP9, and LOXL1) by the LASSO regression method. The six-mRNA signature could divide patients into a high-risk and a low-risk group with significantly different survival rates in training and test sets. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that it was an independent prognostic factor in GBM patients, and it has a superior predictive power as compared with age, IDH mutation status, MGMT, and G-CIMP methylation status. By combining this signature and clinical risk factors, a nomogram can be established to predict 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS in GBM patients with relatively high accuracy.Copyright © 2021 Liu, Zhang, Hu, Cai, Lu, Liang, Qian, Wang and Jiang."

In this study, lncRNAs of Brassica rapa were classified into long intergenic noncoding RNAs, natural antisense RNAs, and intronic noncoding RNAs and their expression analyzed in relation to genome-wide 24-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), DNA methylation, and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation marks (H3K27me3). More than 65% of the lncRNAs analyzed consisted of one exon, and more than 55% overlapped with inverted repeat regions (IRRs). Overlap of lncRNAs with IRRs or genomic regions encoding for 24-nt siRNAs resulted in increased DNA methylation levels when both were present. LncRNA did not overlap greatly with H3K27me3 marks, but the expression level of intronic noncoding RNAs that did coincide with H3K27me3 marks was higher than without H3K27me3 marks. The Brassica genus comprises important vegetables and oil seed crops grown across the world. B. rapa is a diploid (AA genome) thought to be one of the ancestral species of both B. juncea (AABB genome) and B. napus (AACC) through genome merging (allotetrapolyploidization). Complex genome restructuring and epigenetic alterations are thought to be involved in these allotetrapolyploidization events. Comparison of lncRNAs between B. rapa and B. nigra, B. oleracea, B. juncea, and B. napus showed the highest conservation with B. oleracea. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the epigenome structure of B. rapa at multi-epigenetic levels (siRNAs, DNA methylation, H3K27me3, and lncRNAs) and identified a suite of candidate lncRNAs that may be epigenetically regulated in the Brassica genus."

Data were analyzed using six Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies including Deep Learning (DL) followed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used for AD prediction. We identified 152 significantly (FDR p<0.05) differentially methylated intragenic CpGs in 171 distinct genes in AD patients compared to controls. All AI platforms accurately predicted AD with AUCs ≥0.93 using 283,143 intragenic and 244,246 intergenic/extragenic CpGs. DL had an AUC = 0.99 using intragenic CpGs, with both sensitivity and specificity being 97%. High AD prediction was also achieved using intergenic/extragenic CpG sites (DL significance value being AUC = 0.99 with 97% sensitivity and specificity). Epigenetically altered genes included CR1L & CTSV (abnormal morphology of cerebral cortex), S1PR1 (CNS inflammation), and LTB4R (inflammatory response). These genes have been previously linked with AD and dementia. The differentially methylated genes CTSV & PRMT5 (ventricular hypertrophy and dilation) are linked to cardiovascular disease and of interest given the known association between impaired cerebral blood flow, cardiovascular disease, and AD. We report a novel, minimally invasive approach using peripheral blood leucocyte epigenomics, and AI analysis to detect AD and elucidate its pathogenesis."

Preference of meat depends on various factors with muscle play the central role. In this regards, selective breeding abled us to develop ""Nanchukmacdon"" a pig breeds with an enhanced variety of meat and high fertility rate. To identify genomic regions under selection we performed whole-genome resequencing, transcriptome, and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing from Nanchukmacdon muscles samples and used published data for three other breeds such as Landrace, Duroc, Jeju native pig and analyzed the functional characterization of candidate genes. In this study, we present a comprehensive approach to identify candidate genes by using multi-omics approaches. We performed two different methods XP-EHH, XP-CLR to identify traces of artificial selection for traits of economic importance. Moreover, RNAseq analysis was done to identify differentially expressed genes in the crossed breed population. Several genes (UGT8, ZGRF1, NDUFA10, EBF3, ELN, UBE2L6, NCALD, MELK, SERP2, GDPD5, and FHL2) were identified as selective sweep and differentially expressed in muscles related pathways. Furthermore, nucleotide diversity analysis revealed low genetic diversity in Nanchukmacdon for identified genes in comparison to related breeds and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data shows the critical role of DNA methylation pattern in identified genes that leads to enhanced variety of meat. This work demonstrates a way to identify the molecular signature and lays a foundation for future genomic enabled pig breeding."
"33784941","DNA methylation signatures in cord blood associated with birthweight are enriched for dmCpGs previously associated with maternal hypertension or pre-eclampsia, smoking and folic acid intake.","Epigenetics","Many epidemiological studies have linked low birthweight to an increased risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in later life, with epigenetic proceseses suggested as an underlying mechanism. Here, we sought to identify neonatal methylation changes associated with birthweight, at both the individual CpG and genomic regional level, and whether the birthweight-associated methylation signatures were associated with specific maternal factors. Using the Illumina Human MethylationEPIC array we assessed DNA methylation in the cord blood of 557 and 483 infants from the UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial and Southampton Women's Survey, respectively. Adjusting for gestational age and other covariates, an epigenome-wide association study identified 2911 (FDR≤0.05) and 236 (Bonferroni corrected p≤6.45x10-8) differentially methylated CpGs (dmCpGs), and 1230 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (Stouffer ≤0.05) associated with birthweight. The top birthweight-associated dmCpG was located within the Homeobox Telomere-Binding Protein 1 (HMBOX1) gene with a 195g (95%CI: -241, -149g) decrease in birthweight per 10% increase in methylation, while the top DMR was located within the promoter of corticotropin releasing hormone binding protein (CRHBP).. Furthermore, the birthweight-related dmCpGs were enriched for dmCpGs previously associated with gestational hypertension/pre-eclampsia (14.51%, p=1.37x10-255), maternal smoking (7.71%, p=1.50x10-57) and maternal plasma folate levels during pregnancy (0.33%, p=0.029). The identification of birthweight-associated methylation markers, particularly those connected to specific pregnancy complications and exposures, may provide insights into the developmental pathways that affect birthweight and/or suggest surrogate markers to identify adverse prenatal exposures for stratifying for individuals at risk of later NCDs."
"33784351","Differential methylation and expression patterns of microRNAs in relation to breast cancer subtypes among American women of African and European ancestry.","PLoS One","Aggressive high-grade, estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer is more common among American women of African ancestry (AA) than those of European ancestry (EA). Epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation and altered microRNA (miRNA) expression, may contribute to racial differences in breast cancer. However, few studies have specifically characterized genome-wide DNA methylation-based modifications at the miRNA level in relation to ER+ and ER- subtype, and their functional role in the regulation of miRNA expression, especially among high risk AA women. In this study, we evaluated DNA methylation patterns of miRNA encoding genes and their effect on expression in breast tumors from both AA and EA women. The genome-wide methylation screen identified a total of 7,191 unique CpGs mapped to 1,292 miRNA genes, corresponding to 2,035 unique mature miRNAs. We identified differentially methylated loci (DMLs: (|delta β|)>0.10, FDR<0.05) between ER- and ER+ tumor subtypes, including 290 DMLs shared in both races, 317 and 136 were specific to AA and EA women, respectively. Integrated analysis identified certain DMLs whose methylation levels were significantly correlated with the expression of relevant miRNAs, such as multiple CpGs within miR-190b and miR-135b highly negatively correlated with their expression. These results were then validated in the TCGA dataset. Target prediction and pathway analysis showed that these DNA methylation-dysregulated miRNAs are involved in multiple cancer-related pathways, including cell cycle G1-S growth factor regulation, cytoskeleton remodeling, angiogenesis, EMT, and ESR1-mediated signaling pathways. In summary, our results suggest that DNA methylation changes within miRNA genes are associated with altered miRNA expression, which may contribute to the network of subtype- and race-related tumor biological differences in breast cancer. These findings support the involvement of epigenetic regulation of miRNA expression and provide insights into the relations of clinical-relevant miRNAs to their target genes, which may serve as potential preventative and therapeutic targets."

"33779761","Maize Decrease in DNA methylation 1 targets RNA-directed DNA methylation on active chromatin.","Plant Cell","DNA methylation plays vital roles in repressing transposable element (TE) activity and regulating gene expression. The chromatin-remodeling factor Decrease in DNA methylation 1 (DDM1) is crucial for maintaining DNA methylation across diverse plant species, and is required for RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) to maintain mCHH islands in maize (Zea mays). However, the mechanisms by which DDM1 is involved in RdDM are not well understood. In this work, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to ascertain the genome-wide occupancy of ZmDDM1 in the maize genome. The results revealed that ZmDDM1 recognized an 8-bp-long GC-rich degenerate DNA sequence motif, which is enriched in transcription start sites (TSSs) and other euchromatic regions. Meanwhile, 24-nucleotide siRNAs and CHH methylation were delineated at the edge of ZmDDM1-occupied sites. ZmDDM1 co-purified with Argonaute 4 (ZmAGO4) proteins, providing further evidence that ZmDDM1 is a component of RdDM complexes in planta. Consistent with this, the vast majority of ZmDDM1-targeted regions co-localized with ZmAGO4-bound genomic sites. Overall, our results suggest a model that ZmDDM1 may be recruited to euchromatic regions via recognition of a GC-rich motif, thereby remodeling chromatin to provide access for RdDM activities in maize.© The Author(s) 2021.

"33777442","Ultra-Low DNA Input into Whole Genome Methylation Assays and Detection of Oncogenic Methylation and Copy Number Variants in Circulating Tumour DNA.","Epigenomes","Abnormal CpG methylation in cancer is ubiquitous and generally detected in tumour specimens using a variety of techniques at a resolution encompassing single CpG loci to genome wide coverage. Analysis of samples with very low DNA inputs, such as formalin fixed (FFPE) biopsy specimens from clinical trials or circulating tumour DNA is challenging at the genome-wide level because of lack of available input. We present the results of low input experiments into the Illumina Infinium HD methylation assay on FFPE specimens and ctDNA samples.For all experiments, the Infinium HD assay for methylation was used. In total, forty-eight FFPE specimens were used at varying concentrations (lowest input 50 ng); eighteen blood derived specimens (lowest input 10 ng) and six matched ctDNA input (lowest input 10 ng)/fresh tumour specimens (lowest input 250 ng) were processed. Downstream analysis was performed in R/Bioconductor for quality control metrics and differential methylation analysis as well as copy number calls.Correlation coefficients for CpG methylation were high at the probe level averaged R2 = 0.99 for blood derived samples and R2 > 0.96 for the FFPE samples. When matched ctDNA/fresh tumour samples were compared, R2 > 0.91 between the two. Results of differential methylation analysis did not vary significantly by DNA input in either the blood or FFPE groups. There were differences seen in the ctDNA group as compared to their paired tumour sample, possibly because of enrichment for tumour material without contaminating normal. Copy number variants observed in the tumour were generally also seen in the paired ctDNA sample with good concordance via DQ plot.The Illumina Infinium HD methylation assay can robustly detect methylation across a range of sample types, including ctDNA, down to an input of 10 ng. It can also reliably detect oncogenic methylation changes and copy number variants in ctDNA. These findings demonstrate that these samples can now be accessed by methylation array technology, allowing analysis of these important sample types."

In this study, we investigated the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying sex maintenance in Chinese alligators through RNA sequencing and bisulfite sequencing data analyses of the adult gonads. We identified the genes and pathways (e. g., DMRT1-SOX9-AMH pathway for males and oocyte meiotic maturation pathway for females) involved in male and female sex maintenance and gonadal development of adult Chinese alligators. In contrast to their expression patterns in the embryo, bothDMRT1and the steroid hormone biosynthesis related genes showed a male-biased expression in adult gonads. The overall DNA methylation density and level were higher in testes than in ovaries. Hypermethylation in the gene bodies enhanced the expression of male-biased genes (such as DMRT1-SOX9-AMH and steroid hormone biosynthesis related genes) in the testis, as opposed to the normalization of gene expression. Our results provide insights into the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying sex maintenance in adult Chinese alligators, and are expected to contribute to the development of scientific programs for the successful conservation of this endangered species.Copyright © 2021 Lin, Yu, Sun and Fang."
"33771206","Meta-analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation identifies shared associations across neurodegenerative disorders.","Genome Biol","People with neurodegenerative disorders show diverse clinical syndromes, genetic heterogeneity, and distinct brain pathological changes, but studies report overlap between these features. DNA methylation (DNAm) provides a way to explore this overlap and heterogeneity as it is determined by the combined effects of genetic variation and the environment. In this study, we aim to identify shared blood DNAm differences between controls and people with Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease.We use a mixed-linear model method (MOMENT) that accounts for the effect of (un)known confounders, to test for the association of each DNAm site with each disorder. While only three probes are found to be genome-wide significant in each MOMENT association analysis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease (and none with Alzheimer's disease), a fixed-effects meta-analysis of the three disorders results in 12 genome-wide significant differentially methylated positions. Predicted immune cell-type proportions are disrupted across all neurodegenerative disorders. Protein inflammatory markers are correlated with profile sum-scores derived from disease-associated immune cell-type proportions in a healthy aging cohort. In contrast, they are not correlated with MOMENT DNAm-derived profile sum-scores, calculated using effect sizes of the 12 differentially methylated positions as weights.We identify shared differentially methylated positions in whole blood between neurodegenerative disorders that point to shared pathogenic mechanisms. These shared differentially methylated positions may reflect causes or consequences of disease, but they are unlikely to reflect cell-type proportion differences."

Our study aimed to reveal the role of DNA methylation in peripheral monocytes of pSS patients.A total of 11 pSS patients and five age-matched healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using magnetic microbeads. DNA methylation profiles were generated using Human Methylation 850K BeadChips.In monocytes from pSS patients, we identified 2819 differentially methylated positions (DMPs), comprising 1977 hypomethylated- and 842 hypermethylated-DMPs, corresponding to 1313 unique genes when compared with HCs. IFI44L, MX1, PAARP9, and IFITM1, which influence the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway, were among the genes hypomethylated in pSS. Functional analysis of genes with a minimum of two DMPs showed involvement in antigen binding, transcriptional regulation, cell adhesion, IFN-γ pathway, type I IFN pathway, antigen presentation, EB virus infection, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 virus infection, and metabolic disease-related pathways. In addition, patients with higher serum IgG levels exhibited enrichment in Notch signaling and metabolic-related pathways. Upon comparing monocytes with salivary gland epithelial cells, an important overlap was observed in the cell cycle, cell senescence, and interleukin-17 signaling pathways.

Despite its high prevalence, only half of HF patients respond to guideline-directed medical management, prompting therapeutic efforts to confront the molecular underpinnings of its heterogeneity. In the current study, we examined epigenetics as a yet unexplored source of heterogeneity among patients with end-stage HF. Specifically, a multicohort-based study was designed to quantify cardiac genome-wide cytosine-p-guanine (CpG) methylation of cardiac biopsies from male patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. In both pilot (n = 11) and testing (n = 31) cohorts, unsupervised multidimensional scaling of genome-wide myocardial DNA methylation exhibited a bimodal distribution of CpG methylation found largely to occur in the promoter regions of metabolic genes. Among the available patient attributes, only categorical self-identified patient race could delineate this methylation signature, with African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) samples clustering separately. Because race is a social construct, and thus a poor proxy of human physiology, extensive review of medical records was conducted, but ultimately failed to identify co-variates of race at the time of LVAD surgery. By contrast, retrospective analysis exposed a higher all-cause mortality among AA (56.3%) relative to CA (16.7%) patients at 2 years following LVAD placement (P=0.03). Geocoding-based approximation of patient demographics uncovered disparities in income levels among AA relative to CA patients. Therefore, although additional studies are needed, the current analysis implicates cardiac DNA methylation as a previously unrecognized indicator of socioeconomic disparity in human heart failure outcomes."

DNA methylation (DNAm) quantitative trait loci (mQTL) mapping was performed for 235 of the 313 variants with minor allele frequencies > 5%. Stability of identified mQTLs (p < 5e-8) across lifetime was examined using a public mQTL database. Identified mQTLs were also mapped to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project and the eQTLGen Consortium.Breast cancer PRS was not associated with DNAm. A higher proportion of significant cis-mQTLs were observed. Of 822 significant cis-mQTLs (179 unique variants) identified in our dataset, 141 (59 unique variants) were significant (p < 5e-8) in a public mQTL database. Eighty-six percent (121/141) of the matched mQTLs were consistent at multiple time points (birth, childhood, adolescence, pregnancy, middle age, post-diagnosis, or treatment). Ninety-three variants associated with DNAm were also cis-eQTLs (35 variants not genome-wide significant). Multiple loci in the breast cancer PRS are associated with DNAm, contributing to the polygenic nature of the disease. These mQTLs are mostly stable over time.Consistent results from DNAm and expression data may reveal new candidate genes not previously associated with breast cancer."

Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have pioneered competitive long read platforms, with more recent work focused on improving sequencing throughput and per-base accuracy. We used whole-genome sequencing data produced by three PacBio protocols (Sequel II CLR, Sequel II HiFi, RS II) and two ONT protocols (Rapid Sequencing and Ligation Sequencing) to compare assemblies of the bacteria Escherichia coli and the fruit fly Drosophila ananassae. In both organisms tested, Sequel II assemblies had the highest consensus accuracy, even after accounting for differences in sequencing throughput. ONT and PacBio CLR had the longest reads sequenced compared to PacBio RS II and HiFi, and genome contiguity was highest when assembling these datasets. ONT Rapid Sequencing libraries had the fewest chimeric reads in addition to superior quantification of E. coli plasmids versus ligation-based libraries. The quality of assemblies can be enhanced by adopting hybrid approaches using Illumina libraries for bacterial genome assembly or polishing eukaryotic genome assemblies, and an ONT-Illumina hybrid approach would be more cost-effective for many users. Genome-wide DNA methylation could be detected using both technologies, however ONT libraries enabled the identification of a broader range of known E. coli methyltransferase recognition motifs in addition to undocumented D. ananassae motifs.

In the Isle of Wight (IoW) birth cohort, genome-wide DNA methylation in whole blood was measured using Illumina Infinium Human450 and EPIC BeadChip arrays in n = 325 subjects, and pre- to post-adolescence BMI transition was classified into four groups: (1) normal to normal, (2) normal to overweight or obese, (3) overweight or obese to normal, and (4) persistent overweight or obese. We used recursive random forest to screen genome-wide Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites with DNAm potentially associated with BMI transition for each gender, and the association of BMI status transition with DNAm at an earlier age was assessed via logistic regressions. To evaluate gender specificity, interactions between DNAm and gender were included in the model. Findings in the IoW cohort were further tested in an independent cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).In total, 174 candidate CpGs were selected including CpGs from screening and CpGs previously associated correctionally with BMI in children and adults. Of these 174 CpGs, pre-adolescent DNAm of 38 CpGs in the IoW cohort was associated with BMI status transition, including 30 CpGs showing gender-specific associations. Thirteen CpGs showed consistent associations between the IoW cohort and the ALSPAC cohort (11 of which were gender-specific).Pre-adolescence DNAm is associated with the change in BMI status from pre- to post-adolescence and such associations are likely to be gender-specific."

Combined conditions of COVID-19 and OUD could lead to exacerbated complications. With limited human in vivo options to study these complications, we suggest that iPSC-derived brain organoid models may serve as a useful platform to investigate the physiological connection between COVID-19 and OUD.

"33732246","Understanding Asthma and Allergies by the Lens of Biodiversity and Epigenetic Changes.","Front Immunol","Exposure to different organisms (bacteria, mold, virus, protozoan, helminths, among others) can induce epigenetic changes affecting the modulation of immune responses and consequently increasing the susceptibility to inflammatory diseases. Epigenomic regulatory features are highly affected during embryonic development and are responsible for the expression or repression of different genes associated with cell development and targeting/conducting immune responses. The well-known, ""window of opportunity"" that includes maternal and post-natal environmental exposures, which include maternal infections, microbiota, diet, drugs, and pollutant exposures are of fundamental importance to immune modulation and these events are almost always accompanied by epigenetic changes. Recently, it has been shown that these alterations could be involved in both risk and protection of allergic diseases through mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, which can enhance Th2 responses and maintain memory Th2 cells or decrease Treg cells differentiation. In addition, epigenetic changes may differ according to the microbial agent involved and may even influence different asthma or allergy phenotypes. In this review, we discuss how exposure to different organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and helminths can lead to epigenetic modulations and how this correlates with allergic diseases considering different genetic backgrounds of several ancestral populations.Copyright © 2021 Fiuza, Fonseca, Meirelles, Marques, da Silva and Figueiredo."

However, the effects of smoking on miRNA expression have not been fully elucidated in smoking-related lung carcinogenesis. Therefore, in this study, to investigate the change of miRNA expression pattern and to identify tumor suppressor miRNAs by smoking in lung carcinogenesis, we used lung carcinogenesis model cell lines that, derived from a murine xenograft model with human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B), exposed CS or not. The microarray analysis revealed that miR-584-5p expression was downregulated with cancer progression in lung carcinogenesis model cell lines. We confirmed by pyrosequencing that the methylation level of the miR-584-5p promoter increased with cancer progression. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that miR-584-5p suppressed migration and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells by targeting YKT6. Furthermore, we showed that high level of YKT6 was associated with a poor survival rate in NSCLC patients with a history of smoking. These results suggest that miR-584-5p acts as a tumor suppressor and is a potential molecular biomarker for smoking-related NSCLC."

Nicotine, the reinforcing component of tobacco and e-cigarettes, directly acts on the cholinergic system by targeting nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the brain. Activation of nAChRs leads to a multitude of immediate and long-lasting effects in specific cellular populations, thereby affecting the addictive properties of the drug. In addition to the direct actions of nicotine in binding to and opening nAChRs, the subsequent activation of circuits and downstream signaling cascades leads to a wide range of changes in gene expression, which can subsequently alter further behavioral expression. In this review, we provide an overview of the actions of nicotine that lead to changes in gene expression and further highlight evidence supporting how these changes can often be bidirectional, thereby inducing subsequent changes in behaviors associated with further drug intake.Copyright © 2021 Sherafat, Bautista and Fowler."

Due to technical limitations, it has been less clear if mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is methylated and whether 5mC has a regulatory role in this context. Here, we used bisulfite-independent single-molecule sequencing of native human and mouse DNA to study mitochondrial 5mC across different biological conditions. We first validated the ability of long-read nanopore sequencing to detect 5mC in CpG (5mCpG) and non-CpG (5mCpH) context in nuclear DNA at expected genomic locations (i.e. promoters, gene bodies, enhancers, and cell type-specific transcription factor binding sites). Next, using high coverage nanopore sequencing we found low levels of mtDNA CpG and CpH methylation (with several exceptions) and little variation across biological processes: differentiation, oxidative stress, and cancer. 5mCpG and 5mCpH were overall higher in tissues compared to cell lines, with small additional variation between cell lines of different origin. Despite general low levels, global and single-base differences were found in cancer tissues compared to their adjacent counterparts, in particular for 5mCpG. In conclusion, nanopore sequencing is a useful tool for the detection of modified DNA bases on mitochondria that avoid the biases introduced by bisulfite and PCR amplification. Enhanced nanopore basecalling models will provide further resolution on the small size effects detected here, as well as rule out the presence of other DNA modifications such as oxidized forms of 5mC."
"33781317","A review of epigenetic changes in asthma: methylation and acetylation.","Clin Epigenetics","Several studies show that childhood and adulthood asthma and its symptoms can be modulated through epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic changes are inheritable modifications that can modify the gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. The most common epigenetic alternations consist of DNA methylation and histone modifications. How these changes lead to asthmatic phenotype or promote the asthma features, in particular by immune pathways regulation, is an understudied topic. Since external effects, like exposure to tobacco smoke, air pollution, and drugs, influence both asthma development and the epigenome, elucidating the role of epigenetic changes in asthma is of great importance. This review presents available evidence on the epigenetic process that drives asthma genes and pathways, with a particular focus on DNA methylation, histone methylation, and acetylation. We gathered and assessed studies conducted in this field over the past two decades. Our study examined asthma in different aspects and also shed light on the limitations and the important factors involved in the outcomes of the studies. To date, most of the studies in this area have been carried out on DNA methylation. Therefore, the need for diagnostic and therapeutic applications through this molecular process calls for more research on the histone modifications in this disease."
"33744870","Male-specific age estimation based on Y-chromosomal DNA methylation.","Aging (Albany NY)","Although DNA methylation variation of autosomal CpGs provides robust age predictive biomarkers, no male-specific age predictor exists based on Y-CpGs yet. Since sex chromosomes play an important role in aging, a Y-chromosome-based age predictor would allow studying male-specific aging effects and would also be useful in forensics. Here, we used blood-based DNA methylation microarray data of 1,057 males from six cohorts aged 15-87 and identified 75 Y-CpGs with an interquartile range of ≥0.1. Of these, 22 and six were significantly hyper- and hypomethylated with age (p(cor)<0.05, Bonferroni), respectively. Amongst several machine learning algorithms, a model based on support vector machines with radial kernel performed best in male-specific age prediction. We achieved a mean absolute deviation (MAD) between true and predicted age of 7.54 years (cor=0.81, validation) when using all 75 Y-CpGs, and a MAD of 8.46 years (cor=0.73, validation) based on the most predictive 19 Y-CpGs. The accuracies of both age predictors did not worsen with increased age, in contrast to autosomal CpG-based age predictors that are known to predict age with reduced accuracy in the elderly. Overall, we introduce the first-of-its-kind male-specific epigenetic age predictor for future applications in aging research and forensics."
"33836872","Epigenetic Aging and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation in Patients With Severe Aplastic Anemia.","Transplant Cell Ther","Cellular aging in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is important in the context of immune reconstitution and age-related complications. Recently, several DNA-methylation (DNAm)-based biomarkers of aging known as ""epigenetic clocks"" have been introduced as novel tools to predict cellular age. Here, we used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the possible associations of donor pre-HCT DNAm age, and its post-HCT changes, using the recently published lifespan-associated epigenetic clock known as ""DNAm-GrimAge,"" with outcomes among patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA). The study included 732 SAA patients from the Transplant Outcomes in Aplastic Anemia project, who underwent unrelated donor HCT and for whom a donor pre-HCT blood DNA sample was available; 41 also had a post-HCT sample collected at day 100. In multivariable analyses, we found similar associations for donor chronological age and pre-HCT DNAm-GrimAge with post-HCT survival (hazard ratio [HR] per decade = 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-1.28; P = .07 and HR = 1.14; 95% CI, 0.99-1.28; P = .06, respectively). In donors with 10+ years of GrimAge acceleration (ie, deviation from expected DNAm age for chronological age), elevated risks of chronic graft versus host disease (HR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.21-4.65; P = .01) and possibly post-HCT mortality (HR = 1.79; 95% CI, 0.96-3.33; P = .07) were observed. In the subset with post-HCT samples, we observed a significant increase in DNAm-GrimAge in the first 100 days after HCT (median change 12.5 years, range 1.4 to 26.4). Higher DNAm-GrimAge after HCT was associated with inferior survival (HR per year = 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.21; P = .01), predominantly within the first year after HCT. This study highlights the possible role cellular aging may play in HCT outcomes.Published by Elsevier Inc."

"33822649","Adopting a ""Compound"" Exposome Approach in Environmental Aging Biomarker Research: A Call to Action for Advancing Racial Health Equity.","Environ Health Perspect","In June 2020, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hosted a virtual workshop focused on integrating the science of aging and environmental health research. The concurrent COVID-19 pandemic and national attention on racism exposed shortcomings in the environmental research field's conceptualization and methodological use of race, which have subsequently hindered the ability of research to address racial health disparities. By the workshop's conclusion, the authors deduced that the utility of environmental aging biomarkers-aging biomarkers shown to be specifically influenced by environmental exposures-would be greatly diminished if these biomarkers are developed absent of considerations of broader societal factors-like structural racism-that impinge on racial health equity.The authors reached a post-workshop consensus recommendation: To advance racial health equity, a ""compound"" exposome approach should be widely adopted in environmental aging biomarker research. We present this recommendation here.The authors believe that without explicit considerations of racial health equity, people in most need of the benefits afforded by a better understanding of the relationships between exposures and aging will be the least likely to receive them because biomarkers may not encompass cumulative impacts from their unique social and environmental stressors. Employing an exposome approach that allows for more comprehensive exposure-disease pathway characterization across broad domains, including the social exposome and neighborhood factors, is the first step. Exposome-centered study designs must then be supported with efforts aimed at increasing the recruitment and retention of racially diverse study populations and researchers and further ""compounded"" with strategies directed at improving the use and interpretation of race throughout the publication and dissemination process. This compound exposome approach maximizes the ability of our science to identify environmental aging biomarkers that explicate racial disparities in health and best positions the environmental research community to contribute to the elimination of racial health disparities. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8392."
"33822234","Associations of DNA Methylation Mortality Risk Markers with Congenital Microcephaly from Zika Virus: A Study of Brazilian Children Less than 4 Years of Age.","J Trop Pediatr","Zika virus (ZIKV)-associated congenital microcephaly is an important contributor to pediatric death, and more robust pediatric mortality risk metrics are needed to help guide life plans and clinical decision making for these patients. Although common etiologies of pediatric and adult mortality differ, early life health can impact adult outcomes-potentially through DNA methylation. Hence, in this pilot study, we take an early step in identifying pediatric mortality risk metrics by examining associations of ZIKV infection and associated congenital microcephaly with existing adult DNA methylation-based mortality biomarkers: GrimAge and Zhang's mortality score (ZMS).Mortality measures were calculated from previously published HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip data from 44 Brazilian children aged 5-40 months (18 with ZIKV-associated microcephaly; 7 normocephalic, exposed to ZIKV in utero; and 19 unexposed controls). We used linear models adjusted for chronological age, sex, methylation batch and white blood cell proportions to evaluate ZIKV and mortality marker relationships.We observed significant decreases in GrimAge-component plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1; β = -2453.06 pg/ml, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3652.96, -1253.16, p = 0.0002], and ZMS-site cg14975410 methylation (β = -0.06, 95% CI -0.09, -0.03, p = 0.0003) among children with microcephaly compared to controls. PAI-1 (β = -2448.70 pg/ml, 95% CI -4384.45, -512.95, p = 0.01) and cg14975410 (β = 0.01, 95% CI -0.04, 0.06, p = 0.64) results in comparisons of normocephalic, ZIKV-exposed children to controls were not statistically significant.Our results suggest that elements of previously-identified adult epigenetic markers of mortality risk are associated with ZIKV-associated microcephaly, a known contributor to pediatric mortality risk. These findings may provide insights for efforts aimed at developing pediatric mortality markers.© The Author(s) [2021]. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Cellular senescence is one of the hallmarks of the aging process, characterized by an irreversible cell cycle arrest due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, telomeres shortening, chronic inflammatory activation, and chromatin modifications. In this review, we will describe the effects of senescence on tissue structure, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, and nucleus architecture, and see how these changes affect (are affected by) mechano-transduction. In our view, this is essential for a deeper understanding of the progressive pathological evolution of the cardiovascular system and its relationship with the detrimental effects of risk factors, known to act at an epigenetic level."

Further, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive and warrant further in-depth study. In this study, the embryonic day (E) 11.5 mouse fetuses and corresponding placentas derived upon using ROSI, intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), and naturalin vivofertilized (control) embryos were collected. Transcriptome and DNA methylation profiles were analyzed and compared using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, respectively. RNA-seq results revealed similar gene expression profiles in the ROSI, ICSI, and control fetuses and placentas. Compared with the other two groups, seven differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in ROSI fetuses, and ten DEGs were identified in the corresponding placentas. However, no differences in CpG methylation were observed in fetuses and placentas from the three groups. Imprinting control region methylation and imprinted gene expression were the same between the three fetus and placenta groups. Although 49 repetitive DNA sequences (RS) were abnormally activated in ROSI fetuses, RS DNA methylation did not differ between the three groups. Interestingly, abnormal hypermethylation in promoter regions and low expression ofFggyandRec8were correlated with a crown-rump length less than 6 mm in one ROSI fetus. Our study demonstrates that the transcriptome and DNA methylation in ROSI-derived E11.5 mouse fetuses and placentas were comparable with those in the other two groups. However, some abnormally expressed genes in the ROSI fetus and placenta warrant further investigation to elucidate their effect on the development of ROSI-derived embryos.Copyright © 2021 Zhu, Sun, Yu, Li, Hai, Liu, Zhang, Chen, Dai, Li, Li, Liu, Feng and Zhou."

This study aimed to assess the effect of maternal outcome and delivery procedure on global placental DNA methylation status, as well as selected 5'-Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine-3' (CpG) sites inADIPOQandLEPgenes. Global DNA methylation profile in the placenta was assessed using the 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) ratio evaluated with the ELISA, followed by target gene methylation patterns at selected gene regions which were determined using methylation-specific qPCR in 70 placentas from healthy, pregnant women with single pregnancy. We found no statistically significant differences in 5-mC/5-hmC ratio between intrapartum cesarean sections (CS) and vaginal deliveries (p= 0.214), as well as between elective cesarean sections and vaginal deliveries (p= 0.221). In intrapartum cesarean sections, theADIPOQdemethylation index was significantly higher (the average: 1.75) compared to elective cesarean section (the average: 1.23,p= 0.010) and vaginal deliveries (the average: 1.23,p= 0.011). TheLEPdemethylation index did not significantly differ among elective CS, intrapartum CS, and vaginal delivery groups. The demethylation index ofADIPOQcorrelated negatively withLEPin the placenta in the vaginal delivery group (r= -0.456,p= 0.017), but not with the global methylation. The methylation of a singular locus might be different depending on the mode of delivery and uterine contractions. Further studies should be conducted with locus-specific analysis of the whole genome to detect the methylation index of specific genes involved in metabolism."
"33750967","Adiponectin DNA methylation in South African women with gestational diabetes mellitus: Effects of HIV infection.","PLoS One","DNA methylation is increasingly recognized as a potential biomarker of metabolic disease. However, there is limited information on the impact of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on the candidacy of DNA methylation to serve as molecular biomarkers. This study investigated the effect of HIV infection on DNA methylation patterns in the peripheral blood of South African women with (n = 95) or without (n = 191) gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). DNA methylation levels at eight CpG sites in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) promoter were measured using bisulfite conversion and pyrosequencing. Differences between HIV negative (-) and positive (+) women were observed. In HIV- women, methylation at CpG -3400 was lower in GDM+ women compared to those with normoglycemia (8.5-fold; p = 0.004), and was associated with higher fasting glucose (β-co-efficient = 0.973; p = 0.006) and lower adiponectin (β-co-efficient = -0.057; p = 0.014) concentrations. These associations were not observed in HIV+ women. In silico analysis showed that Transcription Factor AP2-alpha is able to bind to the altered CpG site, suggesting that CpG -3400 may play a functional role in the regulation of ADIPOQ expression. Our findings show that DNA methylation differs by HIV status, suggesting that HIV infection needs to be taken into consideration in studies exploring DNA methylation as a biomarker of GDM in high HIV prevalence settings."

The aim was thus to review prevalence studies of SWD, to calculate an overall prevalence by a random effects meta-analysis approach and investigate correlates of SWD prevalence using a random-effects meta-regression.Methods:Systematic searches were conducted in ISI Web of Science, PsycNET, PubMed, and Google Scholar using the search terms ""shift work disorder"" and ""shift work sleep disorder."" No restrictions in terms of time frame were used. Included studies had to present original data on the prevalence of SWD in an occupational sample published in English. A total of 349 unique hits were made. In all, 29 studies were finally included from which two authors independently extracted data using predefined data fields. The meta-regression included four predictors (diagnostic criteria, study country, type of workers, and sample size).Results:The overall prevalence of SWD was 26.5% (95% confidence interval = 21.0-32.8). CochranQwas 1,845.4 (df= 28,p< 0.001), and theI2was 98.5%, indicating very high heterogeneity across the observed prevalence estimates. Diagnostic criteria (International Classification of Sleep Disorders-2 = 0, International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3 = 1) and sample size were inversely related to SWD prevalence.Conclusions:The prevalence of SWD was high across the included studies. The between-study disparity was large and was partly explained by diagnostic criteria and sample size. In order to facilitate comparative research on SWD, there is a need for validation and standardization of assessment methodology as well as agreement in terms of sample restrictions.Copyright © 2021 Pallesen, Bjorvatn, Waage, Harris and Sagoe."

Pointed FEH study efforts are underdeveloped, and the mechanisms by which poor FEH are biologically embedded are unclear. The current exploratory study examined whether variability in 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC) and fronto-limbic grey matter volume may represent pathways through which FEH may become biologically embedded.In 98 university students aged 18-22 years, retrospective self-reported childhood FEH was associated with right hemisphere hippocampus (b = 10.4, p = 0.005), left hemisphere amygdala (b = 5.3, p = 0.009), and right hemisphere amygdala (b = 5.8, p = 0.016) volumes. After pre-processing and filtering to 5mC probes correlated between saliva and brain, analyses showed that childhood FEH was associated with 49 5mC principal components (module eigengenes; MEs) (prange = 3 × 10-6to 0.047). Saliva-derived 5mC MEs partially mediated the association between FEH and right hippocampal volume (Burlywood ME indirect effect b = - 111, p = 0.014), and fully mediated the FEH and right amygdala volume relationship (Pink4 ME indirect effect b = - 48, p = 0.026). Modules were enriched with probes falling in genes with immune, central nervous system (CNS), cellular development/differentiation, and metabolic functions.Findings extend work highlighting neurodevelopmental variability associated with adverse social environment exposure during childhood by specifically implicating poor FEH, while informing a mechanism of biological embedding. FEH-associated epigenetic signatures could function as proxies of altered fronto-limbic grey matter volume associated with poor childhood FEH and inform further investigation into primarily affected tissues such as endocrine, immune, and CNS cell types."

However, little is known about how H2A.Z affects the developmental process and ripening of tomato fruits. Here, we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system to generate a sl_hta9 sl_hta11 double-mutant, designated sl_h2a.z, and found that these two mutations led to a significant reduction in the fresh weight of tomato fruits. Subsequent messenger RNA (mRNA)-seq results showed that dysfunction of Sl_H2A.Z has profound effects on the reprogramming of genome-wide gene expression at different developmental stages of tomato fruits, indicating a ripening-dependent correlation between Sl_H2A.Z and gene expression regulation in tomato fruits. In addition, the expression of three genes, SlPSY1, SlPDS, and SlVDE, encoding the key enzymes in the biosynthesis pathway of carotenoids, was significantly upregulated in the later ripening stages, which was consistent with the increased contents of carotenoids in sl_h2a.z double-mutant fruits. Overall, our study reveals a role of Sl_H2A.Z in the regulation of carotenoids and provides a resource for the study of Sl_H2A.Z-dependent gene expression regulation. Hence, our results provide a link between epigenetic regulation via histone variants and fruit development, suggesting a conceptual framework to understand how histone variants regulate tomato fruit quality."

Our aim was to integrate DNA methylation and gene expression data in an effort to identify biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease risk in a community-based population. We accessed data from the Framingham Offspring Study, a cohort study with data on DNA methylation (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip; Illumina) and gene expression (Human Exon 1.0 ST Array; Affymetrix). Using the MOFA2 R package, we integrated these data to identify biomarkers related to the risk of presenting a cardiovascular event.Four independent latent factors (9, 19, 21-only in women-and 27), driven by DNA methylation, were associated with cardiovascular disease independently of classical risk factors and cell-type counts. In a sensitivity analysis, we also identified factor 21 as associated with CVD in women. Factors 9, 21 and 27 were also associated with coronary heart disease risk. Moreover, in a replication effort in an independent study three of the genes included in factor 27 were also present in a factor identified to be associated with myocardial infarction (CDC42BPB, MAN2A2 and RPTOR). Factor 9 was related to age and cell-type proportions; factor 19 was related to age and B cells count; factor 21 pointed to human immunodeficiency virus infection-related pathways and inflammation; and factor 27 was related to lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption, smoking and body mass index. Inclusion of factor 21 (only in women) improved the discriminative and reclassification capacity of the Framingham classical risk function and factor 27 improved its discrimination.Unsupervised multi-omics data integration methods have the potential to provide insights into the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. We identified four independent factors (one only in women) pointing to inflammation, endothelium homeostasis, visceral fat, cardiac remodeling and lifestyles as key players in the determination of cardiovascular risk. Moreover, two of these factors improved the predictive capacity of a classical risk function."

We tested associations between midlife biological aging and indicators of future frailty-risk in the Dunedin cohort of 1037 infants born the same year and followed to age 45. Participants' Pace of Aging was quantified by tracking declining function in 19 biomarkers indexing the cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, immune, dental, and pulmonary systems across ages 26, 32, 38, and 45 years. At age 45 in 2019, participants with faster Pace of Aging had more cognitive difficulties, signs of advanced brain aging, diminished sensory-motor functions, older appearance, and more pessimistic perceptions of aging. People who are aging more rapidly than same-age peers in midlife may prematurely need supports to sustain independence that are usually reserved for older adults. Chronological age does not adequately identify need for such supports."
"33795684","Evolution of DNA methylation in the human brain.","Nat Commun","DNA methylation is a critical regulatory mechanism implicated in development, learning, memory, and disease in the human brain. Here we have elucidated DNA methylation changes during recent human brain evolution. We demonstrate dynamic evolutionary trajectories of DNA methylation in cell-type and cytosine-context specific manner. Specifically, DNA methylation in non-CG context, namely CH methylation, has increased (hypermethylation) in neuronal gene bodies during human brain evolution, contributing to human-specific down-regulation of genes and co-expression modules. The effects of CH hypermethylation is particularly pronounced in early development and neuronal subtypes. In contrast, DNA methylation in CG context shows pronounced reduction (hypomethylation) in human brains, notably in cis-regulatory regions, leading to upregulation of downstream genes. We show that the majority of differential CG methylation between neurons and oligodendrocytes originated before the divergence of hominoids and catarrhine monkeys, and harbors strong signal for genetic risk for schizophrenia. Remarkably, a substantial portion of differential CG methylation between neurons and oligodendrocytes emerged in the human lineage since the divergence from the chimpanzee lineage and carries significant genetic risk for schizophrenia. Therefore, recent epigenetic evolution of human cortex has shaped the cellular regulatory landscape and contributed to the increased vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diseases."

Age and sex, two major risk factors for AD, are also known to largely affect the epigenetic profiles in brain, but their contribution to AD-associated DNAm changes has been poorly investigated. In this study we considered publicly available DNAm datasets of four brain regions (temporal, frontal, entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum) from healthy adult subjects and AD patients, and performed a meta-analysis to identify sex-, age-, and AD-associated epigenetic profiles. In one of these datasets it was also possible to distinguish 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) profiles. We showed that DNAm differences between males and females tend to be shared between the four brain regions, while aging differently affects cortical regions compared to cerebellum. We found that the proportion of sex-dependent probes whose methylation is modified also during aging is higher than expected, but that differences between males and females tend to be maintained, with only a few probes showing age-by-sex interaction. We did not find significant overlaps between AD- and sex-associated probes, nor disease-by-sex interaction effects. On the contrary, we found that AD-related epigenetic modifications are significantly enriched in probes whose DNAm varies with age and that there is a high concordance between the direction of changes (hyper or hypo-methylation) in aging and AD, supporting accelerated epigenetic aging in the disease. In summary, our results suggest that age-associated DNAm patterns concur to the epigenetic deregulation observed in AD, providing new insights on how advanced age enables neurodegeneration.Copyright © 2021 Pellegrini, Pirazzini, Sala, Sambati, Yusipov, Kalyakulina, Ravaioli, Kwiatkowska, Durso, Ivanchenko, Monti, Lodi, Franceschi, Cortelli, Garagnani and Bacalini."
"33731678","Prioritization of schizophrenia risk genes from GWAS results by integrating multi-omics data.","Transl Psychiatry","Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a polygenic disease with a heritability approaching 80%. Over 100 SCZ-related loci have so far been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the risk genes associated with these loci often remain unknown. We present a new risk gene predictor, rGAT-omics, that integrates multi-omics data under a Bayesian framework by combining the Hotelling and Box-Cox transformations. The Bayesian framework was constructed using gene ontology, tissue-specific protein-protein networks, and multi-omics data including differentially expressed genes in SCZ and controls, distance from genes to the index single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and de novo mutations. The application of rGAT-omics to the 108 loci identified by a recent GWAS study of SCZ predicted 103 high-risk genes (HRGs) that explain a high proportion of SCZ heritability (Enrichment = 43.44 and [Formula: see text]). HRGs were shown to be significantly ([Formula: see text]) enriched in genes associated with neurological activities, and more likely to be expressed in brain tissues and SCZ-associated cell types than background genes. The predicted HRGs included 16 novel genes not present in any existing databases of SCZ-associated genes or previously predicted to be SCZ risk genes by any other method. More importantly, 13 of these 16 genes were not the nearest to the index SNP markers, and them would have been difficult to identify as risk genes by conventional approaches while ten out of the 16 genes are associated with neurological functions that make them prime candidates for pathological involvement in SCZ. Therefore, rGAT-omics has revealed novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying SCZ and could provide potential clues to future therapies."

We employed several approaches to statistically analyze the data and the methods indicated that the case-control differences were subtle but most distinguishable in metastatic case-control pairs in the period 0-3 years prior to diagnosis. The genes of interest along with estimated blood cell populations could indicate disruption of immunological processes in blood. The genes identified from approaches focusing on alterations with time to diagnosis were distinct from those focusing on the case-control differences. Our results support that explorative analyses of prospective blood samples could indicate circulating signals of disease-related processes."

"33735102","Haematopoietic ageing through the lens of single-cell technologies.","Dis Model Mech","Human lifespan is now longer than ever and, as a result, modern society is getting older. Despite that, the detailed mechanisms behind the ageing process and its impact on various tissues and organs remain obscure. In general, changes in DNA, RNA and protein structure throughout life impair their function. Haematopoietic ageing refers to the age-related changes affecting a haematopoietic system. Aged blood cells display different functional aberrations depending on their cell type, which might lead to the development of haematologic disorders, including leukaemias, anaemia or declining immunity. In contrast to traditional bulk assays, which are not suitable to dissect cell-to-cell variation, single-cell-level analysis provides unprecedented insight into the dynamics of age-associated changes in blood. In this Review, we summarise recent studies that dissect haematopoietic ageing at the single-cell level. We discuss what cellular changes occur during haematopoietic ageing at the genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and metabolomic level, and provide an overview of the benefits of investigating those changes with single-cell precision.

To identify therapeutic targets relevant to COVID-19, we conducted Mendelian randomization analyses, deriving genetic instruments based on transcriptomic and proteomic data for 1,263 actionable proteins that are targeted by approved drugs or in clinical phase of drug development. Using summary statistics from the Host Genetics Initiative and the Million Veteran Program, we studied 7,554 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and >1 million controls. We found significant Mendelian randomization results for three proteins (ACE2, P = 1.6 × 10-6; IFNAR2, P = 9.8 × 10-11and IL-10RB, P = 2.3 × 10-14) using cis-expression quantitative trait loci genetic instruments that also had strong evidence for colocalization with COVID-19 hospitalization. To disentangle the shared expression quantitative trait loci signal for IL10RB and IFNAR2, we conducted phenome-wide association scans and pathway enrichment analysis, which suggested that IFNAR2 is more likely to play a role in COVID-19 hospitalization. Our findings prioritize trials of drugs targeting IFNAR2 and ACE2 for early management of COVID-19."

In this study, we demonstrate that TRIM58 is frequently downregulated by promoter methylation in ccRCC tissues, associated significantly with tumor nuclear grade and poor patient survival. TRIM58-TET1 directly induces demethylation of TRIM58 CpG islands, and activates TRIM58 transcription in RCC cell lines. Besides, DNA demethylation of TRIM58 by TRIM58-TET1 significantly inhibits cell proliferation and migration Overall, our results demonstrate that TRIM58 is inactivated by promoter methylation, associates with tumor nuclear grade and poor survival, and TRIM58 DNA demethylation could directly activate TRIM58 transcription and inhibit cell proliferation and migration in RCC cell lines.Copyright © 2021 Gan, Cao, Li, Song, Kuang, Ma, Zhang and Zhang."

We collected nasal swabs from anterior nares of 547 children, measured DNA methylation (DNAm), and tested differences at 15 ACE2 CpGs by sex, age, race/ethnicity and epigenetic age. ACE2 CpGs were differentially methylated by sex with 12 sites having lower DNAm (mean = 12.71%) and 3 sites greater DNAm (mean = 1.45%) among females relative to males. We observed differential DNAm at 5 CpGs for Hispanic females (mean absolute difference = 3.22%) and lower DNAm at 8 CpGs for Black males (mean absolute difference = 1.33%), relative to white participants. Longer DNAm telomere length was associated with greater ACE2 DNAm at 11 and 13 CpGs among males (mean absolute difference = 7.86%) and females (mean absolute difference = 8.21%), respectively. Nasal ACE2 DNAm differences could contribute to our understanding COVID-19 severity and disparities reflecting upstream environmental and social influences.

In our previous longitudinal study from midgestation to late infancy we showed persistence of LV hypertrophy and increased aortic stiffness compared with infants of healthy mothers, the latter of which correlated with third trimester maternal hemoglobin A1c. In the present study, we reexamined the same cohort in early childhood to determine if these cardiovascular abnormalities persisted.Height, weight, and right arm blood pressure were recorded. A full functional and structural echocardiogram was performed with offline analysis of LV posterior wall and interventricular septal diastolic thickness (IVSd), systolic and diastolic function, and aortic pulse wave velocity. Vascular reactivity was assessed using digital thermal monitoring. Participants also completed a physical activity questionnaire.Twenty-five children of diabetic mothers (CDMs) and 20 children from healthy pregnancies (mean age, 5.6 ± 1.7 and 5.3 ± 1.3 years, respectively;P = not significant) were assessed. Compared with controls, IVSd z score was increased in CDMs (1.2 ± 0.6 vs 0.5 ± 0.3, respectively;P = 0.006), with one-fifth having a z score of more than +2.0. Aortic pulse wave velocity was increased in CDMs (3.2 ± 0.6 m/s vs 2.2 ± 0.4 m/s;P = 0.001), and correlated with IVSd z score (R2 = 0.81;P = 0.001) and third trimester maternal A1c (R2 = 0.65;P< 0.0001). Body surface area, height, weight, blood pressure, vascular reactivity, and physical activity scores did not differ between groups. Our longitudinal analysis showed that individuals with greater IVSd, and aortic stiffness in utero, early and late infancy also tended to have greater measures in early childhood (P< 0.001 andP< 0.0001, respectively).CDMs show persistently increased interventricular septal thickness and aortic stiffness in early childhood.© 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

Therefore, we characterized transcriptomic (RNA-sequencing) and epigenomic (RRBS, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing; immunofluorescence) dynamics in matched zebra finch telencephalon samples of both sexes from 1 day post hatching (1 dph) to adulthood, spanning the critical period for song learning (20 and 65 dph). We identified extensive transcriptional neurodevelopmental changes during postnatal telencephalon development. DNA methylation was very low, yet increased over time, particularly in song control nuclei. Only a small fraction of the massive differential expression in the developing zebra finch telencephalon could be explained by differential CpG and CpH DNA methylation. However, a strong association between DNA methylation and age-dependent gene expression was found for various transcription factors (i.e.,OTX2,AR, andFOS) involved in neurodevelopment. Incomplete dosage compensation, independent of DNA methylation, was found to be largely responsible for sexually dimorphic gene expression, with dosage compensation increasing throughout life. In conclusion, our results indicate that DNA methylation regulates neurodevelopmental gene expression dynamics through steering transcription factor activity, but does not explain sexually dimorphic gene expression patterns in zebra finch telencephalon.Copyright © 2021 Diddens, Coussement, Frankl-Vilches, Majumdar, Steyaert, Ter Haar, Galle, De Meester, De Keulenaer, Van Criekinge, Cornil, Balthazart, Van Der Linden, De Meyer and Vanden Berghe."

Here, we made integrative analysis on the GWAS and scRNA-seq data of CLD to uncover CLD-related cell types and provide clues for understanding on the pathogenesis.We downloaded three GWAS summary data and three scRNA-seq data on CLD. After defining the cell types for each scRNA-seq data, we usedRolyPolyandLDSC-ctsto integrate the GWAS and scRNA-seq. In addition, we analyzed one scRNA-seq data without association to CLD to validate the specificity of our findings.After processing the scRNA-seq data, we obtain about 19,002-32,200 cells and identified 10-17 cell types. For the HCC analysis, we identified the association between B cell and HCC in two datasets.RolyPolyalso identified the association, when we integrated the two scRNA-seq datasets. In addition, we also identified natural killer (NK) cell as HCC-associated cell type in one dataset. In specificity analysis, we identified no significant cell type associated with HCC.

In this research, LSCC expression data, which quantify the cellular composition of immune cells, were analyzed by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and a deconvolution algorithm based on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the results indicated a close relationship between LSCC and CD8+T cells. Six hub genes (SYT3, METTL8, HSPB3, GFM1, ERLIN2, and CLCN2) were verified by gene-gene network and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses. We found that the six hub genes were increased in cancer tissues and were closely correlated with cancer development and progression. After immune correlation analysis, METTL8 was selected as a prognostic biomarker. Finally, we found that the METTL8 levels were increased in multiple lung cancer cell lines and LSCC tissues. METTL8 inhibition could clearly induce G1 cell cycle arrest and suppress proliferation.

We first sequenced theVTRNA2-1gene region in multiple-case breast cancer families in whichVTRNA2-1methylation was identified as heritable and associated with breast cancer risk. Methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) were investigated using a prospective cohort study (4500 participants with genotyping and methylation data). Thecis-mQTL analysis (334 variants ± 50 kb of the most heritable CpG site) identified 43 variants associated withVTRNA2-1methylation (p< 1.5 × 10-4); however, these explained little of the methylation variation (R2< 0.5% for each of these variants). No genetic variants elsewhere in the genome were found to strongly influenceVTRNA2-1methylation. SNP-based heritability estimates were consistent with the mQTL findings (h2= 0, 95%CI: -0.14 to 0.14). We found no evidence that age, sex, country of birth, smoking, body mass index, alcohol consumption or diet influenced blood DNA methylation atVTRNA2-1.

However, few studies are evaluating early biomarkers that might link genes, environment, and psychopathology. We aimed to study telomere length (TL) and epigenetic age acceleration (AA) in a cohort of adolescents with and without anxiety disorders (N = 234). We evaluated a representative subsample of participants at baseline and after 5 years (n = 76) and categorized them according to their anxiety disorder diagnosis at both time points: (1) control group (no anxiety disorder, n = 18), (2) variable group (anxiety disorder in one evaluation, n = 38), and (3) persistent group (anxiety disorder at both time points, n = 20). We assessed relative mean TL by real-time quantitative PCR and DNA methylation by Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. We calculated AA using the Horvath age estimation algorithm and analyzed differences among groups using generalized linear mixed models. The persistent group of anxiety disorder did not change TL over time (p = 0.495). The variable group had higher baseline TL (p = 0.003) but no accelerated TL erosion in comparison to the non-anxiety control group (p = 0.053). Furthermore, there were no differences in AA among groups over time. Our findings suggest that adolescents with chronic anxiety did not change telomere length over time, which could be related to a delay in neuronal development in this period of life."

The mechanisms governing such interactions are however not entirely understood. Here, we provide a novel transcriptional mechanism-based framework-SNiPage, to investigate such interactions, whereby a transcription factor (TF) whose expression changes with age (age-associated TF), binds to a polymorphic regulatory element in an allele-dependent fashion, rendering the target gene's expression dependent on both, the age and the genotype. Applying SNiPage to GTEx, we detected ~637 significant TF-SNP-Gene triplets on average across 25 tissues, where the TF binds to a regulatory SNP in the gene's promoter or putative enhancer and potentially regulates its expression in an age- and allele-dependent fashion. The detected SNPs are enriched for epigenomic marks indicative of regulatory activity, exhibit allele-specific chromatin accessibility, and spatial proximity to their putative gene targets. Furthermore, the TF-SNP interaction-dependent target genes have established links to aging and to age-associated diseases. In six hypertension-implicated tissues, detected interactions significantly inform hypertension state of an individual. Lastly, the age-interacting SNPs exhibit a greater proximity to the reported phenotype/diseases-associated SNPs than eSNPs identified in an interaction-independent fashion. Overall, we present a novel mechanism-based model, and a novel framework SNiPage, to identify functionally relevant SNP-age interactions in transcriptional control and illustrate their potential utility in understanding complex age-associated phenotypes."

However, no drug with high efficacy to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection has been approved. With the increasing popularity of gene therapy, scientists have explored the utilization of small RNAs such as microRNAs as therapeutics. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs with high affinity for the 3'-UTRs of targeted messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Interactions between host cells and viral genomes may induce the upregulation or downregulation of various miRNAs. Therefore, understanding the expression patterns of these miRNAs and their functions will provide insights into potential miRNA-based therapies.

We find that CNCRs are depleted from protein-coding genes but enriched within lncRNAs. We demonstrate that per-SNP heritability of a range of brain-relevant phenotypes are enriched within CNCRs. We find that genes implicated in neurological diseases have high CNCR density, including APOE, highlighting an unannotated intron-3 retention event. Using human brain RNA-sequencing data, we show the intron-3-retaining transcript to be more abundant in Alzheimer's disease with more severe tau and amyloid pathological burden.

Energy dysfunction in the neuronal population leads to various pathological events and ultimately results in neuronal death. Identifying common therapeutic targets for these disorders may help in the drug discovery process. The Brodmann area 9 (BA9) region is affected in both the disease conditions and plays an essential role in cognitive, motor, and memory-related functions. Analyzing transcriptome data of BA9 provides deep insights related to common pathological pathways involved in AD and PD. In this work, we map the preprocessed BA9 fastq files generated by RNA-seq for disease and control samples with reference hg38 genomic assembly and identify common variants and differentially expressed genes (DEG). These variants are predominantly located in the 3' UTR (non-promoter) region, affecting the conserved transcription factor (TF) binding motifs involved in the methylation and acetylation process. We have constructed BA9-specific functional interaction networks, which show the relationship between TFs and DEGs.

Here, we propose an approach to identify drug targets with high probability of success by focusing on genes with both gain of function (GoF) and loss of function (LoF) mutations associated with opposing effects on phenotype (Bidirectional Effect Selected Targets, BEST). We find 98 BEST genes for a variety of indications. Drugs targeting those genes are 3.8-fold more likely to be approved than non-BEST genes. We focus on five genes (IGF1R, NPPC, NPR2, FGFR3, and SHOX) with evidence for bidirectional effects on stature. Rare protein-altering variants in those genes result in significantly increased risk for idiopathic short stature (ISS) (OR = 2.75, p = 3.99 × 10-8). Finally, using functional experiments, we demonstrate that adding an exogenous CNP analog (encoded by NPPC) rescues the phenotype, thus validating its potential as a therapeutic treatment for ISS.

To address this knowledge gap, we used a comparative phylogenetic model and transcriptomic data from seven species to infer selection on gene expression in duplicated genes (ohnologs) following the salmonid WGD 80-100 million years ago.We find rare cases of tissue-specific expression evolution but pervasive expression evolution affecting many tissues, reflecting strong selection on maintenance of genome stability following genome doubling. Ohnolog expression levels have evolved mostly asymmetrically, by diverting one ohnolog copy down a path towards lower expression and possible pseudogenization. Loss of expression in one ohnolog is significantly associated with transposable element insertions in promoters and likely driven by selection on gene dosage including selection on stoichiometric balance. We also find symmetric expression shifts, and these are associated with genes under strong evolutionary constraints such as ribosome subunit genes. This possibly reflects selection operating to achieve a gene dose reduction while avoiding accumulation of ""toxic mutations"". Mechanistically, ohnolog regulatory divergence is dictated by the number of bound transcription factors in promoters, with transposable elements being one likely source of novel binding sites driving tissue-specific gains in expression.Our results imply pervasive adaptive expression evolution following WGD to overcome the immediate challenges posed by genome doubling and to exploit the long-term genetic opportunities for novel phenotype evolution."

Results of his extensive laboratory and cardiological diagnostics with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and a one-time cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) were analyzed. After 12 h of running (approximately 130 km), the athlete experienced an increasing pain in the right knee. His baseline clinical data were within the normal range. High physical efficiency in CPET (VO2max 63 mL/kg/min) was similar to the average achieved by other ultramarathoners who had significantly worse results. Thus, we also performed genetic tests and assessed his psychological profile, body composition, and markers of physical and mental stress (serotonin, cortisol, epinephrine, prolactin, testosterone, and luteinizing hormone). The athlete had a mtDNA haplogroup H (HV0a1 subgroup, belonging to the HV cluster), characteristic of athletes with the highest endurance. Psychological studies have shown high and very high intensity of the properties of individual scales of the tools used mental resilience (62-100% depending on the scale), openness to experience (10th sten), coherence (10th sten), positive perfectionism (100%) and overall hope for success score (10th sten). The athlete himself considers the commitment and mental support of his team to be a significant factor of his success. Body composition assessment (%fat 13.9) and the level of stress markers were unremarkable. The tested athlete showed a number of features of the champions of ultramarathon runs, such as: inborn predispositions, mental traits, level of training, and resistance to pain. However, none of these features are reserved exclusively for ""champions"". Team support's participation cannot be underestimated. The factors that guarantee the success of this elite 24-h UM runner go far beyond physiological and psychological explanations.

We applied systematic genomics to integrate our previous GWAS data for IGF-I and IR with multi-omics datasets, e.g., whole-blood expression quantitative loci, molecular pathways, and gene network, to capture the full range of genetic functionalities associated with IGF-I/IR and key drivers (KDs) in gene-regulatory networks.

Next, by using tissue-specific gene-gene interaction networks, we identified both well-established (e.g.,IRS1andIGF1R) and novel (e.g.,AKT1,HRAS, andJAK1) KDs in the IGF-I/IR-associated subnetworks. Our results, if validated in additional genomic studies, may provide robust, comprehensive insights into the mechanisms of IGF-I/IR regulation and highlight potential novel genetic targets as preventive and therapeutic strategies for the associated diseases, e.g., T2DM and cancers."

These insects rely on flight for a number of important life history traits, such as dispersal, foraging, and courtship. Despite the importance of flight, relatively little is known about the genetic architecture of flight performance. Accordingly, we sought to uncover the genetic modifiers of flight using a measure of flies' reaction and response to an abrupt drop in a vertical flight column. We conducted a genome wide association study (GWAS) using 197 of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines, and identified a combination of additive and marginal variants, epistatic interactions, whole genes, and enrichment across interaction networks.

We functionally validated 13 of the additive candidate genes' (Adgf-A/Adgf-A2/CG32181, bru1, CadN, flapper (CG11073), CG15236, flippy (CG9766), CREG, Dscam4, form3, fry, Lasp/CG9692, Pde6, Snoo), and introduce a novel approach to whole gene significance screens: PEGASUS_flies. Additionally, we identified ppk23, an Acid Sensing Ion Channel (ASIC) homolog, as an important hub for epistatic interactions. We propose a model that suggests genetic modifiers of wing and muscle morphology, nervous system development and function, BMP signaling, sexually dimorphic neural wiring, and gene regulation are all important for the observed differences flight performance in a natural population.

Unsurprisingly, this results in disparate solutions. To explore how to exploit these heterogeneous approaches, we selected six network methods and applied them to GENESIS, a nationwide French study on familial breast cancer. First, we verified that network methods recovered more interpretable results than a standard GWAS. We addressed the heterogeneity of their solutions by studying their overlap, computing what we called the consensus. The key gene in this consensus solution was COPS5, a gene related to multiple cancer hallmarks. Another issue we observed was that network methods were unstable, selecting very different genes on different subsamples of GENESIS. Therefore, we proposed a stable consensus solution formed by the 68 genes most consistently selected across multiple subsamples. This solution was also enriched in genes known to be associated with breast cancer susceptibility (BLM, CASP8, CASP10, DNAJC1, FGFR2, MRPS30, and SLC4A7, P-value = 3 × 10-4). The most connected gene was CUL3, a regulator of several genes linked to cancer progression. Lastly, we evaluated the biases of each method and the impact of their parameters on the outcome. In general, network methods preferred highly connected genes, even after random rewirings that stripped the connections of any biological meaning. In conclusion, we present the advantages of network-guided GWAS, characterize their shortcomings, and provide strategies to address them. To compute the consensus networks, implementations of all six methods are available at https://github.com/hclimente/gwas-tools."

Weather and seasonal effects were analyzed using a single linear regression model with age, sex, motion, scan sequence, time-of-day, month of the year, and the deviation from average barometric pressure, air temperature, and humidity, as covariates. FDR correction for multiple comparisons was applied to groups of non-overlapping ROIs. Significant negative relationships were found between the left- and right- cerebellum cortex and pressure (t = -2.25, p = 0.049; t = -2.771, p = 0.017). Significant positive relationships were found between left- and right- cerebellum cortex and white matter between the comparisons of January/June and January/September. Significant negative relationships were found between several subcortical ROIs for the summer months compared to January. An opposing effect was observed between the supra- and infra-tentorium, with opposite effect directions in winter and summer. Cohen's d effect sizes from monthly comparisons were similar to those reported in recent psychiatric big-data publications, raising the possibility that seasonal changes and weather may be confounds in large cohort studies. Additionally, changes in brain volume due to natural environmental variation have not been reported before and may have implications for weather-related and seasonal ailments."

However, the mechanism underlying this relationship remains unclear. We assessed whether DNA methylation differences may mediate the association between prenatal smoking exposure and ADHD symptoms at the age of 6 years.We selected 1150 mother-infant pairs from the Hokkaido Study on the Environment and Children's Health. Mothers were categorized into three groups according to plasma cotinine levels at the third trimester: non-smokers (≤ 0.21 ng/mL), passive smokers (0.21-11.48 ng/mL), and active smokers (≥ 11.49 ng/mL). The children's ADHD symptoms were determined by the ADHD-Rating Scale at the age of 6 years. Maternal active smoking during pregnancy was significantly associated with an increased risk of ADHD symptoms (odds ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-3.15) compared to non-smoking after adjusting for covariates. DNA methylation of the growth factor-independent 1 transcriptional repressor (GFI1) region, as determined by bisulfite next-generation sequencing of cord blood samples, mediated 48.4% of the total effect of the association between maternal active smoking during pregnancy and ADHD symptoms. DNA methylation patterns of other genes (aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor [AHRR], cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 [CYP1A1], estrogen receptor 1 [ESR1], and myosin IG [MYO1G]) regions did not exert a statistically significant mediation effect.Our findings demonstrated that DNA methylation of GFI1 mediated the association between maternal active smoking during pregnancy and ADHD symptoms at the age of 6 years."
"33767450","Single-cell transcriptomic analyses provide insights into the developmental origins of neuroblastoma.","Nat Genet","Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the developing sympathetic nervous system. However, the cellular origin of neuroblastoma has yet to be defined. Here we studied the single-cell transcriptomes of neuroblastomas and normal human developing adrenal glands at various stages of embryonic and fetal development. We defined normal differentiation trajectories from Schwann cell precursors over intermediate states to neuroblasts or chromaffin cells and showed that neuroblastomas transcriptionally resemble normal fetal adrenal neuroblasts. Importantly, neuroblastomas with varying clinical phenotypes matched different temporal states along normal neuroblast differentiation trajectories, with the degree of differentiation corresponding to clinical prognosis. Our work highlights the roles of oncogenic MYCN and loss of TFAP2B in blocking differentiation and may provide the basis for designing therapeutic interventions to overcome differentiation blocks."

Here we found that circulating miR-320a was significantly down-regulated (~5.87-fold;p< 0.0001) in NSCLC patients (n= 80) compared to matched control plasma samples from healthy subjects (n= 80). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that NSCLC patients with lower levels of circulating miR-320a had overall poorer prognosis and survival rates compared to patients with higher levels (p< 0.0001). Moreover, the diagnostic and prognostic potential of miR-320a correlated with clinicopathological characteristics such as tumor size, tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, and lymph node metastasis. Functionally, depletion of miR-320a in human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells induced their metastatic potential and reduced apoptosis, which was reversed by exogenous re-expression of miR-320a mimics, indicating that miR-320a has a tumor-suppressive role in NSCLC. These results were further supported by high levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker proteins (e.g., Beta-catenin, MMP9, and E-cadherin) in lung cancer cells and tissuesviaimmunoblot and immunohistochemistry experiments. Moreover, through bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter assays, we demonstrated thatAKT3was a direct target of miR-320a. In addition, AKT3-associated PI3K/AKT/mTOR protein-signaling pathways were elevated with down-regulated miR-320a levels in NSCLC. These composite data indicate that circulating miR-320a may function as a tumor-suppressor miRNA with potential as a prognostic marker for NSCLC patients.Copyright © 2021 Khandelwal, Sharma, Barwal, Seam, Gupta, Rana, Vasquez and Jain."

Nevertheless, the biological and functional effects of these genetic variants on CAD remain largely equivocal. In the current study, we performed an integrative genomics analysis by integrating large-scale GWAS data (N = 459,534) and 2 independent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets (N = 1890) to determine whether CAD-associated risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exert regulatory effects on gene expression. By using Sherlock Bayesian, MAGMA gene-based, multidimensional scaling (MDS), functional enrichment, and in silico permutation analyses for independent technical and biological replications, we highlighted 4 susceptible genes (CHCHD1, TUBG1, LY6G6C, and MRPS17) associated with CAD risk. Based on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, these 4 genes were found to interact with each other. We detected a remarkably altered co-expression pattern among these 4 genes between CAD patients and controls. In addition, 3 genes of CHCHD1 (P = .0013), TUBG1 (P = .004), and LY6G6C (P = .038) showed significantly different expressions between CAD patients and controls. Together, we provide evidence to support that these identified genes such as CHCHD1 and TUBG1 are indicative factors of CAD.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."
"33767912","Predicting transcription factor binding sites using DNA shape features based on shared hybrid deep learning architecture.","Mol Ther Nucleic Acids","The study of transcriptional regulation is still difficult yet fundamental in molecular biology research. Recent research has shown that the double helix structure of nucleotides plays an important role in improving the accuracy and interpretability of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Although several computational methods have been designed to take both DNA sequence and DNA shape features into consideration simultaneously, how to design an efficient model is still an intractable topic. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid convolutional recurrent neural network (CNN/RNN) architecture, CRPTS, to predict TFBSs by combining DNA sequence and DNA shape features. The novelty of our proposed method relies on three critical aspects: (1) the application of a shared hybrid CNN and RNN has the ability to efficiently extract features from large-scale genomic sequences obtained by high-throughput technology; (2) the common patterns were found from DNA sequences and their corresponding DNA shape features; (3) our proposed CRPTS can capture local structural information of DNA sequences without completely relying on DNA shape data. A series of comprehensive experiments on 66in vitrodatasets derived from universal protein binding microarrays (uPBMs) shows that our proposed method CRPTS obviously outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.© 2021 The Authors."

ACL rupture exhibits both hereditary and environmental risk factors, but the genetic basis of the disease remains unexplained. Spontaneous ACL rupture in the dog has a similar disease presentation and progression, making it a valuable genomic model for ACL rupture. We leveraged the dog model with Bayesian mixture model (BMM) analysis (BayesRC) to identify novel and relevant genetic variants associated with ACL rupture. We performed RNA sequencing of ACL and synovial tissue and assigned single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within differentially expressed genes to biological prior classes. SNPs with the largest effects were on chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9, and 24. Selection signature analysis identified several regions under selection in ACL rupture cases compared to controls. These selection signatures overlapped with genome-wide associations with ACL rupture as well as morphological traits. Notable findings include differentially expressedACSF3withMC1R(coat color) and an association on chromosome 7 that overlaps the boundaries ofSMAD2(weight and body size). Smaller effect associations were within or near genes associated with regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, including several collagen genes. The results of the current analysis are consistent with previous work published by our laboratory and others, and also highlight new genes in biological pathways that have not previously been associated with ACL rupture. The genetic associations identified in this study mirror those found in human beings, which lays the groundwork for development of disease-modifying therapies for both species.Copyright © 2021 Baker, Momen, McNally, Berres, Binversie, Sample and Muir."

Despite higher response rates and prolonged progression free survival (PFS) compared with platinum doublet chemotherapy, a subset of these patients do not receive prolonged benefit from these agents. We investigate if the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and other markers of cachexia and chronic inflammation correlate with worse outcomes in these patients.This study is a retrospective review of 137 patients with advancedEGFR-mutated NSCLC treated with TKIs at Rush University Medical Center and University of Chicago Medicine from August 2011 to July 2019, with outcomes followed through July 2020. The predictive value of NLR and body mass index (BMI) was assessed at the start of therapy, and after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment by univariable and multivariable analyses.On univariable analysis, NLR ≥ 5 or higher NLR on a continuous scale were both associated with significantly worse PFS and overall survival (OS) at treatment initiation, and after 6 or 12 weeks of treatment. On multivariable analysis, NLR ≥ 5 was associated with increased risk of death at 12 weeks of therapy (HR 3.002, 95% CI 1.282-7.029,p= 0.011), as was higher NLR on a continuous scale (HR 1.231, 95% CI 1.063-1.425,p= 0.0054). There was no difference in PFS and OS and amongst BMI categories though number of disease sites and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status was associated with worse PFS and OS.Patients with NLR ≥ 5 have a worse median PFS and median OS than patients with NLR < 5. NLR may have value as a predictive biomarker and may be useful for selecting patients for therapy intensification in the front-line setting either at diagnosis or after 12 weeks on therapy. NLR needs to be validated prospectively."
"33803348","Inflammation-Related Markers and Thyroid Function Measures in Pediatric Patients: Is the Grade of Obesity Relevant?","Diagnostics (Basel)","We aimed to investigate the effect of weight status on inflammation-related markers and thyroid function tests in overweight and obese pediatric patients. Children and adolescents diagnosed between January 2017 and January 2019 with overweight or obesity were included in the study. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) were calculated for the groups defined according to Body Mass Index (BMI)-for-agez-score: overweight (≥1 BMI-for-agez-score), obese (≥2 BMI-for-agez-score) and severely obese (≥3 BMI-for-agez-score). Severely obese patients had significantly higher value of white blood cells (WBC) counts (median = 7.92) compared with overweight patients (7.37,p= 0.014). Absolute lymphocyte count was significantly associated with obesity degree in children (Spearman's Rho coefficientρ= 0.228.p= 0.035), whereas absolute polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNCs) count was significantly higher in severely obese adolescents than overweight adolescents (overweight: 4.04 vs. severely obese: 5.3 (p= 0.029)). In 8.19% of patients an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was found, and 3.36% of patients had a low level of free thyroxine with an elevated level of TSH. Total absolute WBC count may be a reliable inflammation-related marker in obese pediatric patients without metabolic syndrome, but needs to be validated in the context of all possible covariates.

As a secondary endpoint, we assessed the influence of some demographic, clinical and pathological factors on the response to chemo-hyperthermia.Patients and methods: Between March 2017 and December 2019, 72 consecutive patients were retrospectively analysed. Patients with diseases or conditions that could interfere with systemic inflammatory status or full blood count were excluded. The HIVEC protocol consisted of six weekly intravesical treatments with 40 mg Mitomycin-C diluted in 50 mL distilled water. The drug was heated to a temperature of 43°C. Association of categorical variables with response to HIVEC was evaluated using Yates' chi-squared test and differences in continuous variable were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to define independent predictors of response to HIVEC.Results: Patients who failed HIVEC were more likely to have multiple tumours (P= 0.039) at transurethral resection of bladder and a recurrence rate of >1/year (P= 0.046). Lower post-HIVEC inflammatory indices [C-reactive protein (P= 0.021), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P= 0.027)] and lower pre- (P= 0.014) and post-treatment (P= 0.004) neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) values were significantly associated with the response to the HIVEC regimen (no bladder cancer recurrence or progression). In the multivariate analysis, patients with a recurrence rate of >1/year were eight-times more likely to experience failure of HIVEC (P= 0.007). Higher pre- (P= 0.023) and post-treatment NLR values (P= 0.046) were associated with a worse response to the HIVEC regimen.Conclusions: The recurrence rate and systemic inflammatory response markers could be useful tools to predict the likelihood of obtaining a response with the HIVEC regimen. These markers might help to guide patients about the behaviour of the tumour after BCG failure, predicting failure or success of a conservative treatment.Abbreviations:CHT: chemo-hyperthermia; CIS: carcinomain situ; CRP: C-reactive protein; EAU: European Association of Urology; ESR: erythrocyte sedimentation rate; HG: high grade; HIVEC: Hyperthermic IntraVEsical Chemotherapy; ICD: immunogenic cell death; IL: interleukin; MMC: Mitomycin-C; NK: natural killer; NLR: neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; NMIBC: non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer; PLR: platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio; RC: radical cystectomy; SIR: systemic inflammatory response; TURB: transurethral resection of bladder.© 2021 The Author(s).

"33761971","Tackling tumor microenvironment through epigenetic tools to improve cancer immunotherapy.","Clin Epigenetics","Epigenetic alterations are known contributors to cancer development and aggressiveness. Additional to alterations in cancer cells, aberrant epigenetic marks are present in cells of the tumor microenvironment, including lymphocytes and tumor-associated macrophages, which are often overlooked but known to be a contributing factor to a favorable environment for tumor growth. Therefore, the main aim of this review is to give an overview of the epigenetic alterations affecting immune cells in the tumor microenvironment to provoke an immunosuppressive function and contribute to cancer development. Moreover, immunotherapy is briefly discussed in the context of epigenetics, describing both its combination with epigenetic drugs and the need for epigenetic biomarkers to predict response to immune checkpoint blockage.Combining both topics, epigenetic machinery plays a central role in generating an immunosuppressive environment for cancer growth, which creates a barrier for immunotherapy to be successful. Furthermore, epigenetic-directed compounds may not only affect cancer cells but also immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, which could be beneficial for the clinical response to immunotherapy.Thus, modulating epigenetics in combination with immunotherapy might be a promising therapeutic option to improve the success of this therapy. Further studies are necessary to (1) understand in depth the impact of the epigenetic machinery in the tumor microenvironment; (2) how the epigenetic machinery can be modulated according to tumor type to increase response to immunotherapy and (3) find reliable biomarkers for a better selection of patients eligible to immunotherapy."

Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage is a serious secondary injury in various CNS disorders like stroke, brain tumors, and neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, there are no drugs or therapeutics available to treat specifically BBB damage after a brain injury. Growing knowledge in the field of epigenetics can enhance the understanding of gene level of the BBB and has great potential for the development of novel therapeutic strategies or targets to repair a disrupted BBB.

Shengmai formula (SMF) is a traditional Chinese medicine with antioxidant properties and has been used to treat cardiovascular diseases for a long time. The aim of this study was to explore the protective role of SMF and the mechanism by which it prevents myocardial injury in UFPM-exposed rats with MI.Methods:An MI rat model was established. Animals were randomly divided into five groups: sham, UFPM + MI, SMF (1.08 mg/kg⋅d) + UFPM + MI, SMF (2.16 mg/kg⋅d) + UFPM + MI, and SMF (4.32 mg/kg⋅d) + UFPM + MI. SMF or saline was administrated 7 days before UFPM instillation (100 μg/kg), followed by 24 h of ischemia. Physiological and biochemical parameters were measured, and histopathological examinations were conducted to evaluate myocardial damage. We also explored the potential mechanism of the protective role of SMF using a system pharmacology approach and anin vitromyoblast cell model with small molecule inhibitors.Results:UFPM produced myocardial injuries on myocardial infarct size; serum levels of LDH, CK-MB, and cardiac troponin; and OS responses in the rats with MI. Pretreatment with SMF significantly attenuated these damagesviareversing the biomarkers. SMF also improved histopathology induced by UFPM and significantly altered the PI3K/AKT/MAPK and OS signaling pathways. The expression patterns ofCat,Gstk1, andCybain the UFPM model group were reversed in the SMF-treated group. Inin vitrostudies, SMF attenuated UFPM-induced reactive oxygen species production, mitochondrial damage, and OS responses. The PI3K/AKT/p38 MAPK/Nrf2 pathway was significantly changed in the SMF group compared with that in the UFPM group, whereas opposite results were obtained for pathway inhibition.Conclusion:These findings indicate that SMF prevents OS responses and exerts beneficial effects against myocardial injury induced by UFPM + MI in rats. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT/p38 MAPK/Nrf2 signaling pathway might be involved in the protective effects of SMF.Copyright © 2021 Chen, Guo, Qu, Li, Yang, Yang, Zheng, Liu, Wang, Deng, Zhang, Zhu and Li."

However, the effects of BMI in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (AAAD) on postoperative outcomes remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationships between BMI and in-hospital major adverse outcomes (MAO) in AAAD patients.Patients who underwent AAAD surgery at Cardiac Medical Center of Fujian Province from June 2013 to March 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. They were divided into three groups on the basis of Chinese BMI classification established by the World Health Organization: normal weight group (BMI 18.5-23.9 kg/m2), overweight group (BMI 24-27.9 kg/m2), and obese group (BMI >28 kg/m2). Patients' baseline characteristics, preoperative, operative, and postoperative data were collected. A multivariable logistic regression analysis model was performed to identify the association between BMI and MAO in AAAD patients.Of 777 cases, 31.9% were normal weight, 52.5% were overweight, and 15.6% were obese. A total of 160(20.6%) patients died in-hospital. There was a significant difference between the three groups for MAO (62.9% vs 72.1% vs 77.7%, respectively, P = 0.006). The incidence of postoperative complications did not differ among the three groups, except for postoperative bleeding, and prolonged mechanical ventilation, the proportion of which were higher in the overweight and obese groups. Besides, multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a higher risk of MAO in the overweight [odds ratios (ORs):1.475, 95%CI:1.006-2.162], and obese patients (ORs:2.147, 95%CI:1.219-3.782) with reference to the normal weight patients, and age, white blood cell, prior stroke and cardiopulmonary bypass time were also associated with in-hospital MAO (P<0.05).BMI is independently associated with higher in-hospital MAO in patients who underwent AAAD surgery."

However, its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we developed an ESCC-induced cachexia mouse model using human xenograft ESCC cell lines and found that ESCC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit beta (P4HB) induced apoptosis of skeletal muscle cells. We further identified that P4HB promoted apoptotic response through activating ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway and regulated the stability of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) and subsequent antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Additionally, we proved that the P4HB inhibitor, CCF642, not only rescued apoptosis of muscle cells in vitro, but also prevented body weight loss and muscle wasting in ESCC-induced cachexia mouse model. Overall, these findings demonstrate a novel pathway for ESCC-induced muscle wasting and advocate for the development of P4HB as a potential intervention target for cachexia in patients with ESCC.© 2021 The Authors.

"33827674","The dark side of histones: genomic organization and role of oncohistones in cancer.","Clin Epigenetics","The oncogenic role of histone mutations is one of the most relevant discovery in cancer epigenetics. Recurrent mutations targeting histone genes have been described in pediatric brain tumors, chondroblastoma, giant cell tumor of bone and other tumor types. The demonstration that mutant histones can be oncogenic and drive the tumorigenesis in pediatric tumors, led to the coining of the term ""oncohistones."" The first identified histone mutations were localized at or near residues normally targeted by post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the histone N-terminal tails and suggested a possible interference with histone PTMs regulation and reading.In this review, we describe the peculiar organization of the multiple genes that encode histone proteins, and the latter advances in both the identification and the biological role of histone mutations in cancer. Recent works show that recurrent somatic mutations target both N-terminal tails and globular histone fold domain in diverse tumor types. Oncohistones are often dominant-negative and occur at higher frequencies in tumors affecting children and adolescents. Notably, in many cases the mutations target selectively only some of the genes coding the same histone protein and are frequently associated with specific tumor types or, as documented for histone variant H3.3 in pediatric glioma, with peculiar tumors arising from specific anatomic locations.The overview of the most recent advances suggests that the oncogenic potential of histone mutations can be exerted, together with the alteration of histone PTMs, through the destabilization of nucleosome and DNA-nucleosome interactions, as well as through the disruption of higher-order chromatin structure. However, further studies are necessary to fully elucidate the mechanism of action of oncohistones, as well as to evaluate their possible application to cancer classification, prognosis and to the identification of new therapies."

We examined differential DNA methylation patterns using targeted methyl sequencing of regions regulating gene activity in groups of rural Gambian infants: (a) low and high birthweight (DNA from cord blood (n = 16 andn = 20, respectively), from placental trophoblast tissue (n = 21 andn = 20, respectively), and DNA from peripheral blood collected from infants at 12 months of age (n = 23 andn = 17, respectively)), and, (b) the top 10% showing rapid postnatal length gain (high,n = 20) and the bottom 10% showing slow postnatal length gain (low,n = 20) based on z score change between birth and 12 months of age (LAZ) (DNA from peripheral blood collected from infants at 12 months of age). Using BiSeq analysis to identify significant methylation marks, for birthweight, four differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified in trophoblast DNA, compared to 68 DMRs in cord blood DNA, and 54 DMRs in 12-month peripheral blood DNA. Twenty-five DMRs were observed to be associated with high and low length for age (LAZ) at 12 months. With the exception of five loci (associated with two different genes), there was no overlap between these groups of methylation marks. Of the 194 CpG methylation marks contained within DMRs, 106 were located to defined gene regulatory elements (promoters, CTCF-binding sites, transcription factor-binding sites, and enhancers), 58 to gene bodies (introns or exons), and 30 to intergenic DNA. Distinct methylation patterns associated with birthweight between comparison groups were observed in DNA collected at birth (at the end of intrauterine growth window) compared to those established by 12 months (near the infancy/childhood growth transition). The longitudinal differences in methylation patterns may arise from methylation adjustments, changes in cellular composition of blood or both that continue during the critical postnatal growth period, and in response to early nutritional and infectious environmental exposures with impacts on growth and longer-term health outcomes.© 2020 The Authors.

Different groups have highlighted that men have overall worse survival and higher incidence of transformation to acute leukemia compared to women across neoplasms such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN overlap neoplasms, and CML. More recent studies evaluating the genomic profile of patients with these neoplasms demonstrated a male predominance for mutations in high-risk genes includingASXL1,U2AF1,SRSF2andZRSR2. The understanding of the underlying biology is limited but a number of hypotheses have been developed and are currently being investigated. This review summarizes the current knowledge about sex-related differences in the clinical outcomes and genomic profile of patients with chronic myeloid neoplasms and discusses the hypothesized biologic mechanisms as an attempt to explain these observations."

We review research in this field over the past decade and describe how our understanding of the association between intelligence and all-cause mortality has consolidated with the appearance of new, population-scale data. To try to understand the association better, we discuss how intelligence relates to specific causes of death, diseases/diagnoses and biomarkers of health through the adult life course. We examine the extent to which mortality and health associations with intelligence might be attributable to people's differences in education, other indicators of socioeconomic status, health literacy and adult environments and behaviours. Finally, we discuss whether genetic data provide new tools to understand parts of the intelligence-health associations. Social epidemiologists, differential psychologists and behavioural and statistical geneticists, among others, contribute to cognitive epidemiology; advances will occur by building on a common cross-disciplinary knowledge base."

However, associations between DNAm age and molecular features of stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and its prognosis have not been systematically studied.Method:We calculated the DNAm age of 591 STAD samples and 115 normal stomach samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and gene expression omnibus (GEO) database using the Horvath's clock model. Meanwhile, we utilized survival analysis to evaluate the prognostic value of DNAm age and epigenetic age acceleration shift. In addition, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify DNAm age-associated gene modules and pathways. Finally, the association between DNAm age and molecular features was performed by correlation analysis.Results:DNA methylation age was significantly correlated with chronological age in normal gastric tissues (r= 0.85,p< 0.0001), but it was not associated with chronological age in STAD samples (r= 0.060,p= 0.2369). Compared with tumor adjacent normal tissue, the DNAm age of STAD tissues was significantly decreased. Meanwhile, chronological age in STAD samples was higher than its DNAm age. Both DNAm age and epigenetic acceleration shift were associated with the prognosis of STAD patients. By using correlation analysis, we also found that DNAm age was associated with immunoactivation and stemness in STAD samples.Conclusion:In summary, epigenetic age acceleration of STAD was associated with tumor stemness, immunoactivation, and favorable prognosis.Copyright © 2021 Hong, Yang, Wang, Zhang, Wu, Chen, Zhong, Li, Li, Li, Yu, Chen, Zeng and Zhang."

In humans, VNTRs have been implicated in both Mendelian and complex disorders, but are largely ignored by genomic pipelines due to the complexity of genotyping and the computational expense. We describe adVNTR-NN, a method that uses shallow neural networks to genotype a VNTR in 18 seconds on 55X whole genome data, while maintaining high accuracy. We use adVNTR-NN to genotype 10,264 VNTRs in 652 GTEx individuals. Associating VNTR length with gene expression in 46 tissues, we identify 163 ""eVNTRs"". Of the 22 eVNTRs in blood where independent data is available, 21 (95%) are replicated in terms of significance and direction of association. 49% of the eVNTR loci show a strong and likely causal impact on the expression of genes and 80% have maximum effect size at least 0.3. The impacted genes are involved in diseases including Alzheimer's, obesity and familial cancers, highlighting the importance of VNTRs for understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases."
"33791438","Biological and Environmental Factors Affecting Risk and Resilience among Syrian Refugee Children.","J Psychiatr Brain Sci","More than 21 million people globally are refugees. More than half of these (>10 million) are children, representing a highly vulnerable population. Most children experience high levels of trauma exposure, including war trauma, as well as substantial migration- and resettlement-related stress. These exposures confer risk for mental health problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but their relative contributions have not been fully explicated. These effects may be modulated by the developmental timing of trauma and stress exposure: childhood trauma and stress are broadly linked to worse health outcomes across the lifespan, but the developmental specificity of these effects remains uncertain. Refugee children typically experience the trauma leading up to displacement (e.g., civil war) which often lasts for decades, and for some, followed by resettlement. Longitudinal studies that follow children through this process can provide unique insight into how these experiences of trauma, displacement, and resettlement during development impact mechanisms of risk and resilience. They can also elucidate how environmental and physiological factors may modulate the effects of trauma and stress. The present study includes two groups of families (parents and their 7- to 17-year-old children): (1) Syrian and Iraqi refugee families who experienced war-zone trauma before resettling in the United States in ~2016, and (2) Arab immigrant families who did not experience war-zone trauma prior to resettlement in the United States in ~2016. We assessed symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD in refugee and immigrant children and parents. Skin conductance responses, a measure of autonomic response, saliva samples for genetic and epigenetic analyses, and information about social and environmental context, including family structure, resources, and neighborhood quality, were also collected. Refugee participants provided data at three time points spanning ~3 years following resettlement in the United States: Wave 1, within 1 month of resettlement, Wave 2, 12-24 months post resettlement, and Wave 3 planned for 24-36 months resettlement. Immigrant participants will provide data once, within 3-5 years after immigration, matching the age of Wave 1. This comparison group enables us to compare mental health and biomarkers between refugees and immigrants. Results of these comparative analyses will provide insight into the impact of war trauma versus other types of trauma and adversity on biomarkers of child mental health outcomes. Results from the longitudinal analyses will address refugee mental health trajectories over time, and, in children, across development. Initial data from Wave 1 showed high levels of anxiety in refugee children, as well as high levels of PTSD symptoms and anxiety in their parents. Together, results from these comparative and longitudinal analyses will provide insight into multiple aspects of trauma and stress exposure in refugees and immigrants, including how the developmental timing of trauma exposure impacts biomarkers and mental health across development. Our assessment of multiple factors affecting childhood mental health following trauma exposure, including familial, neighborhood and social context following resettlement may identify modifiable targets for interventions to support well-being in refugees."
"33762588","Versatile knowledge guided network inference method for prioritizing key regulatory factors in multi-omics data.","Sci Rep","Constantly decreasing costs of high-throughput profiling on many molecular levels generate vast amounts of multi-omics data. Studying one biomedical question on two or more omic levels provides deeper insights into underlying molecular processes or disease pathophysiology. For the majority of multi-omics data projects, the data analysis is performed level-wise, followed by a combined interpretation of results. Hence the full potential of integrated data analysis is not leveraged yet, presumably due to the complexity of the data and the lacking toolsets. We propose a versatile approach, to perform a multi-level fully integrated analysis: The Knowledge guIded Multi-Omics Network inference approach, KiMONo ( https://github.com/cellmapslab/kimono ). KiMONo performs network inference by using statistical models for combining omics measurements coupled to a powerful knowledge-guided strategy exploiting prior information from existing biological sources. Within the resulting multimodal network, nodes represent features of all input types e.g. variants and genes while edges refer to knowledge-supported and statistically derived associations. In a comprehensive evaluation, we show that our method is robust to noise and exemplify the general applicability to the full spectrum of multi-omics data, demonstrating that KiMONo is a powerful approach towards leveraging the full potential of data sets for detecting biomarker candidates."

Here, through DNA and RNA portraits we explored the molecular features of breast cancers in a set of Hispanic-Mexican (HM) women and compared them to public multi-ancestry datasets. HM patients present an earlier onset of the disease, particularly in aggressive clinical subtypes, compared to non-Hispanic women. The age-related COSMIC signature 1 was more frequent in HM women than in those from other ancestries. We found the AKT1E17Khotspot mutation in 8% of the HM women and identify the AKT1/PIK3CA axis as a potentially druggable target. Also, HM luminal breast tumors present an enhanced immunogenic phenotype compared to Asiatic and Caucasian tumors. This study is an initial effort to include patients from Hispanic populations in the research of breast cancer etiology and biology to further understand breast cancer disparities."

Wider clinical utility requires access to reproducible algorithms, which allow characterization of mutational signatures in a given tumor sample. Here, we show how mutational signature fitting can be applied to hematological cancer genomes to identify biologically and clinically important mutational processes, highlighting the importance of careful interpretation in light of biological knowledge. Our newly released R package mmsig comes with a dynamic error-suppression procedure that improves specificity in important clinical and biological settings. In particular, mmsig allows accurate detection of mutational signatures with low abundance, such as those introduced by APOBEC cytidine deaminases. This is particularly important in the most recent mutational signature reference (COSMIC v3.1) where each signature is more clearly defined. Our mutational signature fitting algorithm mmsig is a robust tool that can be implemented immediately in the clinic."

"33753749","The origins and genetic interactions of KRAS mutations are allele- and tissue-specific.","Nat Commun","Mutational activation of KRAS promotes the initiation and progression of cancers, especially in the colorectum, pancreas, lung, and blood plasma, with varying prevalence of specific activating missense mutations. Although epidemiological studies connect specific alleles to clinical outcomes, the mechanisms underlying the distinct clinical characteristics of mutant KRAS alleles are unclear. Here, we analyze 13,492 samples from these four tumor types to examine allele- and tissue-specific genetic properties associated with oncogenic KRAS mutations. The prevalence of known mutagenic mechanisms partially explains the observed spectrum of KRAS activating mutations. However, there are substantial differences between the observed and predicted frequencies for many alleles, suggesting that biological selection underlies the tissue-specific frequencies of mutant alleles. Consistent with experimental studies that have identified distinct signaling properties associated with each mutant form of KRAS, our genetic analysis reveals that each KRAS allele is associated with a distinct tissue-specific comutation network. Moreover, we identify tissue-specific genetic dependencies associated with specific mutant KRAS alleles. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that the genetic interactions of oncogenic KRAS mutations are allele- and tissue-specific, underscoring the complexity that drives their clinical consequences."
"33761349","Tunable, division-independent control of gene activation timing by a polycomb switch.","Cell Rep","During development, progenitors often differentiate many cell generations after receiving signals. These delays must be robust yet tunable for precise population size control. Polycomb repressive mechanisms, involving histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), restrain the expression of lineage-specifying genes in progenitors and may delay their activation and ensuing differentiation. Here, we elucidate an epigenetic switch controlling the T cell commitment gene Bcl11b that holds its locus in a heritable inactive state for multiple cell generations before activation. Integrating experiments and modeling, we identify a mechanism where H3K27me3 levels at Bcl11b, regulated by methyltransferase and demethylase activities, set the time delay at which the locus switches from a compacted, silent state to an extended, active state. This activation delay robustly spans many cell generations, is tunable by chromatin modifiers and transcription factors, and is independent of cell division. With their regulatory flexibility, such timed epigenetic switches may broadly control timing in development.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"33734444","In search of lost time: Enhancers as modulators of timing in lymphocyte development and differentiation.","Immunol Rev","Proper timing of gene expression is central to lymphocyte development and differentiation. Lymphocytes often delay gene activation for hours to days after the onset of signaling components, which act on the order of seconds to minutes. Such delays play a prominent role during the intricate choreography of developmental events and during the execution of an effector response. Though a number of mechanisms are sufficient to explain timing at short timescales, it is not known how timing delays are implemented over long timescales that may span several cell generations. Based on the literature, we propose that a class of cis-regulatory elements, termed ""timing enhancers,"" may explain how timing delays are controlled over these long timescales. By considering chromatin as a kinetic barrier to state switching, the timing enhancer model explains experimentally observed dynamics of gene expression where other models fall short. In this review, we elaborate on features of the timing enhancer model and discuss the evidence for its generality throughout development and differentiation. We then discuss potential molecular mechanisms underlying timing enhancer function. Finally, we explore recent evidence drawing connections between timing enhancers and genetic risk for immunopathology. We argue that the timing enhancer model is a useful framework for understanding how cis-regulatory elements control the central dimension of timing in lymphocyte biology.© 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The disease is characterized by deposition of drusen between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane, RPE atrophy and death of photoreceptors. AMD is a complex disease with multiple genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 52 variants at 34 genetic loci associated with AMD. A majority of the AMD-GWAS variants are present in non-coding region of the genome and could quantitatively impact distinct human traits [called quantitative trait loci (QTLs)] by affecting regulation of gene expression. The integration of different regulatory features, such as open-chromatin regions, histone marks, transcription factor binding sites, with AMD-GWAS can provide meaningful insights into variant's function. However, functional interpretation of variant-gene relationship in AMD is challenging because of inadequate understanding of cell-type specific and context-dependent information in disease-relevant tissues. Here we focus on the role of sequencing-based omic studies in assigning biological meaning to disease-associated variants and genes. We also discuss the methods and model systems that can be utilized to unravel molecular mechanisms of a complex disorder like AMD."

To identify new treatment targets, we integrated depression genome-wide association study (GWAS) results (N = 500,199) with human brain proteomes (N = 376) to perform a proteome-wide association study of depression followed by Mendelian randomization. We identified 19 genes that were consistent with being causal in depression, acting via their respective cis-regulated brain protein abundance. We replicated nine of these genes using an independent depression GWAS (N = 307,353) and another human brain proteomic dataset (N = 152). Eleven of the 19 genes also had cis-regulated mRNA levels that were associated with depression, based on integration of the depression GWAS with human brain transcriptomes (N = 888). Meta-analysis of the discovery and replication proteome-wide association study analyses identified 25 brain proteins consistent with being causal in depression, 20 of which were not previously implicated in depression by GWAS. Together, these findings provide promising brain protein targets for further mechanistic and therapeutic studies."

However, shared genetic determinations underlying the two diseases remain largely unknown.Our analysis relied on summary statistics available from genome-wide association studies of SLE (N= 23,210) and RA (N= 58,284). We first evaluated the genetic correlation between RA and SLE through the linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC). Then, we performed a multiple-tissue eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) weighted integrative analysis for each of the two diseases and aggregated association evidence across these tissues via the recently proposed harmonic meanP-value (HMP) combination strategy, which can produce a single well-calibratedP-value for correlated test statistics. Afterwards, we conducted the pleiotropy-informed association using conjunction conditional FDR (ccFDR) to identify potential pleiotropic genes associated with both RA and SLE.We found there existed a significant positive genetic correlation (rg= 0.404,P= 6.01E-10) via LDSC between RA and SLE. Based on the multiple-tissue eQTL weighted integrative analysis and the HMP combination across various tissues, we discovered 14 potential pleiotropic genes by ccFDR, among which four were likely newly novel genes (i.e.,INPP5B,OR5K2,RP11-2C24.5, andCTD-3105H18.4). The SNP effect sizes of these pleiotropic genes were typically positively dependent, with an average correlation of 0.579. Functionally, these genes were implicated in multiple auto-immune relevant pathways such as inositol phosphate metabolic process, membrane and glucagon signaling pathway.This study reveals common genetic components between RA and SLE and provides candidate associated loci for understanding of molecular mechanism underlying the comorbidity of the two diseases.Copyright © 2021 Lu, Zhang, Jiang, Zhang, Wang, Zhao and Zeng."

Using the largest ALS GWAS summary statistic (n = 80,610), we identified seven novel genes using 19 tissue reference panels. We conducted a conditional analysis to verify the genes' independence and to confirm that they are driven by genetically regulated expressions. Furthermore, we performed a TWAS-based enrichment analysis to highlight the association of important biological pathways, one in each of the four tissue reference panels. Finally, utilizing a connectivity map, a database of human cell expression profiles cultured with bioactive small molecules, we discovered functional associations between genes and drugs to identify 15 bioactive small molecules as potential drug candidates for ALS. We believe that, by integrating the largest ALS GWAS summary statistic with gene expression to identify new risk loci and causal genes, our study provides strong candidates for molecular basis experiments in ALS."
"33778213","Genetic Risk Stratification: A Paradigm Shift in Prevention of Coronary Artery Disease.","JACC Basic Transl Sci","Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a pandemic disease that is highly preventable as shown by secondary prevention. Primary prevention is preferred knowing that 50% of the population can expect a cardiac event in their lifetime. Risk stratification for primary prevention using the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology predicted 10-year risk based on conventional risk factors for CAD is less than optimal. Conventional risk factors such as hypertension, cholesterol, and age are age-dependent and not present until the sixth or seventh decade of life. The genetic risk score (GRS), which is estimated from the recently discovered genetic variants predisposed to CAD, offers a potential solution to this dilemma. The GRS, which is derived from genotyping the population with a microarray containing these genetic risk variants, has indicated that genetic risk stratification based on the GRS is superior to that of conventional risk factors in detecting those at high risk and who would benefit most from statin therapy. Studies performed in >1 million individuals confirmed genetic risk stratification is superior and primarily independent of conventional risk factors. Prospective clinical trials based on risk stratification for CAD using the GRS have shown lifestyle changes, physical activity, and statin therapy are associated with 40% to 50% reduction in cardiac events in the high genetic risk group (20%). Genetic risk stratification has the advantage of being innate to an individual's DNA, and because DNA does not change in a lifetime, it is independent of age. Genetic risk stratification is inexpensive and can be performed worldwide, providing risk analysis at any age and thus has the potential to revolutionize primary prevention.© 2021 The Authors."

"33808317","iEnhancer-GAN: A Deep Learning Framework in Combination with Word Embedding and Sequence Generative Adversarial Net to Identify Enhancers and Their Strength.","Int J Mol Sci","As critical components of DNA, enhancers can efficiently and specifically manipulate the spatial and temporal regulation of gene transcription. Malfunction or dysregulation of enhancers is implicated in a slew of human pathology. Therefore, identifying enhancers and their strength may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of gene transcription and facilitate the discovery of candidate drug targets. In this paper, a new enhancer and its strength predictor, iEnhancer-GAN, is proposed based on a deep learning framework in combination with the word embedding and sequence generative adversarial net (Seq-GAN). Considering the relatively small training dataset, the Seq-GAN is designed to generate artificial sequences. Given that each functional element in DNA sequences is analogous to a ""word"" in linguistics, the word segmentation methods are proposed to divide DNA sequences into ""words"", and the skip-gram model is employed to transform the ""words"" into digital vectors. In view of the powerful ability to extract high-level abstraction features, a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is constructed to perform the identification tasks, and the word vectors of DNA sequences are vertically concatenated to form the embedding matrices as the input of the CNN. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Seq-GAN to expand the training dataset, the possibility of applying word segmentation methods to extract ""words"" from DNA sequences, the feasibility of implementing the skip-gram model to encode DNA sequences, and the powerful prediction ability of the CNN. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods on the training dataset and independent test dataset, the proposed method achieves a significantly improved overall performance. It is anticipated that the proposed method has a certain promotion effect on enhancer related fields."

"33828297","Genome-wide enhancer maps link risk variants to disease genes.","Nature","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of noncoding loci that are associated with human diseases and complex traits, each of which could reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease1. Many of the underlying causal variants may affect enhancers2,3, but we lack accurate maps of enhancers and their target genes to interpret such variants. We recently developed the activity-by-contact (ABC) model to predict which enhancers regulate which genes and validated the model using CRISPR perturbations in several cell types4. Here we apply this ABC model to create enhancer-gene maps in 131 human cell types and tissues, and use these maps to interpret the functions of GWAS variants. Across 72 diseases and complex traits, ABC links 5,036 GWAS signals to 2,249 unique genes, including a class of 577 genes that appear to influence multiple phenotypes through variants in enhancers that act in different cell types. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causal variants are enriched in predicted enhancers by more than 20-fold in particular cell types such as dendritic cells, and ABC achieves higher precision than other regulatory methods at connecting noncoding variants to target genes. These variant-to-function maps reveal an enhancer that contains an IBD risk variant and that regulates the expression of PPIF to alter the membrane potential of mitochondria in macrophages. Our study reveals principles of genome regulation, identifies genes that affect IBD and provides a resource and generalizable strategy to connect risk variants of common diseases to their molecular and cellular functions."

We performed a multivariate genome-wide association study of cortical surface morphology in 19,644 individuals of European ancestry, identifying 472 genomic loci influencing brain shape, of which 76 are also linked to face shape. Shared loci include transcription factors involved in craniofacial development, as well as members of signaling pathways implicated in brain-face cross-talk. Brain shape heritability is equivalently enriched near regulatory regions active in either forebrain organoids or facial progenitors. However, we do not detect significant overlap between shared brain-face genome-wide association study signals and variants affecting behavioral-cognitive traits. These results suggest that early in embryogenesis, the face and brain mutually shape each other through both structural effects and paracrine signaling, but this interplay may not impact later brain development associated with cognitive function."

Although chromosome conformation capture (3C) and its derivative technologies have been successfully applied to nominate putative causal genes for non-coding variants, many GWAS target genes have not been identified yet. This study generated a high-resolution contact map from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells with two H3K27ac-HiChIP libraries and analyzed the underlying gene networks for 15 risk loci identified from the largest EOC GWAS. By combinatory analysis of 4,021 fine-mapped credible variants of EOC GWAS and high-resolution contact map, we obtained 162 target genes that mainly enriched in cancer related pathways. Compared with GTEx eQTL genes in ovarian tissue and annotated proximal genes, 132 HiChIP targets were first identified for EOC causal variants. More than half of the credible variants (CVs) involved interactions that were over 185 kb in distance, indicating that long-range transcriptional regulation is an important mechanism for the function of GWAS variants in EOC. We also found that many HiChIP gene targets showed significantly differential expressions between normal ovarian and EOC tumor samples. We validated one of these targets by manipulating the rs9303542 located region with CRISPR-Cas9 deletion and dCas9-VP64 activation experiments and found altered expression of HOXB7 and HOXB8 at 17q21.32.

"33828129","The impact of late-career job loss and genetic risk on body mass index: Evidence from variance polygenic scores.","Sci Rep","Unemployment shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic have reignited concerns over the long-term effects of job loss on population health. Past research has highlighted the corrosive effects of unemployment on health and health behaviors. This study examines whether the effects of job loss on changes in body mass index (BMI) are moderated by genetic predisposition using data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS). To improve detection of gene-by-environment (G × E) interplay, we interacted layoffs from business closures-a plausibly exogenous environmental exposure-with whole-genome polygenic scores (PGSs) that capture genetic contributions to both the population mean (mPGS) and variance (vPGS) of BMI. Results show evidence of genetic moderation using a vPGS (as opposed to an mPGS) and indicate genome-wide summary measures of phenotypic plasticity may further our understanding of how environmental stimuli modify the distribution of complex traits in a population."

In this study, we explored the candidate function of aZFP90variant (rs1170426) in the context of SLE and detected the relationship between SLE susceptible genes and SLE drug target genes. First, we investigated the regulatory role of rs1170426 onZFP90expression by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), T, B, and monocytes cells and annotated the regulatory function of rs1170426 using bioinformatic databases. Second, we compared the case-control difference inZFP90expression levels. Third, we analyzed the association of genotype andZFP90expression levels with SLE clinical characters. Last, we showed the interaction of SLE susceptibility genes with SLE drug target genes. Subjects with the risk allele ""C"" of rs1170426 had lower expression levels ofZFP90in PBMCs (P= 0.006) and CD8+ T cells (P= 0.003) from controls. SLE cases also had lower expression levels compared with controls (P= 2.78E-9). After correction for multiple testing, theZFP90expression levels were related to serositis (FDRp= 0.004), arthritis (FDRp= 0.020), hematological involvement (FDRp= 0.021), and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (FDRp= 0.005) in cases. Furthermore, the SLE susceptible genes and the recognized SLE drug target genes were more likely to act upon each other compared with non-SLE genetic genes (OR = 2.701,P= 1.80E-5). These findings suggest thatZFP90might play a role in the pathogenesis of SLE, and SLE genetics would contribute to therapeutic drug discovery.Copyright © 2021 Zhu, Huang, Qian, Sheng, Zhang, Chen, Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Liu, Ding and Liu."
"33795017","Regulatory roles and mechanisms of alternative RNA splicing in adipogenesis and human metabolic health.","Cell Biosci","Alternative splicing (AS) regulates gene expression patterns at the post-transcriptional level and generates a striking expansion of coding capacities of genomes and cellular protein diversity. RNA splicing could undergo modulation and close interaction with genetic and epigenetic machinery. Notably, during the adipogenesis processes of white, brown and beige adipocytes, AS tightly interplays with the differentiation gene program networks. Here, we integrate the available findings on specific splicing events and distinct functions of different splicing regulators as examples to highlight the directive biological contribution of AS mechanism in adipogenesis and adipocyte biology. Furthermore, accumulating evidence has suggested that mutations and/or altered expression in splicing regulators and aberrant splicing alterations in the obesity-associated genes are often linked to humans' diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysregulation phenotypes. Therefore, significant attempts have been finally made to overview novel detailed discussion on the prospects of splicing machinery with obesity and metabolic disorders to supply featured potential management mechanisms in clinical applicability for obesity treatment strategies."

Studies have revealed that the overexpression of a dominant-negative form of IRX3 in the mouse hypothalamus and adipose tissue promoted energy expenditure by enhancing brown/browning activities. Meanwhile, we and others recently demonstrated thatIRX3knockdown impaired the browning program of primary preadipocytesin vitro. In this study, we aimed to further clarify the effects of overexpressing humanIRX3(hIRX3) on brown/beige adipose tissuesin vivo.Brown/beige adipocyte-specific hIRX3-overexpressing mice were generated and the browning program of white adipose tissues was induced by both chronic cold stimulation and CL316,243 injection. Body weight, fat mass, lean mass, and energy expenditure were measured, while morphological changes and the expression of thermogenesis-related genes in adipose tissue were analyzed. Moreover, the browning capacity of primary preadipocytes derived from hIRX3-overexpressing mice was assessed. RNA sequencing was also employed to investigate the effect of hIRX3on the expression of thermogenesis-related genes.hIRX3overexpression in embryonic brown/beige adipose tissues (Rosa26hIRX3;Ucp1-Cre) led to increased energy expenditure, decreased fat mass, and a lean body phenotype. After acute cold exposure or CL316,243 stimulation, brown/beige tissue hIRX3-overexpressing mice showed an increase inUcp1expression. Consistent with this, induced hIRX3overexpression in adult mice (Rosa26hIRX3;Ucp1-CreERT2) also promoted a moderate increase inUcp1expression.Ex vitroexperiments further revealed that hIRX3overexpression induced byUcp1-driven Cre recombinase activity upregulated brown/beige adipocytesUcp1expression and oxygen consumption rate (OCR). RNA sequencing analyses indicated that hIRX3overexpression in brown adipocytes enhanced brown fat cell differentiation, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis.Consistent with thein vitrofindings, brown/beige adipocyte-specific overexpression of hIRX3promotedUcp1expression and thermogenesis, while reducing fat mass.Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Wu, He, Lu, Li, Yang, Gu, Liu, Hong and Wang."

Because theories about pathogenesis drive experimental design, focus, and even therapeutic approach, it is important to consider their impact on our current understanding about vitiligo. Animal models allow researchers to perform mechanistic studies, and the development of improved patient sample collection methods provides a platform for translational studies in vitiligo that can also be applied to understand other autoimmune diseases that are more difficult to study in human samples.

"33730188","Defining the underlying defect in insulin action in type 2 diabetes.","Diabetologia","Insulin resistance is one of the earliest defects in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Over the past 50 years, elucidation of the insulin signalling network has provided important mechanistic insights into the abnormalities of glucose, lipid and protein metabolism that underlie insulin resistance. In classical target tissues (liver, muscle and adipose tissue), insulin binding to its receptor initiates a broad signalling cascade mediated by changes in phosphorylation, gene expression and vesicular trafficking that result in increased nutrient utilisation and storage, and suppression of catabolic processes. Insulin receptors are also expressed in non-classical targets, such as the brain and endothelial cells, where it helps regulate appetite, energy expenditure, reproductive hormones, mood/behaviour and vascular function. Recent progress in cell biology and unbiased molecular profiling by mass spectrometry and DNA/RNA-sequencing has provided a unique opportunity to dissect the determinants of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome; best studied are extrinsic factors, such as circulating lipids, amino acids and other metabolites and exosomal microRNAs. More challenging has been defining the cell-intrinsic factors programmed by genetics and epigenetics that underlie insulin resistance. In this regard, studies using human induced pluripotent stem cells and tissues point to cell-autonomous alterations in signalling super-networks, involving changes in phosphorylation and gene expression both inside and outside the canonical insulin signalling pathway. Understanding how these multi-layered molecular networks modulate insulin action and metabolism in different tissues will open new avenues for therapy and prevention of type 2 diabetes and its associated pathologies."

Mendelian Randomization (MR) may overcome the limitations of observational studies, e.g., unmeasured confounding and uncertainties about cause and effect. We aimed to elucidate associations between neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. To that end, we applied a two-sample, bidirectional, univariable, and multivariable MR design to genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of neuropsychiatric disorders and COVID-19 phenotypes (released in January 2021). In single-variable Generalized Summary MR analysis, the most significant and only Bonferroni-corrected significant result was found for genetic liability to BIP-SCZ (a combined GWAS of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as cases vs. controls) increasing risk of COVID-19 (OR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.06-1.28). However, we found a significant, positive genetic correlation between BIP-SCZ and COVID-19 of 0.295 and could not confirm causal or horizontally pleiotropic effects using another method. No genetic liabilities to COVID-19 phenotypes increased the risk of (neuro)psychiatric disorders. In multivariable MR using both neuropsychiatric and a range of other phenotypes, only genetic instruments of BMI remained causally associated with COVID-19. All sensitivity analyses confirmed the results. In conclusion, while genetic liability to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia combined slightly increased COVID-19 susceptibility in one univariable analysis, other MR and multivariable analyses could only confirm genetic underpinnings of BMI to be causally implicated in COVID-19 susceptibility. Thus, using MR we found no consistent proof of genetic liabilities to (neuro)psychiatric disorders contributing to COVID-19 liability or vice versa, which is in line with at least two observational studies. Previously reported positive associations between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 by others may have resulted from statistical models incompletely capturing BMI as a continuous covariate."
"33830993","Sex-stratified genome-wide association study of multisite chronic pain in UK Biobank.","PLoS Genet","Chronic pain is highly prevalent worldwide and imparts a significant socioeconomic and public health burden. Factors influencing susceptibility to, and mechanisms of, chronic pain development, are not fully understood, but sex is thought to play a significant role, and chronic pain is more prevalent in women than in men. To investigate sex differences in chronic pain, we carried out a sex-stratified genome-wide association study of Multisite Chronic Pain (MCP), a derived chronic pain phenotype, in UK Biobank on 178,556 men and 209,093 women, as well as investigating sex-specific genetic correlations with a range of psychiatric, autoimmune and anthropometric phenotypes and the relationship between sex-specific polygenic risk scores for MCP and chronic widespread pain. We also assessed whether MCP-associated genes showed expression pattern enrichment across tissues. A total of 123 SNPs at five independent loci were significantly associated with MCP in men. In women, a total of 286 genome-wide significant SNPs at ten independent loci were discovered. Meta-analysis of sex-stratified GWAS outputs revealed a further 87 independent associated SNPs. Gene-level analyses revealed sex-specific MCP associations, with 31 genes significantly associated in females, 37 genes associated in males, and a single gene, DCC, associated in both sexes. We found evidence for sex-specific pleiotropy and risk for MCP was found to be associated with chronic widespread pain in a sex-differential manner. Male and female MCP were highly genetically correlated, but at an rg of significantly less than 1 (0.92). All 37 male MCP-associated genes and all but one of 31 female MCP-associated genes were found to be expressed in the dorsal root ganglion, and there was a degree of enrichment for expression in sex-specific tissues. Overall, the findings indicate that sex differences in chronic pain exist at the SNP, gene and transcript abundance level, and highlight possible sex-specific pleiotropy for MCP. Results support the proposition of a strong central nervous-system component to chronic pain in both sexes, additionally highlighting a potential role for the DRG and nociception."

One possible contributor to this is that the two disorders show high genetic correlation. However, the specific regions of the genome that may be responsible for this overlap are unclear. To identify variants associated with both ADHD and MDD, we performed a meta-analysis of GWAS of ADHD and MDD. All genome wide significant (p < 5 × 10-8) SNPs in the meta-analysis that were also strongly associated (p < 5 × 10-4) independently with each disorder were followed up. These putatively pleiotropic SNPs were tested for additional associations across a broad range of phenotypes. Fourteen linkage disequilibrium-independent SNPs were associated with each disorder separately (p < 5 × 10-4) and in the cross-disorder meta-analysis (p < 5 × 10-8). Nine of these SNPs had not been highlighted previously in either individual GWAS. Evidence supported nine of the fourteen SNPs acting as eQTL and two as brain eQTL. Index SNPs and their genomic regions demonstrated associations with other mental health phenotypes. Through conducting meta-analysis on ADHD and MDD only, our results build upon the previously observed genetic correlation between ADHD and MDD and reveal novel genomic regions that may be implicated in this overlap."
"33785739","Model-based assessment of replicability for genome-wide association meta-analysis.","Nat Commun","Genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAMA) is an effective approach to enlarge sample sizes and empower the discovery of novel associations between genotype and phenotype. Independent replication has been used as a gold-standard for validating genetic associations. However, as current GWAMA often seeks to aggregate all available datasets, it becomes impossible to find a large enough independent dataset to replicate new discoveries. Here we introduce a method, MAMBA (Meta-Analysis Model-based Assessment of replicability), for assessing the ""posterior-probability-of-replicability"" for identified associations by leveraging the strength and consistency of association signals between contributing studies. We demonstrate using simulations that MAMBA is more powerful and robust than existing methods, and produces more accurate genetic effects estimates. We apply MAMBA to a large-scale meta-analysis of addiction phenotypes with 1.2 million individuals. In addition to accurately identifying replicable common variant associations, MAMBA also pinpoints novel replicable rare variant associations from imputation-based GWAMA and hence greatly expands the set of analyzable variants."

Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the common substrate serves as an intermediate phenotype to detect genetic risk variants relevant for psychiatric disease. To this end, after a data reduction step, we conducted genome-wide association studies of a combined common substrate measure in four population-based cohorts (n = 2271), followed by meta-analysis and replication in a fifth cohort (n = 865). After correction for covariates, the heritability of the common substrate was estimated at 0.50 (standard error 0.18). The top single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17076061 was associated with the common substrate at genome-wide significance and replicated, explaining 1.2% of the common substrate variance. This SNP mapped to a locus on chromosome 5q35.2 harboring genes involved in neuronal development and regeneration. In follow-up analyses, rs17076061 was not robustly associated with psychiatric disease, and no overlap was found between the broader genetic architecture of the common substrate and genetic risk for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. In conclusion, our study identified that common genetic variation indeed influences the common substrate, but that these variants do not directly translate to increased disease risk. Future studies should investigate gene-by-environment interactions and employ functional imaging to understand how salience network structure translates to psychiatric disorder risk."
"33773584","Boosting heritability: estimating the genetic component of phenotypic variation with multiple sample splitting.","BMC Bioinformatics","Heritability is a central measure in genetics quantifying how much of the variability observed in a trait is attributable to genetic differences. Existing methods for estimating heritability are most often based on random-effect models, typically for computational reasons. The alternative of using a fixed-effect model has received much more limited attention in the literature.In this paper, we propose a generic strategy for heritability inference, termed as ""boosting heritability"", by combining the advantageous features of different recent methods to produce an estimate of the heritability with a high-dimensional linear model. Boosting heritability uses in particular a multiple sample splitting strategy which leads in general to a stable and accurate estimate. We use both simulated data and real antibiotic resistance data from a major human pathogen, Sptreptococcus pneumoniae, to demonstrate the attractive features of our inference strategy.Boosting is shown to offer a reliable and practically useful tool for inference about heritability."

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for CAA in KD patients of European descent with 200 cases and 276 controls. A second GWAS for susceptibility pooled KD cases with healthy paediatric controls from vaccine trials in the UK (n = 1609). Logistic regression mixed models were used for both GWASs. The susceptibility GWAS was meta-analysed with 400 KD cases and 6101 controls from a previous European GWAS, these results were further meta-analysed with Japanese GWASs at two putative loci. The CAA GWAS identified an intergenic region of chromosome 20q13 with multiple SNVs showing genome-wide significance. The risk allele of the most associated SNV (rs6017006) was present in 13% of cases and 4% of controls; in East Asian 1000 Genomes data, the allele was absent or rare. Susceptibility GWAS with meta-analysis with previously published European data identified two previously associated loci (ITPKC and FCGR2A). Further meta-analysis with Japanese GWAS summary data from the CASP3 and FAM167A genomic regions validated these loci in Europeans showing consistent effects of the top SNVs in both populations. We identified a novel locus for CAA in KD patients of European descent. The results suggest that different genes determine susceptibility to KD and development of CAA and future work should focus on the function of the intergenic region on chromosome 20q13."

However, observational studies cannot fully account for confounding factors. We aimed to systematically assess the causal associations between childhood body mass index (BMI) and various adult traits/diseases using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR).After data filtering, 263 adult traits genetically correlated with childhood BMI (P < 0.05) were subjected to MR analyses. Inverse-variance weighted, MR-Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode methods were used to estimate the causal effects. Multivariable MR analysis was performed to test whether the effects of childhood BMI on adult traits are independent from adult BMI.We identified potential causal effects of childhood obesity on 60 adult traits (27 disease-related traits, 27 lifestyle factors, and 6 other traits). Higher childhood BMI was associated with a reduced overall health rating (β = - 0.10, 95% CI - 0.13 to - 0.07, P = 6.26 × 10-11). Specifically, higher childhood BMI was associated with increased odds of coronary artery disease (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.11, P = 4.28 × 10-11), essential hypertension (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.16, P = 1.27 × 10-11), type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.43, P = 1.57 × 10-34), and arthrosis (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.12, P = 8.80 × 10-9). However, after accounting for adult BMI, the detrimental effects of childhood BMI on disease-related traits were no longer present (P > 0.05). For dietary habits, different from conventional understanding, we found that higher childhood BMI was associated with low calorie density food intake. However, this association might be specific to the UK Biobank population.In summary, we provided a phenome-wide view of the effects of childhood BMI on adult traits. Multivariable MR analysis suggested that the associations between childhood BMI and increased risks of diseases in adulthood are likely attributed to individuals remaining obese in later life. Therefore, ensuring that childhood obesity does not persist into later life might be useful for reducing the detrimental effects of childhood obesity on adult diseases."

Using the Haseman-Elston framework, in this study we explicitly analyzed the mathematical structure of the key termtr(KTK), the trace of high-order term of the genetic relationship matrix, a component involved in the estimation procedure. In this study, we proposed two estimators, which can estimatetr(KTK) with greatly reduced sampling variance compared to the existing method under the same computational complexity.

Heteroplasmic variants that impair mitochondrial capacity cause disease, and the state of heteroplasmy itself is deleterious. However, mitochondrial heteroplasmy may provide an intermediate state in the emergence of novel mitochondrial haplogroups. We used genome-wide genotyping data from 982,072 European ancestry individuals to evaluate variation in mitochondrial heteroplasmy and to identify the regions of the nuclear genome that affect it. Age, sex, and mitochondrial haplogroup were associated with the extent of heteroplasmy. GWAS identified 20 loci for heteroplasmy that exceeded genome-wide significance. This included a region overlapping mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), which has multiple roles in mtDNA packaging, replication, and transcription. These results show that mitochondrial heteroplasmy has a heritable nuclear component.Copyright © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Here we present genome-wide data from three individuals dated to between 45,930 and 42,580 years ago from Bacho Kiro Cave, Bulgaria1,2. They are the earliest Late Pleistocene modern humans known to have been recovered in Europe so far, and were found in association with an Initial Upper Palaeolithic artefact assemblage. Unlike two previously studied individuals of similar ages from Romania7and Siberia8who did not contribute detectably to later populations, these individuals are more closely related to present-day and ancient populations in East Asia and the Americas than to later west Eurasian populations. This indicates that they belonged to a modern human migration into Europe that was not previously known from the genetic record, and provides evidence that there was at least some continuity between the earliest modern humans in Europe and later people in Eurasia. Moreover, we find that all three individuals had Neanderthal ancestors a few generations back in their family history, confirming that the first European modern humans mixed with Neanderthals and suggesting that such mixing could have been common."
"33758005","Mapping the micro-proteome of the nuclear lamina and lamina-associated domains.","Life Sci Alliance","The nuclear lamina is a proteinaceous network of filaments that provide both structural and gene regulatory functions by tethering proteins and large domains of DNA, the so-called lamina-associated domains (LADs), to the periphery of the nucleus. LADs are a large fraction of the mammalian genome that are repressed, in part, by their association to the nuclear periphery. The genesis and maintenance of LADs is poorly understood as are the proteins that participate in these functions. In an effort to identify proteins that reside at the nuclear periphery and potentially interact with LADs, we have taken a two-pronged approach. First, we have undertaken an interactome analysis of the inner nuclear membrane bound LAP2β to further characterize the nuclear lamina proteome. To accomplish this, we have leveraged the BioID system, which previously has been successfully used to characterize the nuclear lamina proteome. Second, we have established a system to identify proteins that bind to LADs by developing a chromatin-directed BioID system. We combined the BioID system with the m6A-tracer system which binds to LADs in live cells to identify both LAD proximal and nuclear lamina proteins. In combining these datasets, we have further characterized the protein network at the nuclear lamina, identified putative LAD proximal proteins and found several proteins that appear to interface with both micro-proteomes. Importantly, several proteins essential for LAD function, including heterochromatin regulating proteins related to H3K9 methylation, were identified in this study.© 2021 Wong et al."

As gene expression traits are under genetic regulation we hypothesise that differences in gene expression variability may identify causal breast cancer susceptibility genes. We performed variable expression quantitative trait loci (veQTL) analysis using tissue-specific expression data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Common Fund Project. veQTL analysis identified 70 associations (p < 5 × 10-8) consisting of 60 genes and 27 breast cancer risk variants, including 55 veQTL that were observed in breast tissue only. Pathway analysis of genes associated with breast-specific veQTL revealed an enrichment of four genes (CYP11B1, CYP17A1 HSD3B2 and STAR) involved in the C21-steroidal biosynthesis pathway that converts cholesterol to breast-related hormones (e.g. oestrogen). Each of these four genes were significantly more variable in individuals homozygous for rs11075995 (A/A) breast cancer risk allele located in the FTO gene, which encodes an RNA demethylase. The A/A allele was also found associated with reduced expression of FTO, suggesting an epi-transcriptomic mechanism may underlie the dysregulation of genes involved in hormonal biosynthesis leading to an increased risk of breast cancer. These findings provide evidence that genetic variants govern high levels of expression variance in breast tissue, thus building a more comprehensive insight into the underlying biology of breast cancer risk loci."
"33722957","Mammalian primordial germ cell specification.","Development","The peri-implantation window of mammalian development is the crucial window for primordial germ cell (PGC) specification. Whereas pre-implantation dynamics are relatively conserved between species, the implantation window marks a stage of developmental divergence between key model organisms, and thus potential variance in the cell and molecular mechanisms for PGC specification. In humans, PGC specification is very difficult to studyin vivoTo address this, the combined use of human and nonhuman primate embryos, and stem cell-based embryo models are essential for determining the origin of PGCs, as are comparative analyses to the equivalent stages of mouse development. Understanding the origin of PGCs in the peri-implantation embryo is crucial not only for accurate modeling of this essential process using stem cells, but also in determining the role of global epigenetic reprogramming upon which sex-specific differentiation into gametes relies.© 2021.

"33815205","Harnessing the Neurobiology of Resilience to Protect the Mental Well-Being of Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic.","Front Psychol","Healthcare workers are at a high risk of psychological morbidity in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is significant variability in the impact of this crisis on individual healthcare workers, which can be best explained through an appreciation of the construct of resilience. Broadly speaking, resilience refers to the ability to successfully adapt to stressful or traumatic events, and thus plays a key role in determining mental health outcomes following exposure to such events. A proper understanding of resilience is vital in enabling a shift from a reactive to a proactive approach for protecting and promoting the mental well-being of healthcare workers. Research in the past decade has identified six areas that provide promising leads in understanding the biological basis of individual variations in resilience. These are: (1) the key role played by the monoamines noradrenaline and serotonin, (2) the centrality of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in influencing stress vulnerability and resilience, (3) the intimate links between the immune system and stress sensitivity, (4) the role of epigenetic modulation of gene expression in influencing the stress response, (5) the role played by certain neuropeptides as a natural ""brake"" mechanism in the face of stress, and (6) the neurobiological mechanisms by which environmental factors, such as exercise, diet, and social support, influence resilience to subsequent life events. Though much of this research is still in its early stages, it has already provided valuable information on which strategies - including dietary changes, lifestyle modification, environmental modification, psychosocial interventions, and even pharmacological treatments - may prove to be useful in fostering resilience in individuals and groups. This paper examines the above evidence more closely, with a specific focus on the challenges faced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provides suggestions regarding how it may be translated into real-world interventions, as well as how the more tentative hypotheses advanced in this field may be tested during this critical period.Copyright © 2021 Rajkumar."
"33807066","Regulation of DNA (de)Methylation Positively Impacts Seed Germination during Seed Development under Heat Stress.","Genes (Basel)","Seed development needs the coordination of multiple molecular mechanisms to promote correct tissue development, seed filling, and the acquisition of germination capacity, desiccation tolerance, longevity, and dormancy. Heat stress can negatively impact these processes and upon the increase of global mean temperatures, global food security is threatened. Here, we explored the impact of heat stress on seed physiology, morphology, gene expression, and methylation on three stages of seed development. Notably, Arabidopsis Col-0 plants under heat stress presented a decrease in germination capacity as well as a decrease in longevity. We observed that upon mild stress, gene expression and DNA methylation were moderately affected. Nevertheless, upon severe heat stress during seed development, gene expression was intensively modified, promoting heat stress response mechanisms including the activation of the ABA pathway. By analyzing candidate epigenetic markers using the mutants' physiological assays, we observed that the lack of DNA demethylation by theROS1gene impaired seed germination by affecting germination-related gene expression. On the other hand, we also observed that upon severe stress, a large proportion of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were located in the promoters and gene sequences of germination-related genes. To conclude, our results indicate that DNA (de)methylation could be a key regulatory process to ensure proper seed germination of seeds produced under heat stress."
"33846299","The landscape of molecular chaperones across human tissues reveals a layered architecture of core and variable chaperones.","Nat Commun","The sensitivity of the protein-folding environment to chaperone disruption can be highly tissue-specific. Yet, the organization of the chaperone system across physiological human tissues has received little attention. Through computational analyses of large-scale tissue transcriptomes, we unveil that the chaperone system is composed of core elements that are uniformly expressed across tissues, and variable elements that are differentially expressed to fit with tissue-specific requirements. We demonstrate via a proteomic analysis that the muscle-specific signature is functional and conserved. Core chaperones are significantly more abundant across tissues and more important for cell survival than variable chaperones. Together with variable chaperones, they form tissue-specific functional networks. Analysis of human organ development and aging brain transcriptomes reveals that these functional networks are established in development and decline with age. In this work, we expand the known functional organization of de novo versus stress-inducible eukaryotic chaperones into a layered core-variable architecture in multi-cellular organisms."

Nevertheless, because of its polygenic nature and genetic heterogeneity, the genetic etiology of TD is not well understood. In this study, we combined the segregation information in 13 TD multiplex families with high-throughput sequencing and genotyping to identify genes associated with TD. Using whole-exome sequencing and genotyping array data, we identified both small and large genetic variants within the individuals. We then combined multiple types of evidence to prioritize candidate genes for TD, including variant segregation pattern, variant function prediction, candidate gene expression, protein-protein interaction network, candidate genes from previous studies, etc. From the 13 families, 71 strong candidate genes were identified, including both known genes for NDDs and novel genes, such as HtrA Serine Peptidase 3 (HTRA3), Cadherin-Related Family Member 1 (CDHR1), and Zinc Finger DHHC-Type Palmitoyltransferase 17 (ZDHHC17). The candidate genes are enriched in several Gene Ontology categories, such as dynein complex and synaptic membrane. Candidate genes and pathways identified in this study provide biological insight into TD etiology and potential targets for future studies."

Trastuzumab is an ERBB2 specific recombinant antibody employed for the treatment of these diseases since it blocks ERBB2 signaling causing growth arrest and survival inhibition. While the effects of Trastuzumab on ERBB2 cancer cells are well known, those on the extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from these cells are scarce. This study focused on ERBB2+breast cancer cells and aimed to establish what type of EVs they release and whether Trastuzumab affects their morphology and molecular composition. To these aims, we performed immunoelectron microscopy, immunoblot, and high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses on EVs purified by differential centrifugation of culture supernatant. Here, we show that EVs released from ERBB2+breast cancer cells are polymorphic in size and appearance and that ERBB2 is preferentially associated with large (120 nm) EVs. Moreover, we report that Trastuzumab (Tz) induces the expression of a specific glycosylated 50 kDa isoform of the CD63 tetraspanin and modulates the expression of 51 EVs proteins, including TOP1. Because these proteins are functionally associated with organelle organization, cytokinesis, and response to lipids, we suggest that Tz may influence these cellular processes in target cells at distant sites via modified EVs."
"33731968","Covariance-based sample selection for heterogeneous data: Applications to gene expression and autism risk gene detection.","J Am Stat Assoc","Risk for autism can be influenced by genetic mutations in hundreds of genes. Based on findings showing that genes with highly correlated gene expressions are functionally interrelated, ""guilt by association"" methods such as DAWN have been developed to identify these autism risk genes. Previous research analyze the BrainSpan dataset, which contains gene expression of brain tissues from varying regions and developmental periods. Since the spatiotemporal properties of brain tissue is known to affect the gene expression's covariance, previous research have focused only on a specific subset of samples to avoid the issue of heterogeneity. This analysis leads to a potential loss of power when detecting risk genes. In this article, we develop a new method called COBS (COvariance-Based sample Selection) to find a larger and more homogeneous subset of samples that share the same population covariance matrix for the downstream DAWN analysis. To demonstrate COBS's effectiveness, we use genetic risk scores from two sequential data freezes obtained in 2014 and 2020. We show COBS improves DAWN's ability to predict risk genes detected in the newer data freeze when using the risk scores of the older data freeze as input."
"33816929","Genome annotation across species using deep convolutional neural networks.","PeerJ Comput Sci","Application of deep neural network is a rapidly expanding field now reaching many disciplines including genomics. In particular, convolutional neural networks have been exploited for identifying the functional role of short genomic sequences. These approaches rely on gathering large sets of sequences with known functional role, extracting those sequences from whole-genome-annotations. These sets are then split into learning, test and validation sets in order to train the networks. While the obtained networks perform well on validation sets, they often perform poorly when applied on whole genomes in which the ratio of positive over negative examples can be very different than in the training set. We here address this issue by assessing the genome-wide performance of networks trained with sets exhibiting different ratios of positive to negative examples. As a case study, we use sequences encompassing gene starts from the RefGene database as positive examples and random genomic sequences as negative examples. We then demonstrate that models trained using data from one organism can be used to predict gene-start sites in a related species, when using training sets providing good genome-wide performance. This cross-species application of convolutional neural networks provides a new way to annotate any genome from existing high-quality annotations in a related reference species. It also provides a way to determine whether the sequence motifs recognised by chromatin-associated proteins in different species are conserved or not.©2020 Khodabandelou et al."

Finally, some new and interesting ideas are proposed (immune cellular heterogeneity, non-coding RNAs, and immunometabolism) which will hopefully bring new discoveries in this area of investigation."
"33796819","Deep neural networks identify sequence context features predictive of transcription factor binding.","Nat Mach Intell","Transcription factors (TFs) bind DNA by recognizing specific sequence motifs, typically of length 6-12bp. A motif can occur many thousands of times in the human genome, but only a subset of those sites are actually bound. Here we present a machine learning framework leveraging existing convolutional neural network architectures and model interpretation techniques to identify and interpret sequence context features most important for predicting whether a particular motif instance will be bound. We apply our framework to predict binding at motifs for 38 TFs in a lymphoblastoid cell line, score the importance of context sequences at base-pair resolution, and characterize context features most predictive of binding. We find that the choice of training data heavily influences classification accuracy and the relative importance of features such as open chromatin. Overall, our framework enables novel insights into features predictive of TF binding and is likely to inform future deep learning applications to interpret non-coding genetic variants."
"33795650","LDHA induces EMT gene transcription and regulates autophagy to promote the metastasis and tumorigenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma.","Cell Death Dis","Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is one of the most common kinds of endocrine-related cancer and has a heterogeneous prognosis. Metabolic reprogramming is one of the hallmarks of cancers. Aberrant glucose metabolism is associated with malignant biological behavior. However, the functions and mechanisms of glucose metabolism genes in PTC are not fully understood. Thus, data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were analyzed, and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) was determined to be a potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for PTCs. The research objective was to investigate the expression of LDHA in PTCs and to explore the main functions and relative mechanisms of LDHA in PTCs. Higher expression levels of LDHA were found in PTC tissues than in normal thyroid tissues at both the mRNA and protein levels. Higher expression levels of LDHA were correlated with aggressive clinicopathological features and poor prognosis. Moreover, we found that LDHA not only promoted PTC migration and invasion but also enhanced tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we revealed that the metabolic products of LDHA catalyzed induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process by increasing the relative gene H3K27 acetylation. Moreover, LDHA knockdown activated the AMPK pathway and induced protective autophagy. An autophagy inhibitor significantly enhanced the antitumor effect of FX11. These results suggested that LDHA enhanced the cell metastasis and proliferation of PTCs and may therefore become a potential therapeutic target for PTCs."

In order to identify pure genomic transcriptional effects of 1,25(OH)2D3, we used VDR cistrome, transcriptome and open chromatin data, obtained from the human monocytic cell line THP-1, for a novel hierarchical analysis applying three bioinformatics approaches. We predicted 75.6% of all early 1,25(OH)2D3-responding (2.5 or 4 h) and 57.4% of the late differentially expressed genes (24 h) to be primary VDR target genes. VDR knockout led to a complete loss of 1,25(OH)2D3-induced genome-wide gene regulation. Thus, there was no indication of any VDR-independent non-genomic actions of 1,25(OH)2D3modulating its transcriptional response. Among the predicted primary VDR target genes, 47 were coding for transcription factors and thus may mediate secondary 1,25(OH)2D3responses. CEBPA and ETS1 ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq following CEBPA knockdown were used to validate the predicted regulation of secondary vitamin D target genes by both transcription factors. In conclusion, a directional network containing 47 partly novel primary VDR target transcription factors describes secondary responses in a highly complex vitamin D signaling cascade. The central transcription factor VDR is indispensable for all transcriptome-wide effects of the nuclear hormone."

We validated this approach by showing that, in pregnant women, circulating DNA carrying fetal-specific alleles was entirely placenta-derived. In lung transplant recipients, we showed that, at 72 hr after transplantation, the lung contributed only a median of 17% to the plasma DNA carrying donor-specific alleles, and hematopoietic cells contributed a median of 78%. In hepatocellular cancer patients, the liver was identified as the predominant source of plasma DNA carrying tumor-specific mutations. In a pregnant woman with lymphoma, plasma DNA molecules carrying cancer mutations and fetal-specific alleles were accurately shown to be derived from the lymphocytes and placenta, respectively. Analysis of tissue origin for plasma DNA carrying genetic variants is potentially useful for noninvasive prenatal testing, transplantation monitoring, and cancer screening."
"33808654","Cancer and Aging: Two Tightly Interconnected Biological Processes.","Cancers (Basel)","Age is one of the main risk factors of cancer; several biological changes linked with the aging process can explain this. As our population is progressively aging, the proportion of older patients with cancer is increasing significantly. Due to the heterogeneity of general health and functional status amongst older persons, treatment of cancer is a major challenge in this vulnerable population. Older patients often experience more side effects of anticancer treatments. Over-treatment should be avoided to ensure an optimal quality of life. On the other hand, under-treatment due to fear of toxicity is a frequent problem and can lead to an increased risk of relapse and worse survival. There is a delicate balance between benefits of therapy and risk of toxicity. Robust biomarkers that reflect the body's biological age may aid in outlining optimal individual treatment regimens for older patients with cancer. In particular, the impact of age on systemic immunity and the tumor immune infiltrate should be considered, given the expanding role of immunotherapy in cancer treatment. In this review, we summarize current knowledge concerning the mechanistic connections between aging and cancer, as well as aging biomarkers that could be helpful in the field of geriatric oncology."
"33809061","Molecular Mechanisms of Obesity-Linked Cardiac Dysfunction: An Up-Date on Current Knowledge.","Cells","Obesity is defined as excessive body fat accumulation, and worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975. Excess of free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglycerides in obese individuals promote ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver, skeletal muscle tissue, and heart, among others, inducing insulin resistance, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes (T2D), atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). These diseases are promoted by visceral white adipocyte tissue (WAT) dysfunction through an increase in pro-inflammatory adipokines, oxidative stress, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and adverse changes in the gut microbiome. In the heart, obesity and T2D induce changes in substrate utilization, tissue metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation, leading to myocardial fibrosis and ultimately cardiac dysfunction. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are involved in the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, also improve insulin sensitivity, triglyceride levels, inflammation, and oxidative stress. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the molecular mechanisms involved in obesity-linked CVD pathophysiology, considering pro-inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, and hormones, as well as the role of oxidative stress, inflammation, and PPARs. In addition, cell lines and animal models, biomarkers, gut microbiota dysbiosis, epigenetic modifications, and current therapeutic treatments in CVD associated with obesity are outlined in this paper."

While a number of studies have examined the association between ACEs and diabetes in Western populations, few have done it in Asian populations. The current study aimed to examine (1) the association between ACEs and diabetes, including the association after age stratification, and (2) the association of comorbid depression, resource use and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among those with diabetes and ACEs in Singapore.Participants were surveyed in their homes or any other preferred venue of their choice.6126 individuals aged 18 years and above were randomly selected among Singapore residents.Cross-sectional nationwide epidemiological study.Exposure to any ACE was not associated with increased odds of diabetes; however, those who had experienced parental separation, death or divorce of a parent had higher odds of diabetes. In addition, we observed significant interaction between age and ACEs in relation to odds of diabetes. ACEs were significantly associated with higher odds of diabetes mainly in the younger age group. The prevalence of major depressive disorder was significantly higher among those with diabetes and ACEs than those with diabetes alone (3.7% and 0.3% respectively).Efforts to promote regular exercise and healthy lifestyles both in the population and among those with diabetes must continue for the prevention and management of diabetes. The findings emphasise the need to create more awareness of both the prevalence and impact of ACEs among those treating chronic diseases.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

In recent years, tissue-specific methylation sites have proven to be very stable biomarkers for distinguishing tissue origin. However, it is still challenging to perform tissue source identification and individual identification simultaneously. In this study, we developed a method that uses tissue-specific methylation markers combined with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to detect semen from mixed biofluids and to identify individuals simultaneously. Semen-specific CpG markers were chosen from the literature and further validated utilizing methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease (MSRE) combined with PCR technology. The neighboring SNP markers were searched in the flanking sequence of the target CpG within 400 bp, and SNP typing was then carried out through a single-base extension reaction followed by capillary electrophoresis. Eventually, a method of MSRE combined with SNaPshot that could detect 12 compound CpG-SNP markers was developed. Using this system, 10 ng of total DNA and DNA mixture with semen content up to 25% could be typed successfully. Moreover, the cumulative discrimination power of the system in the northern Chinese Han population is 0.9998. This study provides a valuable strategy for forensic practice to perform tissue origin and individual identification from mixed stains simultaneously."

The purpose of this study was to classify specific molecular subtypes associated with prognosis of pancreatic cancer using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) multiplatform genomic data.Multiplatform genomic data (N = 178), including gene expression, copy number alteration, and somatic mutation data, were obtained from cancer browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu, cohort: TCGA Pancreatic Cancer). Clinical data including survival results were analyzed. We also used validation cohort (GSE50827) to confirm the robustness of these molecular subtypes in pancreatic cancer.When we performed unsupervised clustering using TCGA gene expression data, we found three distinct molecular subtypes associated with different survival results. Copy number alteration and somatic mutation data showed different genomic patterns for these three subtypes. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that each subtype showed differentially altered pathways. Using each subtype-specific genes (200 were selected), we could predict molecular subtype in another cohort, confirming the robustness of these molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer. Cox regression analysis revealed that molecular subtype is the only significant prognostic factor for pancreatic cancer (P = .042, 95% confidence interval 0.523-0.98).Genomic analysis of pancreatic cancer revealed 3 distinct molecular subtypes associated with different survival results.

"33813720","An Integrated Data Analysis of mRNA, miRNA and Signaling Pathways in Pancreatic Cancer.","Biochem Genet","Although many genes and miRNAs have been reported for various cancers, pancreatic cancer's specific genes or miRNAs have not been studied precisely yet. Therefore, we have analyzed the gene and miRNA expression profile of pancreatic cancer data in the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. The microarray-derived miRNAs and mRNAs were annotated by gene ontology (GO) and signaling pathway analysis. We also recognized mRNAs that were targeted by miRNA through the mirDIP database. An integrated analysis of the microarray revealed that only 6 out of 43 common miRNAs had significant differences in their expression profiles between the tumor and normal groups (P value < 0.05 and |log Fold Changes (logFC)|> 1). The hsa-miR-210 had upregulation, whereas hsa-miR-375, hsa-miR-216a, hsa-miR-217, hsa-miR-216b and hsa-miR-634 had downregulation in pancreatic cancer (PC). The analysis results also revealed 109 common mRNAs by microarray and mirDIP 4.1 databases. Pathway analysis showed that amoebiasis, axon guidance, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, absorption and focal adhesion, adherens junction, platelet activation, protein digestion, human papillomavirus infection, extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction, and riboflavin metabolism played important roles in pancreatic cancer. GO analysis revealed the significant enrichment in the three terms of biological process, cellular component, and molecular function, which were identified as the most important processes associated strongly with pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, DTL, CDH11, COL5A1, ITGA2, KIF14, SMC4, VCAN, hsa-mir-210, hsa-mir-217, hsa-mir-216a, hsa-mir-216b, hsa-mir-375 and hsa-mir-634 can be reported as the novel diagnostic or even therapeutic markers for the future studies. Also, the hsa-mir-107 and hsa-mir-125a-5p with COL5A1, CDH11 and TGFBR1 genes can be introduced as major miRNA and genes on the miRNA-drug-mRNA network.

This meta-analysis was performed to determine whether there may exist some association between maternal folate status and GDM. Unrestricted searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Embase were conducted. All relevant studies on the association between maternal folat status and GDM risk were screened. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% CIs was used to determine the association between maternal folate and GDM. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models to assess the impact of maternal folate status on GDM risk. 12 studies were included. The overall data revealed that compared with the non-GDM group, women with GDM had higher level of folate (SMD 0.41, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.21,I2 = 17.2%) in second or third trimester. We also found that maternal high folate status may be associated with increased risk of GDM (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.74,I2 = 0.0%). Compared with non-GDM group, women with GDM are prone to higher folate level. Moreover, high maternal folate status may predict a higher risk of GDM.

Gene-level and pathway-level cis rare-eQTL mapping was performed genome-wide using gene expression data derived from blood donated by 713 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants and from brain tissues donated by 475 Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project participants. The association of gene or pathway expression with a set of all cis potentially regulatory low-frequency and rare variants within 1 Mb of genes was evaluated using SKAT-O. A total of 65 genes expressed in the brain were significant targets for rare expression single nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs) among which 17% (11/65) included established AD genesHLA-DRB1andHLA-DRB5. In the blood, 307 genes were significant targets for rare eSNPs. In the blood and the brain,GNMT,LDHC,RBPMS2,DUS2, andHPwere targets for significant eSNPs. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant pathways in the brain (n= 9) and blood (n= 16). Pathways for apoptosis signaling, cholecystokinin receptor (CCKR) signaling, and inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling were common to both tissues. Significant rare eQTLs in inflammation pathways included five genes in the blood (ALOX5AP,CXCR2,FPR2,GRB2,IFNAR1) that were previously linked to AD.

"33836808","Associations among phthalate exposure, DNA methylation of TSLP, and childhood allergy.","Clin Epigenetics","Dysregulation of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) expressions is linked to asthma and allergic disease. Exposure to phthalate esters, a widely used plasticizer, is associated with respiratory and allergic morbidity. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) causes TSLP upregulation in the skin. In addition, phthalate exposure is associated with changes in environmentally induced DNA methylation, which might cause phenotypic heterogeneity. This study examined the DNA methylation of the TSLP gene to determine the potential mechanism between phthalate exposure and allergic diseases.Among all evaluated, only benzyl butyl phthalate (BBzP) in the settled dusts were negatively correlated with the methylation levels of TSLP and positively associated with children's respiratory symptoms. The results revealed that every unit increase in BBzP concentration in the settled dust was associated with a 1.75% decrease in the methylation level on upstream 775 bp from the transcription start site (TSS) of TSLP (β =  - 1.75, p = 0.015) after adjustment for child's sex, age, BMI, parents' smoking status, allergic history, and education levels, PM2.5, formaldehyde, temperature; and relative humidity. Moreover, every percentage increase in the methylation level was associated with a 20% decrease in the risk of morning respiratory symptoms in the children (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65-0.99).Exposure to BBzP in settled dust might increase children's respiratory symptoms in the morning through decreasing TSLP methylation. Therefore, the exposure to BBzP should be reduced especially for the children already having allergic diseases."

However, the functions of major lncRNAs in cervical cancer are unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to construct a lncRNA-mRNA coexpression functional network and analyze lncRNAs that might contribute to the pathogenesis of cervical cancer.Differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and mRNAs (DEmRNAs) between three pairs of cervical cancer tissues and adjacent mucosa were identified by lncRNA microarray analysis. LncRNA-mRNA correlation analysis and functional enrichment were performed on the DEGs. From the correlation network, PCBP1-AS1 was selected as a candidate for further analysis. PCBP1-AS1 expression was examined by qPCR, and Kaplan-Meier survival, clinicopathology, GSEA, and immune infiltration analysis of PCBP1-AS1 were performed. The immune responses of PCBP1-AS1 expression in cervical cancer were analyzed using TIMER and western blot. PCBP1-AS1 was knocked down and overexpressed to evaluate its role in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.A total of 130 lncRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in cervical cancer patient samples compared with control samples. Differentially expressed mRNAs in the lncRNA-mRNA interaction network were involved in the EMT process. Combined with the Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, the coexpression network revealed that PCBP1-AS1 was significantly associated with OS and clinicopathological parameters in cervical cancer patients. Moreover, PCBP1-AS1 expression was not only significantly increased in cervical cancer specimens but also associated with tumor stage, TNM, and invasion. GSEA revealed that PCBP1-AS1 is closely correlated with cell biological functionviathe p53 and notch signaling pathways. TIMER analysis revealed that the numbers of NK cells and M2 macrophages decreased when PCBP1-AS1 expression was high, which was consistent with the western blot results in clinical samples. Furthermore,in vitroexperiments showed that high expression of PCBP1-AS1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.Transcriptomic and lncRNA-mRNA correlation analyses revealed that PCBP1-AS1 plays a key role as an independent prognostic factor in patients with cervical cancer. The identification of PCBP1-AS1 as a new biomarker for cervical cancer could help explain how changes in the immune environment promote cervical cancer development.Copyright © 2021 Li, Peng, Gong, Ling, Xu and Liu."

With old age, bone homeostasis, which is maintained by an intricate balance between bone formation and bone resorption, undergoes deregulation. Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage, cellular apoptosis, and cellular senescence are all responsible for this tissue dysfunction and the imbalance in the bone homeostasis. These cellular mechanisms have become a target for therapeutics to treat age-related osteoporosis. Genetic mouse models have shown the importance of senescent cell clearance in alleviating age-related osteoporosis. Furthermore, we and others have shown that targeting cellular senescence pharmacologically was an effective tool to alleviate age- and radiation-induced osteoporosis. Senescent cells also have an altered secretome known as the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which may have autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine function. The current review discusses the current and potential pathways which lead to a senescence profile in an aged skeleton and how bone homeostasis is affected during age-related osteoporosis. The review has also discussed existing therapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis and rationalizes for novel therapeutic options based on cellular senescence and the SASP as an underlying pathogenesis of an aging bone."

"33821458","Associations between lifetime stress exposure and the error-related negativity (ERN) differ based on stressor characteristics and exposure timing in young adults.","Cogn Affect Behav Neurosci","Life stress increases risk for multiple forms of psychopathology, in part by altering neural processes involved in performance monitoring. However, the ways in which these stress-cognition effects are influenced by the specific timing and types of life stressors experienced remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we examined how different social-psychological characteristics and developmental timing of stressors are related to the error-related negativity (ERN), a negative-going deflection in the event-related potential (ERP) waveform that is observed from 0 to 100 ms following error commission. A sample of 203 emerging adults performed an ERN-eliciting arrow flanker task and completed an interview-based measure of lifetime stress exposure. Adjusting for stress severity during other developmental periods, there was a small-to-medium effect of stress on performance monitoring, such that more severe total stress exposure, as well as more severe social-evaluative stress in particular, experienced during early adolescence significantly predicted an enhanced ERN. These results suggest that early adolescence may be a sensitive developmental period during which stress exposure may result in lasting adaptations to neural networks implicated in performance monitoring."

Because these are learning experiences, their neural substrate likely involves memory, here affect-enhanced episodic memory. Inaugural object relations are encoded by the hippocampus-amygdala synaptic plasticity, and systems-consolidated by medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Self- and object-mental representations, extracted from these early experiences, are at first dichotomized by contradictory affects evoked by frustrating and rewarding interactions (""partial object relations""). Such affective dichotomization appears to be genetically hardwired the amygdala. Intrinsic propensity of mPFC to form schematic frameworks for episodic memories may pilot non-conscious integration of dichotomized mental representations in neonates and infants. With the emergence of working memory in toddlers, an activated self- and object-representation of a particular valence can be juxtaposed with its memorized opposites creating a balanced cognitive-affective frame (conscious ""integration of object relations""). Specific events of object relations are forgotten but nevertheless profoundly influence the mental future of the individual, acting (i) as implicit schema-affect templates that regulate attentional priorities, relevance, and preferential assimilation of new information based on past experience, and (ii) as basic units of experience that are, under normal circumstances, integrated as attractors or ""focal points"" for interactive self-organization of functional brain networks that underlie the mind. A failure to achieve integrated object relations is predictive of poor adult emotional and social outcomes, including personality disorder. Cognitive, cellular-, and systems-neuroscience of episodic memory appear to support key postulates of object relations theory and help elucidate neural mechanisms of psychodynamic psychotherapy. Derived through the dual prism of psychoanalysis and neuroscience, the gained insights may offer new directions to enhance mental health and improve treatment of multiple forms of psychopathology.Copyright © 2021 Svrakic and Zorumski."
"33805856","The 'Jekyll and Hyde' of Gluconeogenesis: Early Life Adversity, Later Life Stress, and Metabolic Disturbances.","Int J Mol Sci","The physiological response to a psychological stressor broadly impacts energy metabolism. Inversely, changes in energy availability affect the physiological response to the stressor in terms of hypothalamus, pituitary adrenal axis (HPA), and sympathetic nervous system activation. Glucocorticoids, the endpoint of the HPA axis, are critical checkpoints in endocrine control of energy homeostasis and have been linked to metabolic diseases including obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Glucocorticoids, through the glucocorticoid receptor, activate transcription of genes associated with glucose and lipid regulatory pathways and thereby control both physiological and pathophysiological systemic energy homeostasis. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of glucocorticoid functions in energy metabolism and systemic metabolic dysfunction, particularly focusing on glucose and lipid metabolism. There are elements in the external environment that induce lifelong changes in the HPA axis stress response and glucocorticoid levels, and the most prominent are early life adversity, or exposure to traumatic stress. We hypothesise that when the HPA axis is so disturbed after early life adversity, it will fundamentally alter hepatic gluconeogenesis, inducing hyperglycaemia, and hence crystalise the significant lifelong risk of developing either the metabolic syndrome, or type 2 diabetes. This gives a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" role to gluconeogenesis, providing the necessary energy in situations of acute stress, but driving towards pathophysiological consequences when the HPA axis has been altered."

Epigenetic modifications, i.e., DNA methylation, post-translational histone modification and interference of microRNA (miRNA) or long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), are able to influence the severity of the disease and the outcome of the therapy. This article summarizes the most recent literature data on this topic, i.e., usage of histone deacetylases as therapeutic agents with an antidepressant effect and miRNAs or lncRNAs as markers of depression. Due to the noteworthy potential of the role of epigenetics in MDD diagnostics and therapy, we have gathered the most relevant data in this area."

The experimental methods used for predicting ncRNA-protein interactions are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for computational methods to accurately and efficiently predict ncRNA-protein interactions.In this work, we presented an ensemble deep learning-based method, EDLMFC, to predict ncRNA-protein interactions using the combination of multi-scale features, including primary sequence features, secondary structure sequence features, and tertiary structure features. Conjoint k-mer was used to extract protein/ncRNA sequence features, integrating tertiary structure features, then fed into an ensemble deep learning model, which combined convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn dominating biological information with bi-directional long short-term memory network (BLSTM) to capture long-range dependencies among the features identified by the CNN. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods under five-fold cross-validation, EDLMFC shows the best performance with accuracy of 93.8%, 89.7%, and 86.1% on RPI1807, NPInter v2.0, and RPI488 datasets, respectively. The results of the independent test demonstrated that EDLMFC can effectively predict potential ncRNA-protein interactions from different organisms. Furtherly, EDLMFC is also shown to predict hub ncRNAs and proteins presented in ncRNA-protein networks of Mus musculus successfully.In general, our proposed method EDLMFC improved the accuracy of ncRNA-protein interaction predictions and anticipated providing some helpful guidance on ncRNA functions research.

"33763479","Function and Mechanism of Novel Histone Posttranslational Modifications in Health and Disease.","Biomed Res Int","Histone posttranslational modifications (HPTMs) are crucial epigenetic mechanisms regulating various biological events. Different types of HPTMs characterize and shape functional chromatin states alone or in combination, and dedicated effector proteins selectively recognize these modifications for gene expression. The dysregulation of HPTM recognition events takes part in human diseases. With the application of mass spectrometry- (MS-) based proteomics, novel histone lysine acylation has been successively discovered, e.g., propionylation, butyrylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation,β-hydroxybutyrylation, malonylation, succinylation, crotonylation, glutarylation, and lactylation. These nine types of modifications expand the repertoire of HPTMs and regulate chromatin remodeling, gene expression, cell cycle, and cellular metabolism. Recent researches show that HPTMs have a close connection with the pathogenesis of cancer, metabolic diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, infertility, kidney diseases, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This review focuses on the chemical structure, sites, functions of these novel HPTMs, and underlying mechanism in gene expression, providing a glimpse into their complex regulation in health and disease.Copyright © 2021 Huiwen Xu et al."

To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we analyzed 636 RNA-seq samples across 15 tissues. This analysis suggests that changes in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis play a key role regarding the extended life expectancy of reproductive vs. non-reproductive mole-rats. This is substantiated by a corpus of independent evidence. In accordance with previous studies, the up-regulation of the proteasome and so-called 'anti-aging molecules', for example, dehydroepiandrosterone, is linked with enhanced lifespan. On the other hand, several of our results are not consistent with knowledge about aging of short-lived model organisms. For example, we found the up-regulation of the insulin-like growth factor 1/growth hormone axis and several other anabolic processes to be compatible with a considerable lifespan prolongation. These contradictions question the extent to which findings from short-lived species can be transferred to longer-lived ones.© 2021, Sahm et al."
"33836591","DNMT1 maintains metabolic fitness of adipocytes through acting as an epigenetic safeguard of mitochondrial dynamics.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","White adipose tissue (WAT) is a key regulator of systemic energy metabolism, and impaired WAT plasticity characterized by enlargement of preexisting adipocytes associates with WAT dysfunction, obesity, and metabolic complications. However, the mechanisms that retain proper adipose tissue plasticity required for metabolic fitness are unclear. Here, we comprehensively showed that adipocyte-specific DNA methylation, manifested in enhancers and CTCF sites, directs distal enhancer-mediated transcriptomic features required to conserve metabolic functions of white adipocytes. Particularly, genetic ablation of adipocyte Dnmt1, the major methylation writer, led to increased adiposity characterized by increased adipocyte hypertrophy along with reduced expansion of adipocyte precursors (APs). These effects of Dnmt1 deficiency provoked systemic hyperlipidemia and impaired energy metabolism both in lean and obese mice. Mechanistically, Dnmt1 deficiency abrogated mitochondrial bioenergetics by inhibiting mitochondrial fission and promoted aberrant lipid metabolism in adipocytes, rendering adipocyte hypertrophy and WAT dysfunction. Dnmt1-dependent DNA methylation prevented aberrant CTCF binding and, in turn, sustained the proper chromosome architecture to permit interactions between enhancer and dynamin-1-like protein geneDnm1l(Drp1) in adipocytes. Also, adipose DNMT1 expression inversely correlated with adiposity and markers of metabolic health but positively correlated with AP-specific markers in obese human subjects. Thus, these findings support strategies utilizing Dnmt1 action on mitochondrial bioenergetics in adipocytes to combat obesity and related metabolic pathology."

PCOS is a multifactorial, complex, and heterogeneous disease, characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries, which may lead to impaired fertility. Besides the reproductive outcomes, multiple comorbidities, such as metabolic disturbances, insulin resistance, obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, are associated with PCOS. In addition to the clear genetic basis, epigenetic alterations may also play a central role in PCOS outcomes, as environmental and hormonal alterations directly affect clinical manifestations and PCOS development. Here, we highlighted the epigenetic modifications in the multiplicity of clinical manifestations, as well as environmental epigenetic disruptors, as intrauterine hormonal and metabolic alterations affecting embryo development and the adulthood lifestyle, which may contribute to PCOS development. Additionally, we also discussed the new approaches for future studies and potential epigenetic biomarkers for the treatment of associated comorbidities and improvement in quality of life of women with PCOS."
"33815671","Insulin resistance in diabetes: The promise of using induced pluripotent stem cell technology.","World J Stem Cells","Insulin resistance (IR) is associated with several metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). The development of IR in insulin target tissues involves genetic and acquired factors. Persons at genetic risk for T2D tend to develop IR several years before glucose intolerance. Several rodent models for both IR and T2D are being used to study the disease pathogenesis; however, these models cannot recapitulate all the aspects of this complex disorder as seen in each individual. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can overcome the hurdles faced with the classical mouse models for studying IR. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be generated from the somatic cells of the patients without the need to destroy a human embryo. Therefore, patient-specific hiPSCs can generate cells genetically identical to IR individuals, which can help in distinguishing between genetic and acquired defects in insulin sensitivity. Combining the technologies of genome editing and hiPSCs may provide important information about the genetic factors underlying the development of different forms of IR. Further studies are required to fill the gaps in understanding the pathogenesis of IR and diabetes. In this review, we summarize the factors involved in the development of IR in the insulin-target tissues leading to diabetes. Also, we highlight the use of hPSCs to understand the mechanisms underlying the development of IR.©The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved."

Here, we demonstrate an involvement of gut microbiome in the inhibitory effect of Korean red ginseng on high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced mouse obesity, and further provides information on the effects of saponin-containing red ginseng extract (SGE) and saponin-depleted red ginseng extract (GE). Mice were fed with either SGE or GE every third day for one month, and their food intakes, fat weights, plasma glucose, and insulin and leptin levels were measured. Immunofluorescence assays were conducted to measure pancreatic islet size. Stools from the mice were subjected to metagenomic analysis. Both SGE and GE attenuated HFD-induced gain of body weight, reducing HFD-induced increase of food intakes and fat weights. They also reduced HFD-increased plasma glucose, insulin, and leptin levels, decreased both fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations, and improved both insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Immunofluorescence assays revealed that they blocked HFD-induced increase of pancreatic islet size. Our pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region from stools revealed that both SGE and GE modulated HFD-altered composition of gut microbiota. Therefore, we conclude that Korean red ginseng inhibits HFD-induced obesity and diabetes by altering gut microbiome."

Cardiovascular progenitors acquire a gene expression profile representative of an early-stage, dedifferentiated, stem-like state, regardless of age.

Furthermore, rotors can be used to prepare space experiments, e.g., conducting hypergravity experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of a study before its implementation and to complement inflight experiments by comparing the effects of micro- and hypergravity. In this paper, we present a new platform called the Gravitational Experimental Platform for Animal Models (GEPAM), which has been part of European Space Agency (ESA)'s portfolio of ground-based facilities since 2020, to study the effects of altered gravity on aquatic animal models (amphibian embryos/tadpoles) and mice. This platform comprises rotors for hypergravity exposure (three aquatic rotors and one rodent rotor) and models to simulate microgravity (cages for mouse hindlimb unloading and a random positioning machine (RPM)). Four species of amphibians can be used at present. All murine strains can be used and are maintained in a specific pathogen-free area. This platform is surrounded by numerous facilities for sample preparation and analysis using state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we illustrate how GEPAM can contribute to the understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms and the identification of countermeasures."

Leaving the protection that Low Earth Orbit provides will unavoidably expose astronauts to higher cumulative doses of space radiation, in addition to other stressors, e.g., microgravity. Immune regulation is known to be impacted by both radiation and spaceflight and it remains to be seen whether prolonged effects that will be encountered in deep space can have an adverse impact on health. In this study, we investigated the effects in the overall metabolism of three different low dose radiation exposures (γ-rays,16O, and56Fe) in spleens from male C57BL/6 mice at 1, 2, and 4 months after exposure. Forty metabolites were identified with significant enrichment in purine metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acids, acylcarnitines, and amino acids. Early perturbations were more prominent in the γ irradiated samples, while later responses shifted towards more prominent responses in groups with high energy particle irradiations. Regression analysis showed a positive correlation of the abundance of identified fatty acids with time and a negative association with γ-rays, while the degradation pathway of purines was positively associated with time. Taken together, there is a strong suggestion of mitochondrial implication and the possibility of long-term effects on DNA repair and nucleotide pools following radiation exposure."

Telomeres represent a compelling biomarker of individual radiosensitivity and risk, as exposure can result in dysfunctional telomere pathologies that coincidentally overlap with many radiation-induced late effects, ranging from degenerative conditions like fibrosis and cardiovascular disease to proliferative pathologies like cancer. Here, telomere length was longitudinally assessed in a cohort of fifteen prostate cancer patients undergoing Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) utilizing Telomere Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (Telo-FISH). To evaluate genome instability and enhance predictions for individual patient risk of secondary malignancy, chromosome aberrations were assessed utilizing directional Genomic Hybridization (dGH) for high-resolution inversion detection. We present the first implementation of individual telomere length data in a machine learning model, XGBoost, trained on pre-radiotherapy (baseline) and in vitro exposed (4 Gy γ-rays) telomere length measurements, to predict post radiotherapy telomeric outcomes, which together with chromosomal instability provide insight into individual radiosensitivity and risk for radiation-induced late effects."
"33795001","A comprehensive metagenomics framework to characterize organisms relevant for planetary protection.","Microbiome","Clean rooms of the Space Assembly Facility (SAF) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) at NASA are the final step of spacecraft cleaning and assembly before launching into space. Clean rooms have stringent methods of air-filtration and cleaning to minimize microbial contamination for exoplanetary research and minimize the risk of human pathogens, but they are not sterile. Clean rooms make a selective environment for microorganisms that tolerate such cleaning methods. Previous studies have attempted to characterize the microbial cargo through sequencing and culture-dependent protocols. However, there is not a standardized metagenomic workflow nor analysis pipeline for spaceflight hardware cleanroom samples to identify microbial contamination. Additionally, current identification methods fail to characterize and profile the risk of low-abundance microorganisms.A comprehensive metagenomic framework to characterize microorganisms relevant for planetary protection in multiple cleanroom classifications (from ISO-5 to ISO-8.5) and sample types (surface, filters, and debris collected via vacuum devices) was developed. Fifty-one metagenomic samples from SAF clean rooms were sequenced and analyzed to identify microbes that could potentially survive spaceflight based on their microbial features and whether the microbes expressed any metabolic activity or growth. Additionally, an auxiliary testing was performed to determine the repeatability of our techniques and validate our analyses. We find evidence that JPL clean rooms carry microbes with attributes that may be problematic in space missions for their documented ability to withstand extreme conditions, such as psychrophilia and ability to form biofilms, spore-forming capacity, radiation resistance, and desiccation resistance. Samples from ISO-5 standard had lower microbial diversity than those conforming to ISO-6 or higher filters but still carried a measurable microbial load.Although the extensive cleaning processes limit the number of microbes capable of withstanding clean room condition, it is important to quantify thresholds and detect organisms that can inform ongoing Planetary Protection goals, provide a biological baseline for assembly facilities, and guide future mission planning.

The area under the curve (AUC) of growth curves was calculated to characterize long-term burden (total AUC) and trends (incremental AUC) of BMI.After adjusting for covariates, higher values of BMI in terms of childhood and adulthood, as well as total and incremental AUC, were strongly associated with elevated levels of adult C-reactive protein (CRP) in the four race-sex groups. There were significant differences in linear and nonlinear curve parameters between the normal and high CRP groups for all race-sex groups (P< 0.01). Compared with participants who had consistently low BMI in both childhood and adulthood, participants with high BMI in adulthood had higher CRP levels (P< 0.001), irrespective of their childhood BMI status; participants with high BMI in childhood but low BMI in adulthood had similar adult CRP levels.The impact of excessive body weight on inflammation is cumulative and exacerbated over time.

Inhibins contain an α-subunit (INHA) and a β-subunit (either INHBA or INHBB), while activins are mainly homodimers of either βA (INHBA) or βB (INHBB) subunits. Inhibins are biomarkers in a subset of cancers and utilize the coreceptors betaglycan (TGFBR3) and endoglin (ENG) for physiological or pathological outcomes. Given the array of prior reports on inhibin, activin and the coreceptors in cancer, this study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis, assessing their functional prognostic potential in cancer using a bioinformatics approach. We identify cancer cell lines and cancer types most dependent and impacted, which included p53 mutated breast and ovarian cancers and lung adenocarcinomas. Moreover, INHA itself was dependent on TGFBR3 and ENG/CD105 in multiple cancer types. INHA, INHBA, TGFBR3, and ENG also predicted patients' response to anthracycline and taxane therapy in luminal A breast cancers. We also obtained a gene signature model that could accurately classify 96.7% of the cases based on outcomes. Lastly, we cross-compared gene correlations revealing INHA dependency to TGFBR3 or ENG influencing different pathways themselves. These results suggest that inhibins are particularly important in a subset of cancers depending on the coreceptor TGFBR3 and ENG and are of substantial prognostic value, thereby warranting further investigation."

Several studies show that these therapies might favor oncogenic signaling and impede anti-tumor responses. MiR-200c is considered a master regulator of EOC-related oncogenes. In this study, we sought to investigate if chemotherapy and IR could influence the expression of miR-200c-3p and its target genes, like the immune checkpoint PD-L1 and other oncogenes in a cohort of EOC patients' biopsies. Indeed, PD-L1 expression was induced, while miR-200c-3p was significantly reduced in these biopsies post-therapy. The effect of miR-200c-3p target genes was assessed in miR-200c transfected SKOV3 cells untreated and treated with olaparib and IR alone. Under all experimental conditions, miR-200c-3p concomitantly reduced PD-L1, c-Myc and β-catenin expression and sensitized ovarian cancer cells to olaparib and irradiation. In silico analyses further confirmed the anti-correlation between miR-200c-3p with c-Myc and β-catenin in 46 OC cell lines and showed that a higher miR-200c-3p expression associates with a less tumorigenic microenvironment. These findings provide new insights into how miR-200c-3p could be used to hold in check the adverse effects of conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapy and radiation therapy, and offer a novel therapeutic strategy for EOC."

As mitotic chromatin compaction defects can compromise the accuracy of chromosome segregation into daughter cells and drive CIN, characterizing the molecular mechanisms ensuring accurate chromatin compaction may identify novel CIN genes. In vitro, histone H2B monoubiquitination at lysine 120 (H2Bub1) impairs chromatin compaction, while in vivo H2Bub1 is rapidly depleted from chromatin upon entry into mitosis, suggesting that H2Bub1 removal may be a pre-requisite for mitotic fidelity. The deubiquitinating enzyme USP22 catalyzes H2Bub1 removal in interphase and may also be required for H2Bub1 removal in early mitosis to maintain chromosome stability. In this study, we demonstrate that siRNA-mediated USP22 depletion increases H2Bub1 levels in early mitosis and induces CIN phenotypes associated with mitotic chromatin compaction defects revealed by super-resolution microscopy. Moreover,USP22-knockout models exhibit continuously changing chromosome complements over time. These data identify mitotic removal of H2Bub1 as a critical determinant of chromatin compaction and faithful chromosome segregation. We further demonstrate thatUSP22is a CIN gene, indicating thatUSP22deletions, which are frequent in many tumor types, may drive genetic heterogeneity and contribute to cancer pathogenesis."

The BCMC panel identifies 13 cellular phenotypes (11 human and 2 murine), associated with both breast cancer subtypes and specific genomic features. Pre-treatment cellular phenotypic composition is a determinant of response to anticancer therapies. Single-cell profiling also reveals drug-induced cellular phenotypic dynamics, unravelling previously unnoticed intra-tumour response diversity. The comprehensive view of the landscapes of cellular phenotypic heterogeneity in PDTXs uncovered by the BCMC panel, which is mirrored in primary human tumours, has profound implications for understanding and predicting therapy response and resistance."
"33786615","Differential <i>MUC22</i> expression by epigenetic alterations in human lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.","Oncol Rep","Disruption in mucins (MUCs) is involved in cancer development and metastasis and is thus used as a biomarker. Non‑small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is characterized by heterogeneous genetic and epigenetic alterations. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are the two primary subtypes of NSCLC that require different therapeutic interventions. Here, we report distinct expression and epigenetic alterations in mucin 22 (MUC22), a new MUC family member, in LUSC vs. LUAD. In lung cancer cell lines and tissues,MUC22was downregulated in LUSC (MUC22Low) but upregulated in LUAD (MUC22High) with co‑expression ofMUC21. The aberrant expression ofMUC22was inversely correlated with its promoter hypermethylation in LUSC and hypomethylation in LUAD cells and tissues, respectively. DecreasedMUC22expression in NSCLC cell lines was restored upon treatment with epigenetic modifiers 5‑aza‑2'‑deoxycytidine (5‑Aza) or trichostatin A (TSA), accompanied by reduction in global protein level of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) but increased enrichment of histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) specifically in theMUC22promoter in the SK‑MES‑1 cell line.MUC22knockdown increased the growth and motility of lung cancer cells and an immortalized human bronchial epithelial BEAS‑2B cell line via NF‑κB activation. Clinically,MUC22Lowin LUSC andMUC22Highin LUAD were shown to be indicators of unfavorable overall survival for patients with early cancer stages. Our study reveals that changes inMUC22expression due to epigenetic alterations in NSCLC may have important biological significance and prognostic potential in LUSC when compared to LUAD. Thus,MUC22expression and epigenetic alterations may be used for molecular subtyping of NSCLC in precision medicine."
"33771865","Cell-penetrating Alphabody protein scaffolds for intracellular drug targeting.","Sci Adv","The therapeutic scope of antibody and nonantibody protein scaffolds is still prohibitively limited against intracellular drug targets. Here, we demonstrate that the Alphabody scaffold can be engineered into a cell-penetrating protein antagonist against induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein MCL-1, an intracellular target in cancer, by grafting the critical B-cell lymphoma 2 homology 3 helix of MCL-1 onto the Alphabody and tagging the scaffold's termini with designed cell-penetration polypeptides. Introduction of an albumin-binding moiety extended the serum half-life of the engineered Alphabody to therapeutically relevant levels, and administration thereof in mouse tumor xenografts based on myeloma cell lines reduced tumor burden. Crystal structures of such a designed Alphabody in complex with MCL-1 and serum albumin provided the structural blueprint of the applied design principles. Collectively, we provide proof of concept for the use of Alphabodies against intracellular disease mediators, which, to date, have remained in the realm of small-molecule therapeutics.Copyright © 2021 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Here our analyses identify ALYREF, expressed from the most common genetic copy number variation in neuroblastoma, chromosome 17q21-ter gain as a key regulator of MYCN protein turnover. We show strong co-operativity between ALYREF and MYCN from transgenic models of neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo. The two proteins form a nuclear coactivator complex which stimulates transcription of the ubiquitin specific peptidase 3, USP3. We show that increased USP3 levels reduce K-48- and K-63-linked ubiquitination of MYCN, thus driving up MYCN protein stability. In the MYCN-ALYREF-USP3 signal, ALYREF is required for MYCN effects on the malignant phenotype and that of USP3 on MYCN stability. This data defines a MYCN oncoprotein dependency state which provides a rationale for future pharmacological studies."

Therefore, more reliable biomarkers are urgently needed to identify the high-risk subset in stage I patients to guide adjuvant therapy.Methods:This study retrospectively analysed the transcriptome profiles and clinical parameters of 1,400 stage I LUAD patients from 14 public datasets, including 13 microarray datasets from different platforms and 1 RNA-Seq dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A series of bioinformatic and machine learning approaches were combined to establish hypoxia-derived signatures to predict overall survival (OS) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy response in stage I patients. In addition, enriched pathways, genomic and copy number alterations were analysed in different risk subgroups and compared to each other.Results:Among various hallmarks of cancer, hypoxia was identified as a dominant risk factor for overall survival in stage I LUAD patients. The hypoxia-related prognostic risk score (HPRS) exhibited more powerful capacity of survival prediction compared to traditional clinicopathological features, and the hypoxia-related immunotherapeutic response score (HIRS) outperformed conventional biomarkers for ICB therapy. An integrated decision tree and nomogram were generated to optimize risk stratification and quantify risk assessment.Conclusions:In summary, the proposed hypoxia-derived signatures are promising biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes and therapeutic responses in stage I LUAD patients.© The author(s)."
"33753930","A first-generation pediatric cancer dependency map.","Nat Genet","Exciting therapeutic targets are emerging from CRISPR-based screens of high mutational-burden adult cancers. A key question, however, is whether functional genomic approaches will yield new targets in pediatric cancers, known for remarkably few mutations, which often encode proteins considered challenging drug targets. To address this, we created a first-generation pediatric cancer dependency map representing 13 pediatric solid and brain tumor types. Eighty-two pediatric cancer cell lines were subjected to genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screening to identify genes required for cell survival. In contrast to the finding that pediatric cancers harbor fewer somatic mutations, we found a similar complexity of genetic dependencies in pediatric cancer cell lines compared to that in adult models. Findings from the pediatric cancer dependency map provide preclinical support for ongoing precision medicine clinical trials. The vulnerabilities observed in pediatric cancers were often distinct from those in adult cancer, indicating that repurposing adult oncology drugs will be insufficient to address childhood cancers."
"33750914","Cell-autonomous immune gene expression is repressed in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and small cell lung cancer.","Commun Biol","Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is classified as a high-grade neuroendocrine (NE) tumor, but a subset of SCLC has been termed ""variant"" due to the loss of NE characteristics. In this study, we computed NE scores for patient-derived SCLC cell lines and xenografts, as well as human tumors. We aligned NE properties with transcription factor-defined molecular subtypes. Then we investigated the different immune phenotypes associated with high and low NE scores. We found repression of immune response genes as a shared feature between classic SCLC and pulmonary neuroendocrine cells of the healthy lung. With loss of NE fate, variant SCLC tumors regain cell-autonomous immune gene expression and exhibit higher tumor-immune interactions. Pan-cancer analysis revealed this NE lineage-specific immune phenotype in other cancers. Additionally, we observed MHC I re-expression in SCLC upon development of chemoresistance. These findings may help guide the design of treatment regimens in SCLC."
"33734579","MX2 mediates establishment of interferon response profile, regulates XAF1, and can sensitize melanoma cells to targeted therapy.","Cancer Med","MX2 is an interferon inducible gene that is mostly known for its antiviral activity. We have previously demonstrated that MX2 is also associated with the tumorigenesis process in melanoma. However, it remains unknown which molecular mechanisms are regulated by MX2 in response to interferon signaling in this disease. Here, we report that MX2 is necessary for the establishment of an interferon-induced transcriptional profile partially through regulation of STAT1 phosphorylation and other interferon-related downstream factors, including proapoptotic tumor suppressor XAF1. MX2 and XAF1 expression tightly correlate in both cultured melanoma cell lines and in patient-derived primary and metastatic tumors, where they also are significantly related with survival. MX2 mediates IFN growth-inhibitory signals in both XAF1 dependent and independent ways and in a cell type and context-dependent manner. Higher MX2 expression renders melanoma cells more sensitive to targeted therapy drugs such as vemurafenib and trametinib; however, this effect is XAF1 independent. In summary, we uncovered a new mechanism in the complex regulation of interferon signaling in melanoma that can influence both survival and response to therapy.© 2021 The Authors.

A deeper understanding of the molecular events associated with recurrent disease is needed to identify potential targets. Using genome-scale DNA methylation and gene expression data for 16 matched primary-recurrent advanced stage serous epithelial OCs, we discovered that Claudin-1 (CLDN1), a tight junction protein, shows a stronger correlation between expression and methylation in recurrent versus primary OC at multiple CpG sites (R= -0.47 to -0.64 versus R= -0.32 to -0.57, respectively). An independent dataset showed that this correlation is stronger in tumors from short-term (<3y) survivors than in tumors from long-term (>7y) survivors (R= -0.41 to -0.46 versus R= 0.06 to -0.19, respectively). The presence of this inverse correlation in short-term survivors and recurrent tumors suggests an important role for this relationship and potential predictive value for disease prognosis.CLDN1expression increased following pharmacologic inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity (p< 0.001), thus validating the role of methylation inCLDN1gene inhibition.CLDN1knockdown enhanced chemosensitivity and suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and wound healing (p< 0.05). StableCLDN1knockdownin vivoresulted in reduced xenograft tumor growth but did not reach significance. Our results indicate that the relationship betweenCLDN1methylation and expression plays an important role in OC aggressiveness and recurrence.Copyright © 2021 Visco, Sfakianos, Grenier, Boudreau, Simpson, Rodriguez, Whitaker, Yao, Berchuck, Murphy and Huang."
"33802405","Knock-Down of HDAC2 in Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Derived Neurons Improves Neuronal Mitochondrial Dynamics, Neuronal Maturation and Reduces Amyloid Beta Peptides.","Int J Mol Sci","Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is a major HDAC protein in the adult brain and has been shown to regulate many neuronal genes. The aberrant expression of HDAC2 and subsequent dysregulation of neuronal gene expression is implicated in neurodegeneration and brain aging. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (hiPSC-Ns) are widely used models for studying neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, but the role of HDAC2 in hiPSC-N differentiation and maturation has not been explored. In this study, we show that levels of HDAC2 progressively decrease as hiPSCs are differentiated towards neurons. This suppression of HDAC2 inversely corresponds to an increase in neuron-specific isoforms of Endophilin-B1, a multifunctional protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics. Expression of neuron-specific isoforms of Endophilin-B1 is accompanied by concomitant expression of a neuron-specific alternative splicing factor,SRRM4. Manipulation of HDAC2 and Endophilin-B1 using lentiviral approaches shows that the knock-down of HDAC2 or the overexpression of a neuron-specific Endophilin-B1 isoform promotes mitochondrial elongation and protects against cytotoxic stress in hiPSC-Ns, while HDAC2 knock-down specifically influences genes regulating mitochondrial dynamics and synaptogenesis. Furthermore, HDAC2 knock-down promotes enhanced mitochondrial respiration and reduces levels of neurotoxic amyloid beta peptides. Collectively, our study demonstrates a role for HDAC2 in hiPSC-neuronal differentiation, highlights neuron-specific isoforms of Endophilin-B1 as a marker of differentiating hiPSC-Ns and demonstrates that HDAC2 regulates key neuronal and mitochondrial pathways in hiPSC-Ns."
"33815108","The Influence of Treatment of Inflammatory Arthritis During Pregnancy on the Long-Term Children's Outcome.","Front Pharmacol","The management of reproductive issues in women with inflammatory arthritis has greatly changed over decades. In the 1980-1990s, women with refractory forms of arthritis were either not able to get pregnant or did choose not to get pregnant because of their disabling disease. Hence, the traditional belief that pregnancy can induce a remission of arthritis. The availability of biologic agents has allowed a good control of aggressive forms of arthritis. The main topic of discussion during preconception counselling is the use of drugs during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Physicians are now supported by international recommendations released by the European League Against Rheumatism and the American College of Rheumatology, but still they must face with cultural reluctance in accepting that a pregnant woman can take medications. Patient-physician communication should be centered on the message that active maternal disease during pregnancy is detrimental to fetal health. Keeping maternal disease under control with drugs which are not harmful to the fetus is the best way to ensure the best possible outcome for both the mother and the baby. However, there might be concerns about the influence of thein uteroexposure to medications on the newborn's health conditions. Particularly, studies suggesting an increased risk of autism-spectrum-disorders in children born to women with rheumatoid arthritis has raised questions about neuropsychological impairment in the offspring of women with chronic arthritis. As a multidisciplinary group of rheumatologists and child neuropsychiatrists, we conducted a study on 16 women with chronic forms of arthritis whose diagnosis was determined before pregnancy and their 18 school-age children. The children underwent a complete neurological examination and validated tests/questionnaires. Behavioral aspects of somatization and anxiety/depression (internalizing problem) or an ""adult profile"" were found in nearly one third of children. Children at a high risk of neurodevelopmental problems were born to mothers with a longer history of arthritis and were breastfeed for less than 6 months of age or were not breastfeed at all. No association was found with other maternal characteristics such as autoantibody existence and disease activity during and after the pregnancy.Copyright © 2021 Nalli, Galli, Lini, Merlini, Piantoni, Lazzaroni, Bitsadze, Khizroeva, Zatti, Andreoli, Fazzi, Franceschini, Makatsariya, Shoenfeld and Tincani."

Several recent computational methods have been developed to impute spatial information onto a scRNA-seq dataset through analyzing known spatial expression patterns of a small subset of genes known as a reference atlas. However, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis of the accuracy, precision, and robustness of the mappings, along with the generalizability of these methods, which are often designed for specific systems. We present a system-adaptive deep learning-based method (DEEPsc) to impute spatial information onto a scRNA-seq dataset from a given spatial reference atlas. By introducing a comprehensive set of metrics that evaluate the spatial mapping methods, we compare DEEPsc with four existing methods on four biological systems. We find that while DEEPsc has comparable accuracy to other methods, an improved balance between precision and robustness is achieved. DEEPsc provides a data-adaptive tool to connect scRNA-seq datasets and spatial imaging datasets to analyze cell fate decisions. Our implementation with a uniform API can serve as a portal with access to all the methods investigated in this work for spatial exploration of cell fate decisions in scRNA-seq data.

"33767348","Reciprocal control of obesity and anxiety-depressive disorder via a GABA and serotonin neural circuit.","Mol Psychiatry","The high comorbidity between obesity and mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, often exacerbates metabolic and neurological symptoms significantly. However, neural mechanisms that underlie reciprocal control of feeding and mental states are largely elusive. Here we report that melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) neurons located in the dorsal bed nucleus of the stria terminus (dBNST) engage in the regulation of mentally associated weight gain by receiving GABAergic projections from hypothalamic AgRP neurons onto α5-containing GABAAreceptors and serotonergic afferents onto 5-HT3receptors. Chronic treatment with a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly blunts the hyperexcitability of AgRP neurons in response to not only hunger but also anxiety and depression-like stimuli. Such HFD-mediated desensitization reduces GABAergic outputs from AgRP neurons to downstream MC4RdBNSTneurons, resulting in severe mental dysregulation. Genetic enhancement of the GABAAR-α5 or suppression of the 5-HT3R within the MC4RdBNSTneurons not only abolishes HFD-induced anxiety and depression but also robustly reduces body weight by suppression of food intake. To gain further translational insights, we revealed that combined treatment of zonisamide (enhancing the GABAAR-α5 signaling) and granisetron (a selective 5-HT3R antagonist) alleviates mental dysfunction and yields a robust reversal of diet-induced obesity by reducing total calorie intake and altering food preference towards a healthy low-fat diet. Our results unveil a neural mechanism for reciprocal control of appetite and mental states, which culminates in a novel zonisamide-granisetron cocktail therapy for potential tackling the psychosis-obesity comorbidity."

Our research aims to determine the methylation changes of alcohol-induced ONFH.An analytical cross-sectional study of a Chinese male population (50 alcohol-induced ONFH patients and 50 controls). The EpiTYPER of the Sequenom MassARRAY platform was used to detect the DNA methylation status of 132 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in the OPG/RANKL/RANK gene promoter region.In the whole study group, the chi-square test was used to analyze the methylation rate between the two groups, and six CpG sites were found to be different, among which OPG1_CpG_2, OPG3_CpG_4, RANK1_CpG_6, RANK3_CpG_10, RANKL2_CpG_21, and RANKL2_CpG_46 in the case group were higher than those in the control group, while OPG4_CpG_2 was lower than that in the control group. The results showed that in patients with alcohol-induced ONFH, 146 CpG sites were examined for differences in methylation levels compared with healthy controls, 32 of which were not detected, and 23 of the remaining 114 sites showed differences in methylation levels compared with alcohol-induced ONFH patients. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated the methylation levels of OPG/RANKL/RANK could efficiently predict the existence of alcohol-induced ONFH.Our study of Chinese men suggests that several CpG sites in the OPG/RANKL/RANK gene in peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with alcohol-induced ONFH are in an abnormal methylation state (hypermethylation tended to be more frequent)."

The clinical value of GNPNAT1 in LUAD was investigated based on the data from the TCGA database. Then, immunohistochemistry (IHC) of GNPNAT1 was applied to verify the expression and clinical significance in LUAD from the protein level. The relationship between GNPNAT1 and epigenetics was explored using the cBioPortal database, and the miRNAs regulating GNPNAT1 were found using the miRNA database. The association between GNPNAT1 expression and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in LUAD was observed through the Tumor IMmune Estimation Resource (TIMER). Finally, Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to explore the biological signaling pathways involved in GNPNAT1 in LUAD.GNPNAT1 was upregulated in LUAD compared with normal tissues, which was verified through qRT-PCR in different cell lines (P< 0.05), and associated with patients' clinical stage, tumor size, and lymphatic metastasis status (allP< 0.01). Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis suggested that patients with upregulated GNPNAT1 had a relatively poor prognosis (P< 0.0001). Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that GNPNAT1 was an independent prognostic factor for LUAD (OS, TCGA dataset: HR = 1.028, 95%CI: 1.013-1.044,P< 0.001; OS, validation set: HR = 1.313, 95%CI: 1.130-1.526,P< 0.001). GNPNAT1 overexpression was correlated with DNA copy amplification (P< 0.0001), low DNA methylation (R= -0.52,P< 0.0001), and downregulation of hsa-miR-30d-3p (R= -0.17,P< 0.001).

The blue gene module associated with the histopathologic grade of CCA was screened. Then, five candidate hub genes were screened by combining the co-expression network with protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. After progression and survival analyses, bloom syndrome helicase (BLM) was ultimately identified as a real hub gene. Moreover, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis suggested that BLM had a favorable diagnostic and predictive recurrence value for CCA. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) results for a single hub gene revealed the importance of cell cycle-related pathways in the CCA progression and prognosis. Furthermore, we detected the BLM expressionin vitro, and the results demonstrated that the expression level of BLM was much higher in the CCA tissues and cells relative to adjacent non-tumor samples and normal bile duct epithelial cells. Additionally, after further silencing the BLM expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA), the proliferation and migration ability of CCA cells were all inhibited, and the cell cycle was arrested. Altogether, a real hub gene (BLM) and cell cycle-related pathways were identified in the present study, and the gene BLM may be involved in the CCA progression and could act as a reliable biomarker for potential diagnosis and prognostic evaluation.Copyright © 2021 Du, Zhang, Yin, Wang, Yan, Xie, Zheng, Zheng, Li and Song."

Here, we systematically explore batch effects across various scRNA-seq datasets according to magnitude, cell type specificity, and complexity. We developed a cell-specific mixing score (cms) that quantifies mixing of cells from multiple batches. By considering distance distributions, the score is able to detect local batch bias as well as differentiate between unbalanced batches and systematic differences between cells of the same cell type. We compare metrics in scRNA-seq data using real and synthetic datasets and whereas these metrics target the same question and are used interchangeably, we find differences in scalability, sensitivity, and ability to handle differentially abundant cell types.

The expression profile of the following genes by quantitative Real-Time PCR was evaluated: Genes involved in the DNA methylation (DNMT1,DNMT3A) and DNA demethylation process (TET3) and those involved in chromatin remodeling: genes involved in the modification of histone methylation (EHMT1,EHMT2) and genes involved in the modification of histone deacetylation (HDAC3,HDAC5). Gene profiling showed that glyphosate changed the expression ofDNMT1,DMNT3A, andHDAC3, while AMPA changed the expression ofDNMT1andHDAC3. The results also revealed that glyphosate at lower concentrations than AMPA upregulated the expression of the tested genes. Both compounds studied altered expression of genes, which are characteristic for the regulation of transcriptionally inactive chromatin. However, the unknown activity of many other proteins involved in chromatin structure regulation prevents to carry out an unambiguous evaluation of the effect of tested xenobiotics on the studied process. Undoubtedly, we have observed that glyphosate and AMPA affect epigenetic processes that regulate chromatin architecture."

But the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to examine whether cesarean delivery on maternal request without any medical indications (CDMR) impacts DNA methylation status in the umbilical cord blood of the infant.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Shanghai, China. A total of 70 CDMR and 70 vaginal deliveries (VD) were recruited in 2012. The cord blood DNA methylation status was measured in 30 CDMR and 30 VD newborns using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip. To validate the results, the cord blood DNA methylation status was measured in another 40 CDMR and 40 VD newborns using targeted bisulfite sequencing assay. A total of 497 CpG sites from 40 genes were included in the analysis.A total of 165 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) exhibited differences in DNA methylation by 10% or more between the CDMR and VD groups, many of which were related to the development of the immune system. Based on the targeted bisulfite sequencing assay, 16 genes (16/22, 72.7%) had higher methylation level in the CDMR group than the VD group. Among them, 5 genes were related to the immune system. After considering the estimation of cell type proportions, there was few significant differences in DNA methylation between CDMR and VD groups.The DMPs identified between CDMR and VD groups might be largely explained by the cell type proportions.

Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the molecular mechanism of LRP/LR on apoptotic pathways in late stage (DLD-1) colorectal cancer cells upon siRNA-mediated down-regulation of LRP/LR.siRNAs were used to down-regulate the expression of LRP/LR in DLD-1 cells which was assessed using western blotting and qPCR. To evaluate the mechanistic role of LRP/LR, proteomic analysis of pathways involved in proliferation and apoptosis were investigated. The data from the study was analysed using a one-way ANOVA, followed by a two-tailed student's t-test with a confidence interval of 95%.Here we show that knock-down of LRP/LR led to significant changes in the proteome of DLD-1 cells, exposing new roles of the protein. Moreover, analysis showed that LRP/LR may alter components of the MAPK, p53-apoptotic and autophagic signalling pathways to aid colorectal cancer cells in continuous growth and survival. Knock-down of LRP/LR also resulted in significant decreases in telomerase activity and telomerase-related proteins in the DLD-1 cells.These findings show that LRP/LR is critically implicated in apoptosis and cell viability maintenance and suggest that siRNA-mediated knock-down of LRP/LR may be a possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of colorectal cancer."

The three decades following on from its discovery have been accompanied by an increased understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of telomerase activity, and its role in telomere biology. Telomerase has a clearly defined role in telomere length maintenance and an established influence on DNA replication, differentiation, survival, development, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, and a further role in therapeutic resistance in human stem and cancer cells including those of breast and cervical origin.TERTencodes the catalytic subunit and rate-limiting factor for telomerase enzyme activity. The mechanisms of activation or silencing ofTERTremain open to debate across somatic, cancer, and stem cells. Promoter mutations upstream ofTERTmay promote dysregulated telomerase activation in tumour cells but additional factors including epigenetic, transcriptional and posttranscriptional modifications also have a role to play. Previous systematic analysis indicated methylation and mutation of theTERTpromoter in 53% and 31%, respectively, of TERT expressing cancer cell lines supporting the concept of a key role for epigenetic alteration associated with TERT dysregulation and cellular transformation. Epigenetic regulators including DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs are now emerging as drivers in the regulation of telomeres and telomerase activity. Epigenetic regulation may be responsible for reversible silencing of TERT in several biological processes including development and differentiation, and increasedTERTexpression in cancers.

"33800718","The Potential Role of Exosomes in Child and Adolescent Obesity.","Children (Basel)","Child and adolescent obesity constitute one of the greatest contemporary public health menaces. The enduring disproportion between calorie intake and energy consumption, determined by a complex interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors, finally leads to the development of overweight and obesity. Child and adolescent overweight/obesity promotes smoldering systemic inflammation (""para-inflammation"") and increases the likelihood of later metabolic and cardiovascular complications, including metabolic syndrome and its components, which progressively deteriorate during adulthood. Exosomes are endosome-derived extracellular vesicles that are secreted by a variety of cells, are naturally taken-up by target cells, and may be involved in many physiological and pathological processes. Over the last decade, intensive research has been conducted regarding the special role of exosomes and the non-coding (nc) RNAs they contain (primarily micro (mi) RNAs, long (l) non-coding RNAs, messenger (m) RNAs and other molecules) in inter-cellular communications. Through their action as communication mediators, exosomes may contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity and associated disorders. There is increasing evidence that exosomal miRNAs and lncRNAs are involved in pivotal processes of adipocyte biology and that, possibly, play important roles in gene regulation linked to human obesity. This review aims to improve our understanding of the roles of exosomes and their cargo in the development of obesity and related metabolic and inflammatory disorders. We examined their potential roles in adipose tissue physiology and reviewed the scarce data regarding the altered patterns of circulating miRNAs and lncRNAs observed in obese children and adolescents, compared them to the equivalent, more abundant existing findings of adult studies, and speculated on their proposed mechanisms of action. Exosomal miRNAs and lncRNAs could be applied as cardiometabolic risk biomarkers, useful in the early diagnosis and prevention of obesity. Furthermore, the targeting of crucial circulating exosomal cargo to tissues involved in the pathogenesis and maintenance of obesity could provide a novel therapeutic approach to this devastating and management-resistant pandemic."
"33732142","Cellular Senescence in Brain Aging.","Front Aging Neurosci","Aging of the brain can manifest itself as a memory and cognitive decline, which has been shown to frequently coincide with changes in the structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Decreased number and maturity of spines in aged animals and humans, together with changes in synaptic transmission, may reflect aberrant neuronal plasticity directly associated with impaired brain functions. In extreme, a neurodegenerative disease, which completely devastates the basic functions of the brain, may develop. While cellular senescence in peripheral tissues has recently been linked to aging and a number of aging-related disorders, its involvement in brain aging is just beginning to be explored. However, accumulated evidence suggests that cell senescence may play a role in the aging of the brain, as it has been documented in other organs. Senescent cells stop dividing and shift their activity to strengthen the secretory function, which leads to the acquisition of the so called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent cells have also other characteristics, such as altered morphology and proteostasis, decreased propensity to undergo apoptosis, autophagy impairment, accumulation of lipid droplets, increased activity of senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), and epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and histone post-translational modifications that, in consequence, result in altered gene expression. Proliferation-competent glial cells can undergo senescence bothin vitroandin vivo, and they likely participate in neuroinflammation, which is characteristic for the aging brain. However, apart from proliferation-competent glial cells, the brain consists of post-mitotic neurons. Interestingly, it has emerged recently, that non-proliferating neuronal cells present in the brain or cultivatedin vitrocan also have some hallmarks, including SASP, typical for senescent cells that ceased to divide. It has been documented that so called senolytics, which by definition, eliminate senescent cells, can improve cognitive ability in mice models. In this review, we ask questions about the role of senescent brain cells in brain plasticity and cognitive functions impairments and how senolytics can improve them. We will discuss whether neuronal plasticity, defined as morphological and functional changes at the level of neurons and dendritic spines, can be the hallmark of neuronal senescence susceptible to the effects of senolytics.Copyright © 2021 Sikora, Bielak-Zmijewska, Dudkowska, Krzystyniak, Mosieniak, Wesierska and Wlodarczyk."

Our goal in this pilot study was to determine whether liver-specific cfDNA levels are increased in PBC and PSC patients relative to controls and in advanced versus early disease, to evaluate their potential as novel disease biomarkers.Peripheral blood derived bisulfite-treated DNA was PCR amplified from patients with PBC (n = 48), PSC (n = 48) and controls (n = 96) to evaluate methylation status at 16 CpG sites reported to be specifically unmethylated in liver tissue near the genes IGF2R, ITIH4 and VTN. Amplicons were used to prepare paired end libraries which were sequenced on a MiSeq sequencer. Trimmed reads were aligned and used to determine unmethylation ratios and to calculate concentration of liver-specific cfDNA. Comparisons between groups were performed using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney Test and relationships between variables were evaluated using Pearson's Correlation.Levels of liver-specific cfDNA, as measured at the 3 genetic loci, were increased in PBC and PSC patients relative to controls and in late-stage relative to early-stage patients. As well, cfDNA levels were correlated with levels of alkaline phosphatase, a commonly used biochemical test to evaluate disease severity in liver disease, in patients, but not in controls.cfDNA offers promise as a non-invasive liquid-biopsy to evaluate liver-specific cell-death in patients with cholestatic liver diseases."

OA of the knee is initiated by physical damage and accumulated oxidative stress, followed by an exaggerated inflammation leading to cartilage damage. Currently, no effective and safe therapeutic option capable of restoring articular cartilage tissue and joint architecture is available. We here report a novel and highly bioavailable formulation of curcumin, labeled as Next Generation Ultrasol Curcumin (NGUC), which was 64.7 times more bioavailable than natural 95% curcumin extract as demonstrated in rat bioavailability studies. We further investigated the protective effect of NGUC against monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced knee OA in rats. Analysis of X-ray and histopathological images revealed that NGUC supplementation restored joint architecture and reduced swelling of joints induced by MIA. NGUC treatment caused a significant reduction in the levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, COMP, and CRP, and expressions of MMP-3, 5-LOX, COX-2, and NFκB in synovial tissue of rats with MIA-induced OA. NGUC also decreased serum MDA level and increased the levels of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and GPX. Thus, our results indicate that a novel formulation of curcumin with enhanced bioavailability effectively ameliorates the pathophysiology of OA.Copyright © 2021 Yabas, Orhan, Er, Tuzcu, Durmus, Ozercan, Sahin, Bhanuse, Morde, Padigaru and Sahin."
"33808331","A Review of Recent Studies on Bisphenol A and Phthalate Exposures and Child Neurodevelopment.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Bisphenol A and phthalate have been found in the environment, as well as in humans. In this narrative review pre- and postnatal bisphenol A and phthalate exposures, their relationship to neurodevelopment, and the behavioral outcomes of children are elucidated, focusing in particular on the recent case-control, cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies. This review also introduces some of the possible mechanisms behind the observed associations between exposures and outcomes.Although bisphenol A and phthalate exposure have been reported to influence neurobehavioral development in children, there are various kinds of test batteries for child neurodevelopmental assessment at different ages whose findings have been inconsistent among studies. In addition, the timing and number of exposure assessments have varied.Overall, this review suggests that prenatal exposure to bisphenol A and phthalates may contribute to neurobehavioral outcomes in children. The evidence is still limited; however, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms, especially among boys, constantly suggested association with both prenatal and concurrent exposure to bisphenol A. Although there is limited evidence on the adverse effects of prenatal and postnatal bisphenol A and phthalate exposures provided, pregnant women and young children should be protected from exposure based on a precautionary approach."
"33821005","Distinct dynamics and functions of H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 in mouse preimplantation embryos.","Nat Genet","Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1/2) maintain transcriptional silencing of developmental genes largely by catalyzing the formation of mono-ubiquitinated histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1) and trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), respectively. How Polycomb domains are reprogrammed during mammalian preimplantation development remains largely unclear. Here we show that, although H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3 are highly colocalized in gametes, they undergo differential reprogramming dynamics following fertilization. H3K27me3 maintains thousands of maternally biased domains until the blastocyst stage, whereas maternally biased H2AK119ub1 distribution in zygotes is largely equalized at the two-cell stage. Notably, while maternal PRC2 depletion has a limited effect on global H2AK119ub1 in early embryos, it disrupts allelic H2AK119ub1 at H3K27me3 imprinting loci including Xist. By contrast, acute H2AK119ub1 depletion in zygotes does not affect H3K27me3 imprinting maintenance, at least by the four-cell stage. Importantly, loss of H2AK119ub1, but not H3K27me3, causes premature activation of developmental genes during zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and subsequent embryonic arrest. Thus, our study reveals distinct dynamics and functions of H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub1 in mouse preimplantation embryos."
"33785750","Cellular macromolecules-tethered DNA walking indexing to explore nanoenvironments of chromatin modifications.","Nat Commun","Exploring spatial organization and relationship of diverse biomolecules within cellular nanoenvironments is important to elucidate the fundamental processes of life. However, it remains methodologically challenging. Herein, we report a molecular recognition mechanism cellular macromolecules-tethered DNA walking indexing (Cell-TALKING) to probe the nanoenvironments containing diverse chromatin modifications. As an example, we characterize the nanoenvironments of three DNA modifications around one histone posttranslational modification (PTM). These DNA modifications in fixed cells are labeled with respective DNA barcoding probes, and then the PTM site is tethered with a DNA walking probe. Cell-TALKING can continuously produce cleavage records of any barcoding probes nearby the walking probe. New 3'-OH ends are generated on the cleaved barcoding probes to induce DNA amplification for downstream detections. Combining fluorescence imaging, we identify various combinatorial chromatin modifications and investigate their dynamic changes during cell cycles. We also explore the nanoenvironments in different cancer cell lines and clinical specimens. In principle, using high-throughput sequencing instead of fluorescence imaging may allow the detection of complex cellular nanoenvironments containing tens of biomolecules such as transcription factors."
"33841510","Exploring the Imbalance of Periodontitis Immune System From the Cellular to Molecular Level.","Front Genet","Periodontitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease of periodontal tissue, mostly concentrated in people over 30 years old. Statistics show that compared with foreign countries, the prevalence of periodontitis in China is as high as 40%, and the prevalence of periodontal disease is more than 90%, which must arouse our great attention. Diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis currently rely mainly on clinical criteria, and the exploration of the etiologic criteria is relatively lacking. We, therefore, have explored the pathogenesis of periodontitis from the perspective of immune imbalance. By predicting the fraction of 22 immune cells in periodontitis tissues and comparing them with normal tissues, we found that multiple immune cell infiltration in periodontitis tissues was inhibited and this feature can clearly distinguish periodontitis from normal tissues. Further, protein interaction network (PPI) and transcription regulation network have been constructed based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to explore the interaction function modules and regulation pathways. Three functional modules have been revealed and top TFs such as EGR1 and ETS1 have been shown to regulate the expression of periodontitis-related immune genes that play an important role in the formation of the immunosuppressive microenvironment. The classifier was also used to verify the reliability of periodontitis features obtained at the cellular and molecular levels. In conclusion, we have revealed the immune microenvironment and molecular characteristics of periodontitis, which will help to better understand the mechanism of periodontitis and its application in clinical diagnosis and treatment.Copyright © 2021 He, Liu, Li, Zhuang, Dai, Wang and Bi."

A growing number of evidences suggested that a higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI results in adverse offspring health outcomes, especially shorter newborn TL. However, a newborn's genetic endowment is equally derived from both parents, the association between parental pre-pregnancy BMI and newborn TL has been rarely discussed. We aimed to determine the association between parental pre-pregnancy BMI and newborn TL.A total of 1082 parent-newborn pairs were recruited from the Guangxi Zhuang Birth Cohort (GZBC). TL in cord blood was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and expressed as the ratio of telomere copy number to single-copy gene number (T/S). A series of linear regressions were performed to assess the associations between parental pre-pregnancy BMI and newborn TL.Mothers who were overweight before pregnancy had significantly shorter cord blood telomere length in their newborns than those who were normal weight before pregnancy [percentage change: - 7.96% (95% CI: - 14.49 to - 0.69%; P = 0.032)]. Further analysis of the combined effects of parental weight status on newborn TL showed that TL was significantly shortened among newborns whose mothers were overweight and fathers were of healthy weight when compared with those whose mothers and fathers were both of normal weight [percentage change: - 8.38% (95% CI: - 15.47 to - 0.92%; P = 0.028)]. Subgroup analysis indicated these effects were more pronounced among male newborns and those whose paternal age < 31 years or maternal age ≥ 28 years at delivery.Maternal pre-pregnancy overweight, but not paternal pre-pregnancy overweight is associated with shorter newborn TL. Weight control in reproductive women and effective healthy weight management before pregnancy may be of particular benefit for improving longevity and life quality of offspring."

Here, we systematically characterize cis-regulatory elements and their functions in 12 diverse tissues from four pig breeds by adopting similar strategies as the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics projects, which include RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq. In total, we generate 199 datasets and identify more than 220,000 cis-regulatory elements in the pig genome. Surprisingly, we find higher conservation of cis-regulatory elements between human and pig genomes than those between human and mouse genomes. Furthermore, the differences of topologically associating domains between the pig and human genomes are associated with morphological evolution of the head and face. Beyond generating a major new benchmark resource for pig epigenetics, our study provides basic comparative epigenetic data relevant to using pigs as models in human biomedical research."

Some of these 3C technologies retrieve interactions involving non-contiguous sets of loci, resulting in sparse interaction matrices. One of such 3C technologies is Promoter Capture Hi-C (pcHi-C) that is tailored to probe only interactions involving gene promoters. As such, pcHi-C provides sparse interaction matrices that are suitable to characterize short- and long-range enhancer-promoter interactions. Here, we introduce a new method to reconstruct the chromatin structural (3D) organization from sparse 3C-based datasets such as pcHi-C. Our method allows for data normalization, detection of significant interactions and reconstruction of the full 3D organization of the genomic region despite of the data sparseness. Specifically, it builds, with as low as the 2-3% of the data from the matrix, reliable 3D models of similar accuracy of those based on dense interaction matrices. Furthermore, the method is sensitive enough to detect cell-type-specific 3D organizational features such as the formation of different networks of active gene communities.© The Author(s) 2021.

"33790745","Trans-Synaptic Regulation of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors by Elfn Proteins in Health and Disease.","Front Neural Circuits","Trans-regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) transmembrane proteins has emerged as a novel type of synaptic molecular interaction in the last decade. Several studies on LRR-GPCR interactions have revealed their critical role in synapse formation and in establishing synaptic properties. Among them, LRR-GPCR interactions between extracellular LRR fibronectin domain-containing family proteins (Elfn1 and Elfn2) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are particularly interesting as they can affect a broad range of synapses through the modulation of signaling by glutamate, the principal excitatory transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Elfn-mGluR interactions have been investigated in hippocampal, cortical, and retinal synapses. Postsynaptic Elfn1 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex mediates the tonic regulation of excitatory input onto somatostatin-positive interneurons (INs) through recruitment of presynaptic mGluR7. In the retina, presynaptic Elfn1 binds to mGluR6 and is necessary for synapse formation between rod photoreceptor cells and rod-bipolar cells. The repertoire of binding partners for Elfn1 and Elfn2 includes all group III mGluRs (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7, and mGluR8), and both Elfn1 and Elfn2 can alter mGluR-mediated signaling through trans-interaction. Importantly, both preclinical and clinical studies have provided support for the involvement of the Elfn1-mGluR7 interaction in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and epilepsy. In fact, Elfn1-mGluR7-associated disorders may reflect the altered function of somatostatin-positive interneuron inhibitory neural circuits, the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, and habenular circuits, highlighting the need for further investigation into this interaction.Copyright © 2021 Matsunaga and Aruga."

HCC screening is recommended among individuals with cirrhosis using biannual abdominal ultrasound, for earlier tumor detection, administration of curative treatment, and improved survival. Surveillance by imaging with or without biomarkers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) remains suboptimal for early stage HCC detection. Here we report on the development and assessment of methylation biomarkers from liquid biopsies for HCC surveillance in cirrhotic patients.DNA methylation markers including the HCCBloodTest (Epigenomics AG) and a DNA-methylation panel established by next generation sequencing (NGS) were assessed using a training/testing design. The NGS panel algorithm was established in a training study (41 HCC patients; 46 cirrhotic non-HCC controls). For testing, plasma samples were obtained from cirrhotic patients (Child class A or B) with (60) or without (103) early stage HCC (BCLC stage 0, A, B). The assays were then tested using blinded sample sets and analyzed by preset algorithms.The HCCBloodTest and the NGS panel exhibited 76.7% and 57% sensitivities at 64.1% and 97% specificity, respectively. In a post-hoc analysis, a combination of the NGS panel with AFP (20 ng/mL) achieved 68% sensitivity at 97% specificity (AUC = 0.9).Methylation biomarkers in cell free plasma DNA provide a new alternative for HCC surveillance.

However, effectively identifying candidate genes in small cohorts is challenging in most NDDs because of high genetic heterogeneity. We hypothesised that integrating DNVs from multiple NDDs with genetic similarity can significantly increase the possibility of prioritising the candidate gene. We catalogued 66,186 coding DNVs in 50,028 individuals with nine types of NDDs in cohorts with sizes spanning from 118 to 31,260 from Gene4Denovo database to validate this hypothesis. Interestingly, we found that integrated DNVs can effectively increase the number of prioritised candidate genes for each disorder. We identified 654 candidate genes including 481 shared candidate genes carrying putative functional variants in at least two disorders. Notably, 13.51% (65/481) of shared candidate genes were prioritised only via integrated analysis including 44.62% (29/65) genes validated in recent large cohort studies. Moreover, we estimated that more novel candidate genes will be prioritised with the increase in cohort size, in particular for some disorders with high putative functional DNVs per individual. In conclusion, integrated DNVs may increase the power of prioritising candidate genes, which is important for NDDs with small cohort size."

The functions of transcriptomic signatures were explored by multiple bioinformatic analyses, and their diagnostic role was also evaluated.RRA analyses of 12 transcriptome datasets comparing NASH with non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) identified 116 abnormally up-regulated genes in NASH patients. RRA analyses of five transcriptome datasets focusing fibrosis severity identified 78 abnormally up-regulated genes in NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis. The functions of those transcriptomic signatures of NASH development or fibrosis progression were similar, and were both characterized by extracellular matrix (ECM)-related pathways (Adjusted P < 0.05). The transcriptomic signatures could effectively differentiate NASH from NAFL, and could help to identify NAFLD patients with advanced fibrosis. Gene set enrichment analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis further validated the key role of ECM-related pathways in NASH development. The top 10 up-regulated genes in NASH patients were SPP1, FBLN5, CHI3L1, CCL20, CD24, FABP4, GPNMB, VCAN, EFEMP1, and CXCL10, and their functions were mainly related to either ECM-related pathways or immunity-related pathways. Single cell RNA-sequencing analyses revealed that those crucial genes were expressed by distinct cells such as hepatocytes, macrophages, and hepatic stellate cells.Transcriptomic signatures related to NASH development and fibrosis severity of NAFLD patients are both characterized by ECM-related pathways, and fibrosis is a main player during NASH progression. This study uncovers some novel key genes involved in NASH progression, which may be promising therapeutic targets."
"33815470","The Role of Mitonuclear Incompatibility in Bipolar Disorder Susceptibility and Resilience Against Environmental Stressors.","Front Genet","It has been postulated that mitochondrial dysfunction has a significant role in the underlying pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD). Mitochondrial functioning plays an important role in regulating synaptic transmission, brain function, and cognition. Neuronal activity is energy dependent and neurons are particularly sensitive to changes in bioenergetic fluctuations, suggesting that mitochondria regulate fundamental aspects of brain function. Vigorous evidence supports the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the etiology of BD, including dysregulated oxidative phosphorylation, general decrease of energy, altered brain bioenergetics, co-morbidity with mitochondrial disorders, and association with genetic variants in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes. Despite these advances, the underlying etiology of mitochondrial dysfunction in BD is unclear. A plausible evolutionary explanation is that mitochondrial-nuclear (mitonuclear) incompatibility leads to a desynchronization of machinery required for efficient electron transport and cellular energy production. Approximately 1,200 genes, encoded from both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, are essential for mitochondrial function. Studies suggest that mitochondrial and nuclear genomes co-evolve, and the coordinated expression of these interacting gene products are essential for optimal organism function. Incompatibilities between mtDNA and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes results in inefficiency in electron flow down the respiratory chain, differential oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, increased release of free radicals, altered intracellular Ca2+signaling, and reduction of catalytic sites and ATP production. This review explores the role of mitonuclear incompatibility in BD susceptibility and resilience against environmental stressors.Copyright © 2021 Gonzalez."
"33750922","Antigen presentation in cancer: insights into tumour immunogenicity and immune evasion.","Nat Rev Cancer","Immune checkpoint blockade, which blocks inhibitory signals of T cell activation, has shown tremendous success in treating cancer, although success still remains limited to a fraction of patients. To date, clinically effective CD8+T cell responses appear to target predominantly antigens derived from tumour-specific mutations that accumulate in cancer, also called neoantigens. Tumour antigens are displayed on the surface of cells by class I human leukocyte antigens (HLA-I). To elicit an effective antitumour response, antigen presentation has to be successful at two distinct events: first, cancer antigens have to be taken up by dendritic cells (DCs) and cross-presented for CD8+T cell priming. Second, the antigens have to be directly presented by the tumour for recognition by primed CD8+T cells and killing. Tumours exploit multiple escape mechanisms to evade immune recognition at both of these steps. Here, we review the tumour-derived factors modulating DC function, and we summarize evidence of immune evasion by means of quantitative modulation or qualitative alteration of the antigen repertoire presented on tumours. These mechanisms include modulation of antigen expression, HLA-I surface levels, alterations in the antigen processing and presentation machinery in tumour cells. Lastly, as complete abrogation of antigen presentation can lead to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated tumour killing, we also discuss how tumours can harbour antigen presentation defects and still evade NK cell recognition."

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated sites between AF and normal samples were screened. Then, highly expressed and hypomethylated and lowly expressed and hypermethylated genes were identified for AF. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was presented to construct AF-related coexpression networks. 52 AF blood samples were used for whole exome sequence. The mutation was visualized by the maftools package in R. Key genes were validated in AF using independent datasets.DEGs were identified between AF and controls, which were enriched in neutrophil activation and regulation of actin cytoskeleton. RHOA, CCR2, CASP8, and SYNPO2L exhibited abnormal expression and methylation, which have been confirmed to be related to AF. PCDHA family genes had high methylation and low expression in AF. We constructed two AF-related coexpression modules. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was the most common mutation type in AF, especially T > C. MUC4 was the most frequent mutation gene, followed by PHLDA1, AHNAK2, and MAML3. There was no statistical difference in expression of AHNAK2 and MAML3, for AF. PHLDA1 and MUC4 were confirmed to be abnormally expressed in AF.Our findings identified DEGs related to DNA methylation and mutation for AF, which may offer possible therapeutic targets and a new insight into the pathogenesis of AF from a multiomics perspective.Copyright © 2021 Li Liu et al."

Accumulating evidence has convincingly demonstrated the strong genetic basis of AF, and an increasing number of pathogenic variations in over 50 genes have been causally linked to AF. Nevertheless, AF is of pronounced genetic heterogeneity, and the genetic determinants underpinning AF in most patients remain obscure. In the current investigation, a Chinese pedigree with AF as well as ventricular arrhythmias and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was recruited. Whole exome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of the available family members were conducted, and a novel heterozygous variation in the KLF15 gene (encoding Krüppel-like factor 15, a transcription factor critical for cardiac electrophysiology and structural remodeling), NM_014079.4: c.685A>T; p.(Lys229*), was identified. The variation was verified by Sanger sequencing and segregated with autosomal dominant AF in the family with complete penetrance. The variation was absent from 300 unrelated healthy subjects used as controls. In functional assays using a dual-luciferase assay system, mutant KLF15 showed neither transcriptional activation of the KChIP2 promoter nor transcriptional inhibition of the CTGF promoter, alone or in the presence of TGFB1, a key player in the pathogenesis of arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. The findings indicate KLF15 as a new causative gene responsible for AF as well as ventricular arrhythmias and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and they provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac arrhythmias and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."

Multi-omics factor analysis was used to integrate all biological levels. Identified analytes were used to construct best predictive models of the presence of AD pathology and of cognitive decline with multifactorial regression analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis identified pathway alterations in AD.Multi-omics integration identified five major dimensions of heterogeneity explaining the variance within the cohort and differentially associated with AD. Further analysis exposed multiple interactions between single 'omics modalities and distinct multi-omics molecular signatures differentially related to amyloid pathology, neuronal injury, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Enrichment pathway analysis revealed overrepresentation of the hemostasis, immune response, and extracellular matrix signaling pathways in association with AD. Finally, combinations of four molecules improved prediction of both AD (protein 14-3-3 zeta/delta, clusterin, interleukin-15, and transgelin-2) and cognitive decline (protein 14-3-3 zeta/delta, clusterin, cholesteryl ester 27:1 16:0 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1).Applying an integrative multi-omics approach we report novel molecular and pathways alterations associated with AD pathology. These findings are relevant for the development of personalized diagnosis and treatment approaches in AD."

Internal tandem duplication mutations in FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) detected in AML stem cells account for 20-30 percent of AML patients. In this study, we attempted to study the impact of the interaction of FLT3-ITD mutation and the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in AML, and the possible mechanisms caused by the impact by bioinformatics. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) revealed that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway positively correlated with the status of FLT3-ITD mutation. Multiple survival analyses were performed on TCGA-AML to screen the prognostic-related genes, and RPS6KA1 and AP2M1 are powerful prognostic candidates for overall survival in AML. WGCNA, KEGG/GO analysis, and the functional roles of RPS6KA1 and AP2M1 in AML were clarified by correlation analysis. We found that the expression levels of RPS6KA1 and AP2M1 were significantly associated with chemoresistance of AML, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis would regulate RPS6KA1/AP2M1 expression. Besides, miR-138-5p, regulated by the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis, was the common miRNA target of RPS6KA1 and AP2M1. Taken together, the interaction of FLT3-ITD mutation and the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis activated the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, and the increased expression of RPS6KA1 and AP2M1 caused by hsa-miR-138-5p downregulation regulates the multi-resistance gene expression leading to drug indications.Copyright © 2021 Yu, Chen, Liu, Yao, Li and Ruan."

This study identified a polymorphism in the Stathmin-2 gene and investigated its association with sporadic ALS (sALS) disease risk, age-of onset and survival duration.The candidate CA repeat was systematically analyzed using PCR, Sanger sequencing and high throughput capillary separation for genotyping. Stathmin-2 expression was investigated using RT-PCR in patient olfactory neurosphere-derived (ONS) cells and RNA sequencing in laser-captured spinal motor neurons.In a case-control analysis of a combined North American sALS cohort (n= 321) and population control group (n= 332), long/long CA genotypes were significantly associated with disease risk (p= 0.042), and most strongly when one allele was a 24 CA repeat (p= 0.0023). In addition, longer CA allele length was associated with earlier age-of-onset (p= 0.039), and shorter survival duration in bulbar-onset cases (p= 0.006). In an Australian longitudinal sALS cohort (n= 67), ALS functional rating scale scores were significantly lower in carriers of the long/long genotype (p= 0.034). Stathmin-2 mRNA expression was reduced in sporadic patient ONS cells. Additionally, sALS patients and controls exhibited variable expression of Stathmin-2 mRNA according to CA genotype in laser-captured spinal motor neurons.We report a novel non-coding CA repeat in Stathmin-2 which is associated with sALS disease risk and has disease modifying effects. The potential value of this variant as a disease marker and tool for cohort enrichment in clinical trials warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2021 Theunissen, Anderton, Mastaglia, Flynn, Winter, James, Bedlack, Hodgetts, Fletcher, Wilton, Laing, MacShane, Needham, Saunders, Mackay-Sim, Melamed, Ravits, Cleveland and Akkari."
"33804860","Selective Activation of CNS and Reference <i>PPARGC1A</i> Promoters Is Associated with Distinct Gene Programs Relevant for Neurodegenerative Diseases.","Int J Mol Sci","The transcriptional regulator peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1A (PGC-1α), encoded byPPARGC1A, has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Recently discovered CNS-specificPPARGC1Atranscripts are initiated far upstream of the reference promoter, spliced to exon 2 of the reference gene, and are more abundant than reference gene transcripts in post-mortem human brain samples. The proteins translated from the CNS and reference transcripts differ only at their N-terminal regions. To dissect functional differences between CNS-specific isoforms and reference proteins, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) for selective endogenous activation of the CNS or the reference promoters in SH-SY5Y cells. Expression and/or exon usage of the targets was ascertained by RNA sequencing. Compared to controls, more differentially expressed genes were observed after activation of the CNS than the reference gene promoter, while the magnitude of alternative exon usage was comparable between activation of the two promoters. Promoter-selective associations were observed with canonical signaling pathways, mitochondrial and nervous system functions and neurological diseases. The distinct N-terminal as well as the shared downstream regions of PGC-1α isoforms affect the exon usage of numerous genes. Furthermore, associations of risk genes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease were noted with differentially expressed genes resulting from the activation of the CNS and reference gene promoter, respectively. Thus, CNS-specific isoforms markedly amplify the biological functions ofPPARGC1Aand CNS-specific isoforms and reference proteins have common, complementary and selective functions relevant for neurodegenerative diseases."
"33837451","Immune cells lacking Y chromosome show dysregulation of autosomal gene expression.","Cell Mol Life Sci","Epidemiological investigations show that mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in leukocytes is associated with earlier mortality and morbidity from many diseases in men. LOY is the most common acquired mutation and is associated with aberrant clonal expansion of cells, yet it remains unclear whether this mosaicism exerts a direct physiological effect. We studied DNA and RNA from leukocytes in sorted- and single-cells in vivo and in vitro. DNA analyses of sorted cells showed that men diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease was primarily affected with LOY in NK cells whereas prostate cancer patients more frequently displayed LOY in CD4 + T cells and granulocytes. Moreover, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing in leukocytes allowed scoring of LOY from mRNA data and confirmed considerable variation in the rate of LOY across individuals and cell types. LOY-associated transcriptional effect (LATE) was observed in ~ 500 autosomal genes showing dysregulation in leukocytes with LOY. The fraction of LATE genes within specific cell types was substantially larger than the fraction of LATE genes shared between different subsets of leukocytes, suggesting that LOY might have pleiotropic effects. LATE genes are involved in immune functions but also encode proteins with roles in other diverse biological processes. Our findings highlight a surprisingly broad role for chromosome Y, challenging the view of it as a ""genetic wasteland"", and support the hypothesis that altered immune function in leukocytes could be a mechanism linking LOY to increased risk for disease."

One of the considered aspects is the involvement of the sex chromosomes, especially loss of chromosome Y (LOY).Tumors from 105 isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild type male GBM patients were tested with droplet digital PCR for copy number changes of ten genes on chromosome Y. Decreased gene expression, a proxy of gene loss, was then analyzed in 225 IDH wild type GBM derived from TCGA and overall survival in both cohorts was tested with Kaplan-Meier log-rank analysis and maximally selected rank statistics for cut-off determination.LOY was associated with significantly shorter overall survival (7 vs. 14.6 months,p= 0.0016), and among investigated individual genes survival correlated most prominently with loss of the sex-determining region Y gene (SRY) (10.8 vs. 14.8 months,p= 0.0031). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and MYC proto-oncogene signaling pathways are associated with low SRY expression.Our data show that deletions and reduced gene expression of chromosome Y genes, especially SRY, are associated with reduced survival of male GBM patients and connected to major susceptibility pathways of gliomagenesis."

Microglia rapidly react to the changes in their microenvironment. This plasticity is attributed to the ability of microglia to adapt a context-specific phenotype. Numerous gene expression profiling studies of immunosorted CNS immune cells did not permit a clear dissection of their phenotypes, particularly in diseases when peripheral cells of the immune system come to play. Only recent advances in single-cell technologies allowed studying microglia at high resolution and revealed a spectrum of discrete states both under homeostatic and pathological conditions. Single-cell technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry (Cytometry by Time-Of-Flight, CyTOF) enabled determining entire transcriptomes or the simultaneous quantification of >30 cellular parameters of thousands of individual cells. Single-cell omics studies demonstrated the unforeseen heterogeneity of microglia and immune infiltrates in brain pathologies: neurodegenerative disorders, stroke, depression, and brain tumors. We summarize the findings from those studies and the current state of knowledge of functional diversity of microglia under physiological and pathological conditions. A precise definition of microglia functions and phenotypes may be essential to design future immune-modulating therapies."

Patient data were retrospectively reviewed in this study and cancer organoids were established using tissues obtained from two patients. A total of 42 patients with IHCC received conversion therapy, 9 of whom were downstaged successfully, and another 157 patients were initially resectable. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the successfully downstaged patients had a significantly improved overall survival compared to those in whom downstaging was unsuccessful (p= 0.017), and had a similar overall survival to that of initially resectable patients (p= 0.965). The IHCC organoid was successfully established from one of two obtained tissues. Routine hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistological staining found the organoid retained the histopathological characteristics of the original tissues. Whole exome sequencing results indicated the IHCC organoid retained appropriately 87% of the variants in the original tissue. Gemcitabine and paclitaxel exhibited the strongest inhibitory effects on the cancer organoid as determined using drug screening tests, consistent with the levels of efficacy observed in the patient from whom it was derived. This study indicates that conversion therapy could improve the survival of patients with IHCC despite its low success rate, and it may be directed by cancer organoids though this is merely a proof of feasibility."
"33800161","Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Sampling for Personalized Pancreatic Cancer Treatment.","Diagnostics (Basel)","Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal solid malignancy, and the number of patients with pancreatic cancer is increasing. Systemic chemotherapies are often ineffective for such patients, and there is an urgent need for personalized medicine. Unlike other types of cancer, personalized treatments for pancreatic cancer are still in development. Consequently, pancreatic cancer is less sensitive to anticancer drugs and is often refractory to common treatments. Therefore, advances in personalized medicine for pancreatic cancer are necessary. This review examined advances in personalized medicine for pancreatic cancer, including the use of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided sampling. EUS-guided sampling is widely used for diagnosing pancreatic tumors and is expected to be applied to sampled tissues. Additionally, there has been an increase in clinical research using EUS-guided sampling. The combination of precision medicine using genomic testing and pharmacological profiles based on high-throughput drug sensitivity testing using patient-derived organoids is expected to revolutionize pancreatic cancer treatment."
"33735395","The Impact of Gastric Bypass on Telomere Length and Shelterin Complex Gene Expression: 6 Months Prospective Study.","Obes Surg","Telomeres are structures located at the ends of chromosomes associated with a protein complex, known as the shelterin complex. In individuals with obesity, excess adipose tissue plays a key role in inducing a chronic and systemic inflammatory state, which can cause TL shortening. In this context, bariatric surgery is one of the most effective treatment modalities in improving metabolic control.Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate how a short postoperative period of gastric bypass affects TL and expression of POT1, TRF1 and TRF2 genes.Forty-eight women submitted to RYGB were evaluated before and after 6 months of the surgical procedure. Anthropometric measures of body weight and height (BMI), abdominal circumference (AC), body composition, food intake and blood collection for biochemical evaluation, TL analysis (DNA), and gene expression (RNA) were collected at each moment.There was a reduction of weight, BMI, AC, FM and FFM as well as of glycemia, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides after gastric bypass. No difference in energy intake and macronutrients consumption was observed. There was no significant change in TL, but there was a significant increase of POT1 and TRF1 gene expression after surgery, while TRF2 expression did not change.Despite bariatric surgery is not capable of increasing telomere length in a short-term period, no reduction is observed; additionally, we found a correlation between serum triglycerides concentration and TL. The increase of POT1 and TRF1 gene expression may explain the maintenance of the TL after 6 months postoperative period."
"33758175","Epigenetically regulated digital signaling defines epithelial innate immunity at the tissue level.","Nat Commun","To prevent damage to the host or its commensal microbiota, epithelial tissues must match the intensity of the immune response to the severity of a biological threat. Toll-like receptors allow epithelial cells to identify microbe associated molecular patterns. However, the mechanisms that mitigate biological noise in single cells to ensure quantitatively appropriate responses remain unclear. Here we address this question using single cell and single molecule approaches in mammary epithelial cells and primary organoids. We find that epithelial tissues respond to bacterial microbe associated molecular patterns by activating a subset of cells in an all-or-nothing (i.e. digital) manner. The maximum fraction of responsive cells is regulated by a bimodal epigenetic switch that licenses the TLR2 promoter for transcription across multiple generations. This mechanism confers a flexible memory of inflammatory events as well as unique spatio-temporal control of epithelial tissue-level immune responses. We propose that epigenetic licensing in individual cells allows for long-term, quantitative fine-tuning of population-level responses."

The molecular mechanism behind such variability is still under investigation. Several pieces of experimental evidence suggest that genetic variants influencing the onset, maintenance and resolution of the immune response may be fundamental in predicting the evolution of the disease. The identification of genetic variants behind immune system reactivity and function in COVID-19 may help in the elaboration of personalized therapeutic strategies. In the frenetic look for universally shared treatment plans, those genetic variants that are common to other diseases/models may also help in addressing future research in terms of drug repurposing. In this paper, we discuss the most recent updates about the role of immunogenetics in determining the susceptibility to and the history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We propose a narrative review of available data, speculating about lessons that we have learnt from other viral infections and immunosenescence, and discussing what kind of aspects of research should be deepened in order to improve our knowledge of how host genetic variability impacts the outcome for COVID-19 patients."
"33796106","Male Sex Bias in Immune Biomarkers for Tuberculosis.","Front Immunol","Males have a bias toward developing sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, whereas other forms of the disease have an equal sex ratio. Immune responses are known to be affected by estrogen and testosterone. Biomarkers may therefore be affected by these hormones, especially between 16 and 45 years of age when the differences are most marked. Using large data sets, we examined whether the male bias was significant in terms of diagnosis or predictive ability for the development of disease in those exposed to tuberculosis. Despite the large numbers, the need to specify homogeneous population groups for analysis affected the statistical power to discount a useful biomarker. In general, males showed higher interferon-gamma responses to TB antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10, whilst females had stronger tuberculin responses in those with sputum smear- and culture-positive tuberculosis, but smaller responses in those who were screened for tuberculosis and who did not develop disease. Importantly, in contacts of sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, more males who did not develop tuberculosis had tuberculin skin tests in the range between 10 and 14 mm, suggesting that sex-specific cut-offs might be better than general cut-off values for determining who should receive preventive treatment. Immunocytochemistry of the tuberculin responses correlated with cell numbers only in females. Total and anti-lipoarabinomannan IgM antibody levels were lower in males, whereas total and anti-BCG IgE antibody levels were higher. Evaluation of biomarkers should take account of the spectrum of tuberculosis and male sex bias for sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. These findings improve our understanding of how immune responses contribute to the pathogenesis of infectious tuberculosis as well as suggesting clinical applications of the differences between the sexes.Copyright © 2021 Bothamley."

We analyzed the COVID-19 data from the nationwide health insurance claims of South Korea. Data on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and mortality records of patients with COVID-19 were extracted from the database. The odds ratios of mortality according to comorbidities in these patients with and without adjustment for age and sex were calculated. The predictive value of the original Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and the age-adjusted CCI (ACCI) for mortality in these patients were investigated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Among 7590 patients, 227 (3.0%) had died. After age and sex adjustment, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, liver disease, renal disease, and cancer were significant risk factors for mortality. The ROC curve analysis showed that an ACCI threshold > 3.5 yielded the best cut-off point for predicting mortality (area under the ROC 0.92; 95% confidence interval 0.91-0.94). Our study revealed multiple risk factors for mortality in patients with COVID-19. The high predictive power of the ACCI for mortality in our results can support the importance of old age and comorbidities in the severity of COVID-19."

However, the rapidly evolving field of scRNA-seq invoked the emergence of various analytics approaches aimed to maximize the full potential of this novel strategy. Unlike population-based RNA sequencing approaches, scRNA seq necessitates comprehensive computational tools to address high data complexity and keep up with the emerging single-cell associated challenges.

"33761980","CACTUS: integrating clonal architecture with genomic clustering and transcriptome profiling of single tumor cells.","Genome Med","Drawing genotype-to-phenotype maps in tumors is of paramount importance for understanding tumor heterogeneity. Assignment of single cells to their tumor clones of origin can be approached by matching the genotypes of the clones to the mutations found in RNA sequencing of the cells. The confidence of the cell-to-clone mapping can be increased by accounting for additional measurements. Follicular lymphoma, a malignancy of mature B cells that continuously acquire mutations in parallel in the exome and in B cell receptor loci, presents a unique opportunity to join exome-derived mutations with B cell receptor sequences as independent sources of evidence for clonal evolution.Here, we propose CACTUS, a probabilistic model that leverages the information from an independent genomic clustering of cells and exploits the scarce single cell RNA sequencing data to map single cells to given imperfect genotypes of tumor clones.We apply CACTUS to two follicular lymphoma patient samples, integrating three measurements: whole exome, single-cell RNA, and B cell receptor sequencing. CACTUS outperforms a predecessor model by confidently assigning cells and B cell receptor-based clusters to the tumor clones.The integration of independent measurements increases model certainty and is the key to improving model performance in the challenging task of charting the genotype-to-phenotype maps in tumors. CACTUS opens the avenue to study the functional implications of tumor heterogeneity, and origins of resistance to targeted therapies.

We assessed DNA methylation in five NEC-associated genes, selected from literature:EPO, VEGFA, ENOS, DEFA5, andTLR4in infants with NEC and controls.Methods:Observational cohort study including 24 preterm infants who developed NEC (≥Bell Stage IIA) and 45 matched controls. DNA was isolated from stool samples and methylation measured using pyrosequencing. We investigated differences in methylation prior to NEC compared with controls. Next, in NEC infants, we investigated methylation patterns long before, a short time before NEC onset, and after NEC.Results:Prior to NEC, onlyTLR4CpG 2 methylation was increased in NEC infants (median = 75.4%, IQR = 71.3-83.8%) versus controls (median = 69.0%, IQR = 64.5-77.4%,p= 0.025). In NEC infants,VEGFACpG 3 methylation was 0.8% long before NEC, increasing to 1.8% a short time before NEC and 2.0% after NEC (p= 0.011;p= 0.021, respectively). A similar pattern was found inDEFA5CpG 1, which increased from 75.4 to 81.4% and remained 85.3% (p= 0.027;p= 0.019, respectively). These changes were not present forEPO, ENOS, andTLR4.Conclusion:Epigenetic changes ofTLR4, VEGFA, andDEFA5are present in NEC infants and can differ in relation to the time of NEC onset. Differences in DNA methylation ofTLR4, VEGFA, andDEFA5may influence gene expression and increase the risk for developing NEC.

CTD can be used to address toxicological mechanisms for environmental chemicals and facilitate the generation of testable hypotheses about how exposures affect human health. At CTD, manually curated interactions for chemical-induced phenotypes are enhanced with anatomy terms (tissues, fluids, and cell types) to describe the physiological system of the reported event. These same anatomy terms are used to annotate the human media (e.g., urine, hair, nail, blood, etc.) in which an environmental chemical was assayed for exposure. Currently, CTD uses more than 880 unique anatomy terms to contextualize over 255,000 chemical-phenotype interactions and 167,000 exposure statements. These annotations allow chemical-phenotype interactions and exposure data to be explored from a novel, anatomical perspective. Here, we describe CTD's anatomy curation process (including the construction of a controlled, interoperable vocabulary) and new anatomy webpages (that coalesce and organize the curated chemical-phenotype and exposure data sets). We also provide examples that demonstrate how this feature can be used to identify system- and cell-specific chemical-induced toxicities, help inform exposure data, prioritize phenotypes for environmental diseases, survey tissue and pregnancy exposomes, and facilitate data connections with external resources.

These factors can promote vascular dysfunction, inflammation and hypertension, thereby elevating the risk of cardiovascular disease. In this Review, we focus on the indirect, non-auditory cardiovascular health effects of transportation noise. We provide an updated overview of epidemiological research on the effects of transportation noise on cardiovascular risk factors and disease, discuss the mechanistic insights from the latest clinical and experimental studies, and propose new risk markers to address noise-induced cardiovascular effects in the general population. We also explain, in detail, the potential effects of noise on alterations of gene networks, epigenetic pathways, gut microbiota, circadian rhythm, signal transduction along the neuronal-cardiovascular axis, oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolism. Lastly, we describe current and future noise-mitigation strategies and evaluate the status of the existing evidence on noise as a cardiovascular risk factor."
"33788613","Effect of Epidermal Growth Factor Treatment and Polychlorinated Biphenyl Exposure in a Dietary-Exposure Mouse Model of Steatohepatitis.","Environ Health Perspect","Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are signaling disrupting chemicals that exacerbate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in mice. They are epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors that enhance hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in mice.This study tested the hypothesis that epidermal growth factor (EGF) administration can attenuate PCB-related NASH by increasing hepatic EGFR signaling in a mouse model.C57BL/6 male mice were fed a 42% milk fat diet and exposed to Aroclor 1260 (20mg/kg) or vehicle for 12 wk. EGF (0.2μg/g) or vehicle were administered daily for 10 d starting at study week 10. Liver and metabolic phenotyping were performed. The EGF dose was selected based on results of an acute dose-finding study (30 min treatment of EGF at 0.2, 0.02,0.002μg/gof via intraperitoneal injection). Hepatic phosphoproteomic analysis was performed using liver tissue from this acute study to understand EGFR's role in liver physiology.Markers of EGFR signaling were higher in EGF-treated mice.EGF+PCB-exposed mice had lower hepatic free fatty acids, inflammation, and fibrosis relative to PCB-only exposed mice. EGF-treated mice had higher plasma lipids, with no improvement in hepatic steatosis, and an association with higher LXR target gene expression andde novolipogenesis. EGF-treated mice showed more severe hyperglycemia associated with lower adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivity. EGF-treated mice had higher hepaticHNF4α, NRF2, and AhR target gene expression but lower constitutive androstane receptor and farnesoid X receptor target gene expression. The hepatic EGF-sensitive phosphoproteome demonstrated a role for EGFR signaling in liver homeostasis.These results validated EGFR inhibition as a causal mode of action for PCB-related hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in a mouse model of NASH. However, observed adverse effects may limit the clinical translation of EGF therapy. More data are required to better understand EGFR's underinvestigated roles in liver and environmental health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8222."
"33803924","An AI-Powered Blood Test to Detect Cancer Using NanoDSF.","Cancers (Basel)","Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor. Its diagnosis is based on resection or biopsy that could be especially difficult and dangerous in the case of deep location or patient comorbidities. Monitoring disease evolution and progression also requires repeated biopsies that are often not feasible. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop biomarkers to diagnose and follow glioblastoma evolution in a minimally invasive way. In the present study, we described a novel cancer detection method based on plasma denaturation profiles obtained by a non-conventional use of differential scanning fluorimetry. Using blood samples from 84 glioma patients and 63 healthy controls, we showed that their denaturation profiles can be automatically distinguished with the help of machine learning algorithms with 92% accuracy. Proposed high throughput workflow can be applied to any type of cancer and could become a powerful pan-cancer diagnostic and monitoring tool requiring only a simple blood test."
"33757599","Coping with brain amyloid: genetic heterogeneity and cognitive resilience to Alzheimer's pathophysiology.","Acta Neuropathol Commun","Although abnormal accumulation of amyloid in the brain is an early biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD), wide variation in cognitive trajectories during life can be seen in the setting of brain amyloidosis, ranging from maintenance of normal function to progression to dementia. It is widely presumed that cognitive resilience (i.e., coping) to amyloidosis may be influenced by environmental, lifestyle, and inherited factors, but relatively little in specifics is known about this architecture. Here, we leveraged multimodal longitudinal data from a large, population-based sample of older adults to discover genetic factors associated with differential cognitive resilience to brain amyloidosis determined by positron emission tomography (PET). Among amyloid-PET positive older adults, the AD risk allele APOE ɛ4 was associated with worse longitudinal memory trajectories as expected, and was thus covaried in the main analyses. Through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), we uncovered a novel association with cognitive resilience on chromosome 8 at the MTMR7/CNOT7/ZDHHC2/VPS37A locus (p = 4.66 × 10-8, β = 0.23), and demonstrated replication in an independent cohort. Post-hoc analyses confirmed this association as specific to the setting of elevated amyloid burden and not explained by differences in tau deposition or cerebrovascular disease. Complementary gene-based analyses and publically available functional data suggested that the causative variant at this locus may tag CNOT7 (CCR4-NOT Transcription Complex Subunit 7), a gene linked to synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Pathways related to cell adhesion and immune system activation displayed enrichment of association in the GWAS. Our findings, resulting from a unique study design, support the hypothesis that genetic heterogeneity is one of the factors that explains differential cognitive resilience to brain amyloidosis. Further characterization of the underlying biological mechanisms influencing cognitive resilience may facilitate improved prognostic counseling, therapeutic application, and trial enrollment in AD."

ABO transcription is known to be regulated by a constitutive promoter in a CpG island and regions for regulation of cell-specific expression such as the downstream + 22.6-kb site for epithelial cells and a site in intron 1 for erythroid cells. Here we investigated whether the + 22.6-kb site might play a role in transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding odorant binding protein 2B (OBP2B), which is located on the centromere side 43.4 kb from the + 22.6-kb site. In the gastric cancer cell line KATOIII, quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated significantly reduced amounts of OBP2B and ABO transcripts in mutant cells with biallelic deletions of the site created using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, relative to those in the wild-type cells, and Western blotting demonstrated a corresponding reduction of OBP2B protein in the mutant cells. Moreover, single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization assays indicated that the amounts of both transcripts were correlated in individual cells. These findings suggest that OBP2B could be co-regulated by the + 22.6-kb site of ABO."
"33767413","Genome folding through loop extrusion by SMC complexes.","Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol","Genomic DNA is folded into loops and topologically associating domains (TADs), which serve important structural and regulatory roles. It has been proposed that these genomic structures are formed by a loop extrusion process, which is mediated by structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes. Recent single-molecule studies have shown that the SMC complexes condensin and cohesin are indeed able to extrude DNA into loops. In this Review, we discuss how the loop extrusion hypothesis can explain key features of genome architecture; cellular functions of loop extrusion, such as separation of replicated DNA molecules, facilitation of enhancer-promoter interactions and immunoglobulin gene recombination; and what is known about the mechanism of loop extrusion and its regulation, for example, by chromatin boundaries that depend on the DNA binding protein CTCF. We also discuss how the loop extrusion hypothesis has led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of both genome architecture and the functions of SMC complexes."

"33767702","Cancer Immune Evasion Through Loss of MHC Class I Antigen Presentation.","Front Immunol","Major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules bind peptides derived from a cell's expressed genes and then transport and display this antigenic information on the cell surface. This allows CD8 T cells to identify pathological cells that are synthesizing abnormal proteins, such as cancers that are expressing mutated proteins. In order for many cancers to arise and progress, they need to evolve mechanisms to avoid elimination by CD8 T cells. MHC I molecules are not essential for cell survival and therefore one mechanism by which cancers can evade immune control is by losing MHC I antigen presentation machinery (APM). Not only will this impair the ability of natural immune responses to control cancers, but also frustrate immunotherapies that work by re-invigorating anti-tumor CD8 T cells, such as checkpoint blockade. Here we review the evidence that loss of MHC I antigen presentation is a frequent occurrence in many cancers. We discuss new insights into some common underlying mechanisms through which some cancers inactivate the MHC I pathway and consider some possible strategies to overcome this limitation in ways that could restore immune control of tumors and improve immunotherapy.Copyright © 2021 Dhatchinamoorthy, Colbert and Rock."

By applying an exploratory proteomics approach in the prospective FARMFLORA birth cohort, we sought to identify previously unknown circulating proteins in early life that associate to protection or risk for development of allergy up to 8 years of age.We analyzed plasma prepared from umbilical cord blood (n = 38) and blood collected at 1 month (n = 42), 4 months (n = 39), 18 months (n = 42), 36 months (n = 42) and 8 years (n = 44) of age. We profiled 230 proteins with a multiplexed assay and evaluated the global structure of the data with principal component analysis (PCA). Protein profiles informative to allergic disease at 18 months, 36 months and/or 8 years were evaluated using Lasso logistic regression and random forest.Two clusters emerged in the PCA analysis that separated samples obtained at birth and at 1 month of age from samples obtained later. Differences between the clusters were mostly driven by abundant plasma proteins. For the prediction of allergy, both Lasso logistic regression and random forest were most informative with samples collected at 1 month of age. A Lasso model with 27 proteins together with farm environment differentiated children who remained healthy from those developing allergy. This protein panel was primarily composed of antigen-presenting MHC class I molecules, interleukins and chemokines.Sampled at one month of age, circulating proteins that reflect processes of the immune system may predict the development of allergic disease later in childhood."

Immunoblot assays were performed to assess the expression levels of POU2F2 in human lung cancer tissues and cell lines. CCK-8, colony formation, and transwell-migration/invasion assays were conducted to detect the effects of POU2F2 and AGO1 on the proliferaion and motility of A549 and H1299 cells in vitro.

A tumor xenotransplantation model was used to detect the effects of POU2F2 on tumor growth in vivo.We found POU2F2 was highly expressed in human lung cancer tissues and cell lines, and associated with the lung cancer patients' prognosis and clinical features. POU2F2 promoted the proliferation, and motility of lung cancer cells via targeting AGO1 in vitro. Additionally, POU2F2 promoted tumor growth of lung cancer cells via AGO1 in vivo.We found POU2F2 was highly expressed in lung cancer cells and confirmed the involvement of POU2F2 in lung cancer progression, and thought POU2F2 could act as a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer."
"33777002","<i>In Vitro</i> Culture Expansion Shifts the Immune Phenotype of Human Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells.","Front Immunol","Human mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (hMSCs) are known for their potential in regenerative medicine due to their differentiation abilities, secretion of trophic factors, and regulation of immune responses in damaged tissues. Due to the limited quantity of hMSCs typically isolated from bone marrow, other tissue sources, such as adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs), are considered a promising alternative. However, differences have been observed for hASCs in the context of metabolic characteristics and response toin vitroculture stress compared to bone marrow derived hMSCs (BM-hMSCs). In particular, the relationship between metabolic homeostasis and stem cell functions, especially the immune phenotype and immunomodulation of hASCs, remains unknown. This study thoroughly assessed the changes in metabolism, redox cycles, and immune phenotype of hASCs duringin vitroexpansion. In contrast to BM-hMSCs, hASCs did not respond to culture stress significantly during expansion as limited cellular senescence was observed. Notably, hASCs exhibited the increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the decreased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines after extended culture expansion. The NAD+/NADH redox cycle and other metabolic characteristics associated with aging were relatively stable, indicating that hASC functional decline may be regulated through an alternative mechanism rather than NAD+/Sirtuin aging pathways as observed in BM-hMSCs. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis by mRNA-sequencing revealed the upregulation of genes for pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and the downregulation of genes for anti-inflammatory cytokines for hASCs at high passage. Proteomics analysis indicated key pathways (e.g., tRNA charging, EIF2 signaling, protein ubiquitination pathway) that may be associated with the immune phenotype shift of hASCs. Together, this study advances our understanding of the metabolism and senescence of hASCs and may offer vital insights for the biomanufacturing of hASCs for clinical use.Copyright © 2021 Jeske, Yuan, Fu, Bunnell, Logan and Li."

We conducted a miRNA-seq study to identify miRNAs associated with AD in the post-mortem brain from the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG,n= 69) and superior temporal gyrus (STG,n= 81). Four and 64 miRNAs were differentially expressed (adjustedp-value < 0.05) in AD compared to cognitively normal controls in the IFG and STG, respectively. We observed down-regulation of several miRNAs that have previously been implicated in AD, including hsa-miR-212-5p and hsa-miR-132-5p, in AD samples across both brain regions, and up-regulation of hsa-miR-146a-5p, hsa-miR-501-3p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, and hsa-miR-454-3p in the STG. The differentially expressed miRNAs were previously implicated in the formation of amyloid-β plaques, the dysregulation of tau, and inflammation. We have also observed differential expressions for dozens of other miRNAs in the STG, including hsa-miR-4446-3p, that have not been described previously. Putative targets of these miRNAs (adjustedp-value < 0.1) were found to be involved in Wnt signaling pathway, MAPK family signaling cascades, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) pathway, adaptive immune system, innate immune system, and neurogenesis. Our results support the finding of dysregulated miRNAs previously implicated in AD and propose additional miRNAs that appear to be dysregulated in AD for experimental follow-up.Copyright © 2021 Li and Cai."

Recent advances have allowed paired capture of protein abundance and transcriptomic state, but a lack of epigenetic information in these assays has left a missing link to gene regulation. Using the heterogeneous mixture of cells in human peripheral blood as a test case, we developed a novel scATAC-seq workflow that increases signal-to-noise and allows paired measurement of cell surface markers and chromatin accessibility: integrated cellular indexing of chromatin landscape and epitopes, called ICICLE-seq. We extended this approach using a droplet-based multiomics platform to develop a trimodal assay that simultaneously measures transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), epitopes, and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) from thousands of single cells, which we term TEA-seq. Together, these multimodal single-cell assays provide a novel toolkit to identify type-specific gene regulation and expression grounded in phenotypically defined cell types.© 2021, Swanson et al."
"33767446","Neuronal enhancers are hotspots for DNA single-strand break repair.","Nature","Defects in DNA repair frequently lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the particular importance of DNA repair in long-lived post-mitotic neurons1,2. The cellular genome is subjected to a constant barrage of endogenous DNA damage, but surprisingly little is known about the identity of the lesion(s) that accumulate in neurons and whether they accrue throughout the genome or at specific loci. Here we show that post-mitotic neurons accumulate unexpectedly high levels of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) at specific sites within the genome. Genome-wide mapping reveals that SSBs are located within enhancers at or near CpG dinucleotides and sites of DNA demethylation. These SSBs are repaired by PARP1 and XRCC1-dependent mechanisms. Notably, deficiencies in XRCC1-dependent short-patch repair increase DNA repair synthesis at neuronal enhancers, whereas defects in long-patch repair reduce synthesis. The high levels of SSB repair in neuronal enhancers are therefore likely to be sustained by both short-patch and long-patch processes. These data provide the first evidence of site- and cell type-specific SSB repair, revealing unexpected levels of localized and continuous DNA breakage in neurons. In addition, they suggest an explanation for the neurodegenerative phenotypes that occur in patients with defective SSB repair."

"33763068","Targeting the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Signaling Pathway in Breast Cancer Development.","Front Immunol","Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) through environmental exposure to known human carcinogens including dioxins can lead to the promotion of breast cancer. While the repressor protein of the AhR (AhRR) blocks the canonical AhR pathway, the function of AhRR in the development of breast cancer is not well-known. In the current study we examined the impact of suppressing AhR activity using its dedicated repressor protein AhRR. AhRR is a putative tumor suppressor and is silenced in several cancer types, including breast, where its loss correlates with shorter patient survival. Using the AhRR transgenic mouse, we demonstrate that AhRR overexpression opposes AhR-driven and inflammation-induced growth of mammary tumors in two different murine models of breast cancer. These include a syngeneic model using E0771 mammary tumor cells as well as the Polyoma Middle T antigen (PyMT) transgenic model. Further AhRR overexpression or knockout of AhR in human breast cancer cells enhanced apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutics and inhibited the growth of mouse mammary tumor cells. This study provides the firstin vivoevidence that AhRR suppresses mammary tumor development and suggests that strategies which lead to its functional restoration and expression may have therapeutic benefit.Copyright © 2021 Vogel, Lazennec, Kado, Dahlem, He, Castaneda, Ishihara, Vogeley, Rossi, Haarmann-Stemmann, Jugan, Mori, Borowsky, La Merrill and Sweeney."

However, the vertical transmission of COVID-19 is uncertain.This is a systematic review of published studies concerning pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 and their neonates.We carried out a systematic search in multiple databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, and WHO COVID-19 database using the following keywords: (Coronavirus) OR (novel coronavirus) OR (COVID-19) OR (COVID19) OR (COVID 19) OR (SARS-CoV2) OR (2019-nCoV)) and ((pregnancy) OR (pregnant) OR (vertical transmission) OR (neonate) OR (newborn) OR (placenta) OR (fetus) OR (Fetal)). The search took place in April 2020.Original articles published in English were eligible if they included pregnant patients infected with COVID-19 and their newborns.The outcomes of interest consisted of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant patients with COVID-19 and also the effect of COVID-19 on neonatal and pregnancy outcomes.37 articles involving 364 pregnant women with COVID-19 and 302 neonates were included. The vast majority of pregnant patients were in their third trimester of pregnancy, and only 45 cases were in the first or second trimester (12.4%). Most mothers described mild to moderate manifestations of COVID-19. Of 364 pregnant women, 25 were asymptomatic at the time of admission. The most common symptoms were fever (62.4%) and cough (45.3%). Two maternal deaths occurred. Some pregnant patients (12.1%) had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test but displayed clinical manifestations and abnormalities in computed tomography (CT) scan related to COVID-19. Twenty-two (6.0%) pregnant patients developed severe pneumonia. Two maternal deaths occurred from severe pneumonia and multiple organ dysfunction. Studies included a total of 302 neonates from mothers with COVID-19. Of the studies that provided data on the timing of birth, there were 65 (23.6%) preterm neonates. One baby was born dead from a mother who also died from COVID-19. Of the babies born alive from mothers with COVID-19, five newborns faced critical conditions, and two later died. A total of 219 neonates underwent nasopharyngeal specimen collection for SARS-CoV-2, of which 11 tested positive (5%). Seventeen studies examined samples of the placenta, breast milk, umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid, and all tested negative except one amniotic fluid sample.A systematic review of published studies confirm that the course of COVID-19 in pregnant women resembles that of other populations. However, there is not sufficient evidence to establish an idea that COVID-19 would not complicate pregnancy."

Here we use complementary long-read sequencing technologies to complete the linear assembly of human chromosome 8. Our assembly resolves the sequence of five previously long-standing gaps, including a 2.08-Mb centromeric α-satellite array, a 644-kb copy number polymorphism in the β-defensin gene cluster that is important for disease risk, and an 863-kb variable number tandem repeat at chromosome 8q21.2 that can function as a neocentromere. We show that the centromeric α-satellite array is generally methylated except for a 73-kb hypomethylated region of diverse higher-order α-satellites enriched with CENP-A nucleosomes, consistent with the location of the kinetochore. In addition, we confirm the overall organization and methylation pattern of the centromere in a diploid human genome. Using a dual long-read sequencing approach, we complete high-quality draft assemblies of the orthologous centromere from chromosome 8 in chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque to reconstruct its evolutionary history. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses show that the higher-order α-satellite structure evolved in the great ape ancestor with a layered symmetry, in which more ancient higher-order repeats locate peripherally to monomeric α-satellites. We estimate that the mutation rate of centromeric satellite DNA is accelerated by more than 2.2-fold compared to the unique portions of the genome, and this acceleration extends into the flanking sequence."

It is considered that there are multiple PD etiological subtypes, some of which could be predicted by genetics. The characterization and prediction of these distinct molecular entities provides a growing opportunity to use individualized management and personalized therapies. Dissecting the genetic architecture of PD is a critical step in identifying therapeutic targets, and genetics represents a step forward to sub-categorize and predict PD risk and progression. A better understanding and separation of genetic subtypes has immediate implications in clinical trial design by unraveling the different flavors of clinical presentation and development. Personalized medicine is a nascent area of research and represents a paramount challenge in the treatment and cure of PD. This manuscript summarizes the current state of precision medicine in the PD field and discusses how genetics has become the engine to gain insights into disease during our constant effort to develop potential etiological based interventions."

Molecular or genetic factors contribute to disease heterogeneity, but the reasons for different outcomes are poorly understood. Transcriptome studies of tissue biopsies from CD patients are scarce. Here, we present a high-resolution analysis of the transcriptomes extracted from duodenal biopsies of 24 children and adolescents with active CD and 21 individuals without CD but with intestinal afflictions as controls. The transcriptomes of CD patients divide into three groups-a mixed group presenting the control cases, and CD-low and CD-high groups referring to lower and higher levels of CD severity. Persistence of symptoms was weakly associated with subgroup, but the highest marsh stages were present in subgroup CD-high, together with the highest cell cycle rates as an indicator of virtually complete villous atrophy. Considerable variation in inflammation-level between subgroups was further deciphered into immune cell types using cell type de-convolution. Self-organizing maps portrayal was applied to provide high-resolution landscapes of the CD-transcriptome. We find asymmetric patterns of miRNA and long non-coding RNA and discuss the effect of epigenetic regulation. Expression of genes involved in interferon gamma signaling represent suitable markers to distinguish CD from non-CD cases. Multiple pathways overlay in CD biopsies in different ways, giving rise to heterogeneous transcriptional patterns, which potentially provide information about etiology and the course of the disease."
