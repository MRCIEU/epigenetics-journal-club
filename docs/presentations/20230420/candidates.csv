",Large-scale correlation network construction for unraveling the coordination of complex biological systems.,Nat Comput Sci,"Advanced measurement and data storage technologies have enabled high-dimensional profiling of complex biological systems. For this, modern multiomics studies regularly produce datasets with hundreds of thousands of measurements per sample, enabling a new era of precision medicine. Correlation analysis is an important first step to gain deeper insights into the coordination and underlying processes of such complex systems. However, the construction of large correlation networks in modern high-dimensional datasets remains a major computational challenge owing to rapidly growing runtime and memory requirements. Here we address this challenge by introducing CorALS (Correlation Analysis of Large-scale (biological) Systems), an open-source framework for the construction and analysis of large-scale parametric as well as non-parametric correlation networks for high-dimensional biological data. It features off-the-shelf algorithms suitable for both personal and high-performance computers, enabling workflows and downstream analysis approaches. We illustrate the broad scope and potential of CorALS by exploring perspectives on complex biological processes in large-scale multiomics and single-cell studies."

Age acceleration in different epigenetic clocks can serve as biomarker for such risk and could help to disentangle the interplay of psychiatric comorbidity and early adversity on age-related diseases and mortality. We evaluated five epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge and DunedinPoAm) in a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample using epigenome-wide DNA methylation data from peripheral blood of 429 subjects from two studies at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry. Burden of psychiatric disease, represented by a weighted score, was significantly associated with biological age acceleration as measured by GrimAge and DunedinPoAm (R2-adj. 0.22 and 0.33 for GrimAge and DunedinPoAm, respectively), but not the other investigated clocks. The relation of burden of psychiatric disease appeared independent of differences in socioeconomic status and medication. Our findings indicate that increased burden of psychiatric disease may associate with accelerated biological aging. This highlights the importance of medical management of patients with multiple psychiatric comorbidities and the potential usefulness of specific epigenetic clocks for early detection of risk and targeted intervention to reduce mortality in psychiatric patients.© 2023.

,Yes,20230427,ewas,37062770,Exploring the mediation of DNA methylation across the epigenome between childhood adversity and First Episode of Psychosis-findings from the EU-GEI study.,Mol Psychiatry,"Studies conducted in psychotic disorders have shown that DNA-methylation (DNAm) is sensitive to the impact of Childhood Adversity (CA). However, whether it mediates the association between CA and psychosis is yet to be explored. Epigenome wide association studies (EWAS) using the Illumina Infinium-Methylation EPIC array in peripheral blood tissue from 366 First-episode of psychosis and 517 healthy controls was performed. Adversity scores were created for abuse, neglect and composite adversity with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Regressions examining (I) CTQ scores with psychosis; (II) with DNAm EWAS level and (III) between DNAm and caseness, adjusted for a variety of confounders were conducted. Divide-Aggregate Composite-null Test for the composite null-hypothesis of no mediation effect was conducted. Enrichment analyses were conducted with missMethyl package and the KEGG database. Our results show that CA was associated with psychosis (Composite: OR = 1.68; p = <0.001; abuse: OR = 2.16; p < 0.001; neglect: OR = 2.27; p = <0.001). None of the CpG sites significantly mediated the adversity-psychosis association after Bonferroni correction (p < 8.1 × 10-8). However, 28, 34 and 29 differentially methylated probes associated with 21, 27, 20 genes passed a less stringent discovery threshold (p < 5 × 10-5) for composite, abuse and neglect respectively, with a lack of overlap between abuse and neglect. These included genes previously associated to psychosis in EWAS studies, such as PANK1, SPEG TBKBP1, TSNARE1 or H2R. Downstream gene ontology analyses did not reveal any biological pathways that survived false discovery rate correction. Although at a non-significant level, DNAm changes in genes previously associated with schizophrenia in EWAS studies may mediate the CA-psychosis association. These results and associated involved processes such as mitochondrial or histaminergic disfunction, immunity or neural signalling requires replication in well powered samples. The lack of overlap between mediating genes associated with abuse and neglect suggests differential biological trajectories linking CA subtypes and psychosis.© 2023.

,No,20230427,dnamage,37058531,Cross-national and cross-generational evidence that educational attainment may slow the pace of aging in European-descent individuals.,J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci,"Individuals with more education are at lower risk of developing multiple, different age-related diseases than their less educated peers. A reason for this might be that individuals with more education age slower. There are two complications in testing this hypothesis. First, there exists no definitive measure of biological aging. Second, shared genetic factors contribute towards both lower educational attainment and the development of age-related diseases. Here, we tested whether the protective effect of educational attainment was associated with the pace of aging after accounting for genetic factors.We examined data from five studies together totaling almost 17,000 individuals with European ancestry born in different countries during different historical periods, ranging in age from 16 to 98 years old. To assess the pace of aging, we used DunedinPACE, a DNA methylation algorithm that reflects an individual's rate of aging and predicts age-related decline and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD). To assess genetic factors related to education we created a polygenic score (PGS) based on results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment.Across the five studies, and across the lifespan, higher educational attainment was associated with a slower pace of aging even after accounting for genetic factors (meta-analysis effect size=-0.20, 95%CI[-0.30- -0.10]; p-value = 0.006). Further, this effect persisted after taking into account tobacco smoking (meta-analysis effect size=-0.13, 95%CI[-0.21- -0.05]; p-value = 0.01).These results indicate that higher levels of education have positive effects on the pace of aging, and that the benefits can be realized irrespective of individuals' genetics.© The Author(s) 2023.

,No,20230427,dnamage,37031184,Effects of epigenetic age acceleration on kidney function: a Mendelian randomization study.,Clin Epigenetics,"Previous studies have reported cross-sectional associations between measures of epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) and kidney function phenotypes. However, the temporal and potentially causal relationships between these variables remain unclear. We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study of EAA and kidney function. Genetic instruments for EAA and estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were identified from previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses of European-ancestry participants. Causal effects of EAA on kidney function and kidney function on EAA were assessed through summary-based Mendelian randomization utilizing data from the CKDGen GWAS meta-analysis of log-transformed estimated glomerular filtration rate (log-eGFR; n = 5,67,460) and GWAS meta-analyses of EAA (n = 34,710). An allele score-based Mendelian randomization leveraging individual-level data from UK Biobank participants (n = 4,33,462) further examined the effects of EAA on kidney function.Using summary-based Mendelian randomization, we found that each 5 year increase in intrinsic EAA (IEAA) and GrimAge acceleration (GrimAA) was associated with - 0.01 and - 0.02 unit decreases in log-eGFR, respectively (P = 0.02 and P = 0.09, respectively), findings which were strongly supported by allele-based Mendelian randomization study (both P < 0.001). Summary-based Mendelian randomization identified 24% increased odds of CKD with each 5-unit increase in IEAA (P = 0.05), with consistent findings observed in allele score-based analysis (P = 0.07). Reverse-direction Mendelian randomization identified potentially causal effects of decreased kidney function on HannumAge acceleration (HannumAA), GrimAA, and PhenoAge acceleration (PhenoAA), conferring 3.14, 1.99, and 2.88 year decreases in HanumAA, GrimAA, and PhenoAA, respectively (P = 0.003, 0.05, and 0.002, respectively) with each 1-unit increase in log-eGFR.This study supports bidirectional causal relationships between EAA and kidney function, pointing to potential prevention and therapeutic strategies.© 2023.

,Yes,20230427,ewas,37029435,Impact of intrauterine exposure to maternal diabetes on preterm birth: fetal DNA methylation alteration is an important mediator.,Clin Epigenetics,"In utero exposure to diabetes has been shown to contribute to preterm birth, though the underlying biological mechanisms are yet to be fully elucidated. Fetal epigenetic variations established in utero may be a possible pathway. This study aimed to investigate whether in utero exposure to diabetes was associated with a change in newborn DNA methylation, and whether the identified CpG sites mediate the association between diabetes and preterm birth in a racially diverse birth cohort population.This study included 954 mother-newborn pairs. Methylation levels in the cord blood were determined using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850 K array platform. In utero exposure to diabetes was defined by the presence of maternal pregestational or gestational diabetes. Preterm birth was defined as gestational age at birth less than 37 weeks. Linear regression analysis was employed to identify differentially methylated CpG sites. Differentially methylated regions were identified using the DMRcate Package.126 (13%) newborns were born to mothers with diabetes in pregnancy and 173 (18%) newborns were born preterm, while 41 newborns were born both preterm and to mothers with diabetes in pregnancy. Genomic-wide CpG analysis found that eighteen CpG sites in cord blood were differentially methylated by maternal diabetes status at an FDR threshold of 5%. These significant CpG sites were mapped to 12 known genes, one of which was annotated to gene Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II, DM Beta (HLA-DMB). Consistently, one of the two identified significant methylated regions overlapped with HLA-DMB. The identified differentially methylated CpG sites mediated the association between diabetes in pregnancy and preterm birth by 61%.In this US birth cohort, we found that maternal diabetes was associated with altered fetal DNA methylation patterns, which substantially explained the link between diabetes and preterm birth.© 2023.

Sarah,No,20230427,dnamage,37027157,Association of Race and Poverty Status With DNA Methylation-Based Age.,JAMA Netw Open,"The Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated From the Epigenome (DunedinPACE) measure is a newly constructed DNA methylation (DNAm) biomarker associated with morbidity, mortality, and adverse childhood experiences in several cohorts with European ancestry. However, there are few studies of the DunedinPACE measure among socioeconomically and racially diverse cohorts with longitudinal assessments.To investigate the association of race and poverty status with DunedinPACE scores in a socioeconomically diverse middle-aged cohort of African American and White participants.This longitudinal cohort study used data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. HANDLS is a population-based study of socioeconomically diverse African American and White adults aged 30 to 64 years at baseline in Baltimore, Maryland, with follow-up approximately every 5 years. The current study was restricted to 470 participants with blood samples at 2 time points: August 14, 2004, to June 22, 2009 (visit 1), and June 23, 2009, to September 12, 2017 (visit 2). Genome-wide DNAm was assessed at visit 1 (chronological age, 30-64 years) and visit 2. Data were analyzed from March 18, 2022, to February 9, 2023.DunedinPACE scores were estimated for each participant at 2 visits. DunedinPACE scores are values scaled to a mean of 1, interpretable with reference to a rate of 1 year of biological aging per 1 year of chronological aging. Linear mixed-model regression analysis was used to examine the trajectories of DunedinPACE scores by chronological age, race, sex, and poverty status.Among 470 participants, the mean (SD) chronological age at visit 1 was 48.7 (8.7) years. Participants were balanced by sex (238 [50.6%] were men and 232 [49.4%] were women), race (237 [50.4%] African American and 233 [49.6%] White), and poverty status (236 [50.2%] living below poverty level and 234 [49.8%] living above poverty level). The mean (SD) time between visits was 5.1 (1.5) years. Overall, the mean (SD) DunedinPACE score was 1.07 (0.14), representing a 7% faster pace of biological aging than chronological aging. Linear mixed-effects regression analysis revealed an association between the 2-way interaction between race and poverty status (White race and household income below poverty level: β = 0.0665; 95% CI, 0.0298-0.1031; P < .001) and significantly higher DunedinPACE scores and an association between quadratic age (age squared: β = -0.0113; 95% CI, -0.0212 to -0.0013; P = .03) and significantly higher DunedinPACE scores.In this cohort study, household income below poverty level and African American race were associated with higher DunedinPACE scores. These findings suggest that the DunedinPACE biomarker varies with race and poverty status as adverse social determinants of health. Consequently, measures of accelerated aging should be based on representative samples."
Sarah,No,20230427,dnamage,37046280,DNA methylation age at birth and childhood: performance of epigenetic clocks and characteristics associated with epigenetic age acceleration in the Project Viva cohort.,Clin Epigenetics,"Epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) and epigenetic gestational age acceleration (EGAA) are biomarkers of physiological development and may be affected by the perinatal environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate performance of epigenetic clocks and to identify biological and sociodemographic correlates of EGAA and EAA at birth and in childhood. In the Project Viva pre-birth cohort, DNA methylation was measured in nucleated cells in cord blood (leukocytes and nucleated red blood cells, N = 485) and leukocytes in early (N = 120, median age = 3.2 years) and mid-childhood (N = 460, median age = 7.7 years). We calculated epigenetic gestational age (EGA; Bohlin and Knight clocks) and epigenetic age (EA; Horvath and skin & blood clocks), and respective measures of EGAA and EAA. We evaluated the performance of clocks relative to chronological age using correlations and median absolute error. We tested for associations of maternal-child characteristics with EGAA and EAA using mutually adjusted linear models controlling for estimated cell type proportions. We also tested associations of Horvath EA at birth with childhood EAA.Bohlin EGA was strongly correlated with chronological gestational age (Bohlin EGA r = 0.82, p < 0.001). Horvath and skin & blood EA were weakly correlated with gestational age, but moderately correlated with chronological age in childhood (r = 0.45-0.65). Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with higher skin & blood EAA at birth [B (95% CI) = 1.17 weeks (- 0.09, 2.42)] and in early childhood [0.34 years (0.03, 0.64)]. Female newborns and children had lower Bohlin EGAA [- 0.17 weeks (- 0.30, - 0.04)] and Horvath EAA at birth [B (95% CI) = - 2.88 weeks (- 4.41, - 1.35)] and in childhood [early childhood: - 0.3 years (- 0.60, 0.01); mid-childhood: - 0.48 years (- 0.77, - 0.18)] than males. When comparing self-reported Asian, Black, Hispanic, and more than one race or other racial/ethnic groups to White, we identified significant differences in EGAA and EAA at birth and in mid-childhood, but associations varied across clocks. Horvath EA at birth was positively associated with childhood Horvath and skin & blood EAA.Maternal smoking during pregnancy and child sex were associated with EGAA and EAA at multiple timepoints. Further research may provide insight into the relationship between perinatal factors, pediatric epigenetic aging, and health and development across the lifespan.© 2023. The Author(s)."
?,Yes,20230427,ewas,37038196,Distinct CSF biomarker-associated DNA methylation in Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal subjects.,Alzheimers Res Ther,"Growing evidence has demonstrated that DNA methylation (DNAm) plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that DNAm differences can be detected in the blood of AD subjects. Most studies have correlated blood DNAm with the clinical diagnosis of AD in living individuals. However, as the pathophysiological process of AD can begin many years before the onset of clinical symptoms, there is often disagreement between neuropathology in the brain and clinical phenotypes. Therefore, blood DNAm associated with AD neuropathology, rather than with clinical data, would provide more relevant information on AD pathogenesis.We performed a comprehensive analysis to identify blood DNAm associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathological biomarkers for AD. Our study included matched samples of whole blood DNA methylation, CSF Aβ42, phosphorylated tau181(pTau181), and total tau (tTau) biomarkers data, measured on the same subjects and at the same clinical visits from a total of 202 subjects (123 CN or cognitively normal, 79 AD) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. To validate our findings, we also examined the association between premortem blood DNAm and postmortem brain neuropathology measured on a group of 69 subjects in the London dataset.We identified a number of novel associations between blood DNAm and CSF biomarkers, demonstrating that changes in pathological processes in the CSF are reflected in the blood epigenome. Overall, the CSF biomarker-associated DNAm is relatively distinct in CN and AD subjects, highlighting the importance of analyzing omics data measured on cognitively normal subjects (which includes preclinical AD subjects) to identify diagnostic biomarkers, and considering disease stages in the development and testing of AD treatment strategies. Moreover, our analysis revealed biological processes associated with early brain impairment relevant to AD are marked by DNAm in the blood, and blood DNAm at several CpGs in the DMR on HOXA5 gene are associated with pTau181in the CSF, as well as tau-pathology and DNAm in the brain, nominating DNAm at this locus as a promising candidate AD biomarker.Our study provides a valuable resource for future mechanistic and biomarker studies of DNAm in AD.© 2023.

,No,20230427,sperm,37059740,Emerging evidence that the mammalian sperm epigenome serves as a template for embryo development.,Nat Commun,"Although more studies are demonstrating that a father's environment can influence child health and disease, the molecular mechanisms underlying non-genetic inheritance remain unclear. It was previously thought that sperm exclusively contributed its genome to the egg. More recently, association studies have shown that various environmental exposures including poor diet, toxicants, and stress, perturbed epigenetic marks in sperm at important reproductive and developmental loci that were associated with offspring phenotypes. The molecular and cellular routes that underlie how epigenetic marks are transmitted at fertilization, to resist epigenetic reprogramming in the embryo, and drive phenotypic changes are only now beginning to be unraveled. Here, we provide an overview of the state of the field of intergenerational paternal epigenetic inheritance in mammals and present new insights into the relationship between embryo development and the three pillars of epigenetic inheritance: chromatin, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs. We evaluate compelling evidence of sperm-mediated transmission and retention of paternal epigenetic marks in the embryo. Using landmark examples, we discuss how sperm-inherited regions may escape reprogramming to impact development via mechanisms that implicate transcription factors, chromatin organization, and transposable elements. Finally, we link paternally transmitted epigenetic marks to functional changes in the pre- and post-implantation embryo. Understanding how sperm-inherited epigenetic factors influence embryo development will permit a greater understanding related to the developmental origins of health and disease.© 2023.

,No,20230427,methods,37072822,The ENCODE Imputation Challenge: a critical assessment of methods for cross-cell type imputation of epigenomic profiles.,Genome Biol,"A promising alternative to comprehensively performing genomics experiments is to, instead, perform a subset of experiments and use computational methods to impute the remainder. However, identifying the best imputation methods and what measures meaningfully evaluate performance are open questions. We address these questions by comprehensively analyzing 23 methods from the ENCODE Imputation Challenge. We find that imputation evaluations are challenging and confounded by distributional shifts from differences in data collection and processing over time, the amount of available data, and redundancy among performance measures. Our analyses suggest simple steps for overcoming these issues and promising directions for more robust research.© 2023. The Author(s)."
Scott,No,20230427,dnamage,36811674,DNA methylation-based age estimation for adults and minors: considering sex-specific differences and non-linear correlations.,Int J Legal Med,"DNA methylation patterns change during human lifetime; thus, they can be used to estimate an individual's age. It is known, however, that correlation between DNA methylation and aging might not be linear and that the sex might influence the methylation status. In this study, we conducted a comparative evaluation of linear and several non-linear regressions, as well as sex-specific versus unisex models. Buccal swab samples from 230 donors aged 1 to 88 years were analyzed using a minisequencing multiplex array. Samples were divided into a training set (n = 161) and a validation set (n = 69). The training set was used for a sequential replacement regression and a simultaneous 10-fold cross-validation. The resulting model was improved by including a cut-off of 20 years, dividing the younger individuals with non-linear from the older individuals with linear dependence between age and methylation status. Sex-specific models were developed and improved prediction accuracy in females but not in males, which might be explained by a small sample set. We finally established a non-linear, unisex model combining the markers EDARADD, KLF14, ELOVL2, FHL2, C1orf132, and TRIM59. While age- and sex-adjustments did not generally improve the performance of our model, we discuss how other models and large cohorts might benefit from such adjustments. Our model showed a cross-validated MAD and RMSE of 4.680 and 6.436 years in the training set and of 4.695 and 6.602 years in the validation set, respectively. We briefly explain how to apply the model for age prediction.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Sarah,No,20230427,dnamage,34951641,Associations Between Life-Course Socioeconomic Conditions and the Pace of Aging,J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,"Background: Socioeconomic disadvantage is a well-established predictor of morbidity and mortality, and is thought to accelerate the aging process. This study examined associations between life-course socioeconomic conditions and the Pace of Aging, a longitudinal measure of age-related physiological decline.

Methods: Data were drawn from a Swiss population-based cohort of individuals originally recruited between 2003 and 2006, and followed up for 11 years (2 834 women, 2 475 men aged 35-75 years [mean 52]). Pace of Aging was measured using 3 repeated assessments of 12 biomarkers reflecting multiple body systems. Analysis tested associations of socioeconomic conditions with physiological status at baseline and with the Pace of Aging.

Results: Participants with more life-course socioeconomic disadvantage were physiologically older at baseline and experienced faster Pace of Aging. Effect sizes (?) for associations of childhood socioeconomic disadvantage with baseline physiological status ranged from 0.1 to 0.2; for adulthood socioeconomic disadvantage, effect sizes ranged from 0.2 to 0.3. Effect sizes were smaller for associations with the Pace of Aging (<0.05 for childhood disadvantage, 0.05-0.1 for adulthood disadvantage). Those who experienced disadvantaged socioeconomic conditions from childhood to adulthood aged 10% faster over the 11 years of follow-up as compared with those who experienced consistently advantaged socioeconomic conditions. Covariate adjustment for health behaviors attenuated associations, but most remained statistically significant.

Conclusions: Socioeconomic inequalities contribute to a faster Pace of Aging, partly through differences in health behaviors. Intervention to slow aging in at-risk individuals is needed by midlife, before etiology of aging-related diseases become established."
Ryan,No,20230427,ctdna,37055640,Tracking early lung cancer metastatic dissemination in TRACERx using ctDNA.,Nature,"Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) can be used to detect and profile residual tumour cells persisting after curative intent therapy1. The study of large patient cohorts incorporating longitudinal plasma sampling and extended follow-up is required to determine the role of ctDNA as a phylogenetic biomarker of relapse in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we developed ctDNA methods tracking a median of 200 mutations identified in resected NSCLC tissue across 1,069 plasma samples collected from 197 patients enrolled in the TRACERx study2. A lack of preoperative ctDNA detection distinguished biologically indolent lung adenocarcinoma with good clinical outcome. Postoperative plasma analyses were interpreted within the context of standard-of-care radiological surveillance and administration of cytotoxic adjuvant therapy. Landmark analyses of plasma samples collected within 120 days after surgery revealed ctDNA detection in 25% of patients, including 49% of all patients who experienced clinical relapse; 3 to 6 monthly ctDNA surveillance identified impending disease relapse in an additional 20% of landmark-negative patients. We developed a bioinformatic tool (ECLIPSE) for non-invasive tracking of subclonal architecture at low ctDNA levels. ECLIPSE identified patients with polyclonal metastatic dissemination, which was associated with a poor clinical outcome. By measuring subclone cancer cell fractions in preoperative plasma, we found that subclones seeding future metastases were significantly more expanded compared with non-metastatic subclones. Our findings will support (neo)adjuvant trial advances and provide insights into the process of metastatic dissemination using low-ctDNA-level liquid biopsy.© 2023. The Author(s)."
?,No,20230427,aging,37046086,Ageing-associated changes in transcriptional elongation influence longevity,Nature,"Physiological homeostasis becomes compromised during ageing, as a result of impairment of cellular processes, including transcription and RNA splicing1-4. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of transcriptional fidelity are so far elusive, as are ways of preventing it. Here we profiled and analysed genome-wide, ageing-related changes in transcriptional processes across different organisms: nematodes, fruitflies, mice, rats and humans. The average transcriptional elongation speed (RNA polymerase II speed) increased with age in all five species. Along with these changes in elongation speed, we observed changes in splicing, including a reduction of unspliced transcripts and the formation of more circular RNAs. Two lifespan-extending interventions, dietary restriction and lowered insulin-IGF signalling, both reversed most of these ageing-related changes. Genetic variants in RNA polymerase II that reduced its speed in worms5 and flies6 increased their lifespan. Similarly, reducing the speed of RNA polymerase II by overexpressing histone components, to counter age-associated changes in nucleosome positioning, also extended lifespan in flies and the division potential of human cells. Our findings uncover fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying animal ageing and lifespan-extending interventions, and point to possible preventive measures."
?,No,20230427,methods,36747096,Simultaneous sequencing of genetic and epigenetic bases in DNA,Nat Biotechnol,"DNA comprises molecular information stored in genetic and epigenetic bases, both of which are vital to our understanding of biology. Most DNA sequencing approaches address either genetics or epigenetics and thus capture incomplete information. Methods widely used to detect epigenetic DNA bases fail to capture common C-to-T mutations or distinguish 5-methylcytosine from 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. We present a single base-resolution sequencing methodology that sequences complete genetics and the two most common cytosine modifications in a single workflow. DNA is copied and bases are enzymatically converted. Coupled decoding of bases across the original and copy strand provides a phased digital readout. Methods are demonstrated on human genomic DNA and cell-free DNA from a blood sample of a patient with cancer. The approach is accurate, requires low DNA input and has a simple workflow and analysis pipeline. Simultaneous, phased reading of genetic and epigenetic bases provides a more complete picture of the information stored in genomes and has applications throughout biomedicine."
