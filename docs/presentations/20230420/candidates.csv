"37071201","Transgressive and parental dominant gene expression and cytosine methylation during seed development in Brassica napus hybrids.","Theor Appl Genet","Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of gene expression and small RNAs during seed and seedling development reveals expression and methylation dominance levels with implications on early stage heterosis in oilseed rape. The enhanced performance of hybrids through heterosis remains a key aspect in plant breeding; however, the underlying mechanisms are still not fully elucidated. To investigate the potential role of transcriptomic and epigenomic patterns in early expression of hybrid vigor, we investigated gene expression, small RNA abundance and genome-wide methylation in hybrids from two distant Brassica napus ecotypes during seed and seedling developmental stages using next-generation sequencing. A total of 31117, 344, 36229 and 7399 differentially expressed genes, microRNAs, small interfering RNAs and differentially methylated regions were identified, respectively. Approximately 70% of the differentially expressed or methylated features displayed parental dominance levels where the hybrid followed the same patterns as the parents. Via gene ontology enrichment and microRNA-target association analyses during seed development, we found copies of reproductive, developmental and meiotic genes with transgressive and paternal dominance patterns. Interestingly, maternal dominance was more prominent in hypermethylated and downregulated features during seed formation, contrasting to the general maternal gamete demethylation reported during gametogenesis in angiosperms. Associations between methylation and gene expression allowed identification of putative epialleles with diverse pivotal biological functions during seed formation. Furthermore, most differentially methylated regions, differentially expressed siRNAs and transposable elements were in regions that flanked genes without differential expression. This suggests that differential expression and methylation of epigenomic features may help maintain expression of pivotal genes in a hybrid context. Differential expression and methylation patterns during seed formation in an F1hybrid provide novel insights into genes and mechanisms with potential roles in early heterosis.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37069357","Transdiagnostic evaluation of epigenetic age acceleration and burden of psychiatric disorders.","Neuropsychopharmacology","Different psychiatric disorders as well as exposure to adverse life events have individually been associated with multiple age-related diseases and mortality. Age acceleration in different epigenetic clocks can serve as biomarker for such risk and could help to disentangle the interplay of psychiatric comorbidity and early adversity on age-related diseases and mortality. We evaluated five epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge and DunedinPoAm) in a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample using epigenome-wide DNA methylation data from peripheral blood of 429 subjects from two studies at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry. Burden of psychiatric disease, represented by a weighted score, was significantly associated with biological age acceleration as measured by GrimAge and DunedinPoAm (R2-adj. 0.22 and 0.33 for GrimAge and DunedinPoAm, respectively), but not the other investigated clocks. The relation of burden of psychiatric disease appeared independent of differences in socioeconomic status and medication. Our findings indicate that increased burden of psychiatric disease may associate with accelerated biological aging. This highlights the importance of medical management of patients with multiple psychiatric comorbidities and the potential usefulness of specific epigenetic clocks for early detection of risk and targeted intervention to reduce mortality in psychiatric patients.© 2023.

"37066716","Comprehensive analysis of transcriptome-wide M(6)A methylation for hepatic ischaemia reperfusion injury in mice.","Epigenetics","N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) plays key roles in the regulation of biological functions and cellular mechanisms for ischaemia reperfusion (IR) injury in different organs. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms of m6A-modified mRNAs in hepatic IR injury. In mouse models, liver samples were subjected to methylated RNA immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). In total, 16917 m6A peaks associated with 4098 genes were detected in the sham group, whereas 21,557 m6A peaks associated with 5322 genes were detected in the IR group. There were 909 differentially expressed m6A peaks, 863 differentially methylated transcripts and 516 differentially m6A modification genes determined in both groups. The distribution of m6A peaks was especially enriched in the coding sequence and 3'UTR. Furthermore, we identified a relationship between differentially m6A methylated genes (fold change≥1.5/≤ 0.667,pvalue≤0.05) and differentially expressed genes (fold change≥1.5 andpvalue≤0.05) to obtain three overlapping predicted target genes (Fnip2, Phldb2, and Pcf11). Our study revealed a transcriptome-wide map of m6A mRNAs in hepatic IR injury and might provide a theoretical basis for future research in terms of molecular mechanisms."
"37065130","Large-scale genetic characterization of the model sulfate-reducing bacterium, Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough.","Front Microbiol","Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are obligate anaerobes that can couple their growth to the reduction of sulfate. Despite the importance of SRB to global nutrient cycles and their damage to the petroleum industry, our molecular understanding of their physiology remains limited. To systematically provide new insights into SRB biology, we generated a randomly barcoded transposon mutant library in the model SRBDesulfovibrio vulgarisHildenborough (DvH) and used this genome-wide resource to assay the importance of its genes under a range of metabolic and stress conditions. In addition to defining the essential gene set of DvH, we identified a conditional phenotype for 1,137 non-essential genes. Through examination of these conditional phenotypes, we were able to make a number of novel insights into our molecular understanding of DvH, including how this bacterium synthesizes vitamins. For example, we identified DVU0867 as an atypical L-aspartate decarboxylase required for the synthesis of pantothenic acid, provided the first experimental evidence that biotin synthesis in DvH occursviaa specialized acyl carrier protein and without methyl esters, and demonstrated that the uncharacterized dehydrogenase DVU0826:DVU0827 is necessary for the synthesis of pyridoxal phosphate. In addition, we used the mutant fitness data to identify genes involved in the assimilation of diverse nitrogen sources and gained insights into the mechanism of inhibition of chlorate and molybdate. Our large-scale fitness dataset and RB-TnSeq mutant library are community-wide resources that can be used to generate further testable hypotheses into the gene functions of this environmentally and industrially important group of bacteria.Copyright © 2023 Trotter, Shatsky, Price, Juba, Zane, De León, Majumder, Gui, Ali, Wetmore, Kuehl, Arkin, Wall, Deutschbauer, Chandonia and Butland."
"37063698","A longitudinal epigenome-wide association study of preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancy.","Epigenetics Commun","While preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of pregnancy-related morbidity/mortality, its underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. DNA methylation (DNAm) is a dynamic regulator of gene expression that may offer insight into PE pathophysiology and/or serve as a biomarker (e.g., risk, subtype, a therapeutic response). This study's purpose was to evaluate for differences in blood-based DNAm across all trimesters between individuals eventually diagnosed with PE (cases) and individuals who remained normotensive throughout pregnancy, did not develop proteinuria, and birthed a normally grown infant (controls).In the discovery phase, longitudinal, genome-wide DNAm data were generated across three trimesters of pregnancy in 56 participants (n=28 cases,n=28 controls) individually matched on self-identified race, pre-pregnancy body mass index, smoking, and gestational age at sample collection. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was conducted, using surrogate variable analysis to account for unwanted sources of variation. No CpGs met the genome-wide significancepvalue threshold of 9×10-8, but 16 CpGs (trimester 1: 5; trimester 2: 1; trimester 3: 10) met the suggestive significance threshold of 1×10-5. DNAm data were also evaluated for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by PE status. Three DMRs in each trimester were significant after Bonferonni-adjustment. Since only third-trimester samples were available from an independent replication sample (n=64 cases,n=50 controls), the top suggestive hits from trimester 3 (cg16155413 and cg21882990 associated withTRAF3IP2-AS1/TRAF3IP2genes, which also made up the top DMR) were carried forward for replication. During replication, DNAm data were also generated for validation purposes from discovery phase third trimester samples. While significant associations between DNAm and PE status were observed at both sites in the validation sample, no associations between DNAm and PE status were observed in the independent replication sample.The discovery phase findings for cg16155413/cg21882990 (TRAF3IP2-AS1/TRAF3IP2) were validated with a new platform but were not replicated in an independent sample. Given the differences in participant characteristics between the discovery and replication samples, we cannot rule out important signals for these CpGs. Additional research is warranted for cg16155413/cg21882990, as well as top hits in trimesters 1-2 and significant DMRs that were not examined in the replication phase."
"37062770","Exploring the mediation of DNA methylation across the epigenome between childhood adversity and First Episode of Psychosis-findings from the EU-GEI study.","Mol Psychiatry","Studies conducted in psychotic disorders have shown that DNA-methylation (DNAm) is sensitive to the impact of Childhood Adversity (CA). However, whether it mediates the association between CA and psychosis is yet to be explored. Epigenome wide association studies (EWAS) using the Illumina Infinium-Methylation EPIC array in peripheral blood tissue from 366 First-episode of psychosis and 517 healthy controls was performed. Adversity scores were created for abuse, neglect and composite adversity with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Regressions examining (I) CTQ scores with psychosis; (II) with DNAm EWAS level and (III) between DNAm and caseness, adjusted for a variety of confounders were conducted. Divide-Aggregate Composite-null Test for the composite null-hypothesis of no mediation effect was conducted. Enrichment analyses were conducted with missMethyl package and the KEGG database. Our results show that CA was associated with psychosis (Composite: OR = 1.68; p = <0.001; abuse: OR = 2.16; p < 0.001; neglect: OR = 2.27; p = <0.001). None of the CpG sites significantly mediated the adversity-psychosis association after Bonferroni correction (p < 8.1 × 10-8). However, 28, 34 and 29 differentially methylated probes associated with 21, 27, 20 genes passed a less stringent discovery threshold (p < 5 × 10-5) for composite, abuse and neglect respectively, with a lack of overlap between abuse and neglect. These included genes previously associated to psychosis in EWAS studies, such as PANK1, SPEG TBKBP1, TSNARE1 or H2R. Downstream gene ontology analyses did not reveal any biological pathways that survived false discovery rate correction. Although at a non-significant level, DNAm changes in genes previously associated with schizophrenia in EWAS studies may mediate the CA-psychosis association. These results and associated involved processes such as mitochondrial or histaminergic disfunction, immunity or neural signalling requires replication in well powered samples. The lack of overlap between mediating genes associated with abuse and neglect suggests differential biological trajectories linking CA subtypes and psychosis.© 2023.

"37061916","Transient suppression of SUMOylation in embryonic stem cells generates embryo-like structures.","Cell Rep","Recent advances in synthetic embryology have opened new avenues for understanding the complex events controlling mammalian peri-implantation development. Here, we show that mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) solely exposed to chemical inhibition of SUMOylation generate embryo-like structures comprising anterior neural and trunk-associated regions. HypoSUMOylation-instructed ESCs give rise to spheroids that self-organize into gastrulating structures containing cell types spatially and functionally related to embryonic and extraembryonic compartments. Alternatively, spheroids cultured in a droplet microfluidic device form elongated structures that undergo axial organization reminiscent of natural embryo morphogenesis. Single-cell transcriptomics reveals various cellular lineages, including properly positioned anterior neuronal cell types and paraxial mesoderm segmented into somite-like structures. Transient SUMOylation suppression gradually increases DNA methylation genome wide and repressive mark deposition at Nanog. Interestingly, cell-to-cell variations in SUMOylation levels occur during early embryogenesis. Our approach provides a proof of principle for potentially powerful strategies to explore early embryogenesis by targeting chromatin roadblocks of cell fate change.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

"37059287","Genome-wide identification of MATE, functional analysis and molecular dynamics of DcMATE21 involved in anthocyanin accumulation in Daucus carota.","Phytochemistry","Anthocyanins are a subclass of flavonoids that are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and then transported to the vacuole in plants. Multidrug and toxic compound extrusion transporters (MATE) is a family of membrane transporters that transport ions and secondary metabolites, such as anthocyanins, in plants. Although various studies on MATE transporters have been carried out on different plant species, this is the first comprehensive report to mine the Daucus carota genome to identify the MATE gene family. Our study identified 45 DcMATEs through genome-wide analysis and detected five segmental and six tandem duplications from the genome. The chromosome distribution, phylogenetic analysis, and cis-regulatory elements revealed the structural diversity and numerous functions associated with the DcMATEs. In addition, we analyzed RNA-seq data obtained from the European Nucleotide Archive to screen for the expression of DcMATEs involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. Among the identified DcMATEs, DcMATE21 correlated with anthocyanin content in the different D. carota varieties. In addition, the expression of DcMATE21 and anthocyanin biosynthesis genes was correlated under abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, sodium nitroprusside, salicylic acid, and phenylalanine treatments, which were substantiated by anthocyanin accumulation in the in vitro cultures. Further molecular membrane dynamics of DcMATE21 with anthocyanin (cyanidin-3-glucoside) identified the binding pocket, showing extensive H-bond interactions with 10 crucial amino acids present in the transmembrane helix of 7, 8, and 10 of DcMATE21. The current investigation, using RNA-seq, in vitro cultures, and molecular dynamics studies revealed the involvement of DcMATE21 in anthocyanin accumulation in vitro cultures of D. carota.Copyright © 2023.

"37058531","Cross-national and cross-generational evidence that educational attainment may slow the pace of aging in European-descent individuals.","J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci","Individuals with more education are at lower risk of developing multiple, different age-related diseases than their less educated peers. A reason for this might be that individuals with more education age slower. There are two complications in testing this hypothesis. First, there exists no definitive measure of biological aging. Second, shared genetic factors contribute towards both lower educational attainment and the development of age-related diseases. Here, we tested whether the protective effect of educational attainment was associated with the pace of aging after accounting for genetic factors.We examined data from five studies together totaling almost 17,000 individuals with European ancestry born in different countries during different historical periods, ranging in age from 16 to 98 years old. To assess the pace of aging, we used DunedinPACE, a DNA methylation algorithm that reflects an individual's rate of aging and predicts age-related decline and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD). To assess genetic factors related to education we created a polygenic score (PGS) based on results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment.Across the five studies, and across the lifespan, higher educational attainment was associated with a slower pace of aging even after accounting for genetic factors (meta-analysis effect size=-0.20, 95%CI[-0.30- -0.10]; p-value = 0.006). Further, this effect persisted after taking into account tobacco smoking (meta-analysis effect size=-0.13, 95%CI[-0.21- -0.05]; p-value = 0.01).These results indicate that higher levels of education have positive effects on the pace of aging, and that the benefits can be realized irrespective of individuals' genetics.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37058433","High-Dimensional Mediation Analysis: A New Method Applied to Maternal Smoking, Placental DNA Methylation, and Birth Outcomes.","Environ Health Perspect","High-dimensional mediation analysis is an extension of unidimensional mediation analysis that includes multiple mediators, and increasingly it is being used to evaluate the indirect omics-layer effects of environmental exposures on health outcomes. Analyses involving high-dimensional mediators raise several statistical issues. Although many methods have recently been developed, no consensus has been reached about the optimal combination of approaches to high-dimensional mediation analyses.We developed and validated a method for high-dimensional mediation analysis (HDMAX2) and applied it to evaluate the causal role of placental DNA methylation in the pathway between exposure to maternal smoking (MS) during pregnancy and gestational age (GA) and birth weight of the baby at birth.HDMAX2 combines latent factor regression models for epigenome-wide association studies withmax2tests for mediation and considers CpGs and aggregated mediator regions (AMRs). HDMAX2 was carefully evaluated using simulated data and compared to state-of-the-art multidimensional epigenetic mediation methods. Then, HDMAX2 was applied to data from 470 women of the Etude des Déterminants pré et postnatals du développement de la santé de l'Enfant (EDEN) cohort.HDMAX2 demonstrated increased power in comparison with state-of-the-art multidimensional mediation methods and identified several AMRs not identified in previous mediation analyses of exposure to MS on birth weight and GA. The results provided evidence for a polygenic architecture of the mediation pathway with a posterior estimate of the overall indirect effect of CpGs and AMRs equal to44.5glower birth weight representing 32.1% of the total effect [standard deviation(SD)=60.7g]. HDMAX2 also identified AMRs having simultaneous effects both on GA and on birth weight. Among the top hits of both GA and birth weight analyses, regions located inCOASY,BLCAP, andESRP2also mediated the relationship between GA and birth weight, suggesting reverse causality in the relationship between GA and the methylome.HDMAX2 outperformed existing approaches and revealed an unsuspected complexity of the potential causal relationships between exposure to MS and birth weight at the epigenome-wide level. HDMAX2 is applicable to a wide range of tissues and omic layers. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11559."

The up-regulated HAVCR1 was closely related to the poor prognosis in patients with esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). Moreover, DAVID analysis showed that HAVCR1, along with different other associated genes, was involved in numerous cancer-associated signaling pathways across ESCA, STAD, and LUAD. Furthermore, in these cancers, HAVCR1 was also found closely associated with some other parameters such as promoter methylation, tumor purity, level of CD8+ T immune cells, genomic alterations, and chemotherapeutic drugs.HAVCR1 was overexpressed in multiple tumors. However, the up-regulated HAVCR1 is a valuable diagnostic and prognostic biomarker as well as a therapeutic target in only ESCA, STAD, and LUAD patients.AJTR Copyright © 2023."

However, the specific functions of m6A in CdCl2-induced kidney injury remain unclear.Here, we investigate a transcriptome-wide map of m6A modifications and explore the effects of m6A on Cd-induced kidney injury.The rat kidney injury model was constructed by subcutaneous injection of CdCl2(0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg). The m6A levels were measured by colorimetry. The level of expression of m6A-related enzymes were detected by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Transcriptome-wide m6A methylome in CdCl2(2.0 mg/kg) and the control group were profiled by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq). Subsequently, the sequencing data were analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), while gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) confirmed the functional enrichment pathways of sequencing genes. In addition, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was applied to select hub genes.The levels of m6A and m6A regulators (METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, YTHDF2) were significantly increased in CdCl2groups. We identified a total of 2615 differentially expressed m6A peaks, 868 differentially expressed genes and 200 genes with significant changes in both m6A modification and gene expression levels. GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses indicated that these genes were mainly enriched in inflammation and metabolism-related pathways such as in IL-17 signaling and fatty acid metabolism. According the result of the conjoint analysis, we identified the top ten hub genes (Fos, Hsp90aa1, Gata3, Fcer1g, Cftr, Cspg4, Atf3, Cdkn1a, Ptgs2, and Npy) which may be regulated by m6A and involve in CdCl2-induced kidney damage.This study established a m6A transcriptional map in a CdCl2-induced kidney injury model and suggested that m6A may affect CdCl2induced kidney injury via regulated the inflammation and metabolism related gene.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

"37048094","Smoking Suppresses the Therapeutic Potential of Adipose Stem Cells in Crohn's Disease Patients through Epigenetic Changes.","Cells","Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) who smoke are known to have a worse prognosis than never-smokers and a higher risk for post-surgical recurrence, whereas patients who quit smoking after surgery have significantly lower post-operative recurrence. The hypothesis was that smoking induces epigenetic changes that impair the capacity of adipose stem cells (ASCs) to suppress the immune system. It was also questioned whether this impairment remains in ex-smokers with CD. ASCs were isolated from non-smokers, smokers and ex-smokers with CD and their interactions with immune cells were studied. The ASCs from both smokers and ex-smokers promoted macrophage polarization to an M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype, were not able to inhibit T- and B-cell proliferation in vitro and enhanced the gene and protein expression of inflammatory markers including interleukin-1b. Genome-wide epigenetic analysis using two different bioinformatic approaches revealed significant changes in the methylation patterns of genes that are critical for wound healing, immune and metabolic response and p53-mediated DNA damage response in ASCs from smokers and ex-smokers with CD. In conclusion, cigarette smoking induces a pro-inflammatory epigenetic signature in ASCs that likely compromises their therapeutic potential."

"37047360","Identification of TIAM1 as a Potential Synthetic-Lethal-like Gene in a Defined Subset of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.","Int J Mol Sci","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, has very poor outcomes. Current therapies often have low efficacy and significant toxicities. Thus, there is a critical need for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for HCC. We have developed a novel bioinformatics pipeline, which integrates genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression data, to identify genes required for the survival of specific molecular cancer subgroups but not normal cells. Targeting these genes may induce cancer-specific ""synthetic lethality"". Initially, five potential HCC molecular subgroups were identified based on global DNA methylation patterns. Subgroup-2 exhibited the most unique methylation profile and two candidate subtype-specific vulnerability or SL-like genes were identified for this subgroup, including TIAM1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor encoding gene known to activate Rac1 signalling. siRNA targeting TIAM1 inhibited cell proliferation in TIAM1-positive (subgroup-2) HCC cell lines but had no effect on the normal hepatocyte HHL5 cell line. Furthermore,TIAM1-positive/subgroup-2 cell lines were significantly more sensitive to the TIAM1/RAC1 inhibitor NSC23766 compared withTIAM1-negative HCC lines or the normal HHL5 cell line. The results are consistent with a synthetic lethal role forTIAM1in a methylation-defined HCC subgroup and suggest it may be a viable therapeutic target in this subset of HCC patients."
"37047189","H3K4me1 Modification Functions in Caste Differentiation in Honey Bees.","Int J Mol Sci","Honey bees are important species for the study of epigenetics. Female honey bee larvae with the same genotype can develop into phenotypically distinct organisms (sterile workers and fertile queens) depending on conditions such as diet. Previous studies have shown that DNA methylation and histone modification can establish distinct gene expression patterns, leading to caste differentiation. It is unclear whether the histone methylation modification H3K4me1 can also impact caste differentiation. In this study, we analyzed genome-wide H3K4me1 modifications in both queen and worker larvae and found that H3K4me1 marks are more abundant in worker larvae than in queen larvae at both the second and fourth instars, and many genes associated with caste differentiation are differentially methylated. Notably, caste-specific H3K4me1 in promoter regions can direct worker development. Thus, our results suggest that H3K4me1 modification may act as an important regulatory factor in the establishment and maintenance of caste-specific transcriptional programs in honey bees; however, the potential influence of other epigenetic modifications cannot be excluded."
"37047150","FZD7, Regulated by Non-CpG Methylation, Plays an Important Role in Immature Porcine Sertoli Cell Proliferation.","Int J Mol Sci","The regulatory role of non-CpG methylation in mammals has been important in whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. It has also been suggested that non-CpG methylation regulates gene expression to affect the development and health of mammals. However, the dynamic regulatory mechanisms of genome-wide, non-CpG methylation during testicular development still require intensive study. In this study, we analyzed the dataset from the whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and the RNA-seq of precocious porcine testicular tissues across two developmental stages (1 and 75 days old) in order to explore the regulatory roles of non-CpG methylation. Our results showed that genes regulated by non-CpG methylation affect the development of testes in multiple pathways. Furthermore, several hub genes that are regulated by non-CpG methylation during testicular development-such asVEGFA,PECAM1, andFZD7-were also identified. We also found that the relative expression ofFZD7was downregulated by the zebularine-induced demethylation of the first exon ofFZD7. This regulatory relationship was consistent with the results of the WGBS and RNA-seq analysis. The immature porcine Sertoli cells were transfected with RNAi to mimic the expression patterns ofFZD7during testicular development. The results of the simulation test showed that cell proliferation was significantly impeded and that cell cycle arrest at the G2 phase was caused by the siRNA-inducedFZD7inhibition. We also found that the percentage of early apoptotic Sertoli cells was decreased by transfecting them with the RNAi forFZD7. This indicates thatFZD7is an important factor in linking the proliferation and apoptosis of Sertoli cells. We further demonstrated that Sertoli cells that were treated with the medium collected from apoptotic cells could stimulate proliferation. These findings will contribute to the exploration of the regulatory mechanisms of non-CpG methylation in testicular development and of the relationship between the proliferation and apoptosis of normal somatic cells."
"37047019","Genetics and Epigenetics: Implications for the Life Course of Gestational Diabetes.","Int J Mol Sci","Gestational diabetes (GDM) is one of the most common complications of pregnancy, affecting as many as one in six pregnancies. It is associated with both short- and long-term adverse outcomes for the mother and fetus and has important implications for the life course of affected women. Advances in genetics and epigenetics have not only provided new insight into the pathophysiology of GDM but have also provided new approaches to identify women at high risk for progression to postpartum cardiometabolic disease. GDM and type 2 diabetes share similarities in their pathophysiology, suggesting that they also share similarities in their genetic architecture. Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies have identified susceptibility genes that are shared between GDM and type 2 diabetes. Despite these similarities, a much greater effect size forMTNR1Bin GDM compared to type 2 diabetes and association ofHKDC1, which encodes a hexokinase, with GDM but not type 2 diabetes suggest some differences in the genetic architecture of GDM. Genetic risk scores have shown some efficacy in identifying women with a history of GDM who will progress to type 2 diabetes. The association of epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation and circulating microRNAs, with GDM has also been examined. Targeted and epigenome-wide approaches have been used to identify DNA methylation in circulating blood cells collected during early, mid-, and late pregnancy that is associated with GDM. DNA methylation in early pregnancy had some ability to identify women who progressed to GDM, while DNA methylation in blood collected at 26-30 weeks gestation improved upon the ability of clinical factors alone to identify women at risk for progression to abnormal glucose tolerance post-partum. Finally, circulating microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs that are present in early or mid-pregnancy and associated with GDM have been identified. MicroRNAs have also proven efficacious in predicting both the development of GDM as well as its long-term cardiometabolic complications. Studies performed to date have demonstrated the potential for genetic and epigenetic technologies to impact clinical care, although much remains to be done."
"37046805","Epigenetic Rewiring of Metastatic Cancer to the Brain: Focus on Lung and Colon Cancers.","Cancers (Basel)","Distant metastasis occurs when cancer cells adapt to a tissue microenvironment that is different from the primary organ. This process requires genetic and epigenetic changes in cancer cells and the concomitant modification of the tumor stroma to facilitate invasion by metastatic cells. In this study, we analyzed differences in the epigenome of brain metastasis from the colon (n = 4) and lung (n = 14) cancer and we compared these signatures with those found in primary tumors. Results show that CRC tumors showed a high degree of genome-wide methylation compared to lung cancers. Further, brain metastasis from lung cancer deeply activates neural signatures able to modify the brain microenvironment favoring tumor cells adaptation. At the protein level, brain metastases from lung cancer show expression of the neural/glial marker Nestin. On the other hand, colon brain metastases show activation of metabolic signaling. These signatures are specific for metastatic tumors since primary cancers did not show such epigenetic derangements.

However, this experimental approach has limitations in faithfully recreating the microenvironment and cellular processes occurring in tumors. For these reasons, 3D cell cultures have recently been implemented to optimize the conditions that better recreate the biological and molecular features of tumors, including cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, growth kinetics, metabolic activities, and the development of gradients in the cellular microenvironment affecting the availability of oxygen and nutrients. In this sense, tumor cells receive stimuli from the local environment, resulting in significant changes in their signaling pathways, gene expression, and transcriptional and epigenetic patterns. In this review, we discuss how different types of 3D cell culture models can be applied to characterize the epigenetic footprints of cancer cell lines, emphasizing that DNA methylation patterns play an essential role in the emergence and development of cancer. However, how 3D cancer cell cultures remodel the epigenetic programs is poorly understood, with very few studies in this emerging topic. Here, we have summarized the studies on the reprogramming of the epigenetic landscape of DNA methylation during tumorigenesis and discuss how it may be affected by microenvironmental factors, specifically in 3D cell cultures."
"37046291",NA,NA,"Obesity and neurodevelopmental delay are complex traits that often co-occur and differ between boys and girls. Prenatal exposures are believed to influence children's obesity, but it is unknown whether exposures of pregnant mothers can confer a different risk of obesity between sexes, and whether they can affect neurodevelopment.We analyzed data from 1044 children from the HELIX project, comprising 93 exposures during pregnancy, and clinical, neuropsychological, and methylation data during childhood (5-11 years). Using exposome-wide interaction analyses, we identified prenatal exposures with the highest sexual dimorphism in obesity risk, which were used to create a multiexposure profile. We applied causal random forest to classify individuals into two environments: E1 and E0. E1 consists of a combination of exposure levels where girls have significantly less risk of obesity than boys, as compared to E0, which consists of the remaining combination of exposure levels. We investigated whether the association between sex and neurodevelopmental delay also differed between E0 and E1. We used methylation data to perform an epigenome-wide association study between the environments to see the effect of belonging to E1 or E0 at the molecular level.We observed that E1 was defined by the combination of low dairy consumption, non-smokers' cotinine levels in blood, low facility richness, and the presence of green spaces during pregnancy (ORinteraction = 0.070, P = 2.59 × 10-5). E1 was also associated with a lower risk of neurodevelopmental delay in girls, based on neuropsychological tests of non-verbal intelligence (ORinteraction = 0.42, P = 0.047) and working memory (ORinteraction = 0.31, P = 0.02). In line with this, several neurodevelopmental functions were enriched in significant differentially methylated probes between E1 and E0.The risk of obesity can be different for boys and girls in certain prenatal environments. We identified an environment combining four exposure levels that protect girls from obesity and neurodevelopment delay. The combination of single exposures into multiexposure profiles using causal inference can help determine populations at risk.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Previous studies have showed that DNA methylation was involved in MD development, but systematic studies are still lacking. Herein, we performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-seq in MDV-infected tumorous spleens (IN), noninfected spleens (NoIN), and survivor (SUR) spleens of chickens to identify the genes playing important roles in MD tumor transformation. We generated the first genome-wide DNA methylation profile of MDV-infected, noninfected, and survivor chickens. Combined the WGBS and RNA-Seq, we found that the expression of 25% differential expression genes (DEGs) were significantly correlated with methylation of CpG sites in their gene bodies or promoters. Further, we focused on the DEGs with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) on genes' body and promoter, and it showed the expression of 60% DEGs were significantly correlated with methylation of CpG sites in DMRs. Finally, we identified 8 genes, including CD4, CTLA4, DTL, HMGB1, LGMN, NUP210, RAD52, and ZAP70, and their expression was negatively correlated with methylation of DMRs in their promoters in both IN vs. NoIN and IN vs. SUR. These 8 genes showed specifically high expression in IN groups and clustered in module turquoise analyzed by WGCNA. Out of 8 genes, CD4 and HMGB1 were drop in QTLs associated with MD resistance. Thus, we overexpressed the 2 genes to simulate their high expression in the IN group and found they significantly promoted MDCC-MSB-1 cell proliferation, which revealed they might play promoting roles in MD tumorigenesis in IN due to their high expression induced by hypomethylation.Copyright © 2023.

"37042721","Air Pollution and Human Endogenous Retrovirus Methylation in the School Inner-City Asthma Intervention Study.","Toxicol Sci","Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are transposable genomic elements generally repressed through DNA methylation. HERVs can be demethylated and expressed in response to environmental stimuli. Therefore, more research is needed to understand the influence of environmental exposures on HERV methylation. Air pollutants are commonly linked with global hypomethylation, and as HERVs comprise of nearly 8% of repetitive elements in the human genome, our objective was to examine the association between air pollutant exposure and HERV methylation. We investigated 180 students with asthma participating in the School Inner-City Asthma Intervention Study, which evaluated the efficacy of classroom air filters and school-wide pest management on air pollutant/allergen exposure and asthma. Both air pollutants measured in classrooms and asthma outcomes assessed by surveys were collected pre- and post-intervention. Buccal swabs were also collected pre- and post-intervention, and methylation levels from nine transposable genomic elements (HERV-E, -FRD, -K, -L, -R, -W, -9, and HRES and LINE1) were measured. Adjusting for relevant covariates, the overall air pollutant mixture was cross-sectionally associated with higher HERV-W and lower HERV-L and LINE1 methylation. Coarse PM was cross-sectionally associated with higher HERV-K methylation and CO2 with lower LINE1 methylation. These results suggest that exposure to air pollutants is associated with HERV-W and HERV-K hypermethylation and HERV-L and LINE1 hypomethylation in children with asthma. Future studies are needed to characterize the links between HERV methylation and possible adverse outcomes.© The Author(s) 2023.

Frequently, patient-derived tissues stored in long-term hospital tissue banks have been preserved using formalin-fixation paraffin-embedding (FFPE). While these samples can comprise valuable resources for studying disease, the fixation process ultimately compromises the DNA's integrity and leads to degradation. Degraded DNA can complicate CpG methylome profiling using traditional techniques, particularly when performing methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing (MRE-seq), yielding high backgrounds and resulting in lowered library complexity. Here, we describe Capture MRE-seq, a new MRE-seq protocol tailored to preserving unmethylated CpG information when using samples with highly degraded DNA. The results using Capture MRE-seq correlate well (0.92) with traditional MRE-seq calls when profiling non-degraded samples, and can recover unmethylated regions in highly degraded samples when traditional MRE-seq fails, which we validate using bisulfite sequencing-based data (WGBS) as well as methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq).© 2023.

"37036021","Physical activity is associated with slower epigenetic ageing-Findings from the Rhineland study.","Aging Cell","Epigenetic ageing, i.e., age-associated changes in DNA methylation patterns, is a sensitive marker of biological ageing, a major determinant of morbidity and functional decline. We examined the association of physical activity with epigenetic ageing and the role of immune function and cardiovascular risk factors in mediating this relation. Moreover, we aimed to identify novel molecular processes underlying the association between physical activity and epigenetic ageing. We analysed cross-sectional data from 3567 eligible participants (mean age: 55.5 years, range: 30-94 years, 54.8% women) of the Rhineland Study, a community-based cohort study in Bonn, Germany. Physical activity components (metabolic equivalent (MET)-Hours, step counts, sedentary, light-intensity and moderate-to-vigorous intensity activities) were recorded with accelerometers. DNA methylation was measured with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip. Epigenetic age acceleration (Hannum's age, Horvath's age, PhenoAge and GrimAge) was calculated based on published algorithms. The relation between physical activity and epigenetic ageing was examined with multivariable regression, while structural equation modeling was used for mediation analysis. Moreover, we conducted an epigenome-wide association study of physical activity across 850,000 CpG sites. After adjustment for age, sex, season, education, smoking, cell proportions and batch effects, physical activity (step counts, MET-Hours and %time spend in moderate-to-vigorous activities) was non-linearly associated with slower epigenetic ageing, in part through its beneficial effects on immune function and cardiovascular health. Additionally, we identified 12 and 7 CpGs associated with MET-Hours and %time spent in moderate-to-vigorous activities, respectively (p < 1 × 10-5). Our findings suggest that regular physical activity slows epigenetic ageing by counteracting immunosenescence and lowering cardiovascular risk.© 2023 The Authors.

"37034474","The relationship between epigenetic age and the hallmarks of aging in human cells.","Nat Aging","Epigenetic clocks are mathematically derived age estimators that are based on combinations of methylation values that change with age at specific CpGs in the genome. These clocks are widely used to measure the age of tissues and cells1,2. The discrepancy between epigenetic age (EpiAge), as estimated by these clocks, and chronological age is referred to as EpiAge acceleration. Epidemiological studies have linked EpiAge acceleration to a wide variety of pathologies, health states, lifestyle, mental state and environmental factors2, indicating that epigenetic clocks tap into critical biological processes that are involved in aging. Despite the importance of this inference, the mechanisms underpinning these clocks remained largely uncharacterized and unelucidated. Here, using primary human cells, we set out to investigate whether epigenetic aging is the manifestation of one or more of the aging hallmarks previously identified3. We show that although epigenetic aging is distinct from cellular senescence, telomere attrition and genomic instability, it is associated with nutrient sensing, mitochondrial activity and stem cell composition."

Women suffer from the symptoms caused by EMs, such as chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. However, the etiology and pathophysiology of EMs remain unclear. This study aimed to identify candidate genes of endometriosis through integrated analysis of genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles.Eutopic and ectopic endometrial tissues were collected from patients who were diagnosed as ovarian EMs. Genome-wide methylation profiling identified 17551 differentially methylated loci, with 9777 hypermethylated and 7774 hypomethylated loci. Differentially methylated loci were mainly concentrated in the gene body and intergenic regions. Genome-wide gene expression profiling identified 1837 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 1079 genes upregulated and 758 downregulated in ectopic groups. Integrated analysis revealed that DNA methylation was negatively correlated to gene expression in most genomic regions, such as exon, 3'UTR, 5'UTR, and promoter. We also identified promoter-related (53 downregulated and 113 upregulated) and enhancer-related DMGs (212 downregulated and 232 upregulated), which were significantly correlated to the gene expression. Further validation of the top-ranked genes belonging to differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and DEGs revealed thatTMEM184A,GREM2,SFN,KIR3DX1,HPGD,ESR1,BST2,PIK3CGandRNASE1were significant candidate genes in ovarian endometriosis.Our study revealed the significance of DNA methylation in the gene expression in ovary endometriosis, which provides new insights and a molecular foundation for understanding the underlying mechanisms of endometriosis.Copyright © 2023 Lei, Xu, Gong, Lin and Li."

T2DM is associated with long-term complications that have contributed to the burden of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The objective of this manuscript is to conduct an Exome-Wide Association Study (EWAS) on T2DM Emirati individuals to improve our understanding on diabetes-related complications to improve early diagnostic methods and treatment strategies.This cross-sectional study recruited 310 Emirati participants that were stratified according to their medically diagnosed diabetes-related complications: diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and cardiovascular complications. The Illumina's Infinium Exome-24 array was used and 39,840 SNPs remained for analysis after quality control.The analysis revealed the associations of various genes with each complication category: 1) diabetic retinopathy was associated toSHANK3gene in locus 22q13.33 (SNP rs9616915; p=5.18 x10-4),ZSCAN5Agene in locus 19q13.43 (SNP rs7252603; p=7.55 x10-4), andDCP1Bgene in locus 12p13.33 (SNPs rs715146, rs1044950, rs113147414, rs34730825; p=7.62 x10-4); 2) diabetic neuropathy was associated toADH4gene in locus 4q23 (SNP rs4148883; p=1.23 x10-4),SLC11A1gene in locus 2q35 (SNP rs17235409; p=1.85 x10-4), andMATN4gene in locus 20q13.12 (SNP rs2072788; p=2.68 x10-4); 3) diabetic nephropathy was associated toPPP1R3Agene in locus 7q31.1 (SNP rs1799999; p=1.91 x10-4),ZNF136gene in locus 19p13.2 (SNP rs140861589; p=2.80 x10-4), andHSPA12Bgene in locus 20p13 (SNP rs6076550; p=2.86 x10-4); and 4) cardiovascular complications was associated toPCNTgene in locus 21q22.3 (SNPs rs7279204, rs6518289, rs2839227, rs2839223; p=2.18 x10-4,3.04 x10-4,4.51 x10-4,5.22 x10-4respectively),SEPT14gene in locus 7p11.2 (SNP rs146350220; p=2.77 x10-4), andWDR73gene in locus 15q25.2 (SNP rs72750868; p=4.47 x10-4).We have identified susceptibility loci associated with each category of T2DM-related complications in the Emirati population. Given that only 16% of the markers from the Illumina's Infinium Exome chip passed quality control assessment, this demonstrates that multiple variants were, either, monomorphic in the Arab population or were not genotyped due to the use of a Euro-centric EWAS array that limits the possibility of including targeted ethnic-specific SNPs. Our results suggest the alarming possibility that lack of representation in reference panels could inhibit discovery of functionally important loci associated to T2DM complications. Further effort must be conducted to improve the representation of diverse populations in genotyping and sequencing studies.Copyright © 2023 Mansour, Mousa, Abdelmannan, Tay, Hassoun and Alsafar."

These epigenetic traits are heritable without any change in genetic DNA sequences. DNA methylation is a universal mechanism of epigenetic regulation in all kingdoms of life. In bacteria, DNA methylation is the main form of epigenetic regulation and plays important roles in affecting clinically relevant phenotypes, such as virulence, host colonization, sporulation, biofilm formation et al. In this review, we survey bacterial epigenomic studies and focus on the recent developments in the structure, function, and mechanism of several highly conserved bacterial DNA methylases. These methyltransferases are relatively common in bacteria and participate in the regulation of gene expression and chromosomal DNA replication and repair control. Recent advances in sequencing techniques capable of detecting methylation signals have enabled the characterization of genome-wide epigenetic regulation. With their involvement in critical cellular processes, these highly conserved DNA methyltransferases may emerge as promising targets for developing novel epigenetic inhibitors for biomedical applications.Copyright © 2023 Gao, Lu, Wang, He, Wang, Jia, Chen, Zhu, Liu, Zhao, Yang, Wu, Zhang, Huang, Mao, Ou, Sun, Tian and Cheng."

Nanopore sequencing allows genome-wide 5mC detection in cfDNA without bisulphite conversion. The aims of this study were: i) to find differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of cfDNA associated with obesity in Göttingen minipigs using Nanopore sequencing, ii) to validate a subset of the DMRs using methylation-specific PCR (MSP-PCR), and iii) to compare the cfDNA DMRs with those from whole blood genomic DNA (gDNA). Serum cfDNA and gDNA were obtained from 10 lean and 7 obese Göttingen Minipigs both with experimentally induced myocardial infarction and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore MinION. A total of 1,236 cfDNA DMRs (FDR<0.01) were associated with obesity. In silico analysis showed enrichment of the adipocytokine signalling, glucagon signalling, and cellular glucose homoeostasis pathways. A strong cfDNA DMR was discovered inPPARGC1B, a gene linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes. The DMR was validated using MSP-PCR and correlated significantly with body weight (P < 0.05). No DMRs intersected between cfDNA and gDNA, suggesting that cfDNA originates from body-wide shedding of DNA. In conclusion, nanopore sequencing detected differential methylation in minute quantities (0.1-1 ng/µl) of cfDNA. Future work should focus on translation into human and comparing 5mC from somatic tissues to pinpoint the exact location of pathology."
"37031184","Effects of epigenetic age acceleration on kidney function: a Mendelian randomization study.","Clin Epigenetics","Previous studies have reported cross-sectional associations between measures of epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) and kidney function phenotypes. However, the temporal and potentially causal relationships between these variables remain unclear. We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study of EAA and kidney function. Genetic instruments for EAA and estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were identified from previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses of European-ancestry participants. Causal effects of EAA on kidney function and kidney function on EAA were assessed through summary-based Mendelian randomization utilizing data from the CKDGen GWAS meta-analysis of log-transformed estimated glomerular filtration rate (log-eGFR; n = 5,67,460) and GWAS meta-analyses of EAA (n = 34,710). An allele score-based Mendelian randomization leveraging individual-level data from UK Biobank participants (n = 4,33,462) further examined the effects of EAA on kidney function.Using summary-based Mendelian randomization, we found that each 5 year increase in intrinsic EAA (IEAA) and GrimAge acceleration (GrimAA) was associated with - 0.01 and - 0.02 unit decreases in log-eGFR, respectively (P = 0.02 and P = 0.09, respectively), findings which were strongly supported by allele-based Mendelian randomization study (both P < 0.001). Summary-based Mendelian randomization identified 24% increased odds of CKD with each 5-unit increase in IEAA (P = 0.05), with consistent findings observed in allele score-based analysis (P = 0.07). Reverse-direction Mendelian randomization identified potentially causal effects of decreased kidney function on HannumAge acceleration (HannumAA), GrimAA, and PhenoAge acceleration (PhenoAA), conferring 3.14, 1.99, and 2.88 year decreases in HanumAA, GrimAA, and PhenoAA, respectively (P = 0.003, 0.05, and 0.002, respectively) with each 1-unit increase in log-eGFR.This study supports bidirectional causal relationships between EAA and kidney function, pointing to potential prevention and therapeutic strategies.© 2023.

Fetal epigenetic variations established in utero may be a possible pathway. This study aimed to investigate whether in utero exposure to diabetes was associated with a change in newborn DNA methylation, and whether the identified CpG sites mediate the association between diabetes and preterm birth in a racially diverse birth cohort population.This study included 954 mother-newborn pairs. Methylation levels in the cord blood were determined using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850 K array platform. In utero exposure to diabetes was defined by the presence of maternal pregestational or gestational diabetes. Preterm birth was defined as gestational age at birth less than 37 weeks. Linear regression analysis was employed to identify differentially methylated CpG sites. Differentially methylated regions were identified using the DMRcate Package.126 (13%) newborns were born to mothers with diabetes in pregnancy and 173 (18%) newborns were born preterm, while 41 newborns were born both preterm and to mothers with diabetes in pregnancy. Genomic-wide CpG analysis found that eighteen CpG sites in cord blood were differentially methylated by maternal diabetes status at an FDR threshold of 5%. These significant CpG sites were mapped to 12 known genes, one of which was annotated to gene Major Histocompatibility Complex, Class II, DM Beta (HLA-DMB). Consistently, one of the two identified significant methylated regions overlapped with HLA-DMB. The identified differentially methylated CpG sites mediated the association between diabetes in pregnancy and preterm birth by 61%.In this US birth cohort, we found that maternal diabetes was associated with altered fetal DNA methylation patterns, which substantially explained the link between diabetes and preterm birth.© 2023.

"37027157","Association of Race and Poverty Status With DNA Methylation-Based Age.","JAMA Netw Open","The Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated From the Epigenome (DunedinPACE) measure is a newly constructed DNA methylation (DNAm) biomarker associated with morbidity, mortality, and adverse childhood experiences in several cohorts with European ancestry. However, there are few studies of the DunedinPACE measure among socioeconomically and racially diverse cohorts with longitudinal assessments.To investigate the association of race and poverty status with DunedinPACE scores in a socioeconomically diverse middle-aged cohort of African American and White participants.This longitudinal cohort study used data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. HANDLS is a population-based study of socioeconomically diverse African American and White adults aged 30 to 64 years at baseline in Baltimore, Maryland, with follow-up approximately every 5 years. The current study was restricted to 470 participants with blood samples at 2 time points: August 14, 2004, to June 22, 2009 (visit 1), and June 23, 2009, to September 12, 2017 (visit 2). Genome-wide DNAm was assessed at visit 1 (chronological age, 30-64 years) and visit 2. Data were analyzed from March 18, 2022, to February 9, 2023.DunedinPACE scores were estimated for each participant at 2 visits. DunedinPACE scores are values scaled to a mean of 1, interpretable with reference to a rate of 1 year of biological aging per 1 year of chronological aging. Linear mixed-model regression analysis was used to examine the trajectories of DunedinPACE scores by chronological age, race, sex, and poverty status.Among 470 participants, the mean (SD) chronological age at visit 1 was 48.7 (8.7) years. Participants were balanced by sex (238 [50.6%] were men and 232 [49.4%] were women), race (237 [50.4%] African American and 233 [49.6%] White), and poverty status (236 [50.2%] living below poverty level and 234 [49.8%] living above poverty level). The mean (SD) time between visits was 5.1 (1.5) years. Overall, the mean (SD) DunedinPACE score was 1.07 (0.14), representing a 7% faster pace of biological aging than chronological aging. Linear mixed-effects regression analysis revealed an association between the 2-way interaction between race and poverty status (White race and household income below poverty level: β = 0.0665; 95% CI, 0.0298-0.1031; P < .001) and significantly higher DunedinPACE scores and an association between quadratic age (age squared: β = -0.0113; 95% CI, -0.0212 to -0.0013; P = .03) and significantly higher DunedinPACE scores.In this cohort study, household income below poverty level and African American race were associated with higher DunedinPACE scores. These findings suggest that the DunedinPACE biomarker varies with race and poverty status as adverse social determinants of health. Consequently, measures of accelerated aging should be based on representative samples."

This research aims to examine genome-wide changes in injured human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) using the Ribonucleic Acid sequencing (RNA-Seq) technique, and to search for key genes influencing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, thus gaining new insights into future clinical diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and laying a foundation for follow-up research.Impaired HDMECs (injury group), established by endotoxin intervention, were analyzed by RNA-Seq for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) relative to normal HDMECs (control group). Then, DEGs that might be associated with m6A methylation were selected for expression blocking to observe m6A methylation alterations. The migration, angiogenesis, and inflammatory response of damaged HDMECs were detected by cell scratch assay, western blotting, and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) experiments, respectively.In this study, 20 DEGs were screened out from the two groups by RNA-Seq, of which 17 were up-regulated and 3 were down-regulated. The C-C motif chemokine receptor 10 (CCR10) was selected for subsequent analysis. Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) identified elevatedCCR10expression and reduced m6A methylation levels in the injury group (p< 0.05). After blockingCCR10expression in damaged HDMECs by BI6901 (aCCR10specific blocker) m6A methylation, cell activity, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and CD31 protein expression, as well as relative length and branches of tube formation were found to be increased compared with the injury group, while the levels of inflammatory factors interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-1 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were decreased (p< 0.05).BlockingCCR10expression can activate m6A methylation, promote cell activity, inhibit inflammatory reactions and alleviate HDMEC injury, which may become a breakthrough in future diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases."

The toxicity of Cd to animals/humans have been widely reported, yet little is known about the health risk of dietary Cd intake at the epigenetic level. Here, we investigated the effect of a household Cd-contaminated rice (Cd-rice) on genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) changes in the model mouse. Feeding Cd-rice increased kidney Cd and urinary Cd concentrations compared with the Control rice (low-Cd rice), whereas supplementation of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid iron sodium salt (NaFeEDTA) in the diet significantly increased urinary Cd and consequently decreased kidney Cd concentrations. Genome-wide DNAm sequencing revealed that dietary Cd-rice exposure caused the differentially methylated sites (DMSs), which were mainly located in the promoter (32.5%), downstream (32.5%), and intron (26.1%) regions of genes. Notably, Cd-rice exposure induced hypermethylation at the promoter sites of genes Caspase-8 and interleukin-1β (Il-1β), and consequently, their expressions were down-regulated. The two genes are critical in apoptosis and inflammation, respectively. In contrast, Cd-rice induced hypomethylation of the gene midline 1 (Mid1), which is vital to neurodevelopment. Furthermore, 'pathways in cancer' was significantly enriched as the leading canonical pathway. Supplementation of NaFeEDTA partly alleviated the toxic symptoms and DNAm alternations induced by Cd-rice exposure. These results highlight the broad effects of elevated dietary Cd intake on the level of DNAm, providing epigenetic evidence on the specific endpoints of health risks induced by Cd-rice exposure.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Super-enhancers were identified sing ROSE software. Overlap analysis was used to assess the potential DMS in SEs region. Feature selection was performed by Cox regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm based on TCGA training cohort. Prognosis model validation was performed in TCGA training cohort, TCGA validation cohort, and gene expression omnibus (GEO) test cohort. The gene ontology and KEGG analysis revealed that SEs target genes were significantly enriched in cell-migration-associated processes and pathways. A total of 83 654 DMS were identified between BRCA and adjacent tissues. Around 2397 DMS in SEs region were identified by overlap study and used to feature selection. By using Cox regression and LASSO algorithm, 42 features were selected to develop a clinical prediction model (CPM).

Rasayana therapy is one of them and although these treatment modules show improvement in bronchial asthma, their mechanism of action, particularly the effect on DNA methylation, is largely understudied.Our study aimed at identifying the contribution of DNA methylation changes in modulating bronchial asthma phenotype upon Ayurveda intervention.In this study, genome-wide methylation profiling in peripheral blood DNA of healthy controls and bronchial asthmatics before (BT) and after (AT) Ayurveda treatment was performed using array-based profiling of reference-independent methylation status (aPRIMES) coupled to microarray technique.We identified 4820 treatment-associated DNA methylation signatures (TADS) and 11,643 asthma-associated DNA methylation signatures (AADS), differentially methylated [FDR (≤0.1) adjusted p-values] in AT and HC groups respectively, compared to BT group. Neurotrophin TRK receptor signaling pathway was significantly enriched for differentially methylated genes in bronchial asthmatics, compared to AT and HC subjects. Additionally, we identified over 100 differentially methylated immune-related genes located in the promoter/5'-UTR regions of TADS and AADS. Various immediate-early response and immune regulatory genes with functions such as transcription factor activity (FOXD1, FOXD2, GATA6, HOXA3, HOXA5, MZF1, NFATC1, NKX2-2, NKX2-3, RUNX1, KLF11), G-protein coupled receptor activity (CXCR4, PTGER4), G-protein coupled receptor binding (UCN), DNA binding (JARID2, EBF2, SOX9), SNARE binding (CAPN10), transmembrane signaling receptor activity (GP1BB), integrin binding (ITGA6), calcium ion binding (PCDHGA12), actin binding (TRPM7, PANX1, TPM1), receptor tyrosine kinase binding (PIK3R2), receptor activity (GDNF), histone methyltransferase activity (MLL5), and catalytic activity (TSTA3) were found to show consistent methylation status between AT and HC group in microarray data.Our study reports the DNA methylation-regulated genes in bronchial asthmatics showing improvement in symptoms after Ayurveda intervention. DNA methylation regulation in the identified genes and pathways represents the Ayurveda intervention responsive genes and may be further explored as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers for bronchial asthma in peripheral blood.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

"37018654","Human skeletal muscle methylome after low carbohydrate energy balanced exercise.","Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab","We aimed to investigate the human skeletal muscle (SkM) DNA methylome after exercise in low carbohydrate (CHO) energy balance (with high fat) compared with exercise in low-CHO energy deficit (with low fat) conditions. The objective to identify novel epigenetically regulated genes and pathways associated with 'train-low sleep-low' paradigms. The sleep-low conditions included 9 males that cycled to deplete muscle glycogen while reaching a set energy expenditure. Post-exercise, low-CHO meals (protein-matched) completely replaced (using high-fat) or only partially replaced (low-fat) the energy expended. The following morning resting baseline biopsies were taken and the participants then undertook 75 minutes of cycling exercise, with skeletal muscle biopsies collected 30 minutes and 3.5 hours post exercise. Discovery of genome-wide DNA methylation was undertaken using Illumina EPIC arrays and targeted gene expression analysis was conducted by RT-qPCR. At baseline participants under energy balance (high fat) demonstrated a predominantly hypermethylated (60%) profile across the genome compared to energy deficit-low fat conditions. However, post exercise performed in energy balance (with high fat) elicited a more prominent hypomethylation signature 30 minutes post-exercise in gene regulatory regions important for transcription (CpG islands within promoter regions) compared with exercise in energy deficit (with low fat) conditions. Such hypomethylation was enriched within pathways related to: IL6-JAK-STAT signalling, metabolic processes, p53 / cell cycle and oxidative / fatty acid metabolism. Hypomethylation within the promoter regions of genes: HDAC2, MECR, IGF2 and c13orf16 were associated with significant increases in gene expression in the post-exercise period in energy balance compared with energy deficit. Furthermore, histone deacetylase, HDAC11 was oppositely regulated at the gene expression level compared with HDAC2, where HDAC11 was hypomethylated yet increased in energy deficit compared with energy balance conditions. Overall, we identify some novel epigenetically regulated genes associated with train-low sleep-low paradigms."

DNA methylation is associated with a variety of inflammatory skin diseases, but its role in severe acne is unclear. In this study, we conducted a two-stage epigenome correlation study using 88 blood samples to identify disease-related differential methylation sites. We found close associations between the DNA methylation at 23 differentially methylated sites (DMSs) and severe acne, includingPDGFD, ARHGEF10, etc. Further analysis revealed that differentially methylated genes (PARP8andMAPKAPK2) were also expressed differently between severe acne and health control groups. These findings lead us to speculation that epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role in the pathogenesis of severe acne."

DNA methylation is known to be important in the occurrence of NDDs. The family study is conducive to eliminate the effects of relative epigenetic backgrounds, and to screen for differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) that are truly associated with NDDs.Four monozygotic twin families were recruited, and both twin individuals suffered from NDDs (either SZ, ID, or SZ plus ID). Genome-wide methylation analysis was performed in all samples and each family. DMPs and DMRs between NDD patients and unaffected individuals were identified. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed on the annotated genes.Two significant DMPs annotated toCYP2E1were found in all samples. In Family One, 1476 DMPs mapped to 880 genes, and 162 DMRs overlapping with 153 unique genes were recognised. Our results suggested that the altered methylation levels ofFYN,STAT3,RAC1, andNR4A2were associated with the development of SZ and ID. Neurodevelopment and the immune system may participate in the occurrence of SZ and ID.Our findings suggested that DNA methylation participated in the development of NDDs by affecting neurodevelopment and the immune system."

The ciliary axoneme is a microtubule-based cytoskeleton consisting of two central singlets and nine outer doublet microtubules. Cryo-electron microscopy-based studies have revealed a complex network inside the lumen of both tubules composed of microtubule-inner proteins (MIPs). However, the functions of most MIPs remain unknown. Here, we present single-particle cryo-EM-based analyses of the Tetrahymena thermophila native doublet microtubule and identify 42 MIPs. These data shed light on the evolutionarily conserved and diversified roles of MIPs. In addition, we identified MIPs potentially responsible for the assembly and stability of the doublet outer junction. Knockout of the evolutionarily conserved outer junction component CFAP77 moderately diminishes Tetrahymena swimming speed and beat frequency, indicating the important role of CFAP77 and outer junction stability in cilia beating generation and/or regulation.© 2023.

In recent years, air pollution, especially particulate matter (PM), has been widely studied as a contributing factor to COPD. As an essential component of PM, PM2.5 is associated with COPD prevalence, morbidity, and acute exacerbations. However, the specific pathogenic mechanisms were still unclear and deserve further research. The diversity and complexity of PM2.5 components make it challenging to get its accurate effects and mechanisms for COPD. It has been determined that the most toxic PM2.5 components are metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), carbonaceous particles (CPs), and other organic compounds. PM2.5-induced cytokine release and oxidative stress are the main mechanisms reported leading to COPD. Nonnegligibly, the microorganism in PM 2.5 may directly cause mononuclear inflammation or break the microorganism balance contributing to the development and exacerbation of COPD.

The identification of pregnancies at risk of PTB remains challenging, as the incomplete understanding of molecular mechanisms associated with PTB. Although several transcriptome studies have been done on the placenta and plasma from PTB women, a comprehensive description of the RNA profiles from plasma and placenta associated with PTB remains lacking.Candidate markers with consistent trends in the placenta and plasma were identified by implementing differential expression analysis using placental tissue and maternal plasma RNA-seq datasets, and then validated by RT-qPCR in an independent cohort. In combination with bioinformatics analysis tools, we set up two protein-protein interaction networks of the significant PTB-related modules. The support vector machine (SVM) model was used to verify the prediction potential of cell free RNAs (cfRNAs) in plasma for PTB and late PTB.We identified 15 genes with consistent regulatory trends in placenta and plasma of PTB while the full term birth (FTB) acts as a control. Subsequently, we verified seven cfRNAs in an independent cohort by RT-qPCR in maternal plasma. The cfRNA ARHGEF28 showed consistence in the experimental validation and performed excellently in prediction of PTB in the model. The AUC achieved 0.990 for whole PTB and 0.986 for late PTB.In a comparison of PTB versus FTB, the combined investigation of placental and plasma RNA profiles has shown a further understanding of the mechanism of PTB.

High FA intake is associated with increased insulin resistance and gestational diabetes. We aimed to establish whether maternal one-carbon metabolism and hormones that regulate glucose homeostasis change in healthy pregnancies post-FA food fortification. Circulating folate, B12, homocysteine, prolactin (PRL), human placental lactogen (hPL) and placental growth hormone (GH2) were measured in early pregnancy maternal blood in women with uncomplicated pregnancies prior to (SCOPE: N = 604) and post (STOP: N = 711)-FA food fortification. FA food fortification resulted in 63% higher maternal folate. STOP women had lower hPL (33%) and GH2 (43%) after 10 weeks of gestation, but they had higher PRL (29%) and hPL (28%) after 16 weeks. FA supplementation during pregnancy increased maternal folate and reduced homocysteine but only in the SCOPE group, and it was associated with 54% higher PRL in SCOPE but 28% lower PRL in STOP. FA food fortification increased maternal folate status, but supplements no longer had an effect, thereby calling into question their utility. An altered secretion of hormones that regulate glucose homeostasis in pregnancy could place women post-fortification at an increased risk of insulin resistance and gestational diabetes, particularly for older women and those with obesity."

The aim of this study was to evaluate performance of epigenetic clocks and to identify biological and sociodemographic correlates of EGAA and EAA at birth and in childhood. In the Project Viva pre-birth cohort, DNA methylation was measured in nucleated cells in cord blood (leukocytes and nucleated red blood cells, N = 485) and leukocytes in early (N = 120, median age = 3.2 years) and mid-childhood (N = 460, median age = 7.7 years). We calculated epigenetic gestational age (EGA; Bohlin and Knight clocks) and epigenetic age (EA; Horvath and skin & blood clocks), and respective measures of EGAA and EAA. We evaluated the performance of clocks relative to chronological age using correlations and median absolute error. We tested for associations of maternal-child characteristics with EGAA and EAA using mutually adjusted linear models controlling for estimated cell type proportions. We also tested associations of Horvath EA at birth with childhood EAA.Bohlin EGA was strongly correlated with chronological gestational age (Bohlin EGA r = 0.82, p < 0.001). Horvath and skin & blood EA were weakly correlated with gestational age, but moderately correlated with chronological age in childhood (r = 0.45-0.65). Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with higher skin & blood EAA at birth [B (95% CI) = 1.17 weeks (- 0.09, 2.42)] and in early childhood [0.34 years (0.03, 0.64)]. Female newborns and children had lower Bohlin EGAA [- 0.17 weeks (- 0.30, - 0.04)] and Horvath EAA at birth [B (95% CI) = - 2.88 weeks (- 4.41, - 1.35)] and in childhood [early childhood: - 0.3 years (- 0.60, 0.01); mid-childhood: - 0.48 years (- 0.77, - 0.18)] than males. When comparing self-reported Asian, Black, Hispanic, and more than one race or other racial/ethnic groups to White, we identified significant differences in EGAA and EAA at birth and in mid-childhood, but associations varied across clocks. Horvath EA at birth was positively associated with childhood Horvath and skin & blood EAA.Maternal smoking during pregnancy and child sex were associated with EGAA and EAA at multiple timepoints.

"37032822","Pain interference mediates the association between epigenetic aging and grip strength in middle to older aged males and females with chronic pain.","Front Aging Neurosci","Chronic pain is one of the leading causes of disability that may accelerate biological aging and reduce physical function. Epigenetic clocks provide an estimate of how the system ages and can predict health outcomes such as physical function. Physical function declines may be attributed to decreases in muscle quality due to disuse that can be measured quickly and noninvasively using grip strength. The purpose of this study was to explore the associations among self-reported pain, grip strength, and epigenetic aging in those with chronic pain.Participants (57.91 ± 8.04 years) completed pain questionnaires, a blood draw and hand grip strength task. We used an epigenetic clock previously associated with knee pain (DNAmGrimAge), and used the subsequent difference of predicted epigenetic age from chronological age (DNAmGrimAge-Difference).Exploratory pathway analyses revealed that pain intensity mediated the association between DNAmGrimAge-difference and handgrip strength in males only (β = -0.1115; CI [-0.2929, -0.0008]) and pain interference mediated the association between DNAmGrimAge-difference and handgrip strength in males β = -0.1401; CI [-0.3400, -0.0222]), and females (β = -0.024; CI [-0.2918, -0.0020]).Chronic knee pain may accelerate epigenetic aging processes that may influence handgrip strength in older age adults. Chronic pain could be a symptom of the aging body thus contributing to declines in musculoskeletal function in later life.Copyright © 2023 Peterson, Crow, Johnson, Meng, Rani, Huo, Foster, Fillingim and Cruz-Almeida."
"37025178","Epigenetic clocks and female fertility timeline: A new approach to an old issue?","Front Cell Dev Biol","Worldwide increase in life expectancy has boosted research on aging. Overcoming the concept of chronological age, higher attention has been addressed to biological age, which reflects a person's real health state, and which may be the resulting combination of both intrinsic and environmental factors. As epigenetics may exert a pivotal role in the biological aging, epigenetic clocks were developed. They are based on mathematical models aimed at identifying DNA methylation patterns that can define the biological age and that can be adopted for different clinical scopes (i.e., estimation of the risks of developing age-related disorders or predicting lifespan). Recently, epigenetic clocks have gained a peculiar attention in the fertility research field, in particular in the female counterpart. The insight into the possible relations between epigenetic aging and women's infertility might glean additional information about certain conditions that are still not completely understood. Moreover, they could disclose significant implications for health promotion programs in infertile women. Of relevance here is that the impact of biological age and epigenetics may not be limited to fertility status but could translate into pregnancy issues. Indeed, epigenetic alterations of the mother may transfer into the offspring, and pregnancy itself as well as related complications could contribute to epigenetic modifications in both the mother and newborn. However, even if the growing interest has culminated in the conspicuous production of studies on these topics, a global overview and the availability of validated instruments for diagnosis is still missing. The present narrative review aims to explore the possible bonds between epigenetic aging and fertility timeline. In the ""infertility"" section, we will discuss the advances on epigenetic clocks focusing on the different tissues examined (endometrium, peripheral blood, ovaries). In the ""pregnancy"" section, we will discuss the results obtained from placenta, umbilical cord and peripheral blood. The possible role of epigenetic aging on infertility mechanisms and pregnancy outcomes represents a question that may configure epigenetic clock as a bond between two apparently opposite worlds: infertility and pregnancy.Copyright © 2023 Li Piani, Vigano' and Somigliana."
"37024597","Heterogeneous aging across multiple organ systems and prediction of chronic disease and mortality.","Nat Med","Biological aging of human organ systems reflects the interplay of age, chronic disease, lifestyle and genetic risk. Using longitudinal brain imaging and physiological phenotypes from the UK Biobank, we establish normative models of biological age for three brain and seven body systems. Here we find that an organ's biological age selectively influences the aging of other organ systems, revealing a multiorgan aging network. We report organ age profiles for 16 chronic diseases, where advanced biological aging extends from the organ of primary disease to multiple systems. Advanced body age associates with several lifestyle and environmental factors, leukocyte telomere lengths and mortality risk, and predicts survival time (area under the curve of 0.77) and premature death (area under the curve of 0.86). Our work reveals the multisystem nature of human aging in health and chronic disease. It may enable early identification of individuals at increased risk of aging-related morbidity and inform new strategies to potentially limit organ-specific aging in such individuals.© 2023.

Especially in azoospermic men, use of ICSI with surgically retrieved testicular sperm has helped them have their own biological child. However, considering the immature nature of testicular sperm safety of testicular sperm has been debated.To compare reproductive outcomes, neonatal outcomes and the incidence of congenital malformations in children born after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), using different sperm origins.This is a retrospective study in which a total of 989 participants were enrolled. Study group (Testicular Sperm Aspiration (TESA) ICSI group) had 552 couples with female partners aged ≤37 and had self gamete cycles. ICSI cycles with ejaculated sperm (EJS) acted as the control group.All male patients underwent surgical sperm retrieval and all the women underwent controlled ovarian stimulation and transvaginal oocyte retrieval and Ovum Pick Up (OPU) as per the standard operating procedures of the clinic. Frozen embryo transfer with two good-grade blastocysts, which had shown 100% survival, were transferred in subsequent cycles.The Student'st-test was performed for age distribution; odds ratio was performed to find the confounding factors.Embryonic and reproductive outcomes were comparable and not statistically significant in the study and control groups. Incidence of congenital anomalies was observed in singleton live births and twin live births in both the TESA-ICSI group and the EJS-ICSI group, but the difference was not statistically significant.Our study revealed that congenital malformations in children born out of ICSI using testicular sperm and EJS were similar; no difference was observed in miscarriages between the testicular sperm-ICSI and EJS-ICSI group. Our data suggests that surgical sperm retrieval in couples with male factor infertility does not alter their reproductive outcome.Copyright: © 2022 Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences."

However, only few studies have addressed the impact of STR variation on phenotypic variation at both the organismal and molecular levels. Potential driving forces underlying the high mutation rates of STRs also remain largely unknown. Here, we leverage the recently generated expression and STR variation data among wild Caenorhabditis elegans strains to conduct a genome-wide analysis of how STRs affect gene expression variation. We identify thousands of expression STRs (eSTRs) showing regulatory effects and demonstrate that they explain missing heritability beyond SNV-based expression quantitative trait loci. We illustrate specific regulatory mechanisms such as how eSTRs affect splicing sites and alternative splicing efficiency. We also show that differential expression of antioxidant genes and oxidative stresses might affect STR mutations systematically using both wild strains and mutation accumulation lines. Overall, we reveal the interplay between STRs and gene expression variation by providing novel insights into regulatory mechanisms of STRs and highlighting that oxidative stress could lead to higher STR mutation rates.© The Author(s) 2023.

Physical performance was assessed throughout SFAS.Between-group differences (False Discovery Rate < 0.05) in 108 metabolites were detected. Selected candidates had higher levels of compounds within xenobiotic, pentose phosphate, and corticosteroid metabolic pathways, while non-selected candidates had higher levels of compounds potentially indicative of oxidative stress (i.e., sphingomyelins, acylcarnitines, glutathione, amino acids). Multiple compounds higher in non-selected versus selected candidates included: 1-carboxyethylphenylalanine; 4-hydroxy-nonenal-glutathione; α-hydroxyisocaproate; hexanoylcarnitine; sphingomyelin and were associated with lower diet quality and worse physical performance.  CONCLUSION: Candidates selected during SFAS had higher pre-SFAS levels of circulating metabolites that were associated with resistance to oxidative stress, higher physical performance and higher diet quality. In contrast, non-selected candidates had higher levels of metabolites potentially indicating elevated oxidative stress. These findings indicate that Soldiers who were selected for continued Special Forces training enter the SFAS course with metabolites associated with healthier diets and better physical performance. Additionally, the non-selected candidates had higher levels of metabolites that may indicate elevated oxidative stress, which could result from poor nutrition, non-functional overreaching/overtraining, or incomplete recovery from previous physical activity.© 2023.

This study aimed to investigate whether in vitro exposure to 0.1 μM permethrin and malathion at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h after cell culture initiation induced changes in the gene expression and DNA methylation in mononuclear cells from bone marrow and peripheral blood (BMMCs, PBMCs). Both pesticides induced several gene expression modifications in both tissues. Through gene ontology analysis, we found that permethrin deregulates ion channels in PBMCs and BMMCs and that malathion alters genes coding proteins with nucleic acid binding capacity, which was also observed in PBMCs exposed to permethrin. Additionally, we found that both insecticides deregulate genes coding proteins with chemotaxis functions, ion channels, and cytokines. Several genes deregulated in this study are potentially associated with cancer onset and development, and some of them have been reported to be deregulated in hematological cancer. We found that permethrin does not induce DNA hypermethylation but can induce hypomethylation, and that malathion generated both types of events. Our results suggest that these pesticides have the potential to modify gene expression through changes in promoter DNA methylation and potentially through other mechanisms that should be investigated."

Single-cell data allows reconstruction of personalized co-expression networks and therefore the identification of SNPs altering co-expression patterns (co-expression QTLs, co-eQTLs) and the affected upstream regulatory processes using a limited number of individuals.We conduct a co-eQTL meta-analysis across four scRNA-seq peripheral blood mononuclear cell datasets using a novel filtering strategy followed by a permutation-based multiple testing approach. Before the analysis, we evaluate the co-expression patterns required for co-eQTL identification using different external resources. We identify a robust set of cell-type-specific co-eQTLs for 72 independent SNPs affecting 946 gene pairs. These co-eQTLs are replicated in a large bulk cohort and provide novel insights into how disease-associated variants alter regulatory networks. One co-eQTL SNP, rs1131017, that is associated with several autoimmune diseases, affects the co-expression of RPS26 with other ribosomal genes. Interestingly, specifically in T cells, the SNP additionally affects co-expression of RPS26 and a group of genes associated with T cell activation and autoimmune disease. Among these genes, we identify enrichment for targets of five T-cell-activation-related transcription factors whose binding sites harbor rs1131017. This reveals a previously overlooked process and pinpoints potential regulators that could explain the association of rs1131017 with autoimmune diseases.Our co-eQTL results highlight the importance of studying context-specific gene regulation to understand the biological implications of genetic variation.

In Parkinson's Disease (PD), iron accumulation is a cardinal feature of degenerating regions in the brain and seems to be a key player in mechanisms that precipitate cell death. The aim of this study was to explore the genetic and genomic connection between NBIA and PD. We screened for known and rare pathogenic mutations in autosomal dominant and recessive genes linked to NBIA in a total of 4481 PD cases and 10,253 controls from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Parkinsons' Disease Program and the UKBiobank. We examined whether a genetic burden of NBIA variants contributes to PD risk through single-gene, gene-set, and single-variant association analyses. In addition, we assessed publicly available expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data through Summary-based Mendelian Randomization and conducted transcriptomic analyses in blood of 1886 PD cases and 1285 controls. Out of 29 previously reported NBIA screened coding variants, four were associated with PD risk at a nominal p value < 0.05. No enrichment of heterozygous variants in NBIA-related genes risk was identified in PD cases versus controls. Burden analyses did not reveal a cumulative effect of rare NBIA genetic variation on PD risk. Transcriptomic analyses suggested that DCAF17 is differentially expressed in blood from PD cases and controls. Due to low mutation occurrence in the datasets and lack of replication, our analyses suggest that NBIA and PD may be separate molecular entities.© 2023.

Advances in genomic technologies have driven the identification of multiple genetic loci associated with this disease, ranging from studying severe onset cases to investigating common multifactorial polygenic forms. Additionally, findings from epigenetic analyses of modifications to the genome that do not involve changes to the underlying DNA sequence have emerged as key signatures in the development of obesity. Such modifications can mediate the effects of environmental factors, including diet and lifestyle, on gene expression and clinical presentation. This review outlines what is known about the genetic and epigenetic contributors to obesity susceptibility, along with the albeit limited therapeutic options currently available.

"36993749","The genetic architecture of pain intensity in a sample of 598,339 U.S. veterans.","medRxiv","Chronic pain is a common problem, with more than one-fifth of adult Americans reporting pain daily or on most days. It adversely affects quality of life and imposes substantial personal and economic costs. Efforts to treat chronic pain using opioids played a central role in precipitating the opioid crisis. Despite an estimated heritability of 25-50%, the genetic architecture of chronic pain is not well characterized, in part because studies have largely been limited to samples of European ancestry. To help address this knowledge gap, we conducted a cross-ancestry meta-analysis of pain intensity in 598,339 participants in the Million Veteran Program, which identified 125 independent genetic loci, 82 of which are novel. Pain intensity was genetically correlated with other pain phenotypes, level of substance use and substance use disorders, other psychiatric traits, education level, and cognitive traits. Integration of the GWAS findings with functional genomics data shows enrichment for putatively causal genes (n = 142) and proteins (n = 14) expressed in brain tissues, specifically in GABAergic neurons. Drug repurposing analysis identified anticonvulsants, beta-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers, among other drug groups, as having potential analgesic effects. Our results provide insights into key molecular contributors to the experience of pain and highlight attractive drug targets."
"37041209","Within- and between-twin comparisons of risk for childhood behavioral difficulties after preterm birth.","Pediatr Res","Preterm birth and multiple gestation are independently associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. The objective of this study was to describe risks of screening positive for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and anxiety in preterm-born twin children by zygosity (monozygotic, dizygotic) and birth order (first-born, second-born).Caregivers of 349 preterm-born twin pairs (42% monozygotic) aged 3-18 years reported child behavioral outcomes on Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behavior; Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition; and Preschool Anxiety Scale or Screen for Child Anxiety and Related Emotional Disorders.Concordance for behavioral outcomes in twin pairs ranged from 80.06 to 89.31% for ADHD, 61.01 to 84.23% for ASD, and 64.76 to 73.35% for anxiety. Monozygotic twins had a greater risk than dizygotic of screening positive for inattention (risk ratio = 2.91, 95% CI = 1.48-5.72) and social anxiety (1.79, 1.23-2.61). Relative to first-born, second-born twins had a greater risk of screening positive for hyperactivity/impulsivity (1.51, 1.06-2.16); overall ASD (2.38, 1.62-3.49); difficulties with social awareness (2.68, 1.94-3.71), social cognition (4.45, 3.06-6.46), and social communication (2.36, 1.56-3.57); restricted/repetitive behavior (1.91, 1.30-2.81); overall anxiety (1.34, 1.10-1.64); generalized anxiety (1.34, 1.11-1.60); and social anxiety (1.32, 1.06-1.64).The current findings emphasize considering zygosity and birth order in preterm and multiple birth outcomes research, and highlight clinical implications for discharge planning, neurodevelopmental surveillance, and facilitating parenting and family support.Zygosity and birth order are important determinants of behavioral and socioemotional outcomes in preterm-born twins. Among 349 preterm-born twin pairs aged 3-18 years (42% monozygotic), 61-89% demonstrated concordance for behavioral and socioemotional outcomes. Monozygosity had greater risks than dizygosity for positive screening of inattention and social anxiety. Second-born twins had greater risks than first-born for hyperactivity/impulsivity, social difficulties (awareness, cognition, communication), restricted/repetitive behavior, and anxiety (generalized, social). These findings have implications for discharge planning, neurodevelopmental surveillance, and facilitating parenting and family support.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37009895","Glutamate shall not pass: a mechanistic role for astrocytic O-GlcNAc transferase in stress and depression.","J Clin Invest","Major depressive disorder, characterized by aberrant glutamatergic signaling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Depression is highly comorbid with metabolic disorders, but a mechanistic link is elusive. In this issue of the JCI, Fan and coauthors report that elevated posttranslational modification with the glucose metabolite N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) contributed to stress-induced establishment of depression-like behaviors in mice. This effect was specific to medial PFC (mPFC) astrocytes, with glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) identified as an OGT target. Specifically, O-GlcNAcylation of GLT-1 resulted in diminished glutamate clearance from excitatory synapses. Further, astrocytic OGT knockdown restored stress-induced deficits in glutamatergic signaling, promoting resilience. These findings provide a mechanistic link between metabolism and depression and have relevance for antidepressant targets."

The C57BL/6J strain is a suitable model for studying therapies aimed at extending healthy aging and longevity due to its relatively short lifespan and the availability of aging biomarkers. Epigenetic clocks based on DNA methylation profiles are reliable molecular biomarkers of aging, while frailty measurement tools are used to evaluate overall health during aging. In this study, we show that the systemic gene transfer of LAV-BPIFB4 in aged C57BL/6J mice was associated with a significant reduction in the epigenetic clock-based biological age, as measured by a three CpG clock method. Furthermore, LAV-BPIFB4 gene transfer resulted in an improvement of the Vitality Score with a reduction in the Frailty Index. These findings further support the use of LAV-BPIFB4 gene therapy to induce beneficial effects on epigenetic mechanisms associated with aging and frailty in aged mice, with potential implications for future therapies to prevent frailty in humans."

The intervention consisted of an 8-week program that included diet, sleep, exercise and relaxation guidance, supplemental probiotics and phytonutrients and nutritional coaching. DNA methylation and biological age analysis (Horvath DNAmAge clock (2013), normalized using the SeSAMe pipeline [a]) was conducted on blood samples at baseline and at the end of the 8-week period. Five of the six participants exhibited a biological age reduction of between 1.22 and 11.01 years from their baseline biological age. There was a statistically significant (p=.039) difference in the participants' mean biological age before (55.83 years) and after (51.23 years) the 8-week diet and lifestyle intervention, with an average decrease of 4.60 years. The average chronological age at the start of the program was 57.9 years and all but one participant had a biological age younger than their chronological age at the start of the program, suggesting that biological age changes were unrelated to disease improvement and instead might be attributed to underlying aging mechanisms."
"36882310","The Genetic Architectures of Functional and Structural Connectivity Properties within Cerebral Resting-State Networks.","eNeuro","Functional connectivity within resting-state networks (RSN-FC) is vital for cognitive functioning. RSN-FC is heritable and partially translates to the anatomic architecture of white matter, but the genetic component of structural connections of RSNs (RSN-SC) and their potential genetic overlap with RSN-FC remain unknown. Here, we perform genome-wide association studies (Ndiscovery= 24,336;Nreplication= 3412) and annotation on RSN-SC and RSN-FC. We identify genes for visual network-SC that are involved in axon guidance and synaptic functioning. Genetic variation in RSN-FC impacts biological processes relevant to brain disorders that previously were only phenotypically associated with RSN-FC alterations. Correlations of the genetic components of RSNs are mostly observed within the functional domain, whereas less overlap is observed within the structural domain and between the functional and structural domains. This study advances the understanding of the complex functional organization of the brain and its structural underpinnings from a genetics viewpoint.Copyright © 2023 Tissink et al."

Little is known about epigenetic programming at the level of NGFI-A (nerve growth factor-inducible protein A) putative binding site (CpG) of the NR3C1 exon 1F in dyads mother-child exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) more specifically in an unstudied region such as the sub-Saharan Africa where levels of violence are very high.Examine NR3C1 exon 1F methylation in response to IPV and possible association with cortisol concentration and mental health.We recruited 20 mother-child dyads exposed to IPV and a control group of 20 mother-child dyads not exposed to IPV. We administered self-reported questionnaires to measure mother's mental health and collected saliva samples for cortisol dosage and bisulfite sequencing of DNA methylation.Regarding the mothers, our results showed a significant difference in methylation level at CpG 16-21 sites of the NR3C1 exon 1F promoter region between the groups. In the exposed group as compared to the control group, there was a significant positive association between the level of methylation at CpG 16-21 sites and mother's mental health in particular anxiety symptoms. However, we did not find any significant correlation between methylation level and cortisol concentration. In children, we did not find any significant results.This study highlights a NGFI-A putative binding site (CpG 16-21) that is more methylated in mothers exposed to IPV and which may have the potential to confer vulnerability for psychopathologies.Copyright: © 2023 Wadji et al.

"37034826","Hyperarousal Symptom Severity in Women with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Might Be Associated with LINE-1 Hypomethylation in Childhood Sexual Abuse Victims.","Complex Psychiatry","Sexual assault and a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) are related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) development. Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1) are transposable elements, and their methylation is used to infer DNA global methylation. DNA methylation can be affected by trauma exposition which in turn would be associated with PTSD. Thus, we investigated if the LINE-1 methylation pattern is related to PTSD symptoms in females with a history of CSA.This is a case-control study that examined, at baseline (W1), 64 women victims of sexual assault diagnosed with PTSD and 31 patients with PTSD who completed the 1-year follow-up (W2). Participants were categorized into two groups according to the presence of CSA (PTSDCSA+: NW1 = 19, NW2 = 10; PTSDCSA-: NW1 = 45, NW2 = 21). PTSD symptoms (re-experiencing, avoidance, hyperarousal, alterations in cognition/mood) were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, and the history of CSA was assessed by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. LINE-1 methylation was measured in three sites (CpG1, CpG2, CpG3) located in the 5'UTR region using bisulfite conversion followed by pyrosequencing. Linear regression models were performed to test the relation between LINE-1 CpG sites methylation and PTSD symptoms.We found a negative association between CpG2 methylation and hyperarousal symptoms among those in the PTSDCSA+ group in W1 (adjustedp= 0.003) compared to the PTSDCSA- group (p> 0.05). Still, no association was observed between other PTSD symptoms and other CpG sites. Further, in the longitudinal analysis, LINE-1 hypomethylation was no longer observed in PTSD participants exposed to CSA.Our findings suggest that LINE-1 methylation may help understand the relationship between trauma and PTSD. However, more studies are needed to investigate LINE-1 as an epigenetic marker of psychiatric disorders.© 2023 S. Karger AG, Basel."
"37058565","Consensus molecular environment of schizophrenia risk genes in coexpression networks shifting across age and brain regions.","Sci Adv","Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental brain disorder whose genetic risk is associated with shifting clinical phenomena across the life span. We investigated the convergence of putative schizophrenia risk genes in brain coexpression networks in postmortem human prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), hippocampus, caudate nucleus, and dentate gyrus granule cells, parsed by specific age periods (totalN = 833). The results support an early prefrontal involvement in the biology underlying schizophrenia and reveal a dynamic interplay of regions in which age parsing explains more variance in schizophrenia risk compared to lumping all age periods together. Across multiple data sources and publications, we identify 28 genes that are the most consistently found partners in modules enriched for schizophrenia risk genes in DLPFC; twenty-three are previously unidentified associations with schizophrenia. In iPSC-derived neurons, the relationship of these genes with schizophrenia risk genes is maintained. The genetic architecture of schizophrenia is embedded in shifting coexpression patterns across brain regions and time, potentially underwriting its shifting clinical presentation."

This momentum has, in turn, fostered the development of putative molecular therapies. In this Review, we outline the current genetic knowledge, emphasizing recent discoveries and emerging concepts such as the implication of distinct types of mutation, variability in mutated genes in diverse genetic ancestries and gene-environment interactions. We also propose a high-level model to synthesize the interdependent effects of genetics, environmental and lifestyle factors, and ageing into a unified theory of ALS. Furthermore, we summarize the current status of therapies developed on the basis of genetic knowledge established for ALS over the past 30 years, and we discuss how developing treatments for ALS will advance our understanding of targeting other neurological diseases.© 2023.

"37024583","Precise modulation of transcription factor levels identifies features underlying dosage sensitivity.","Nat Genet","Transcriptional regulation exhibits extensive robustness, but human genetics indicates sensitivity to transcription factor (TF) dosage. Reconciling such observations requires quantitative studies of TF dosage effects at trait-relevant ranges, largely lacking so far. TFs play central roles in both normal-range and disease-associated variation in craniofacial morphology; we therefore developed an approach to precisely modulate TF levels in human facial progenitor cells and applied it to SOX9, a TF associated with craniofacial variation and disease (Pierre Robin sequence (PRS)). Most SOX9-dependent regulatory elements (REs) are buffered against small decreases in SOX9 dosage, but REs directly and primarily regulated by SOX9 show heightened sensitivity to SOX9 dosage; these RE responses partially predict gene expression responses. Sensitive REs and genes preferentially affect functional chondrogenesis and PRS-like craniofacial shape variation. We propose that such REs and genes underlie the sensitivity of specific phenotypes to TF dosage, while buffering of other genes leads to robust, nonlinear dosage-to-phenotype relationships.© 2023.

"37041330","Mitochondrial Inheritance Following Nuclear Transfer: From Cloned Animals to Patients with Mitochondrial Disease.","Methods Mol Biol","Mitochondria are indispensable power plants of eukaryotic cells that also act as a major biochemical hub. As such, mitochondrial dysfunction, which can originate from mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), may impair organism fitness and lead to severe diseases in humans. MtDNA is a multi-copy, highly polymorphic genome that is uniparentally transmitted through the maternal line. Several mechanisms act in the germline to counteract heteroplasmy (i.e., coexistence of two or more mtDNA variants) and prevent expansion of mtDNA mutations. However, reproductive biotechnologies such as cloning by nuclear transfer can disrupt mtDNA inheritance, resulting in new genetic combinations that may be unstable and have physiological consequences. Here, we review the current understanding of mitochondrial inheritance, with emphasis on its pattern in animals and human embryos generated by nuclear transfer.© 2023.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the impact of lockdowns on the smoking and vaping behaviours of adults during the pandemic.This was a systematic review and meta-analysis.A systematic literature search was conducted up to 28 April 2022 in the following databases: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science.In total, 77 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. In 34 studies, an increase in smoking behaviour was reported for the majority of participants; however, in 21 and 18 studies, 'no change' and 'decrease' in smoking were the predominant responses, respectively. The results from the meta-analysis, which examined the change in the number of cigarettes smoked per day, showed no difference between the pre- and post-lockdown periods: 0.81 weighted mean difference (95% confidence interval, -0.59 to 2.21). Regarding vaping, three of seven studies reported an increase in smoking for the majority of participants, whereas 'no change' and 'decrease' were the predominant answers in the other four studies.The results show that lockdowns led most participants to increase smoking/vaping, whereas a decrease or cessation of smoking/vaping was only reported in the minority of participants. Attention should be given to the non-communicable diseases that could arise as a result of the increase in smoking/vaping during lockdowns, and further research in this area is needed.Copyright © 2023 The Royal Society for Public Health.

"37038196","Distinct CSF biomarker-associated DNA methylation in Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal subjects.","Alzheimers Res Ther","Growing evidence has demonstrated that DNA methylation (DNAm) plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and that DNAm differences can be detected in the blood of AD subjects. Most studies have correlated blood DNAm with the clinical diagnosis of AD in living individuals. However, as the pathophysiological process of AD can begin many years before the onset of clinical symptoms, there is often disagreement between neuropathology in the brain and clinical phenotypes. Therefore, blood DNAm associated with AD neuropathology, rather than with clinical data, would provide more relevant information on AD pathogenesis.We performed a comprehensive analysis to identify blood DNAm associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathological biomarkers for AD. Our study included matched samples of whole blood DNA methylation, CSF Aβ42, phosphorylated tau181(pTau181), and total tau (tTau) biomarkers data, measured on the same subjects and at the same clinical visits from a total of 202 subjects (123 CN or cognitively normal, 79 AD) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. To validate our findings, we also examined the association between premortem blood DNAm and postmortem brain neuropathology measured on a group of 69 subjects in the London dataset.We identified a number of novel associations between blood DNAm and CSF biomarkers, demonstrating that changes in pathological processes in the CSF are reflected in the blood epigenome. Overall, the CSF biomarker-associated DNAm is relatively distinct in CN and AD subjects, highlighting the importance of analyzing omics data measured on cognitively normal subjects (which includes preclinical AD subjects) to identify diagnostic biomarkers, and considering disease stages in the development and testing of AD treatment strategies. Moreover, our analysis revealed biological processes associated with early brain impairment relevant to AD are marked by DNAm in the blood, and blood DNAm at several CpGs in the DMR on HOXA5 gene are associated with pTau181in the CSF, as well as tau-pathology and DNAm in the brain, nominating DNAm at this locus as a promising candidate AD biomarker.Our study provides a valuable resource for future mechanistic and biomarker studies of DNAm in AD.© 2023.

The results showed high heterogeneity (I2=90.83%, p<0.001). So, we used random-effects model. However, NLR can be utilized to identify the radiological severity and staging of pulmonary sarcoidosis due to statistically significant variations. An elevation in NLR values may assist both sarcoidosis diagnosis and lung parenchyma involvement. Also, extra-pulmonary involvement was just more probable to be found in individuals diagnosed with sarcoidosis inhibiting high rates of NLR. High NLR levels were found to be associated with an accelerated rate of progression, revealing that NLR might be used to detect Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) as a complication of sarcoidosis.In the visualizations of the disease, NLR was revealed to be a beneficial and straightforward fundamental laboratory biomarker connected to disease severity and requirement for therapy."

However, the molecular mechanisms leading to the loss of transcriptional fidelity are so far elusive, as are ways of preventing it. Here we profiled and analysed genome-wide, ageing-related changes in transcriptional processes across different organisms: nematodes, fruitflies, mice, rats and humans. The average transcriptional elongation speed (RNA polymerase II speed) increased with age in all five species. Along with these changes in elongation speed, we observed changes in splicing, including a reduction of unspliced transcripts and the formation of more circular RNAs. Two lifespan-extending interventions, dietary restriction and lowered insulin-IGF signalling, both reversed most of these ageing-related changes. Genetic variants in RNA polymerase II that reduced its speed in worms5and flies6increased their lifespan. Similarly, reducing the speed of RNA polymerase II by overexpressing histone components, to counter age-associated changes in nucleosome positioning, also extended lifespan in flies and the division potential of human cells. Our findings uncover fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying animal ageing and lifespan-extending interventions, and point to possible preventive measures.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We previously showed in cell lines that altered exonic CpG methylation can modify promoter start sites, and hence protein isoform expression, for the human TP53 tumor suppressor gene. Here we extend this work to the in vivo setting by testing whether synonymous germline modifications of exonic CpG sites affect murine development, fertility, longevity, or cancer incidence. We substituted the DNA-binding exons 5-8 of Trp53, the mouse ortholog of human TP53, with variant-CpG (either CpG-depleted or -enriched) sequences predicted to encode the normal p53 amino acid sequence; a control construct was also created in which all non-CpG sites were synonymously substituted. Homozygous Trp53-null mice were the only genotype to develop tumors. Mice with variant-CpG Trp53 sequences remained tumor-free, but were uniquely prone to dental anomalies causing jaw malocclusion (p < .0001). Since the latter phenotype also characterises murine Rett syndrome due to dysfunction of the trans-repressive MeCP2 methyl-CpG-binding protein, we hypothesise that CpG sites may exert non-coding phenotypic effects via pre-translational cis-interactions of 5-methylcytosine with methyl-binding proteins which regulate mRNA transcript initiation, expression or splicing, although direct effects on mRNA structure or translation are also possible.Copyright: © 2023 Epstein et al.

However, the upstream regulators that coordinate these events are relatively underexplored. Here, usingZfp281knockout mouse and degron knock-in cell models, we uncover the direct transcriptional activation ofDnmt3a/3bby ZFP281 in pluripotent stem cells. Chromatin co-occupancy of ZFP281 and DNA hydroxylase TET1, dependent on the formation of R loops in ZFP281-targeted gene promoters, undergoes a ""high-low-high"" bimodal pattern regulating dynamic DNA methylation and gene expression during the naïve-formative-primed transitions.

Our study demonstrates a previously unappreciated role for ZFP281 in coordinating DNMT3A/3B and TET1 functions to promote pluripotent state transitions.The naive, formative, and primed pluripotent states and their interconversions recapitulate pluripotency continuum during early development. Huang and colleagues investigated the transcriptional programs during successive pluripotent state transitions and revealed an essential role for ZFP281 in coordinating DNMT3A/3B and TET1 to establish the DNA methylation and gene expression programs during the transitions.ZFP281 activatesDnmt3a/3b in vitroin pluripotent stem cells andin vivoin epiblast.

"36961833","Phenotypic plasticity evolves at multiple biological levels in response to environmental predictability in a long-term experiment with a halotolerant microalga.","PLoS Biol","Phenotypic plasticity, the change in the phenotype of a given genotype in response to its environment of development, is a ubiquitous feature of life, enabling organisms to cope with variation in their environment. Theoretical studies predict that, under stationary environmental variation, the level of plasticity should evolve to match the predictability of selection at the timing of development. However, the extent to which patterns of evolution of plasticity for more integrated traits are mirrored by their underlying molecular mechanisms remains unclear, especially in response to well-characterized selective pressures exerted by environmental predictability. Here, we used experimental evolution with the microalgae Dunaliella salina under controlled environmental fluctuations, to test whether the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in responses to environmental predictability (as measured by the squared autocorrelation ρ2) occurred across biological levels, going from DNA methylation to gene expression to cell morphology. Transcriptomic analysis indicates clear effects of salinity and ρ2 × salinity interaction on gene expression, thus identifying sets of genes involved in plasticity and its evolution. These transcriptomic effects were independent of DNA methylation changes in cis. However, we did find ρ2-specific responses of DNA methylation to salinity change, albeit weaker than for gene expression. Overall, we found consistent evolution of reduced plasticity in less predictable environments for DNA methylation, gene expression, and cell morphology. Our results provide the first clear empirical signature of plasticity evolution at multiple levels in response to environmental predictability, and highlight the importance of experimental evolution to address predictions from evolutionary theory, as well as investigate the molecular basis of plasticity evolution.Copyright: © 2023 Leung et al.

Monthly air pollution level was estimated using a validated ordinary Kriging method and assigned to individuals. Time-dependent Cox models were developed to estimate the relationship between monthly PM10and O3exposures and the all-cause and cause-specific hospitalizations after adjusting for confounders. The interaction between air pollution and individual factors was also investigated.Overall, each 10 μg/m3increase in PM10concentration was associated with a 3.1% (95%CI: 1.3%-4.9%) increment in the risk of all-cause hospitalization. The estimate was even greater following O3exposure (6.8%, 5.5%-8.2%). Furthermore, each 10 μg/m3increase in PM10was associated with a 2.3%-9.1% elevation in all the cause-specific hospitalizations except for those related to respiratory and digestive diseases. The same increment in O3was relevant to a 4.7%-22.8% elevation in the risk except for respiratory diseases. Additionally, the older individuals tended to be more vulnerable to PM10exposure (Pinteraction: 0.002), while the alcohol abused and those with an abnormal BMI were more vulnerable to the impact of O3(Pinteraction: 0.052 and 0.011). However, the heavy smokers were less vulnerable to O3exposure (Pinteraction: 0.032).We provide comprehensive evidence on the hospitalization hazard of monthly PM10and O3exposure and their interaction with individual factors.Copyright © 2023 Ju, Yimaer, Du, Wang, Cai, Chen, Zhang, Wu, Wu, Lin, Wang, Jiang, Hu, Zhang and Hao."
"36993614","MIMOSA: A resource consisting of improved methylome imputation models increases power to identify DNA methylation-phenotype associations.","medRxiv","DNA methylation has been shown to be involved in the etiology of many complex diseases, yet the specific key underlying methylation sites remain largely unknown. One strategy to identify putative causal CpG sites and enhance disease etiology understanding is to conduct methylome-wide association studies (MWASs), in which predicted or measured DNA methylation that is associated with complex diseases can be identified. However, current MWAS models are trained with relatively small reference datasets, limiting the ability to adequately handle CpG sites with low genetic heritability. Here, we introduce a new resource, MWAS Imputing Methylome Obliging Summary-level mQTLs and Associated LD matrices (MIMOSA), a set of models that substantially improve the prediction accuracy of DNA methylation and subsequent MWAS power through the use of a large, summary-level mQTL dataset provided by the Genetics of DNA Methylation Consortium (GoDMC). With the analyses of GWAS summary statistics for 28 complex traits and diseases, we demonstrate that MIMOSA considerably increases the accuracy of DNA methylation prediction in blood, crafts fruitful prediction models for low heritability CpG sites, and determines markedly more CpG site-phenotype associations than preceding methods."

However, whether these and other associations are present during childhood remains unclear. Using data from 5556 genomically-confirmed European ancestry youth who completed the baseline session of the ongoing the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSMStudy (ABCD Study®), our phenome-wide association study estimating associations between four indices of genetic risk for late-onset AD (i.e., AD polygenic risk scores (PRS), APOE rs429358 genotype, AD PRS with the APOE region removed (ADPRS-APOE), and an interaction between ADPRS-APOEand APOE genotype) and 1687 psychosocial, behavioral, and neural phenotypes revealed no significant associations after correction for multiple testing (all ps > 0.0002; all pfdr > 0.07). These data suggest that AD genetic risk may not phenotypically manifest during middle-childhood or that effects are smaller than this sample is powered to detect.© 2023.

"37025349","The early life course-related traits with three psychiatric disorders: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.","Front Psychiatry","Several studies have indicated a potential association between early life course-related traits and neurological and psychiatric disorders in adulthood, but the causal link remains unclear.Instrumental variables (IVs) that have been shown to be strongly associated with exposure were obtained from summary data of genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Four early life course-related traits [i.e., birthweight (BW), childhood body mass index (BMI), early body size, and age at first birth (AFB)] were used as exposure IVs to estimate their causal associations with three neurological and psychiatric diseases [i.e., Alzheimer's disease (AD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]. Four different statistical methods, i.e., inverse-variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger (MRE), weighted median (WM), and weighted mode (Wm), were performed in our MR analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed by using the leave-one-out method, and horizontal pleiotropy was assessed using the MR-PRESSO package.There was evidence suggesting that BW has a causal effect on AD (ORMR-PRESSO = 1.05,p = 1.14E-03), but this association was not confirmedviamultivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) (ORMVMR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02,p = 3.00E-01). A strong relationship was observed between childhood BMI and ADHD among both sexes; a 1-SD increase in BMI significantly predicted a 1.46-fold increase in the OR for ADHD (p = 9.13E-06). In addition, a similar relationship was found between early life body size and ADHD (ORMR-PRESSO = 1.47,p = 9.62E-05), and this effect was mainly driven by male participants (ORMR-PRESSO = 1.50,p = 1.28E-3). Earlier AFB could significantly predict a higher risk of MDD (ORMR-PRESSO = 1.19,p = 1.96E-10) and ADHD (ORMR-PRESSO = 1.45,p = 1.47E-15). No significant causal associations were observed between the remaining exposures and outcomes.Our results reveal the adverse effects of childhood obesity and preterm birth on the risk of ADHD later in life. The results of MVMR also show that lower BW may have no direct relationship with AD after adjusting for BMI. Furthermore, AFB may predict a higher risk of MDD.Copyright © 2023 He, Mo, Zhu, Luo, Liu, Huang and Sheng."
"37027097","Connecting the mechanisms of tumor sex differences with cancer therapy.","Mol Cell Biochem","Sex differences in cancer incidence and survival are constant and pronounced globally, across all races and all age groups of cancer types. In 2016, after the National Institutes of Health proposed a policy of utilizing sex as a biological variable, researchers started paying more attention to the molecular mechanisms behind gender variations in cancer. Historically, most previous studies investigating sex differences have been centered on gonadal sex hormones. Nevertheless, sex differences also involve genetic and molecular pathways that run throughout the entire process of cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and treatment response, in addition to sex hormones. In particular, there is significant gender dimorphism in the efficacy and toxicity of oncology treatments, including conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as the emerging targeted therapies and immunotherapy. To be clear, not all mechanisms will exhibit gender bias, and not all gender bias will affect cancer risk. Our goal in this review is to discuss some of the significant sex-related changes in fundamental cancer pathways. To this purpose, we summarize the differential impact of gender on cancer development in three dimensions: sex hormones, genetics, and epigenetics, and focus on current hot subjects including tumor suppressor function, immunology, stem cell renewal, and non-coding RNAs. Clarifying the essential mechanisms of gender differences will help guide the clinical treatment of both sexes in tumor radiation and chemotherapy, medication therapy with various targets, immunotherapy, and even drug development. We anticipate that sex-differentiated research will help advance sex-based cancer personalized medicine models and encourage future basic scientific and clinical research to take sex into account.© 2023.

Rad54 like 2 (Rad54l2) which might be one of key effector proteins of DNA damage mediated by estrogen was downregulated in numerous cancers, however, its role in epidemiological characteristics of Xp11.2 tRCC was needed to further study. We reviewed 1005 Xp11.2 tRCC cases and collected estrogen data and then compared the onset time of Xp11.2 tRCC cases in female with estrogen changing trend. An RNA-sequencing was performed in estrogen treated HK-2 cells and subsequently bioinformatic analysis was applied based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and GEO database. The male-to-female ratio of Xp11.2 tRCC was 1:1.4 and the median age of onset was 29.7 years old. The onset trend of female was similar to estrogen physiological rhythm (r = 0.67, p < 0.01). In Xp11.2 tRCC and HK-2 cells after estrogen treatment, Rad54l2 was downregulated, and GSEA showed that pathways significantly enriched in DNA damage repair and cancer related clusters after estrogen treated, as well as GO and KEGG analysis. Downregulation of Rad54l2 was in numerous cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), in which Rad54l2 expression was significantly decreased in male, age over 60 years old, T2&T3&T4 stages, pathologic SII&SIII&SIV stages as well as histologic G3&G4 grades, and cox regression analysis proved that Rad54l2 expression was a risk factor for overall survival, disease-specific survival and progression-free interval in univariate analysis. There existed female predominance in Xp11.2 tRCC and Rad54l2 might play vital role in estrogen mediating female predominance in Xp11.2 tRCC.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37035206","The RNA helicase DDX3 and its role in c-MYC driven germinal center-derived B-cell lymphoma.","Front Oncol","DDX3X is an RNA helicase with many functions in RNA metabolism such as mRNA translation, alternative pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA stability, but also plays a role as a regulator of transcription as well as in the Wnt/beta-catenin- and Nf-κB signaling pathways. The gene encoding DDX3X is located on the X-chromosome, but escapes X-inactivation. Hence females have two active copies and males only one. However, the Y chromosome contains the gene for the male DDX3 homologue, calledDDX3Y, which has a very high sequence similarity and functional redundancy with DDX3X, but shows a more restricted protein expression pattern than DDX3X. High throughput sequencing of germinal center (GC)-derived B-cell malignancies such as Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) and Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) samples showed a high frequency of loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in theDDX3Xgene revealing several features that distinguish this gene from others. First,DDX3Xmutations occur with high frequency particularly in those GC-derived B-cell lymphomas that also show translocations of thec-MYCproto-oncogene, which occurs in almost all BL and a subset of DLBCL. Second,DDX3XLOF mutations occur almost exclusively in males and is very rarely found in females. Third, mutations in the male homologueDDX3Yhave never been found in any type of malignancy. Studies with human primary GC B cells from male donors showed that a loss ofDDX3Xfunction helps the initial process of B-cell lymphomagenesis by buffering the proteotoxic stress induced by c-MYC activation. However, full lymphomagenesis requires DDX3 activity since an upregulation of DDX3Y expression is invariably found in GC derived B-cell lymphoma withDDX3XLOF mutation. Other studies with male transgenic mice that lackDdx3x, but constitutively express activatedc-Myctransgenes in B cells and are therefore prone to develop B-cell malignancies, also showed upregulation of the DDX3Y protein expression during the process of lymphomagenesis. Since DDX3Y is not expressed in normal human cells, these data suggest that DDX3Y may represent a new cancer cell specific target to develop adjuvant therapies for male patients with BL and DLBCL and LOF mutations in theDDX3Xgene.Copyright © 2023 Lacroix, Beauchemin, Khandanpour and Möröy."

Aside from hormones, the mechanisms driving sex-dependent bone mass regulation are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that the X-linked H3K4me2/3 demethylase KDM5C regulates sex-specific bone mass. Loss of KDM5C in hematopoietic stem cells or bone marrow monocytes increases bone mass in female but not male mice. Mechanistically, loss of KDM5C impairs the bioenergetic metabolism, resulting in impaired osteoclastogenesis. Treatment with the KDM5 inhibitor reduces osteoclastogenesis and energy metabolism of both female mice and human monocytes. Our report details a sex-dependent mechanism for bone homeostasis, connecting epigenetic regulation to osteoclast metabolism and positions KDM5C as a potential target for future treatment of osteoporosis in women."
"36856073","TET2 confers a mechanistic link of microRNA-210 and mtROS in hypoxia-suppressed spontaneous transient outward currents in uterine arteries of pregnant sheep.","J Physiol","Hypoxia during pregnancy impairs uterine vascular adaptation via microRNA-210 (miR-210)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) generation. TET methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) participates in regulating inflammation and oxidative stress and its deficiency contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple cardiovascular diseases. Thus, we hypothesize a role of TET2 in hypoxia/miR-210-mediated mtROS suppressing spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) in uterine arteries. We found that gestational hypoxia downregulated TET2 in uterine arteries of pregnant sheep and TET2 was a target of miR-210. Knockdown of TET2 with small interfering RNAs suppressed mitochondrial respiration, increased mtROS, inhibited STOCs and elevated myogenic tone. By contrast, overexpression of TET2 negated hypoxia- and miR-210-induced mtROS. The effects of TET2 knockdown in uterine arteries on mtROS, STOCs and myogenic contractions were blocked by the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ. In addition, the recovery effects of inhibiting endogenous miR-210 with miR-210-LNA on hypoxia-induced suppression of STOCs and augmentation of myogenic tone were reversed by TET2 knockdown in uterine arteries. Together, our study reveals a novel mechanistic link between the miR-210-TET2-mtROS pathway and inhibition of STOCs and provides new insights into the understanding of uterine vascular maladaptation in pregnancy complications associated with gestational hypoxia. KEY POINTS: Gestational hypoxia downregulates TET methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) in uterine arteries of pregnant sheep. TET2 is a downstream target of microRNA-210 (miR-210) and miR-210 mediates hypoxia-induced TET2 downregulation. Knockdown of TET2 in uterine arteries recapitulates the effect of hypoxia and miR-210 and impairs mitochondrial bioenergetics and increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) . Overexpression of TET2 negates the effect of hypoxia and miR-210 on increasing mtROS. TET2 knockdown reiterates the effect of hypoxia and miR-210 and suppresses spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) and elevates myogenic tone, and these effects are blocked by MitoQ. Knockdown of TET2 reverses the miR-210-LNA-induced reversal of the effects of hypoxia on STOCs and myogenic tone in uterine arteries.© 2023 The Authors.

"37065462","Fountain of youth-Targeting autophagy in aging.","Front Aging Neurosci","As our society ages inexorably, geroscience and research focusing on healthy aging is becoming increasingly urgent. Macroautophagy (referred to as autophagy), a highly conserved process of cellular clearance and rejuvenation has attracted much attention due to its universal role in organismal life and death. Growing evidence points to autophagy process as being one of the key players in the determination of lifespan and health. Autophagy inducing interventions show significant improvement in organismal lifespan demonstrated in several experimental models. In line with this, preclinical models of age-related neurodegenerative diseases demonstrate pathology modulating effect of autophagy induction, implicating its potential to treat such disorders. In humans this specific process seems to be more complex. Recent clinical trials of drugs targeting autophagy point out some beneficial effects for clinical use, although with limited effectiveness, while others fail to show any significant improvement. We propose that using more human-relevant preclinical models for testing drug efficacy would significantly improve clinical trial outcomes. Lastly, the review discusses the available cellular reprogramming techniques used to model neuronal autophagy and neurodegeneration while exploring the existing evidence of autophagy's role in aging and pathogenesis in human-derivedin vitromodels such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons (iPSC-neurons) or induced neurons (iNs).Copyright © 2023 Danics, Abbas, Kis and Pircs."
"37047770","Protocol Optimization for Direct Reprogramming of Primary Human Fibroblast into Induced Striatal Neurons.","Int J Mol Sci","The modeling of neuropathology on induced neurons obtained by cell reprogramming technologies can fill a gap between clinical trials and studies on model organisms for the development of treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. Patient-specific models based on patients' cells play an important role in such studies. There are two ways to obtain induced neuronal cells. One is based on induced pluripotent stem cells. The other is based on direct reprogramming, which allows us to obtain mature neuronal cells from adult somatic cells, such as dermal fibroblasts. Moreover, the latter method makes it possible to better preserve the age-related aspects of neuropathology, which is valuable for diseases that occur with age. However, direct methods of reprogramming have a significant drawback associated with low cell viability during procedures. Furthermore, the number of reprogrammable neurons available for morphological and functional studies is limited by the initial number of somatic cells. In this article, we propose modifications of a previously developed direct reprogramming method, based on the combination of microRNA and transcription factors, which allowed us to obtain a population of functionally active induced striatal neurons (iSNs) with a high efficiency. We also overcame the problem of the presence of multinucleated neurons associated with the cellular division of starting fibroblasts. Synchronization cells in the G1 phase increased the homogeneity of the fibroblast population, increased the survival rate of induced neurons, and eliminated the presence of multinucleated cells at the end of the reprogramming procedure. We have demonstrated that iSNs are functionally active and able to form synaptic connections in co-cultures with mouse cortical neurons. The proposed modifications can also be used to obtain a population of other induced neuronal types, such as motor and dopaminergic ones, by selecting transcription factors that determine differentiation into a region-specific neuron."
"37055548","Programming of metabolism by adipokines during development.","Nat Rev Endocrinol","The intrauterine and early postnatal periods represent key developmental stages in which an organism is highly susceptible to being permanently influenced by maternal factors and nutritional status. Strong evidence indicates that either undernutrition or overnutrition during development can predispose individuals to disease later in life, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, a concept known as metabolic programming. Adipose tissue produces important signalling molecules that control energy and glucose homeostasis, including leptin and adiponectin. In addition to their well-characterized metabolic effects in adults, adipokines have been associated with metabolic programming by affecting different aspects of development. Therefore, alterations in the secretion or signalling of adipokines, caused by nutritional insults in early life, might lead to metabolic diseases in adulthood. This Review summarizes and discusses the potential role of several adipokines in inducing metabolic programming through their effects during development. The identification of the endocrine factors that act in early life to permanently influence metabolism represents a key step in understanding the mechanisms behind metabolic programming. Thus, future strategies aiming to prevent and treat these metabolic diseases can be designed, taking into consideration the relationship between adipokines and the developmental origins of health and disease.© 2023.

Its etiology and pathogenesis are poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested potential changes in the complement and coagulation pathways in individuals with ASD. In this study, using multiple reactions monitoring proteomic technology, 16 of the 33 proteins involved in this pathway were identified as differentially-expressed proteins in plasma between children with ASD and controls. Among them, CFHR3, C4BPB, C4BPA, CFH, C9, SERPIND1, C8A, F9, and F11 were found to be altered in the plasma of children with ASD for the first time. SERPIND1 expression was positively correlated with the CARS score. Using the machine learning method, we obtained a panel composed of 12 differentially-expressed proteins with diagnostic potential for ASD. We also reviewed the proteins changed in this pathway in the brain and blood of patients with ASD.

While no TP53-targeting drugs have been approved in the USA or Europe so far, preclinical and clinical studies are underway to investigate targeting of specific or all TP53 mutations, for example, by restoration of the functionality of mutated TP53 (TP53mut) or protecting wildtype TP53 (TP53wt) from negative regulation. We performed a comprehensive mRNA expression analysis in 24 cancer types of TCGA to extract (i) a consensus expression signature shared across TP53 mutation types and cancer types, (ii) differential gene expression patterns between tumors harboring different TP53 mutation types such as loss of function, gain of function or dominant-negative mutations, and (iii) cancer-type-specific patterns of gene expression and immune infiltration. Analysis of mutational hotspots revealed both similarities across cancer types and cancer type-specific hotspots. Underlying ubiquitous and cancer type-specific mutational processes with the associated mutational signatures contributed to explaining this observation. Virtually no genes were differentially expressed between tumors harboring different TP53 mutation types, while hundreds of genes were over- and underexpressed in TP53mut compared to TP53wt tumors. A consensus list included 178 genes that were overexpressed and 32 genes that were underexpressed in the TP53mut tumors of at least 16 of the investigated 24 cancer types. In an association analysis of immune infiltration with TP53 mutations in 32 cancer subtypes, decreased immune infiltration was observed in six subtypes, increased infiltration in two subtypes, a mixed pattern of decreased and increased immune cell populations in four subtypes, while immune infiltration was not associated with TP53 status in 20 subtypes. The analysis of a large cohort of human tumors complements results from experimental studies and supports the view that TP53 mutations should be further evaluated as predictive markers for immunotherapy and targeted therapies.© 2023.

"37047013","Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) Mutations in Cancer Cells.","Int J Mol Sci","Arginine methylation is a form of posttranslational modification that regulates many cellular functions such as development, DNA damage repair, inflammatory response, splicing, and signal transduction, among others. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is one of nine identified methyltransferases, and it can methylate both histone and non-histone targets. It has pleiotropic functions, including recruitment of repair machinery to a chromosomal DNA double strand break (DSB) and coordinating the interplay between repair and checkpoint activation. Thus, PRMT5 has been actively studied as a cancer treatment target, and small molecule inhibitors of its enzymatic activity have already been developed. In this report, we analyzed all reported PRMT5 mutations appearing in cancer cells using data from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancers (COSMIC). Our goal is to classify mutations as either drivers or passengers to understand which ones are likely to promote cellular transformation. Using gold standard artificial intelligence algorithms, we uncovered several key driver mutations in the active site of the enzyme (D306H, L315P, and N318K). In silico protein modeling shows that these mutations may affect the affinity of PRMT5 for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is required as a methyl donor. Electrostatic analysis of the enzyme active site shows that one of these mutations creates a tunnel in the vicinity of the SAM binding site, which may allow interfering molecules to enter the enzyme active site and decrease its activity. We also identified several non-coding mutations that appear to affect PRMT5 splicing. Our analyses provide insights into the role of PRMT5 mutations in cancer cells. Additionally, since PRMT5 single molecule inhibitors have already been developed, this work may uncover future directions in how mutations can affect targeted inhibition."

To address the complexity of the cancer-genomic landscape and extract meaningful insights, numerous computational approaches have been developed over the last two decades. In this review, we survey the current leading computational methods to derive intricate mutational patterns in the context of clinical relevance. We begin with mutation signatures, explaining first how mutation signatures were developed and then examining the utility of studies using mutation signatures to correlate environmental effects on the cancer genome. Next, we examine current clinical research that employs mutation signatures and discuss the potential use cases and challenges of mutation signatures in clinical decision-making. We then examine computational studies developing tools to investigate complex patterns of mutations beyond the context of mutational signatures. We survey methods to identify cancer-driver genes, from single-driver studies to pathway and network analyses. In addition, we review methods inferring complex combinations of mutations for clinical tasks and using mutations integrated with multi-omics data to better predict cancer phenotypes. We examine the use of these tools for either discovery or prediction, including prediction of tumor origin, treatment outcomes, prognosis, and cancer typing. We further discuss the main limitations preventing widespread clinical integration of computational tools for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. We end by proposing solutions to address these challenges using recent advances in machine learning."
"37046083","Aberrant activation of TCL1A promotes stem cell expansion in clonal haematopoiesis.","Nature","Mutations in a diverse set of driver genes increase the fitness of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), leading to clonal haematopoiesis1. These lesions are precursors for blood cancers2-6, but the basis of their fitness advantage remains largely unknown, partly owing to a paucity of large cohorts in which the clonal expansion rate has been assessed by longitudinal sampling. Here, to circumvent this limitation, we developed a method to infer the expansion rate from data from a single time point. We applied this method to 5,071 people with clonal haematopoiesis. A genome-wide association study revealed that a common inherited polymorphism in the TCL1A promoter was associated with a slower expansion rate in clonal haematopoiesis overall, but the effect varied by driver gene. Those carrying this protective allele exhibited markedly reduced growth rates or prevalence of clones with driver mutations in TET2, ASXL1, SF3B1 and SRSF2, but this effect was not seen in clones with driver mutations in DNMT3A. TCL1A was not expressed in normal or DNMT3A-mutated HSCs, but the introduction of mutations in TET2 or ASXL1 led to the expression of TCL1A protein and the expansion of HSCs in vitro. The protective allele restricted TCL1A expression and expansion of mutant HSCs, as did experimental knockdown of TCL1A expression. Forced expression of TCL1A promoted the expansion of human HSCs in vitro and mouse HSCs in vivo. Our results indicate that the fitness advantage of several commonly mutated driver genes in clonal haematopoiesis may be mediated by TCL1A activation.© 2023.

Both accuracy and area under the curve were used as performance measures in five-fold cross-validation.A total of 475 models using unconstrained genes, and 112 models using protein-coding genes were selected for future inference purposes.

SNVs and small indels were the most common types of somatic mutations, and increased up to twofold to threefold by whole-body X-irradiation. Base substitution patterns in the SNVs suggested a role of reactive oxygen species in radiation mutagenesis, and signature analysis of single base substitutions (SBS) revealed a dose-dependent increase of SBS40. Most of spontaneous small deletions were shrinkage of tandem repeats, and X-irradiation specifically induced small deletions out of tandem repeats (non-repeat deletions). Presence of microhomology sequences in non-repeat deletions suggested involvement of microhomology mediated end-joining repair mechanisms as well as nonhomologous end-joining in radiation-induced DNA damages. We also identified multisite mutations and structural variants (SV), i.e., large indels, inversions, reciprocal translocations, and complex variants. The radiation-specificity of each mutation type was evaluated from the spontaneous mutation rate and the per-Gy mutation rate estimated by linear regression, and was highest with non-repeat deletions without microhomology, followed by those with microhomology, SV except retroelement insertions, and multisite mutations; these types were thus revealed as mutational signatures of ionizing radiation. Further analysis of somatic mutations in multiple LT-HSCs indicated that large fractions of postirradiation LT-HSCs originated from single LT-HSCs that survived the irradiation and then expanded in vivo to confer marked clonality to the entire hematopoietic system, with varying clonal expansion and dynamics depending on radiation dose and fractionation."
"36799304","The multi-tissue landscape of somatic mtDNA mutations indicates tissue-specific accumulation and removal in aging.","Elife","Accumulation of somatic mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) has long been proposed as a possible mechanism of mitochondrial and tissue dysfunction that occurs during aging. A thorough characterization of age-associated mtDNA somatic mutations has been hampered by the limited ability to detect low-frequency mutations. Here, we used Duplex Sequencing on eight tissues of an aged mouse cohort to detect >89,000 independent somatic mtDNA mutations and show significant tissue-specific increases during aging across all tissues examined which did not correlate with mitochondrial content and tissue function. G→A/C→T substitutions, indicative of replication errors and/or cytidine deamination, were the predominant mutation type across all tissues and increased with age, whereas G→T/C→A substitutions, indicative of oxidative damage, were the second most common mutation type, but did not increase with age regardless of tissue. We also show that clonal expansions of mtDNA mutations with age is tissue- and mutation type-dependent. Unexpectedly, mutations associated with oxidative damage rarely formed clones in any tissue and were significantly reduced in the hearts and kidneys of aged mice treated at late age with elamipretide or nicotinamide mononucleotide. Thus, the lack of accumulation of oxidative damage-linked mutations with age suggests a life-long dynamic clearance of either the oxidative lesions or mtDNA genomes harboring oxidative damage.© 2023, Sanchez-Contreras, Sweetwyne et al."
"37047386","The Landscape of Accessible Chromatin and Developmental Transcriptome Maps Reveal a Genetic Mechanism of Skeletal Muscle Development in Pigs.","Int J Mol Sci","The epigenetic regulation mechanism of porcine skeletal muscle development relies on the openness of chromatin and is also precisely regulated by transcriptional machinery. However, fewer studies have exploited the temporal changes in gene expression and the landscape of accessible chromatin to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling muscle development. To address this, skeletal muscle biopsy samples were taken from Landrace pigs at days 0 (D0), 60 (D60), 120 (D120), and 180 (D180) after birth and were then analyzed using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. The RNA-seq analysis identified 8554 effective differential genes, among whichACBD7,TMEM220,andATP1A2were identified as key genes related to the development of porcine skeletal muscle. Some potential cis-regulatory elements identified by ATAC-seq analysis contain binding sites for many transcription factors, including SP1 and EGR1, which are also the predicted transcription factors regulating the expression ofACBD7genes. Moreover, the omics analyses revealed regulatory regions that become ectopically active after birth during porcine skeletal muscle development after birth and identified 151,245, 53,435, 30,494, and 40,911 peaks. The enriched functional elements are related to the cell cycle, muscle development, and lipid metabolism. In summary, comprehensive high-resolution gene expression maps were developed for the transcriptome and accessible chromatin during postnatal skeletal muscle development in pigs."
"37020498","Relationship between lysine methyltransferase levels and heterochromatin gene repression in living cells and in silico.","PNAS Nexus","Gene regulation plays essential roles in all multicellular organisms, allowing for different specialized tissue types to be generated from a complex genome. Heterochromatin-driven gene repression, associated with a physical compaction of the genome, is a pathway involving core components that are conserved from yeast to human. Posttranslational modification of chromatin is a critical component of gene regulation. Specifically, tri-methylation of the nucleosome component histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me3) is a key feature of this pathway along with the hallmark heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Histone methyltransferases are recruited by HP1 to deposit H3K9me3 marks which nucleate and recruit more HP1 in a process that spreads from the targeting site to signal for gene repression. One of the enzymes recruited is SETDB1, a methyltransferase which putatively catalyzes posttranslational methylation marks on H3K9. To better understand the contribution of SETDB1 in heterochromatin formation, we downregulated SETDB1 through knockdown by a dCas9-KRAB system and examined heterochromatin formation in a chromatin in vivo assay (CiA-Oct4). We studied the contribution of SETDB1 to heterochromatin formation kinetics in a developmentally crucial locus,Oct4. Our data demonstrate that SETDB1 reduction led to a delay in both gene silencing and in H3K9me3 accumulation. Importantly, SETDB1 knockdown to a ∼50% level did not stop heterochromatin formation completely. Particle-based Monte Carlo simulations in 3D space with explicit representation of key molecular processes enabled the elucidation of how SETDB1 downregulation affects the individual molecular processes underlying heterochromatin formation.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37020022","Large-scale mapping and mutagenesis of human transcriptional effector domains.","Nature","Human gene expression is regulated by more than 2,000 transcription factors and chromatin regulators1,2. Effector domains within these proteins can activate or repress transcription. However, for many of these regulators we do not know what type of effector domains they contain, their location in the protein, their activation and repression strengths, and the sequences that are necessary for their functions. Here, we systematically measure the effector activity of more than 100,000 protein fragments tiling across most chromatin regulators and transcription factors in human cells (2,047 proteins). By testing the effect they have when recruited at reporter genes, we annotate 374 activation domains and 715 repression domains, roughly 80% of which are new and have not been previously annotated3-5. Rational mutagenesis and deletion scans across all the effector domains reveal aromatic and/or leucine residues interspersed with acidic, proline, serine and/or glutamine residues are necessary for activation domain activity. Furthermore, most repression domain sequences contain sites for small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation, short interaction motifs for recruiting corepressors or are structured binding domains for recruiting other repressive proteins. We discover bifunctional domains that can both activate and repress, some of which dynamically split a cell population into high- and low-expression subpopulations. Our systematic annotation and characterization of effector domains provide a rich resource for understanding the function of human transcription factors and chromatin regulators, engineering compact tools for controlling gene expression and refining predictive models of effector domain function.© 2023.

Genome-wide association studies in up to 40,095 participants (18 population-based cohorts, 66.3 ± 8.6 yr, 96.9% European ancestry) revealed 24 genome-wide significant PVS risk loci, mainly in the white matter. These were associated with white matter PVS already in young adults (N = 1,748; 22.1 ± 2.3 yr) and were enriched in early-onset leukodystrophy genes and genes expressed in fetal brain endothelial cells, suggesting early-life mechanisms. In total, 53% of white matter PVS risk loci showed nominally significant associations (27% after multiple-testing correction) in a Japanese population-based cohort (N = 2,862; 68.3 ± 5.3 yr). Mendelian randomization supported causal associations of high blood pressure with basal ganglia and hippocampal PVS, and of basal ganglia PVS and hippocampal PVS with stroke, accounting for blood pressure. Our findings provide insight into the biology of PVS and cerebral small vessel disease, pointing to pathways involving extracellular matrix, membrane transport and developmental processes, and the potential for genetically informed prioritization of drug targets.© 2023.

The datasets are mapped to matched, diploid genomes with long-read phasing and structural variants, instantiating a catalog of >1 million allele-specific loci. These loci exhibit coordinated activity along haplotypes and are less conserved than corresponding, non-allele-specific ones. Surprisingly, a deep-learning transformer model can predict the allele-specific activity based only on local nucleotide-sequence context, highlighting the importance of transcription-factor-binding motifs particularly sensitive to variants. Furthermore, combining EN-TEx with existing genome annotations reveals strong associations between allele-specific and GWAS loci. It also enables models for transferring known eQTLs to difficult-to-profile tissues (e.g., from skin to heart).

Here, nine deconvolution methods were evaluated with sample-matched data from bulk-tissue RNAseq, single-cell/nuclei (sc/sn) RNAseq, and immunohistochemistry. A total of 1,130,767 nuclei/cells from 149 adult postmortem brains and 72 organoid samples were used. The results showed the best performance of dtangle for estimating cell proportions and bMIND for estimating sample-wise cell-type gene expression. For eight brain cell types, 25,273 cell-type eQTLs were identified with deconvoluted expressions (decon-eQTLs). The results showed that decon-eQTLs explained more schizophrenia GWAS heritability than bulk-tissue or single-cell eQTLs alone. Differential gene expression associated with multiple phenotypes were also examined using the deconvoluted data. Our findings, which were replicated in bulk-tissue RNAseq and sc/snRNAseq data, provided new insights into the biological applications of deconvoluted data."

"36939312","The lingering effects of Neanderthal introgression on human complex traits.","Elife","The genetic variants introduced into the ancestors of modern humans from interbreeding with Neanderthals have been suggested to contribute an unexpected extent to complex human traits. However, testing this hypothesis has been challenging due to the idiosyncratic population genetic properties of introgressed variants. We developed rigorous methods to assess the contribution of introgressed Neanderthal variants to heritable trait variation and applied these methods to analyze 235,592 introgressed Neanderthal variants and 96 distinct phenotypes measured in about 300,000 unrelated white British individuals in the UK Biobank. Introgressed Neanderthal variants make a significant contribution to trait variation (explaining 0.12% of trait variation on average). However, the contribution of introgressed variants tends to be significantly depleted relative to modern human variants matched for allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium (about 59% depletion on average), consistent with purifying selection on introgressed variants. Different from previous studies (McArthur et al., 2021), we find no evidence for elevated heritability across the phenotypes examined. We identified 348 independent significant associations of introgressed Neanderthal variants with 64 phenotypes. Previous work (Skov et al., 2020) has suggested that a majority of such associations are likely driven by statistical association with nearby modern human variants that are the true causal variants. Applying a customized fine-mapping led us to identify 112 regions across 47 phenotypes containing 4303 unique genetic variants where introgressed variants are highly likely to have a phenotypic effect. Examination of these variants reveals their substantial impact on genes that are important for the immune system, development, and metabolism.© 2023, Wei, Robles et al."

Moreover, causal variants are hard to statistically fine-map at many loci because of widespread linkage disequilibrium. To address this challenge, we present a strategy utilizing transcription factor (TF) binding quantitative trait loci (bQTLs) for colocalization analysis to identify trait associations likely mediated by TF occupancy variation and to pinpoint likely causal variants using motif scores. We applied this approach to PU.1 bQTLs in lymphoblastoid cell lines and blood cell traits GWAS data. Colocalization analysis revealed 69 blood cell trait GWAS loci putatively driven by PU.1 occupancy variation. We nominate PU.1 motif-altering variants as the likely shared causal variants at 51 loci. Such integration of TF bQTL data with other GWAS data may reveal transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and causal noncoding variants underlying additional complex traits."

Although regular exercise may contribute to disease prevention and health promotion, reliable early biomarkers are required to objectively discern people performing low PA from those who exercise enough. Here, we aimed to identify potential transcript-based biomarkers through the analysis of a whole-genome microarray in peripheral blood cells (PBC) from physically less active (n = 10) comparing with more active (n = 10) children. A set of genes differentially expressed (p < 0.01, Limma test) in less physically active children were identified, including the down-regulation of genes related to cardiometabolic benefits and improved skeletal function (KLB, NOX4, and SYPL2), and the up-regulation of genes whose elevated expression levels are associated with metabolic complications (IRX5, UBD, and MGP). The analysis of the enriched pathways significantly affected by PA levels were those associated with protein catabolism, skeletal morphogenesis, and wound healing, among others, which may suggest a differential impact of low PA on these processes. Microarray analysis comparing children according to their usual PA has revealed potential PBC transcript-based biomarkers that may be useful in early discerning children expending high sedentary time and its associated negative consequences.© 2023.

While COPD is clinically defined by applying thresholds to summary measures of lung function, a quantitative liability score has more power to identify genetic signals. Here we train a deep convolutional neural network on noisy self-reported and International Classification of Diseases labels to predict COPD case-control status from high-dimensional raw spirograms and use the model's predictions as a liability score. The machine-learning-based (ML-based) liability score accurately discriminates COPD cases and controls, and predicts COPD-related hospitalization without any domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the ML-based liability score is associated with overall survival and exacerbation events. A genome-wide association study on the ML-based liability score replicates existing COPD and lung function loci and also identifies 67 new loci. Lastly, our method provides a general framework to use ML methods and medical-record-based labels that does not require domain knowledge or expert curation to improve disease prediction and genomic discovery for drug design.© 2023.

Literature-based network analysis was conducted to construct molecular pathways connecting MDD and COVID-19.We found that MDD has positive genetic correlations with COVID-19 outcomes (rg: 0.10-0.15).

Iron homeostasis plays a very important role in the inflammatory response and is closely related to the pathogenesis of AS. This study aimed to use large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data to study the genetic causal relationship between AS and iron homeostasis using Mendelian randomization (MR).Genome-wide association study summary data of AS and iron homeostasis-related indicators were obtained from the FinnGen consortium and the DeCODE genetics database, respectively. We used four iron homeostasis-related indicators: ferritin, serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (TSAT) for two-sample MR analyses to test for genetic causal association with AS using the ""TwoSampleMR"" package of the R software (version 4.1.2). The random-effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was the main analysis method used for MR. We examined the MR analysis results for heterogeneity, horizontal pleiotropy, and possible outliers. In addition, we confirmed the robustness of the MR analysis by testing whether the results were affected by a single SNP and whether they followed a normal distribution.The random-effects IVW results showed that ferritin [p = 0.225, OR 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.836 (0.627-1.116)], serum iron [p = 0.714, OR 95% CI = 0.948 (0.714-1.260)], TIBC [p = 0.380, OR 95% CI = 0.917 (0.755-1.113)], and TSAT [p = 0.674, OR 95% CI = 0.942 (0.713-1.244)] have no genetic causal relationship with AS.

"36993707","Testing for differences in polygenic scores in the presence of confounding.","bioRxiv","Polygenic scores have become an important tool in human genetics, enabling the prediction of individual phenotypes from their genotypes. Understanding how the pattern of differences in polygenic score predictions across individuals intersects with variation in ancestry can provide insights into the evolutionary forces acting on the trait in question, and is important for understanding health disparities. However, because most polygenic scores are computed using effect estimates from population samples, they are susceptible to confounding by both genetic and environmental effects that are correlated with ancestry. The extent to which this confounding drives patterns in the distribution of polygenic scores depends on patterns of population structure in both the original estimation panel and in the prediction/test panel. Here, we use theory from population and statistical genetics, together with simulations, to study the procedure of testing for an association between polygenic scores and axes of ancestry variation in the presence of confounding. We use a simple model of genetic relatedness to describe how confounding in the estimation panel biases the distribution of polygenic scores in a way that depends on the degree of overlap in population structure between panels. We then show how this confounding can bias tests for associations between polygenic scores and important axes of ancestry variation in the test panel. We then use the understanding gained from this analysis to develop a simple method that leverages the patterns of genetic similarity between the two panels to guard against these biases, and show that this method can provide better protection against confounding than the standard PCA-based approach."
"36993611","Guidelines for Evaluating the Comparability of Down-Sampled GWAS Summary Statistics.","bioRxiv","Proprietary genetic datasets are valuable for boosting the statistical power of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), but their use can restrict investigators from publicly sharing the resulting summary statistics. Although researchers can resort to sharing down-sampled versions that exclude restricted data, down-sampling reduces power and might change the genetic etiology of the phenotype being studied. These problems are further complicated when using multivariate GWAS methods, such as genomic structural equation modeling (Genomic SEM), that model genetic correlations across multiple traits. Here, we propose a systematic approach to assess the comparability of GWAS summary statistics that include versus exclude restricted data. Illustrating this approach with a multivariate GWAS of an externalizing factor, we assessed the impact of down-sampling on (1) the strength of the genetic signal in univariate GWASs, (2) the factor loadings and model fit in multivariate Genomic SEM, (3) the strength of the genetic signal at the factor level, (4) insights from gene-property analyses, (5) the pattern of genetic correlations with other traits, and (6) polygenic score analyses in independent samples. For the externalizing GWAS, down-sampling resulted in a loss of genetic signal and fewer genome-wide significant loci, while the factor loadings and model fit, gene-property analyses, genetic correlations, and polygenic score analyses are robust. Given the importance of data sharing for the advancement of open science, we recommend that investigators who share down-sampled summary statistics report these analyses as accompanying documentation to support other researchers' use of the summary statistics."

We found 393 and 756 significant loci with and without adjusting for globals, respectively, where 8% and 45% loci were associated with more than one region. Results from analyses without adjustment for globals recovered loci associated with global measures. Genetic factors that contribute to total surface area of the cortex particularly expand anterior/frontal regions, whereas those contributing to thicker cortex predominantly increase dorsal/frontal-parietal thickness. Interactome-based analyses revealed significant genetic overlap of global and dorsolateral prefrontal modules, enriched for neurodevelopmental and immune system pathways. Consideration of global measures is important in understanding the genetic variants underlying cortical morphology."
"36821378","Nutrient regulation of the islet epigenome controls adaptive insulin secretion.","J Clin Invest","Adaptation of the islet β cell insulin-secretory response to changing insulin demand is critical for blood glucose homeostasis, yet the mechanisms underlying this adaptation are unknown. Here, we have shown that nutrient-stimulated histone acetylation plays a key role in adapting insulin secretion through regulation of genes involved in β cell nutrient sensing and metabolism. Nutrient regulation of the epigenome occurred at sites occupied by the chromatin-modifying enzyme lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1) in islets. β Cell-specific deletion of Lsd1 led to insulin hypersecretion, aberrant expression of nutrient-response genes, and histone hyperacetylation. Islets from mice adapted to chronically increased insulin demand exhibited shared epigenetic and transcriptional changes. Moreover, we found that genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes were enriched at LSD1-bound sites in human islets, suggesting that interpretation of nutrient signals is genetically determined and clinically relevant. Overall, these studies revealed that adaptive insulin secretion involves Lsd1-mediated coupling of nutrient state to regulation of the islet epigenome."

Domestication and crop breeding often target the scaling traits in the opposite directions. The genetic mechanism of the size scaling influencing the pattern of size scaling remains unexplored. Here, we revisited a diverse barley (Hordeum vulgareL.) panel with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) profile and the measurement of their plant height and seed weight to explore the possible genetic mechanisms that may lead to a correlation of the two traits and the influence of domestication and breeding selection on the size scaling. Plant height and seed weight are heritable and remain positively correlated in domesticated barley regardless of growth type and habit. Genomic structural equation modeling systematically evaluated the pleiotropic effect of individual SNP on the plant height and seed weight within a trait correlation network. We discovered seventeen novel SNPs (quantitative trait locus) conferring pleiotropic effect on plant height and seed weight, involving genes with function in diverse traits related to plant growth and development. Linkage disequilibrium decay analysis revealed that a considerable proportion of genetic markers associated with either plant height or seed weight are closely linked in the chromosome. We conclude that pleiotropy and genetic linkage likely form the genetic bases of plant height and seed weight scaling in barley. Our findings contribute to understanding the heritability and genetic basis of size scaling and open a new venue for seeking the underlying mechanism of allometric scaling in plants.Copyright © 2023 Tianhua He et al."

The molecular and cellular routes that underlie how epigenetic marks are transmitted at fertilization, to resist epigenetic reprogramming in the embryo, and drive phenotypic changes are only now beginning to be unraveled. Here, we provide an overview of the state of the field of intergenerational paternal epigenetic inheritance in mammals and present new insights into the relationship between embryo development and the three pillars of epigenetic inheritance: chromatin, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs. We evaluate compelling evidence of sperm-mediated transmission and retention of paternal epigenetic marks in the embryo. Using landmark examples, we discuss how sperm-inherited regions may escape reprogramming to impact development via mechanisms that implicate transcription factors, chromatin organization, and transposable elements. Finally, we link paternally transmitted epigenetic marks to functional changes in the pre- and post-implantation embryo. Understanding how sperm-inherited epigenetic factors influence embryo development will permit a greater understanding related to the developmental origins of health and disease.© 2023.

However, identifying the best imputation methods and what measures meaningfully evaluate performance are open questions. We address these questions by comprehensively analyzing 23 methods from the ENCODE Imputation Challenge. We find that imputation evaluations are challenging and confounded by distributional shifts from differences in data collection and processing over time, the amount of available data, and redundancy among performance measures. Our analyses suggest simple steps for overcoming these issues and promising directions for more robust research.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37072475","DNMT1 mutant ants develop normally but have disrupted oogenesis.","Nat Commun","Although DNA methylation is an important gene regulatory mechanism in mammals, its function in arthropods remains poorly understood. Studies in eusocial insects have argued for its role in caste development by regulating gene expression and splicing. However, such findings are not always consistent across studies, and have therefore remained controversial. Here we use CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 in the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi. Mutants have greatly reduced DNA methylation, but no obvious developmental phenotypes, demonstrating that, unlike mammals, ants can undergo normal development without DNMT1 or DNA methylation. Additionally, we find no evidence of DNA methylation regulating caste development. However, mutants are sterile, whereas in wild-type ants, DNMT1 is localized to the ovaries and maternally provisioned into nascent oocytes. This supports the idea that DNMT1 plays a crucial but unknown role in the insect germline.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37056564","Epigenetically regulated lncRNAs dissect the intratumoural heterogeneity and facilitate immune evasion of glioblastomas.","Theranostics","Background:Glioblastomas are the most common and malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors that occupied a highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TIME). Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), whose expression can be modified by DNA methylation, are emerging as critical regulators in the immune system. However, knowledge about the epigenetic changes in lncRNAs and their contribution to the immune heterogeneity of glioma is still lacking.Methods:In this study, we integrated paired methylome and transcriptome datasets of glioblastomas and identified 2 robust immune subtypes based on lncRNA methylation features. The immune characteristics of glioma subtypes were compared. Furthermore, immune-related lncRNAs were identified and their relationships with immune evasion were evaluated.Results:Glioma immunophenotypes exhibited distinct immune-related characteristics as well as clinical and epigenetic features. 149 epigenetically regulated (ER) lncRNAs were recognized that possessed inverse variation in epigenetic and transcriptional levels between glioma subtypes. Immune-related lncRNAs were further identified through the investigation of their correlation with immune cell infiltrations and immune-related pathways. In particular, the 'Hot' glioma subtype with higher immunoactivity while a worse survival outcome was found to character immune evasion features. We finally prioritized candidate ER lncRNAs associated with immune evasion markers and response to glioma immunotherapy. Among them, CD109-AS1 and LINC02447 were validated as novel immunoevasive biomarkers for glioma throughin vitroexperiments.Conclusion:In summary, our study systematically reveals the crosstalk among DNA methylation, lncRNA, and immune regulation in glioblastomas, and will facilitate the development of epigenetic immunotherapy approaches.© The author(s)."

In this study, we first analyzed recent large genome-wide associations studies (GWAS) on SCZ (n = 53,386, Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Wave 3) and OCD (n = 2688, the International Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Foundation Genetics Collaborative (IOCDF-GC) and the OCD Collaborative Genetics Association Study (OCGAS)) using a conjunctional false discovery rate (FDR) approach to evaluate overlap in common genetic variants of European descent. Using a variety of biological resources, we functionally characterized the identified genomic loci. Then we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the bidirectional causal association between SCZ and OCD. Results showed that there is a positive genetic correlation between SCZ and OCD (rg= 0.36, P = 0.02). We identified that one genetic locus (lead SNP rs5757717 in an intergenic region at CACNA1I) was jointly associated with SCZ and OCD (conjFDR = 2.12 × 10-2). Mendelian randomization results showed that variants associated with increased risk for SCZ also increased the risk of OCD. This study broadens our understanding of the genetic architectures underpinning SCZ and OCD and suggests that the same molecular genetic processes may be responsible for shared pathophysiological and clinical characteristics between the two disorders.© 2023.

However, the prevalence and impact of cryptic antisense transcription from the opposite strand of protein-coding genes were mostly unknown in cancer. Applying a robust computational pipeline to publicly available transcriptome and epigenome datasets, we identified hundreds of previously unannotated cryptic antisense polyadenylated transcripts (CAPTs) that were enriched in tumor samples. We showed that the activation of cryptic antisense transcription was associated with increased chromatin accessibility and active histone marks. Accordingly, we found that many of the antisense transcripts were inducible by treatment of epigenetic drugs. Moreover, CRISPR-mediated epigenetic editing assays revealed that transcription of a noncoding RNALRRK1-CAPT promoted LUSC cell proliferation, suggesting its oncogenic role. Our findings largely expand our understanding of cancer-associated transcription events, which may facilitate the development of novel strategies for cancer diagnosis and treatment."
"36993565","Cis -regulatory control of transcriptional timing and noise in response to estrogen.","bioRxiv","Cis-Regulatory Elements (CREs) control transcription levels, temporal dynamics, and cell-cell variation - often referred to as transcriptional noise. However, the combination of regulatory proteins and epigenetic features necessary to control different transcription attributes is not fully understood. Here, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is conducted during a time course of estrogen treatment to identify genomic predictors of expression timing and noise. We find that genes associated with multiple active enhancers exhibit faster temporal responses. Synthetic modulation of enhancer activity verifies that activating enhancers accelerates expression responses, while inhibiting enhancers results in a more gradual response. Noise is controlled by a balance of promoter and enhancer activity. Active promoters are found at genes with low noise levels, whereas active enhancers are associated with high noise. Finally, we observe that co-expression across single cells is an emergent property associated with chromatin looping, timing, and noise levels. Overall, our results indicate a fundamental tradeoff between a geneâ€™s ability to quickly respond to incoming signals and maintain low variation across cells."
"36993500","Efficient Hi-C inversion facilitates chromatin folding mechanism discovery and structure prediction.","bioRxiv","Genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments have revealed many structural features of chromatin across multiple length scales. Further understanding genome organization requires relating these discoveries to the mechanisms that establish chromatin structures and reconstructing these structures in three dimensions, but both objectives are difficult to achieve with existing algorithms that are often computationally expensive. To alleviate this challenge, we present an algorithm that efficiently converts Hi-C data into contact energies, which measure the interaction strength between genomic loci brought into proximity. Contact energies are local quantities unaffected by the topological constraints that correlate Hi-C contact probabilities. Thus, extracting contact energies from Hi-C contact probabilities distills the biologically unique information contained in the data. We show that contact energies reveal the location of chromatin loop anchors, support a phase separation mechanism for genome compartmentalization, and parameterize polymer simulations that predict three-dimensional chromatin structures. Therefore, we anticipate that contact energy extraction will unleash the full potential of Hi-C data and that our inversion algorithm will facilitate the widespread adoption of contact energy analysis.The three-dimensional organization of the genome is essential to many DNA-templated processes, and numerous experimental techniques have been introduced to characterize its features. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture experiments, or Hi-C, have proven particularly useful, reporting the interaction frequency between pairs of DNA segmentsin vivoand genome-wide. However, the polymer topology of chromosomes complicates Hi-C data analysis, which often employs sophisticated algorithms without explicitly accounting for the disparate processes affecting each interaction frequency. In contrast, we introduce a computational framework based on polymer physics arguments that efficiently removes the correlation between Hi-C interaction frequencies and quantifies how each local interaction influences genome folding globally. This framework facilitates the identification of mechanistically important interactions and the prediction of three-dimensional genome structures."

COPD is often comorbid with mood disorders; however, they are frequently neglected or undiagnosed in COPD management, thus resulting in unintended treatment outcomes and higher mortality associated with the disease. Although the exact link between COPD and mood disorders remains to be ascertained, there is a broader opinion that inflammatory reactions in the lungs, blood, and inflammation-induced changes in the brain could orchestrate the onset of mood disorders in COPD. Although the current management of mood disorders such as depression in COPD involves using antidepressants, their use has been limited due to tolerability issues. On the other hand, as omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) play a vital role in regulating inflammatory responses, they could be promising alternatives in managing mood disorders in COPD. This review discusses comorbid mood disorders in COPD as well as their influence on the progression and management of COPD. The underlying mechanisms of comorbid mood disorders in COPD will also be discussed, along with the potential role of n-3 PUFAs in managing these conditions."

Preclinicalin vitroandin vivodata indicate that dodecyl creatine ester (DCE) which increases the creatine brain content, might be a therapeutic option for CTD patients. To gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology and DCE treatment efficacy in CTD, this study focuses on the identification of biomarkers related to cognitive improvement in a Slc6a8 knockout mouse model (Slc6a8-/y) engineered to mimic the clinical features of CTD patients which have low brain creatine content. Shotgun proteomics analysis of 4,035 proteins in four different brain regions; the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus (associated with cognitive functions) and brain stem, and muscle as a control, was performed in 24 mice. Comparison of the protein abundance in the four brain regions between DCE-treated intranasally Slc6a8-/y mice and wild type and DCE-treated Slc6a8-/y and vehicle group identified 14 biomarkers, shedding light on the mechanism of action of DCE. Integrative bioinformatics and statistical modeling identified key proteins in CTD, including KIF1A and PLCB1. The abundance of these proteins in the four brain regions was significantly correlated with both the object recognition and the Y-maze tests.

Deregulation of cellular pathways envisaging metabolism, transcription, translation, and epigenetics caused by these risk factors either individually or in unison is manifold, resulting in the increased risk of oral cancer. Globally, this cancer continues to exist as one of the major causes of cancer-related mortalities; the numbers in the developing South Asian countries clearly indicate yearly escalation. This review encompasses the variety of genetic modifications, including adduct formation, mutation (duplication, deletion, and translocation), and epigenetic changes evident in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In addition, it highlights the interference caused by tobacco products in Wnt signaling, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, JAK-STAT, and other important pathways. The information provided also ensures a comprehensive and critical revisit to non-tobacco-induced OSCC.

"37063266","Sex chromosome complement and sex steroid signaling underlie sex differences in immunity to respiratory virus infection.","Front Pharmacol","Epidemiological studies have revealed sex differences in the incidence and morbidity of respiratory virus infection in the human population, and often these observations are correlated with sex differences in the quality or magnitude of the immune response. Sex differences in immunity and morbidity also are observed in animal models of respiratory virus infection, suggesting differential dominance of specific immune mechanisms. Emerging research shows intrinsic sex differences in immune cell transcriptomes, epigenomes, and proteomes that may regulate human immunity when challenged by viral infection. Here, we highlight recent research into the role(s) of sex steroids and X chromosome complement in immune cells and describe how these findings provide insight into immunity during respiratory virus infection. We focus on the regulation of innate and adaptive immune cells by receptors for androgen and estrogens, as well as genes with a propensity to escape X chromosome inactivation. A deeper mechanistic knowledge of these pathways will help us to understand the often significant sex differences in immunity to endemic or pandemic respiratory pathogens such as influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses and pathogenic coronaviruses.Copyright © 2023 Miller, Williams and Kovats."

So far, it remains unclear whether transplanted hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) undergo epigenetic changes upon engraftment in recipient bone marrow (BM) after AHSCT and whether these changes might be useful in the transplant diagnostics. The purpose of this study was to characterize the whole genome methylation profile of HSPCs following AHSCT. Moreover, the relationship between the observed methylation signature and patient outcome was analyzed. Mobilized peripheral blood (mPB)-HSPCs from seven donors and BM-HSPCs longitudinally collected from transplanted patients with hematological malignancies up to one year from AHSCT (a total of twenty-eight samples) were analyzed using DNA methylation based-arrays. The obtained data showed that DNA methylation of mPB-HSPCs differs between young and adult donors and changes following HSPC engraftment in the BM of recipient patients. Looking at methylation in promoter regions, at 30 days post-AHSCT, BM-HSPCs showed a higher number of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) compared to those of mPB-HSPCs, with a prevalent hyper-methylation. These changes were maintained during all the analyzed time points, and methylation became like the donors after one year from transplant. Functional analysis of these DMGs showed an enrichment in cell adhesion, differentiation and cytokine (interleukin-2, -5 and -7) production and signaling pathways. Of note, DNA methylation analysis allowed to identify a potential ""cancer/graft methylation signature"" of transplant failure. It was evident in the latest available post-transplant BM-HSPC sample (at 160 days) and surprisingly already in early phase (at 30 days) in patients whose transplant was doomed to fail. Overall, the analysis of HSPC methylation profile could offer useful prognostic information to potentially assess engraftment success and predict graft failure in AHSCT.© 2023. The Author(s)."

While COPD is defined by spirometry, many COPD characteristics are seen in cigarette smokers with normal spirometry. The extent to which COPD and COPD heterogeneity is captured in omics of lung tissue is not known.We clustered gene expression and methylation data in 78 lung tissue samples from former smokers with normal lung function or severe COPD. We applied two integrative omics clustering methods: (1) Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) and (2) Entropy-Based Consensus Clustering (ECC).SNF clusters were not significantly different by the percentage of COPD cases (48.8% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.13), though were different according to median forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted (82 vs. 31, p = 0.017). In contrast, the ECC clusters showed stronger evidence of separation by COPD case status (48.2% vs. 81.8%, p = 0.013) and similar stratification by median FEV1% predicted (82 vs. 30.5, p = 0.0059). ECC clusters using both gene expression and methylation were identical to the ECC clustering solution generated using methylation data alone. Both methods selected clusters with differentially expressed transcripts enriched for interleukin signaling and immunoregulatory interactions between lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells.Unsupervised clustering analysis from integrated gene expression and methylation data in lung tissue resulted in clusters with modest concordance with COPD, though were enriched in pathways potentially contributing to COPD-related pathology and heterogeneity.© 2023.

Therefore, CPT1A is a desirable drug target for clinical therapy. The deep comprehension of human CPT1A is crucial for developing the therapeutic inhibitors like Etomoxir. CPT1A is an appealing druggable target for cancer therapies since it is essential for the survival, proliferation, and drug resistance of cancer cells. It will help to lower the risk of cancer recurrence and metastasis, reduce mortality, and offer prospective therapy options for clinical treatment if the effects of CPT1A on the lipid metabolism of cancer cells are inhibited. Targeted inhibition of CPT1A can be developed as an effective treatment strategy for cancers from a metabolic perspective. However, the pathogenic mechanism and recent progress of CPT1A in diseases have not been systematically summarized.

However, the crosstalk between epigenetic markers and the gut microbiome in obesity remains unclear. The main objective of this study was to establish a link between the gut microbiota and DNA methylation patterns in subjects with obesity by identifying differentially methylated DNA regions (DMRs) that could be potentially regulated by the gut microbiota. DNA methylation and bacterial DNA sequencing analysis were performed on 342 subjects with a BMI between 18 and 40 kg/m2. DNA methylation analyses identified a total of 2648 DMRs associated with BMI, while ten bacterial genera were associated with BMI. Interestingly, only the abundance ofRuminococcuswas associated with one BMI-related DMR, which is located between theMACROD2/SEL1L2genes. TheRuminococcusabundance negatively correlated with BMI, while the hypermethylated DMR was associated with reduced MACROD2 protein levels in serum. Additionally, the mediation test showed that 19% of the effect ofRuminococcusabundance on BMI is mediated by the methylation of theMACROD2/SEL1L2DMR. These findings support the hypothesis that a crosstalk between gut microbiota and epigenetic markers may be contributing to obesity development."

To capture conserved aging signatures, we studied long-lived C57BL/6J and short-lived NZO/HILtJ mouse strains by profiling transcriptomes and epigenomes of immune cells from peripheral blood and the spleen from young and old mice. Transcriptional activation of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, particularly Fos, Junb, and Jun genes, was the most significant and conserved aging signature across tissues and strains. ATAC-seq data analyses showed that the chromatin around these genes was more accessible with age and there were significantly more binding sites for these TFs with age across all studied tissues, targeting pro-inflammatory molecules including Il6. Age-related increases in binding sites of JUN and FOS factors were also conserved in human peripheral blood ATAC-seq data. Single-cell RNA-seq data from the mouse aging cell atlas Tabula Muris Senis showed that the expression of these genes increased with age in B, T, NK cells, and macrophages, with macrophages from old mice expressing these molecules more abundantly than other cells. Functional data showed that upon myeloid cell activation via poly(I:C), the levels of JUN protein and its binding activity increased more significantly in spleen cells from old compared to young mice. In addition, upon activation, old cells produced more IL6 compared to young cells. In sum, we showed that the aging-related transcriptional activation of Jun and Fos family members in AP-1 complex is conserved across immune tissues and long- and short-living mouse strains, possibly contributing to increased inflammation with age.© 2023 The Authors.

In this study, we provide a systematic review of the causes, mechanisms, and treatments of IR. The pathogenesis of IR depends on genetics, obesity, age, disease, and drug effects. Mechanistically, any factor leading to abnormalities in the insulin signaling pathway leads to the development of IR in the host, including insulin receptor abnormalities, disturbances in the internal environment (regarding inflammation, hypoxia, lipotoxicity, and immunity), metabolic function of the liver and organelles, and other abnormalities. The available therapeutic strategies for IR are mainly exercise and dietary habit improvement, and chemotherapy based on biguanides and glucagon-like peptide-1, and traditional Chinese medicine treatments (e.g., herbs and acupuncture) can also be helpful. Based on the current understanding of IR mechanisms, there are still some vacancies to follow up and consider, and there is also a need to define more precise biomarkers for different chronic diseases and lifestyle interventions, and to explore natural or synthetic drugs targeting IR treatment. This could enable the treatment of patients with multiple combined metabolic diseases, with the aim of treating the disease holistically to reduce healthcare expenditures and to improve the quality of life of patients to some extent.Copyright © 2023 Zhao, An, Yang, Sun, Ji and Lian."

These enrichment patterns have mirrored the biome-species-function relationship, which is shaped by ecological and evolutionary principles. However, a grand picture of these enrichment patterns, as well as the roles of external and internal factors in driving these enrichment patterns, remain largely unexamined. In this work, we have examined the enrichment patterns based on 1705 microbiome samples from four representative biomes (Engineered, Gut, Freshwater, and Soil). Moreover, an ""enrichment sphere"" model was constructed to elucidate the regulatory principles behind these patterns. The driving factors for this model were revealed based on two case studies: (1) The copper-resistance genes were enriched in Soil biomes, owing to the copper contamination and horizontal gene transfer. (2) The flagellum-related genes were enriched in the Freshwater biome, due to high fluidity and vertical gene accumulation. Furthermore, this enrichment sphere model has valuable applications, such as in biome identification for metagenome samples, and in guiding 3D structure modeling of proteins.

Here, using paired whole-exome and RNA sequencing data, we investigate intratumour transcriptomic diversity in 354 non-small cell lung cancer tumours from 347 out of the first 421 patients prospectively recruited into the TRACERx study2,3. Analyses of 947 tumour regions, representing both primary and metastatic disease, alongside 96 tumour-adjacent normal tissue samples implicate the transcriptome as a major source of phenotypic variation. Gene expression levels and ITH relate to patterns of positive and negative selection during tumour evolution. We observe frequent copy number-independent allele-specific expression that is linked to epigenomic dysfunction. Allele-specific expression can also result in genomic-transcriptomic parallel evolution, which converges on cancer gene disruption. We extract signatures of RNA single-base substitutions and link their aetiology to the activity of the RNA-editing enzymes ADAR and APOBEC3A, thereby revealing otherwise undetected ongoing APOBEC activity in tumours. Characterizing the transcriptomes of primary-metastatic tumour pairs, we combine multiple machine-learning approaches that leverage genomic and transcriptomic variables to link metastasis-seeding potential to the evolutionary context of mutations and increased proliferation within primary tumour regions.

GBM cell lines are commonly used to mimic tumors forin vitroexperiments, but the extent to which they resemble GBM tumors in relation to the membranome is unclear. The present study explores the resemblance of GBM cell lines to primary tumors regarding membranome expression. Gene expression data was retrieved from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Membranomic genes were annotated and tumor purity was accounted for when correlating tumors and cell lines. The results suggest some commonly used cell lines, including AM38 and U87MG, display relatively little resemblance to tumors membranome. Differential gene expression analysis and subsequent gene set enrichment showed numerous genes related to neurexin/neuroligin, ion homeostasis, and synaptic signaling were downregulated in cell lines' membranomes compared to that of GBM tumors. The findings suggest that the membranome of GBM cell lines exhibit pronounced changes in gene expression compared to primary tumors and may not be completely representative of the disease process."
"37035245","Dual inhibition of EZH2 and G9A/GLP histone methyltransferases by HKMTI-1-005 promotes differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells.","Front Cell Dev Biol","All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-based differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) represents one of the most clinically effective examples of precision medicine and the first example of targeted oncoprotein degradation. The success of ATRA in APL, however, remains to be translated to non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We previously showed that aberrant histone modifications, including histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation, were associated with this lack of response and that epigenetic therapy with small molecule inhibitors of the H3K4 demethylase LSD1/KDM1A could reprogram AML cells to respond to ATRA. Serving as the enzymatic component of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, EZH2/KMT6A methyltransferase plays a critical role in normal hematopoiesis by affecting the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. The canonical function of EZH2 is methylation of H3K27, although important non-canonical roles have recently been described. EZH2 mutation or deregulated expression has been conclusively demonstrated in the pathogenesis of AML and response to treatment, thus making it an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we therefore investigated whether inhibition of EZH2 might also improve the response of non-APL AML cells to ATRA-based therapy. We focused on GSK-343, a pyridone-containing S-adenosyl-L-methionine cofactor-competitive EZH2 inhibitor that is representative of its class, and HKMTI-1-005, a substrate-competitive dual inhibitor targeting EZH2 and the closely related G9A/GLP H3K9 methyltransferases. We found that treatment with HKMTI-1-005 phenocopiedEZH2knockdown and was more effective in inducing differentiation than GSK-343, despite the efficacy of GSK-343 in terms of abolishing H3K27 trimethylation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed that in contrast to treatment with GSK-343, HKMTI-1-005 upregulated the expression of differentiation pathway genes with and without ATRA, while downregulating genes associated with a hematopoietic stem cell phenotype. These results pointed to a non-canonical role for EZH2, which was supported by the finding that EZH2 associates with the master regulator of myeloid differentiation, RARα, in an ATRA-dependent manner that was enhanced by HKMTI-1-005, possibly playing a role in co-regulator complex exchange during transcriptional activation. In summary, our results strongly suggest that addition of HKMTI-1-005 to ATRA is a new therapeutic approach against AML that warrants further investigation.Copyright © 2023 Sbirkov, Schenk, Kwok, Stengel, Brown, Brown, Chesler, Zelent, Fuchter and Petrie."

To understand adaptive responses that enable CIN, we analyzed paired normal, premalignant, and malignant gastric lesions from human specimens and a carcinogen-induced mouse model, observing activation of replication stress, DNA damage response (DDR), and cell cycle regulator p21 in neoplastic progression. In GEA cell lines, expression of DDR markers correlated with ploidy abnormalities, including high-level focal amplifications and whole-genome duplication (WGD). Moreover, high expression of DNA damage markerH2AXcorrelated with CIN, WGD, and inferior patient survival. By developing and implementing a composite diagnostic score that incorporatesTP53mutation status, ploidy abnormalities, andH2AXexpression, among other genomic information, we can identify GEA cell lines with enhanced sensitivity to DDR pathway inhibitors targeting Chk1/2 and Wee1. Anti-tumor properties were further augmented in combination with irinotecan (SN38) but not gemcitabine chemotherapy. These results implicate specific DDR biomarkers and ploidy abnormalities as diagnostic proxy that may predict premalignant progression and response to DDR pathway inhibitors."

Additionally, we demonstrate that the recently conceptualized REpresentation of Features as Images with NEighborhood Dependencies CNN framework can be combined with the proposed Federated Deep Regression Forests to provide improved performance as compared to existing approaches.The Python source code for reproducing the main results are available on GitHub: https://github.com/DanielNolte/FederatedDeepRegressionForests.ranadip.pal@ttu.edu.Supplementary data are available atBioinformatics Advancesonline.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37020040","ROS-mediated SRMS activation confers platinum resistance in ovarian cancer.","Oncogene","Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among gynecological malignancies. Checkpoint blockade immunotherapy has so far only shown modest efficacy in ovarian cancer and platinum-based chemotherapy remains the front-line treatment. Development of platinum resistance is one of the most important factors contributing to ovarian cancer recurrence and mortality. Through kinome-wide synthetic lethal RNAi screening combined with unbiased datamining of cell line platinum response in CCLE and GDSC databases, here we report that Src-Related Kinase Lacking C-Terminal Regulatory Tyrosine And N-Terminal Myristylation Sites (SRMS), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is a novel negative regulator of MKK4-JNK signaling under platinum treatment and plays an important role in dictating platinum efficacy in ovarian cancer. Suppressing SRMS specifically sensitizes p53-deficient ovarian cancer cells to platinum in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SRMS serves as a ""sensor"" for platinum-induced ROS. Platinum treatment-induced ROS activates SRMS, which inhibits MKK4 kinase activity by directly phosphorylating MKK4 at Y269 and Y307, and consequently attenuates MKK4-JNK activation. Suppressing SRMS leads to enhanced MKK4-JNK-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting MCL1 transcription, thereby boosting platinum efficacy. Importantly, through a ""drug repurposing"" strategy, we uncovered that PLX4720, a small molecular selective inhibitor of B-RafV600E, is a novel SRMS inhibitor that can potently boost platinum efficacy in ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, targeting SRMS with PLX4720 holds the promise to improve the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy and overcome chemoresistance in ovarian cancer.© 2023.

"37013003","Integration of pharmacoproteomic and computational approaches reveals the cellular signal transduction pathways affected by apatinib in gastric cancer cell lines.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Apatinib is known to be a highly selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) inhibitor with anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor properties. In a phase III study, the objective response rate to apatinib was low. It remains unclear why the effectivity of apatinib varies among patients and what type of patients are candidates for the treatment. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor efficacy of apatinib against 13 gastric cancer cell lines and found that it differed depending on the cell line. Using integrated wet and dry approaches, we showed that apatinib was a multi-kinase inhibitor of c-Kit, RAF1, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3, predominantly inhibiting c-Kit. Notably, KATO-III, which was the most apatinib-sensitive among the gastric cancer cell lines investigated, was the only cell line expressing c-Kit, RAF1, VEGFR1, and VEGFR3 but not VEGFR2. Furthermore, we identified SNW1 as a molecule affected by apatinib that plays an important role in cell survival. Finally, we identified the molecular network related to SNW1 that was affected by treatment with apatinib. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of apatinib in KATO-III cells is independent of VEGFR2 and that the differential efficacy of apatinib was due to differences in expression patterns of receptor tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, our results suggest that the differential efficacy of apatinib in gastric cell lines may be attributed to SNW1 phosphorylation levels at a steady state. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of apatinib in gastric cancer cells.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"36993718","Ras-dependent activation of BMAL2 regulates hypoxic metabolism in pancreatic cancer.","bioRxiv","To identify novel drivers of malignancy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we employed regulatory network analysis, which calculates the activity of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins based on the integrated expression of their positive and negative target genes. We generated a regulatory network for the malignant epithelial cells of human PDAC using gene expression data from a set of 197 laser capture microdissected human PDAC samples and 45 low-grade precursors, for which we had matched histopathological, clinical, and epidemiological annotation. We then identified the most highly activated and repressed regulatory proteins (e.g. master regulators or MRs) associated with four malignancy phenotypes: precursors vs. PDAC (initiation), low-grade vs. high grade histopathology (progression), survival post resection, and association with KRAS activity. Integrating across these phenotypes, the top MR of PDAC malignancy was found to be BMAL2, a member of the PAS family of bHLH transcription factors. Although the canonical function of BMAL2 is linked to the circadian rhythm protein CLOCK, annotation of BMAL2 target genes highlighted a potential role in hypoxia response. We previously demonstrated that PDAC is hypovascularized and hypoperfused, and here show that PDAC from the genetically engineered KPC model exists in a state of extreme hypoxia, with a partial oxygen pressure of <1mmHg. Given the close homology of BMAL2 to HIF1β (ARNT) and its potential to heterodimerize with HIF1A and HIF2A, we investigated whether BMAL2 plays a role in the hypoxic response of PDAC. Indeed, BMAL2 controlled numerous hypoxia response genes and could be inhibited following treatment with multiple RAF, MEK, and ERK inhibitors, validating its association with RAS activity. Knockout of BMAL2 in four human PDAC cell lines led to defects in growth and invasion in the setting of hypoxia. Strikingly, BMAL2 null cells failed to induce glycolysis upon exposure to severe hypoxia and this was associated with a loss of expression of the glycolytic enzyme LDHA. Moreover, HIF1A was no longer stabilized under hypoxia in BMAL2 knockout cells. By contrast, HIF2A was hyper-stabilized under hypoxia, indicating a dysregulation of hypoxia metabolism in response to BMAL2 loss. We conclude that BMAL2 is a master regulator of hypoxic metabolism in PDAC, serving as a molecular switch between the disparate metabolic roles of HIF1A- and HIF2A-dependent hypoxia responses.There is a surprising disconnect between the genomic alterations present in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and key phenotypes of malignancy, suggesting that non-genetic factors must play a role. Here we analyze changes in regulatory state - calculated from network analysis of RNA expression data - to identify transcription factors and other regulatory proteins whose activities drive pancreatic cancer malignancy. We identified the top candidate, BMAL2, as a novel, KRAS-responsive regulator of hypoxic response in pancreatic cancer, serving as a switch between HIF1A and HIF2A expression. These data help explain how KRAS coordinates cell regulatory state to enable tumor cells to survive extreme hypoxia, and highlight the ability of regulatory network analysis to identify overlooked, key drivers of biological phenotypes."

It subsumes many application-specific algorithms, from splicing detection to RNA editing to applications in DNA-sequencing and beyond. Here, we introduce NOMAD2, a fast, scalable, and user-friendly implementation of NOMAD based on KMC, an efficient k-mer counting approach. The pipeline has minimal installation requirements, and can be executed with a single command. NOMAD2 enables efficient analysis of massive RNA-Seq datasets where it reveals novel biology, showcased by rapid analysis of 1,553 human muscle cells, the entire Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (671 cell lines, 5.7 TB) and a deep RNAseq study of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) with âˆ¼2 fold less computational resource and time than state of the art alignment methods.

"36952569","A systematic evaluation of deep learning methods for the prediction of drug synergy in cancer.","PLoS Comput Biol","One of the main obstacles to the successful treatment of cancer is the phenomenon of drug resistance. A common strategy to overcome resistance is the use of combination therapies. However, the space of possibilities is huge and efficient search strategies are required. Machine Learning (ML) can be a useful tool for the discovery of novel, clinically relevant anti-cancer drug combinations. In particular, deep learning (DL) has become a popular choice for modeling drug combination effects. Here, we set out to examine the impact of different methodological choices on the performance of multimodal DL-based drug synergy prediction methods, including the use of different input data types, preprocessing steps and model architectures. Focusing on the NCI ALMANAC dataset, we found that feature selection based on prior biological knowledge has a positive impact-limiting gene expression data to cancer or drug response-specific genes improved performance. Drug features appeared to be more predictive of drug response, with a 41% increase in coefficient of determination (R2) and 26% increase in Spearman correlation relative to a baseline model that used only cell line and drug identifiers. Molecular fingerprint-based drug representations performed slightly better than learned representations-ECFP4 fingerprints increased R2 by 5.3% and Spearman correlation by 2.8% w.r.t the best learned representations. In general, fully connected feature-encoding subnetworks outperformed other architectures. DL outperformed other ML methods by more than 35% (R2) and 14% (Spearman). Additionally, an ensemble combining the top DL and ML models improved performance by about 6.5% (R2) and 4% (Spearman). Using a state-of-the-art interpretability method, we showed that DL models can learn to associate drug and cell line features with drug response in a biologically meaningful way. The strategies explored in this study will help to improve the development of computational methods for the rational design of effective drug combinations for cancer therapy.Copyright: © 2023 Baptista et al.

Here, we examined whether theCORINpromoter's methylation, an epigenetic DNA modification, was associated with the risk of stroke in two independent samples.A total of 1771 participants including 853 stroke cases and 918 healthy controls were included as a discovery sample and 2,498 community members with 10 years of follow-up were included as a replication sample. DNA methylation of theCORINpromoter was quantified by target bisulfite sequencing in both samples. We first examined the single CpG association, followed by a gene-based analysis of the joint association between multiple CpG methylation and stroke, adjusting for conventional risk factors.The single CpG association analysis found that hypermethylation at all of the 9 CpG sites assayed was significantly associated with lower odds of prevalent stroke in the discovery sample (allp < 0.05), and three of them located at Chr4:47840038 (HR = 0.74,p = 0.015), Chr4:47839941 (HR = 0.80,p = 0.047), and Chr4:47839933 (HR = 0.82,p = 0.050) were also significantly associated with incident stroke in the replication sample. The gene-based association analysis found that DNA methylation of the 9 CpG sites at theCORINpromoter was jointly associated with stroke in both samples (allp < 0.05).DNA methylation levels of theCORINgene promoter were lower in stroke patients and predicted a higher risk of incident stroke in Chinese adults.

"36993393","HIV-1 Vpr combats the PU.1-driven antiviral response in primary human macrophages.","bioRxiv","The HIV-1 accessory protein, Vpr, is an enigmatic protein required for efficient spread of HIV from macrophages to T cells, a necessary step for propagation of infection. To illuminate the role of Vpr in HIV-infection of primary macrophages, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to capture the transcriptional changes during an HIV-1 spreading infection plus and minus Vpr. We found that Vpr reprogramed HIV-infected macrophage gene expression by targeting the master transcriptional regulator, PU.1. PU.1 was required for efficient induction of the host innate immune response to HIV, including upregulation ofISG15,LY96,andIFI6. In contrast, we did not observe direct effects of PU.1 on HIV gene transcription. Single cell gene expression analysis also revealed Vpr countered an innate immune response to HIV-infection within bystander macrophages via a PU.1-independent mechanism. The capacity of Vpr to target PU.1 and disrupt the anti-viral response was highly conserved across primate lentiviruses including HIV-2 and several SIVs. By demonstrating how Vpr overcomes a critical early warning system of infection, we identify a crucial reason why Vpr is necessary for HIV infection and spread."

Existing simulators typically focus on modeling one or two specific biological factors or mechanisms that affect the output data, which limits their capacity to simulate the complexity and multi-modality in real data. Here, we present scMultiSim, an in silico simulator that generates multi-modal single-cell data, including gene expression, chromatin accessibility, RNA velocity, and spatial cell locations while accounting for the relationships between modalities. scMultiSim jointly models various biological factors that affect the output data, including cell identity, within-cell gene regulatory networks (GRNs), cell-cell interactions (CCIs), and chromatin accessibility, while also incorporating technical noises. Moreover, it allows users to adjust each factor's effect easily. We validated scMultiSimâ€™s simulated biological effects and demonstrated its applications by benchmarking a wide range of computational tasks, including cell clustering and trajectory inference, multi-modal and multi-batch data integration, RNA velocity estimation, GRN inference and CCI inference using spatially resolved gene expression data. Compared to existing simulators, scMultiSim can benchmark a much broader range of existing computational problems and even new potential tasks."

Thus, this prospective cohort of South Asian pregnant women aimed to evaluate how early pregnancy MetS would affect pregnancy outcomes.A prospective cohort study was conducted among first-trimester (T1) pregnant women of Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka recruited to the Rajarata Pregnancy Cohort in 2019. MetS was diagnosed by the Joint Interim Statement criteria before 13 weeks of gestational age (GA). Participants were followed up until their delivery, and the major outcomes measured were large for gestational age (LGA), small for gestational age (SGA), preterm birth (PTB) and miscarriage (MC). Gestational weight gain, gestational age at delivery and neonatal birth weight were used as measurements to define the outcomes. Additionally, outcome measures were re-assessed with adjusting fasting plasma glucose (FPG) thresholds of MetS to be compatible with hyperglycemia in pregnancy (Revised MetS).2326 T1 pregnant women with a mean age of 28.1 years (SD-5.4), and a median GA of 8.0 weeks (IQR-2) were included. Baseline MetS prevalence was 5.9% (n = 137, 95%CI-5.0-6.9). Only 2027 (87.1%) women from baseline, had a live singleton birth, while 221(9.5%) had MC and 14(0.6%) had other pregnancy losses. Additionally, 64(2.8%) were lost to follow-up. A higher cumulative incidence of LGA, PTB, and MC was noted among the T1-MetS women. T1-MetS carried significant risk (RR-2.59, 95%CI-1.65-3.93) for LGA, but reduced the risk for SGA (RR-0.41, 95%CI-0.29-0.78). Revised MetS moderately increased the risk for PTB (RR-1.54, 95%CI-1.04-2.21). T1-MetS was not associated (p = 0.48) with MC. Lowered FPG thresholds were significantly associated with risk for all major pregnancy outcomes. After adjusting for sociodemographic and anthropometric confounders, revised MetS remained the only significant risk predictor for LGA.Pregnant women with T1 MetS in this population are at an increased risk for LGA and PTB and a reduced risk for SGA. We observed that a revised MetS definition with lower threshold for FPG compatible with GDM would provide a better estimation of MetS in pregnancy in relation to predicting LGA.© 2023.

Machine learning results in the training group: for area under the curve (AUC), except for RF and LR, the AUC values of all machine learning classifiers were greater than .8, but the joint algorithm did not improve the AUC for any single machine learning algorithm. Among the results related to accuracy and precision, the accuracy of other machine learning classifiers except the RF algorithm was higher than 70%, and only the precision of the LGBM algorithm was higher than 70%. Machine learning results in the test group: Similarly, for areas under the curve (AUC), except RF and LR, the AUC values for all machine learning classifiers were greater than .8, but the joint algorithm did not improve the AUC value for any single machine learning algorithm. For accuracy, except for the RF algorithm, the accuracy of other machine learning classifiers was higher than 70%. The highest precision for the LGBM algorithm was .675.The results of this concept verification study show that machine learning algorithm classifiers can distinguish the bone metastasis of patients with lung cancer. This will provide a new research idea for the future use of non-invasive technology to identify bone metastasis in lungcancer. However, more prospective multicenter cohort studies are needed."

However, its co-carcinogenic signature in different cancers is not fully understood.In this study, we first analyzed the expression of MMP13 in pan-cancer and its association with prognosis, immune infiltration, and cancer-related signaling pathways through integrated bioinformatics. Furthermore, western blotting (WB) was used to verify the expression of MMP13 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) factors in cancer tissues. Finally, the value of MMP13 as a serum diagnostic marker was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).MMP13 expression is frequently upregulated in multiple cancers that always indicate an adverse prognosis. MMP13 undergoes comprehensive genetic alterations and promoter methylation reduction in various tumors. Additionally, immune correlation analysis showed that MMP13 expression was significantly associated with TMB, MSI, and tumor immune infiltration. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that MMP13 upregulation was correlated with activation of the EMT signaling pathway, which was verified by WB in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Most importantly, ELISA results showed that serum MMP13 levels could be used for the diagnosis of multiple tumors, including BRCA, HNSC, LUAD, and LUSC, with the area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.8494, 0.9259, 0.7144, and 0.8575, respectively.MMP13 is often overexpressed across cancers and predicts poor prognosis, with the potential as a therapeutic target. Furthermore, the up-regulation of its expression can be effectively reflected in the serum protein level, thus serving as a valuable diagnostic marker."

Defining the genetic control of gene expression in a cell-type-specific and context-dependent manner is critical for understanding the mechanisms through which genetic variation influences complex traits and disease pathobiology. To this end, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of lung tissue from 67 PF and 49 unaffected donors. Employing a pseudo-bulk approach, we mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) across 38 cell types, observing both shared and cell type-specific regulatory effects. Further, we identified disease-interaction eQTL and demonstrated that this class of associations is more likely to be cell-type specific and linked to cellular dysregulation in PF. Finally, we connected PF risk variants to their regulatory targets in disease-relevant cell types. These results indicate that cellular context determines the impact of genetic variation on gene expression, and implicates context-specific eQTL as key regulators of lung homeostasis and disease."

The occurrence of any registered pregnancy from people aged 14 years until age at the end of follow-up was assessed using Cox proportional regression for both groups.Among 1 092 151 people born in Norway from 1984 to 2002, 180 652 were registered at least once as mothers, and 137 530 as fathers. Of these, 399 men and 553 women were conceived by assisted reproductive technologies. People who were conceived by assisted reproductive technologies had little evidence of increased risk of adverse outcomes in their own pregnancies, increased use of assisted reproductive technologies, or any difference in mean birth weight, placental weight, or gestational age. The only exception was for an increased risk of the neonate having a low Apgar score at 5 min (adjusted odds ratio 1.86 (95% confidence interval 1.20 to 2.89)) among women who were conceived by assisted reproductive technologies. Odds were slightly decreased of having a boy among mothers conceived by assisted reproductive technologies (odds ratio 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.93)). People conceived by assisted reproductive technologies were slightly less likely to have a registered pregnancy within the follow-up period (women, adjusted hazard ratio 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.96); men, 0.91 (0.83 to 1.01)).People conceived by assisted reproductive technologies were not at increased risk of obstetric or perinatal complications when becoming parents. The proportion of people conceived by assisted reproductive technologies with a registered pregnancy was lower than among people who were naturally conceived, but a longer follow-up is required to fully assess their fertility and reproductive history.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Further, the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed. We utilized machine learning algorithms of lasso and random forest (RF) to identify the common signature genes. Then the diagnostic nomogram models and receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were constructed and validated with external verification datasets. The gene interaction network was establishedviathe GeneMANIA database. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene set variation analysis (GSVA), and immune infiltration analysis were performed to explore the co-regulated pathways and immune cells.A total of 11 co-DEGs were identified. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that co-DEGs were mainly enriched in lipid catabolic process, calcium ion transport, and regulation of cytokine. Moreover, three common signature genes (PLCXD3, CCL19, and PKD2) were defined. Based on these genes, we constructed the efficiently predictable diagnostic models for advanced AS and NAFLD with the nomograms, evaluated with the ROC curves (AUC = 0.995 for advanced AS, 95% CI 0.971-1.0; AUC = 0.973 for advanced NAFLD, 95% CI 0.938-0.998). In addition, the AUC of the verification datasets had a similar trend. The NOD-like receptors (NLRs) signaling pathway might be the most crucial co-regulated pathway, and activated CD4 T cells and central memory CD4 T cells were significantly excessive infiltration in advanced NAFLD and AS.We identified three common signature genes (PLCXD3, CCL19, and PKD2), co-regulated pathways, and shared immune features of NAFLD and AS, which might provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of NAFLD complicated with AS.© 2023 Mo, Wang, Yuan, Wu, Zhao, Wei, Qin, Jiang and Qin."

Nowadays the rate of nonsmoking patients has dramatically increased and may be associated with the presence of driver mutations. Better understanding of the mutation profile data of nonsmoking LUAD patients are critical to predict survival and provide greater benefits to more patients. The apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) has been shown to play an important role in molecular tumorigenesis of NSCLC. However, the clinical relevance of APOBEC in nonsmoking LUAD remains to be understood.LUAD patients with somatic mutation and RNA sequencing data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were assessed and screened in the Gene Expression Omnibus. Transcriptome data and mutational signatures were analyzed using R package. Then, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model to construct the APOBEC3 score (APOBEC3 score) model. The prognostic value was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Finally, the functional enrichment analysis of differential expressed genes (DEGs) and the immune-related features were also estimated using R package.By analyzing the mutational profile data of NSCLC in the TCGA database, we found that different mutation patterns existed between smoking and nonsmoking patients, and the APOBEC3 family played an important role in the mutation pattern of nonsmoking patients with LUAD. We established an APOBEC3 score and found that TCW (W = A or T) mutation counts were significantly greater in the high APOBEC3 score group than in the low APOBEC3 score group. Furthermore, there were different immune feathers and prognostic values between the high and low APOBEC3 score patients, suggesting an independent prognostic factor of APOBEC3 in nonsmoking LUAD patients.We established a comprehensive view of APOBEC3 mutations in nonsmoking LUAD patients.

Mitophagy, ferroptosis, and the associated immune microenvironment (IME) have been shown to play important roles in renal IRI. However, the role of mitophagy-associated IME genes in IRI remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to construct a prediction model of IRI prognosis based on mitophagy-associated IME genes.The specific biological characteristics of the mitophagy-associated IME gene signature were comprehensively analyzed using public databases such as GEO, Pathway Unification, and FerrDb. Correlations between the expression of prognostic genes and immune-related genes and IRI prognosis were determined by Cox regression, LASSO analysis, and Pearson's correlation. Molecular validation was performed using human kidney 2 (HK2) cells and culture supernatant as well as the serum and kidney tissues of mice after renal IRI. Gene expression was measured by PCR, and inflammatory cell infiltration was examined by ELISA and mass cytometry. Renal tissue damage was characterized using renal tissue homogenate and tissue sections.The expression of the mitophagy-associated IME gene signature was significantly correlated with IRI prognosis. Excessive mitophagy and extensive immune infiltration were the primary factors affecting IRI. In particular, FUNDC1, SQSTM1, UBB, UBC, KLF2, CDKN1A, and GDF15 were the key influencing factors. In addition, B cells, neutrophils, T cells, and M1 macrophages were the key immune cells present in the IME after IRI. A prediction model for IRI prognosis was constructed based on the key factors associated with the mitophagy IME. Validation experiments in cells and mice indicated that the prediction model was reliable and applicable.We clarified the relationship between the mitophagy-related IME and IRI.

The prognostic value of the model was validated in internal and external sepsis datasets. The correlations of the IRG signature with immunological characteristics, including immune cell infiltration and cytokine expression, were explored. We finally validated the expression of the three IRG signature genes in blood samples from 12 sepsis patients and 12 healthy controls using qPCR.We established a prognostic IRG signature comprising three gene members (LTB4R,HLA-DMBandIL4R). The IRG signature demonstrated good predictive performance for 28-day mortality on the internal and external validation datasets. The immune infiltration and cytokine analyses revealed that the IRG signature was significantly associated with multiple immune cells and cytokines. The molecular pathway analysis uncovered ontology enrichment in myeloid cell differentiation and iron ion homeostasis, providing clues regarding the underlying biological mechanisms of the IRG signature. Finally, qPCR detection verified the differential expression of the three IRG signature genes in blood samples from 12 sepsis patients and 12 healthy controls.This study presents an innovative IRG signature for 28-day mortality prediction in sepsis patients, which may be used to facilitate stratification of risky sepsis patients and evaluate patients' immune state.Copyright © 2023 Peng, Wu, Liu, Zhang, Han, Yin, Wang, Chen, Zhang, Feng and Zhu."
"37033796","Identification of Breast Cancer Subtypes by Integrating Genomic Analysis with the Immune Microenvironment.","ACS Omega","Objectives: We aim to identify the breast cancer (BC) subtype clusters and the crucial gene classifier prognostic signatures by integrating genomic analysis with the tumor immune microenvironment (TME).Methods: Data sets of BC were derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), METABRIC, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Unsupervised consensus clustering was carried out to obtain the subtype clusters of BC patients. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and univariate and multivariate regression analysis were employed to obtain the gene classifier signatures and their biological functions, which were validated by the BC dataset from the METABRIC database. Additionally, to evaluate the overall survival rates of BC patients, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was carried out. Moreover, to assess how BC subtype clusters are related to the TME, single-cell analysis was performed. Finally, the drug sensitivity and the immune cell infiltration for different phenotypes of BC patients were also calculated by the CIBERSORT and ESTIMATE algorithms.Results:TCGA-BC samples were divided into three subtype clusters, S1, S2, and S3, among which the prognosis of S2 was poor and that of S1 and S3 were better. Three key pathways and 10 crucial prognostic-related gene signatures are screened. Finally, single-cell analysis suggests that S1 samples have the most types of immune cells, S2 with more sensitivity to tumor treatment drugs are enriched with more neutrophils, and more multilymphoid progenitor cells are involved in subtype cluster S3.Conclusions: Our novelty was to identify the BC subtype clusters and the gene classifier signatures employing a large-amount dataset combined with multiple bioinformatics methods. All of the results provide a basis for clinical precision treatment of BC.© 2023 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society."

It is known, however, that correlation between DNA methylation and aging might not be linear and that the sex might influence the methylation status. In this study, we conducted a comparative evaluation of linear and several non-linear regressions, as well as sex-specific versus unisex models. Buccal swab samples from 230 donors aged 1 to 88 years were analyzed using a minisequencing multiplex array. Samples were divided into a training set (n = 161) and a validation set (n = 69). The training set was used for a sequential replacement regression and a simultaneous 10-fold cross-validation. The resulting model was improved by including a cut-off of 20 years, dividing the younger individuals with non-linear from the older individuals with linear dependence between age and methylation status. Sex-specific models were developed and improved prediction accuracy in females but not in males, which might be explained by a small sample set. We finally established a non-linear, unisex model combining the markers EDARADD, KLF14, ELOVL2, FHL2, C1orf132, and TRIM59. While age- and sex-adjustments did not generally improve the performance of our model, we discuss how other models and large cohorts might benefit from such adjustments. Our model showed a cross-validated MAD and RMSE of 4.680 and 6.436 years in the training set and of 4.695 and 6.602 years in the validation set, respectively. We briefly explain how to apply the model for age prediction.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here, we investigated the temporal relationship between the two conditions after bariatric surgery.In total, 409 participants were enrolled from three bariatric centers in China from 2009 to 2018. We evaluated whether baseline IR (proxied by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) and lipid accumulation (proxied by visceral adiposity index (VAI) and lipid accumulation product (LAP)) were associated with follow-up IR and lipid accumulation (3 months postoperatively) using linear regression models. We then conducted a cross-lagged panel analysis model to simultaneously examine the bidirectional relationship between IR and lipid accumulation.Multivariable linear regression analyses showed that baseline HOMA-IR was associated with follow-up VAI (β = 0.430, 95% CI: 0.082-0.778, p = 0.016) and LAP (β = 0.070, 95% CI: 0.010-0.130, p = 0.022). There was no relationship between baseline lipid accumulation and follow-up IR. Further cross-lagged panel analyses indicated that the path coefficient from baseline HOMA-IR to follow-up VAI (β2 = 0.145, p = 0.003) was significantly greater than the coefficient from baseline VAI to follow-up HOMA-IR (β1 =  - 0.013, p = 0.777). Similarly, the path coefficient from baseline HOMA-IR to follow-up LAP (β2 = 0.141, p = 0.003) was significantly greater than the coefficient from baseline LAP to follow-up HOMA-IR (β1 = 0.041, p = 0.391).Our study demonstrated a unidirectional relationship from HOMA-IR to VAI and LAP, suggesting that the change in IR may precede lipid accumulation after surgery.© 2023.

"37024684","Dynamic antagonism between key repressive pathways maintains the placental epigenome.","Nat Cell Biol","DNA and Histone 3 Lysine 27 methylation typically function as repressive modifications and operate within distinct genomic compartments. In mammals, the majority of the genome is kept in a DNA methylated state, whereas the Polycomb repressive complexes regulate the unmethylated CpG-rich promoters of developmental genes. In contrast to this general framework, the extra-embryonic lineages display non-canonical, globally intermediate DNA methylation levels, including disruption of local Polycomb domains. Here, to better understand this unusual landscape's molecular properties, we genetically and chemically perturbed major epigenetic pathways in mouse trophoblast stem cells. We find that the extra-embryonic epigenome reflects ongoing and dynamic de novo methyltransferase recruitment, which is continuously antagonized by Polycomb to maintain intermediate, locally disordered methylation. Despite its disorganized molecular appearance, our data point to a highly controlled equilibrium between counteracting repressors within extra-embryonic cells, one that can seemingly persist indefinitely without bistable features typically seen for embryonic forms of epigenetic regulation.© 2023.

"36993517","Targeted DNA integration in human cells without double-strand breaks using CRISPR RNA-guided transposases.","bioRxiv","Traditional genome-editing reagents such as CRISPR-Cas9 achieve targeted DNA modification by introducing double-strand breaks (DSBs), thereby stimulating localized DNA repair by endogenous cellular repair factors. While highly effective at generating heterogenous knockout mutations, this approach suffers from undesirable byproducts and an inability to control product purity. Here we develop a system in human cells for programmable, DSB-free DNA integration using Type I CRISPR-associated transposons (CASTs). To adapt our previously described CAST systems, we optimized DNA targeting by the QCascade complex through a comprehensive assessment of protein design, and we developed potent transcriptional activators by exploiting the multi-valent recruitment of the AAA+ ATPase, TnsC, to genomic sites targeted by QCascade. After initial detection of plasmid-based transposition, we screened 15 homologous CAST systems from a wide range of bacterial hosts, identified a CAST homolog fromPseudoalteromonasthat exhibited improved activity, and increased integration efficiencies through parameter optimization. We further discovered that bacterial ClpX enhances genomic integration by multiple orders of magnitude, and we propose that this critical accessory factor functions to drive active disassembly of the post-transposition CAST complex, akin to its demonstrated role in Mu transposition. Our work highlights the ability to functionally reconstitute complex, multi-component machineries in human cells, and establishes a strong foundation to realize the full potential of CRISPR-associated transposons for human genome engineering."
"36993286","Germline-mediated immunoediting sculpts breast cancer subtypes and metastatic proclivity.","bioRxiv","Cancer represents a broad spectrum of molecularly and morphologically diverse diseases. Individuals with the same clinical diagnosis can have tumors with drastically different molecular profiles and clinical response to treatment. It remains unclear when these differences arise during disease course and why some tumors are addicted to one oncogenic pathway over another. Somatic genomic aberrations occur within the context of an individual's germline genome, which can vary across millions of polymorphic sites. An open question is whether germline differences influence somatic tumor evolution. Interrogating 3,855 breast cancer lesions, spanning pre-invasive to metastatic disease, we demonstrate that germline variants in highly expressed and amplified genes influence somatic evolution by modulating immunoediting at early stages of tumor development. Specifically, we show that the burden of germline-derived epitopes in recurrently amplified genes selects against somatic gene amplification in breast cancer. For example, individuals with a high burden of germline-derived epitopes inERBB2,encoding human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), are significantly less likely to develop HER2-positive breast cancer compared to other subtypes. The same holds true for recurrent amplicons that define four subgroups of ER-positive breast cancers at high risk of distant relapse. High epitope burden in these recurrently amplified regions is associated with decreased likelihood of developing high risk ER-positive cancer. Tumors that overcome such immune-mediated negative selection are more aggressive and demonstrate an ""immune cold"" phenotype. These data show the germline genome plays a previously unappreciated role in dictating somatic evolution. Exploiting germline-mediated immunoediting may inform the development of biomarkers that refine risk stratification within breast cancer subtypes."

This study explored correlates of treatment among pregnant women with syphilis in Guangzhou, China.Pregnant women with a diagnosis of syphilis in Guangzhou between January 2014 and December 2016 were included. Information of syphilis treatment and correlates were extracted from a comprehensive national case-reporting system. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify the correlations between information on the demographic characteristics, previous history, clinical characteristics about current syphilis, information of diagnosing hospital, and receiving no treatment or inadequate treatment among syphilis-seropositive pregnant women. A causal mediation analysis was used to explore the potential mediating role of the timing of syphilis diagnosis in the correlates.Among 1248 syphilis-seropositive pregnant women, 379 (30.4%) women received no treatment or inadequate treatment. Migrant pregnant women (adjusted OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.25-2.73), multiparous participants (adjusted OR = 3.68, 95% CI: 2.51-5.50), unmarried participants (adjusted OR = 3.21, 95% CI: 1.97-5.28) and unemployed participants (adjusted OR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.41-4.39) were more likely to receive no treatment or inadequate treatment. Participants who with history of syphilis infection (adjusted OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.42-0.82) and with high school and higher education participants (adjusted OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.49-0.97) were less likely to receive untreated or inadequately treatment. And that the impact of all these factors (except for the migrants) on treatment status are fully mediated through the syphilis diagnosis time, with the direct effect of migrants that would have resulted in a higher rate of no or inadequate treatment (OR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.08-5.32) was partially cancelled out by the syphilis diagnosis time.Pregnant women who were migrant without local residence and women with syphilis diagnosed at a later gestational age were more likely to slip through the cracks of the existing antenatal care system. More programs should focus on eliminating these gaps of residence-related health inequalities.

Resilience may explain this heterogeneity; thus, it is critical to understand the etiologic underpinnings of resilience.Objective:The present study sought to examine the genetic underpinnings of psychiatric resilience using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), and polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses.Method:Participants were 6,634 trauma exposed college students attending a diverse, public university in the Mid Atlantic. GWAS and GCTA analyses were conducted, and using GWAS summary statistics from large genetic consortia, PRS analyses examined the shared genetic risk between resilience and various phenotypes.Results:Results demonstrate that nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) met the suggestive of significance threshold, heritability estimates for resilience were non-significant, and that there is genetic overlap between resilience and AD, as well as resilience and PTSD.Conclusion:Mixed findings from the present study suggest additional research to elucidate the etiological underpinnings of resilience, ideally with larger samples less biased by variables such as heterogeneity (i.e. clinical vs. population based) and population stratification. Genetic investigations of resilience have the potential to elucidate the molecular bases of stress-related psychopathology, suggesting new avenues for prevention and intervention efforts."
"36975205","Longitudinal fundus imaging and its genome-wide association analysis provide evidence for a human retinal aging clock.","Elife","Biological age, distinct from an individual's chronological age, has been studied extensively through predictive aging clocks. However, these clocks have limited accuracy in short time-scales. Here we trained deep learning models on fundus images from the EyePACS dataset to predict individuals' chronological age. Our retinal aging clocking, 'eyeAge', predicted chronological age more accurately than other aging clocks (mean absolute error of 2.86 and 3.30 years on quality-filtered data from EyePACS and UK Biobank, respectively). Additionally, eyeAge was independent of blood marker-based measures of biological age, maintaining an all-cause mortality hazard ratio of 1.026 even when adjusted for phenotypic age. The individual-specific nature of eyeAge was reinforced via multiple GWAS hits in the UK Biobank cohort. The top GWAS locus was further validated via knockdown of the fly homolog,Alk, which slowed age-related decline in vision in flies. This study demonstrates the potential utility of a retinal aging clock for studying aging and age-related diseases and quantitatively measuring aging on very short time-scales, opening avenues for quick and actionable evaluation of gero-protective therapeutics.© 2023, Ahadi et al."
"36864611","Interpretable meta-learning of multi-omics data for survival analysis and pathway enrichment.","Bioinformatics","Despite the success of recent machine learning algorithms' applications to survival analysis, their black-box nature hinders interpretability, which is arguably the most important aspect. Similarly, multi-omics data integration for survival analysis is often constrained by the underlying relationships and correlations that are rarely well understood. The goal of this work is to alleviate the interpretability problem in machine learning approaches for survival analysis and also demonstrate how multi-omics data integration improves survival analysis and pathway enrichment. We use meta-learning, a machine-learning algorithm that is trained on a variety of related datasets and allows quick adaptations to new tasks, to perform survival analysis and pathway enrichment on pan-cancer datasets. In recent machine learning research, meta-learning has been effectively used for knowledge transfer among multiple related datasets.We use meta-learning with Cox hazard loss to show that the integration of TCGA pan-cancer data increases the performance of survival analysis. We also apply advanced model interpretability method called DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures) to show different sets of enriched pathways for multi-omics and transcriptomics data. Our results show that multi-omics cancer survival analysis enhances performance compared with using transcriptomics or clinical data alone. Additionally, we show a correlation between variable importance assignment from DeepLIFT and gene coenrichment, suggesting that genes with higher and similar contribution scores are more likely to be enriched together in the same enrichment sets.https://github.com/berkuva/TCGA-omics-integration.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37065201","Development and investigation of metabolism-associated risk assessment models for patients with viral hepatitis.","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","Dysregulation of metabolism plays an important role in the onset and progression of multiple pathogenic diseases, including viral hepatitis. However, a model to predict viral hepatitis risk by metabolic pathways is still lacking. Thus, we developed two risk assessment models for viral hepatitis based on metabolic pathways identified through univariate and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis. The first model is designed to assess the progression of the disease by evaluating changes in the Child-Pugh class, hepatic decompensation, and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The second model is focused on determining the prognosis of the illness, taking into account the patient's cancer status. Our models were further validated by Kaplan-Meier plots of survival curves. In addition, we investigated the contribution of immune cells in metabolic processes and identified three distinct subsets of immune cells-CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and NK cells-that have significantly affected metabolic pathways. Specifically, our findings suggest that resting or inactive macrophages and NK cells contribute to maintaining metabolic homeostasis, particularly with regard to lipid and α-amino acid metabolism, thereby potentially reducing the risk of viral hepatitis progression. Moreover, maintaining metabolic homeostasis ensures a balance between killer-proliferative and exhausted CD8+ T cells, which helps in mitigating CD8+ T cell-mediated liver damage while preserving energy reserves. In conclusion, our study offers a useful tool for early disease detection in viral hepatitis patients through metabolic pathway analysis and sheds light on the immunological understanding of the disease through the examination of immune cell metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2023 Zhao, Lei, Zhou, Sun, Li, Zhou, Huang, Li and Zhao."

Environmental factors such as exposure to pollutants, unbalanced nutrition, behavioral factors, stress, in vitro culture conditions can negatively affect epigenetic reprogramming events. In this review, we describe the main epigenetic mechanisms found during mammalian preimplantation development (e.g., genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation).

Identifying novel genes and pathways related to the mineralization process are important steps for future gene therapy in bone disorders. In this study, we detect an inter-chromosomal insertional duplication in a female proband disrupting a topologically associating domain and causing an ultra-rare progressive form of heterotopic ossification. This structural variant lead to enhancer hijacking and misexpression of ARHGAP36 in fibroblasts, validated here by orthogonal in vitro studies. In addition, ARHGAP36 overexpression inhibits TGFβ, and activates hedgehog signaling and genes/proteins related to extracellular matrix production.

Interestingly, HBV altered the boundaries of many topologically associating domains (TADs), and genes nearby these boundaries showed functional enrichment in cell adhesion which may promote cancer metastasis. Moreover, A/B compartment analysis revealed dramatic changes on chromosomes 9, 13 and 21, with more B compartments (inactive or closed) shifting to A compartments (active or open). The A-to-B regions (closing) harbored enhancers enriched in the regulation of inflammatory responses, whereas B-to-A regions (opening) were enriched for transposable elements (TE). Furthermore, we identified large HBV-induced structural variations (SVs) that disrupted tumor suppressors,NLGN4YandPROS1. Finally, we examined differentially expressed genes and TEs in single hepatocytes with or without HBV infection, by using single-cell RNA-seq data. Consistent with our HiC sequencing findings, two upregulated genes that promote HBV replication,HNF4AandNR5A2, were located in regions with HBV-enhanced CIs, and five TEs were located in HBV-activated regions. Therefore, HBV may promote liver diseases by affecting the human 3D genome structure.Our work promotes mechanistic understanding of HBV infection and host-virus interactions related to liver diseases that affect billions of people worldwide.

"37017895","The role of transposable elements in aging and cancer.","Biogerontology","Transposable elements (TEs) constitute a large portion of the human genome. Various mechanisms at the transcription and post-transcription levels developed to suppress TE activity in healthy conditions. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that TE dysregulation is involved in various human diseases, including age-related diseases and cancer. In this review, we explained how sensing TEs by the immune system could induce innate immune responses, chronic inflammation, and following age-related diseases. We also noted that inflammageing and exogenous carcinogens could trigger the upregulation of TEs in precancerous cells. Increased inflammation could enhance epigenetic plasticity and upregulation of early developmental TEs, which rewires the transcriptional networks and gift the survival advantage to the precancerous cells. In addition, upregulated TEs could induce genome instability, activation of oncogenes, or inhibition of tumor suppressors and consequent cancer initiation and progression. So, we suggest that TEs could be considered therapeutic targets in aging and cancer.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."

Notwithstanding, our understanding of age-related changes in cognitive and motor functions in chimpanzees remains largely unstudied despite recent evident demonstrating that chimpanzees exhibit many of the same neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease observed in human postmortem brains. Here, we examined age-related differences in cognition and cortical thickness measured from magnetic resonance images in a sample of 215 chimpanzees ranging in age between 9 and 54 years. We found that chimpanzees showed global and region-specific thinning of cortex with increasing age. Further, within the elderly cohort, chimpanzees that performed better than average had thicker cortex in frontal, temporal and parietal regions compared to chimpanzees that performed worse than average. Independent of age, we also found sex differences in cortical thickness in 4 brain regions. Males had higher adjusted cortical thickness scores for the caudal anterior cingulate, rostral anterior cingulate, and medial orbital frontal while females had higher values for the inferior parietal cortex. We found no evidence that increasing age nor sex was associated with asymmetries in cortical thickness. Moreover, age-related differences in cognitive function were only weakly associated with asymmetries in cortical thickness. In summary, as has been reported in humans and other primates, elderly chimpanzees show thinner cortex and variation in cortical thickness is associated with general cognitive functions.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Using an experimental pipeline enabling PDAC organoid isolation and collection based on invasive phenotype, we assessed the transcriptomic programs associated with invasion in our organoid model. We identified differentially expressed genes in invasive organoids compared with matched noninvasive organoids from the same patients, and we confirmed that the encoded proteins were enhanced in organoid invasive protrusions. We identified 3 distinct transcriptomic groups in invasive organoids, 2 of which correlated directly with the morphological invasion patterns and were characterized by distinct upregulated pathways. Leveraging publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we mapped our transcriptomic groups onto human PDAC tissue samples, highlighting differences in the tumor microenvironment between transcriptomic groups and suggesting that non-neoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment can modulate tumor cell invasion. To further address this possibility, we performed computational ligand-receptor analysis and validated the impact of multiple ligands (TGF-β1, IL-6, CXCL12, MMP9) on invasion and gene expression in an independent cohort of fresh human PDAC organoids. Our results identify molecular programs driving morphologically defined invasion patterns and highlight the tumor microenvironment as a potential modulator of these programs."

To approach this problem, we measured 4701 circulating human protein abundances in two independent cohorts totaling 986 individuals. We then trained prediction models including protein abundances and clinical risk factors to predict COVID-19 severity in 417 subjects and tested these models in a separate cohort of 569 individuals. For severe COVID-19, a baseline model including age and sex provided an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 65% in the test cohort. Selecting 92 proteins from the 4701 unique protein abundances improved the AUC to 88% in the training cohort, which remained relatively stable in the testing cohort at 86%, suggesting good generalizability. Proteins selected from different COVID-19 severity were enriched for cytokine and cytokine receptors, but more than half of the enriched pathways were not immune-related. Taken together, these findings suggest that circulating proteins measured at early stages of disease progression are reasonably accurate predictors of COVID-19 severity. Further research is needed to understand how to incorporate protein measurement into clinical care.© 2023. The Author(s)."

It is unclear how progression of NAFLD towards cirrhosis translates into systematic changes in circulating proteins. Here, we provide a detailed proteo-transcriptomic map of steatohepatitis and fibrosis during progressive NAFLD. In this multicentre proteomic study, we characterize 4,730 circulating proteins in 306 patients with histologically characterized NAFLD and integrate this with transcriptomic analysis in paired liver tissue. We identify circulating proteomic signatures for active steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis, and correlate these with hepatic transcriptomics to develop a proteo-transcriptomic signature of 31 markers. Deconvolution of this signature by single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the hepatic cell types likely to contribute to proteomic changes with disease progression. As an exemplar of use as a non-invasive diagnostic, logistic regression establishes a composite model comprising four proteins (ADAMTSL2, AKR1B10, CFHR4 and TREM2), body mass index and type 2 diabetes mellitus status, to identify at-risk steatohepatitis.© 2023.

However, little is known regarding how ACE exposure modulates neural biomarkers to influence poorer health outcomes in ACE-exposed children. To address this, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impact of ACE exposure on Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels - a neural biomarker involved in childhood and adult neurogenesis and long-term memory formation. Twenty-two studies were selected for inclusion within the systematic review, ten of which were included in meta-analysis. Most included studies retrospectively assessed impacts of childhood maltreatment in clinical populations. Sample size, BDNF protein levels in ACE-exposed and unexposed subjects, and standard deviations were extracted from ten publications to estimate the BDNF ratio of means (ROM) across exposure categories. Overall, no significant difference was found in BDNF protein levels between ACE-exposed and unexposed groups (ROM: 1.08; 95 % CI: 0.93-1.26). Age at sampling, analyte type (e.g., sera, plasma, blood), and categories of ACE exposure contributed to high between-study heterogeneity, some of which was minimized in subset-based analyses. These results support continued investigation into the impact of ACE exposure on neural biomarkers and highlight the potential importance of analyte type and timing of sample collection on study results.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Emerging concepts suggest that a combination of persisting focal and diffuse inflammation within the CNS and a gradual failure of compensatory mechanisms, including remyelination, result in disease progression. Therefore, promotion of remyelination presents a promising intervention approach. However, despite our increasing knowledge regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating remyelination in animal models, therapeutic increases in remyelination remain an unmet need in MS, which suggests that mechanisms of remyelination and remyelination failure differ fundamentally between humans and demyelinating animal models. New and emerging technologies now allow us to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying remyelination failure in human tissue samples in an unprecedented way. The aim of this Review is to summarize our current knowledge regarding mechanisms of remyelination and remyelination failure in MS and in animal models of the disease, identify open questions, challenge existing concepts, and discuss strategies to overcome the translational roadblock in the field of remyelination-promoting therapies.© 2023.

"37037874","Revisiting the critical roles of reactive astrocytes in neurodegeneration.","Mol Psychiatry","Astrocytes, an integral component of the central nervous system (CNS), contribute to the maintenance of physiological homeostasis through their roles in synaptic function, K+buffering, blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintenance, and neuronal metabolism. Reactive astrocytes refer to astrocytes undergoing morphological, molecular and functional remodelling in response to pathological stimuli. The activation and differentiation of astrocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are still controversies regarding their subset identification, function and nomenclature in neurodegeneration. In this review, we revisit the multidimensional roles of reactive astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Furthermore, we propose a precise linkage between astrocyte subsets and their functions based on single-cell sequencing analyses.© 2023.

"37032369","Longitudinal associations between use of antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering medications and biological aging.","Geroscience","Aging is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases. This study aimed to examine the effects of antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antidiabetic drugs on biological aging. We included 672 participants and 2746 repeated measurements from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. Self-reported medicine uses were categorized into antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering drugs. A total of 12 biomarkers for biological aging (BA biomarkers) were included as outcomes. Conditional generalized estimating equations were applied conditioning on individuals to estimate the drug effect on BA biomarker level within the same person when using or not using the drug. Chronological age, body mass index, smoking status, number of multiple medication uses, blood pressure, blood glucose level, and apoB/apoA ratio were adjusted for as covariates in the model. Overall, using antihypertensive drugs was associated with a decrease in one DNA-methylation age (PCGrimAge: beta = - 0.39, 95%CI = - 0.67 to - 0.12). When looking into drug subcategories, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were associated with a decrease in several DNA-methylation ages (PCHorvathAge beta = - 1.28, 95%CI = - 2.34 to - 0.21; PCSkin&bloodAge beta = - 1.34, 95%CI = - 2.61 to - 0.07; PCPhenoAge beta = - 1.74, 95%CI = - 2.58 to - 0.89; PCGrimAge beta = - 0.57, 95%CI = - 0.96 to - 0.17) and in functional biological ages (functional age index beta = - 2.18, 95%CI = - 3.65 to - 0.71; frailty index beta = - 1.31, 95%CI = - 2.43 to - 0.18). However, the results within other drug subcategories were inconsistent. Calcium channel blockers may decrease biological aging captured by the BA biomarkers measured at epigenetic and functional level. Future studies are warranted to confirm these effects and understand the underlying biological mechanisms.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37012303","Longitudinal trajectory of vascular age indices and cardiovascular risk factors: a repeated-measures analysis.","Sci Rep","This study aimed to identify the modifiable cardiovascular risk factors associated with longitudinal changes, which are nine functional and structural biological vascular aging indicators (BVAIs), to propose an effective method to prevent biological vascular aging. We conducted a longitudinal study of 697 adults (a maximum of 3636 BVAI measurements) who were, at baseline, aged between 26 and 85 years and whose BVAIs were measured at least twice between 2007 and 2018. The nine BVAIs were measured using vascular testing and an ultrasound device. Covariates were assessed using validated questionnaires and devices. During the mean follow-up period of 6.7 years, the average number of BVAI measurements ranged from 4.3 to 5.3. The longitudinal analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between the common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and chronological age in both men (r = 0.53) and women (r = 0.54). In the multivariate analysis, BVAIs were associated with factors such as age, sex, residential area, smoking status, blood clinical chemistry test levels, number of comorbidities, physical fitness, body mass, physical activity, and dietary intake. The IMT is the most useful BVAI. Our findings suggest that modifiable cardiovascular risk factors are associated with longitudinal changes in BVAI as represented by IMT.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37072614","Why does the immune system destroy pancreatic Î²-cells but not Î±-cells in type 1 diabetes?","Nat Rev Endocrinol","A perplexing feature of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is that the immune system destroys pancreatic β-cells but not neighbouring α-cells, even though both β-cells and α-cells are dysfunctional. Dysfunction, however, progresses to death only for β-cells. Recent findings indicate important differences between these two cell types. First, expression of BCL2L1, a key antiapoptotic gene, is higher in α-cells than in β-cells. Second, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes are differentially expressed, with higher expression levels of pro-apoptotic CHOP in β-cells than in α-cells and higher expression levels of HSPA5 (which encodes the protective chaperone BiP) in α-cells than in β-cells. Third, expression of viral recognition and innate immune response genes is higher in α-cells than in β-cells, contributing to the enhanced resistance of α-cells to coxsackievirus infection. Fourth, expression of the immune-inhibitory HLA-E molecule is higher in α-cells than in β-cells. Of note, α-cells are less immunogenic than β-cells, and the CD8+T cells invading the islets in T1D are reactive to pre-proinsulin but not to glucagon. We suggest that this finding is a result of the enhanced capacity of the α-cell to endure viral infections and ER stress, which enables them to better survive early stressors that can cause cell death and consequently amplify antigen presentation to the immune system. Moreover, the processing of the pre-proglucagon precursor in enteroendocrine cells might favour immune tolerance towards this potential self-antigen compared to pre-proinsulin.© 2023.

Single-cell sequencing provides high-resolution data on cell heterogeneity, allowing high-fidelity cell type identification, and lineage tracking. Computational algorithms and mathematical models have been developed to make sense of the data, compensate for errors and simulate the biological processes, which has led to breakthroughs in our understanding of cell differentiation, cell-fate determination and tissue cell composition. The development of long-read (a.k.a. third-generation) sequencing technologies has produced powerful tools for investigating alternative splicing, isoform expression (at the RNA level), genome assembly and the detection of complex structural variants (at the DNA level). In this review, we provide an overview of the recent advancements in single-cell and long-read sequencing technologies, with a particular focus on the computational algorithms that help in correcting, analysing, and interpreting the resulting data. Additionally, we review some mathematical models that use single-cell and long-read sequencing data to study cell-fate determination and alternative splicing, respectively. Moreover, we highlight the emerging opportunities in modelling cell-fate determination that result from the combination of single-cell and long-read sequencing technologies.© 2023 The Authors."

Here, we present Epi-Impute, a computational method for dropout imputation by reconciling expression and epigenomic data. Epi-Impute leverages single-cell ATAC-seq data as an additional source of information about gene activity to reduce the number of dropouts. We demonstrate that Epi-Impute outperforms existing methods, especially for very sparse single-cell RNA-seq data sets, significantly reducing imputation error. At the same time, Epi-Impute accurately captures the primary distribution of gene expression across cells while preserving the gene-gene and cell-cell relationship in the data. Moreover, Epi-Impute allows for the discovery of functionally relevant cell clusters as a result of the increased resolution of scRNA-seq data due to imputation."

While coding variation inHLAgenes has been extensively documented, regulatory genetic variation modulatingHLAexpression levels has not been comprehensively investigated. Here, we mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for classicalHLAgenes across 1,073 individuals and 1,131,414 single cells from three tissues, using personalized reference genomes to mitigate technical confounding. We identified cell-type-specificcis-eQTLs for every classicalHLAgene. Modeling eQTLs at single-cell resolution revealed that many eQTL effects are dynamic across cell states even within a cell type.HLA-DQgenes exhibit particularly cell-state-dependent effects within myeloid, B, and T cells.

"36972313","Tuberculosis severity associates with variants and eQTLs related to vascular biology and infection-induced inflammation.","PLoS Genet","Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health problem globally, even compared to COVID-19. Genome-wide studies have failed to discover genes that explain a large proportion of genetic risk for adult pulmonary TB, and even fewer have examined genetic factors underlying TB severity, an intermediate trait impacting disease experience, quality of life, and risk of mortality. No prior severity analyses used a genome-wide approach.As part of our ongoing household contact study in Kampala, Uganda, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of TB severity measured by TBScore, in two independent cohorts of culture-confirmed adult TB cases (n = 149 and n = 179). We identified 3 SNPs (P<1.0 x 10-7) including one on chromosome 5, rs1848553, that was GWAS significant (meta-analysis p = 2.97x10-8). All three SNPs are in introns of RGS7BP and have effect sizes corresponding to clinically meaningful reductions in disease severity. RGS7BP is highly expressed in blood vessels and plays a role in infectious disease pathogenesis. Other genes with suggestive associations defined gene sets involved in platelet homeostasis and transport of organic anions. To explore functional implications of the TB severity-associated variants, we conducted eQTL analyses using expression data from Mtb-stimulated monocyte-derived macrophages. A single variant (rs2976562) associated with monocyte SLA expression (p = 0.03) and subsequent analyses indicated that SLA downregulation following MTB stimulation associated with increased TB severity. Src Like Adaptor (SLAP-1), encoded by SLA, is highly expressed in immune cells and negatively regulates T cell receptor signaling, providing a potential mechanistic link to TB severity.These analyses reveal new insights into the genetics of TB severity with regulation of platelet homeostasis and vascular biology being central to consequences for active TB patients. This analysis also reveals genes that regulate inflammation can lead to differences in severity. Our findings provide an important step in improving TB patient outcomes.Copyright: © 2023 McHenry et al.

We used penalized logistic regressions with three different types of penalties included least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), minimax concave penalty (MCP), and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD). The models were trained using genome-wide expression profiling to define gene networks relevant to the COPD stages. A 10-fold cross-validation scheme was used to evaluate the performance of the methods. In addition, we validate our results by the external validity approach. We reported the sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) of the models.There were 21, 22, and 18 significantly associated genes for LASSO, SCAD, and MCP models, respectively. The most statistically conservative method (detecting less significant features) was MCP detected 18 genes that were all detected by the other two approaches. The most appropriate approach was a SCAD penalized logistic regression (AUC= 96.26, sensitivity= 94.2, specificity= 86.96). In this study, we have a common panel of 18 genes in all three models that show a significant positive and negative correlation with COPD, in which RNF130, STX6, PLCB1, CACNA1G, LARP4B, LOC100507634, SLC38A2, and STIM2 showed the odds ratio (OR) more than 1. However, there was a slight difference between penalized methods.Regularization solves the serious dimensionality problem in using this kind of regression. More exploration of how these genes affect the outcome and mechanism is possible more quickly in this manner. The regression-based approaches we present could apply to overcoming this issue."

While a lot is known about the dynamics of chromatin during programmed cellular processes such as development, the role of chromatin in experience-dependent functions remains not well defined. Accumulating evidence suggests that in brain cells, environmental stimuli can trigger long-lasting changes in chromatin structure and tri-dimensional (3D) organization that can influence future transcriptional programs. This review describes recent findings suggesting that chromatin plays an important role in cellular memory, particularly in the maintenance of traces of prior activity in the brain. Inspired by findings in immune and epithelial cells, we discuss the underlying mechanisms and the implications for experience-dependent transcriptional regulation in health and disease. We conclude by presenting a holistic view of chromatin as potential molecular substrate for the integration and assimilation of environmental information that may constitute a conceptual basis for future research.© 2023.

"37020503","Normalization of Large-Scale Transcriptome Data Using Heuristic Methods.","Bioinform Biol Insights","In this study, we introduce an artificial intelligent method for addressing the batch effect of a transcriptome data. The method has several clear advantages in comparison with the alternative methods presently in use. Batch effect refers to the discrepancy in gene expression data series, measured under different conditions. While the data from the same batch (measurements performed under the same conditions) are compatible, combining various batches into 1 data set is problematic because of incompatible measurements. Therefore, it is necessary to perform correction of the combined data (normalization), before performing biological analysis. There are numerous methods attempting to correct data set for batch effect. These methods rely on various assumptions regarding the distribution of the measurements. Forcing the data elements into pre-supposed distribution can severely distort biological signals, thus leading to incorrect results and conclusions. As the discrepancy between the assumptions regarding the data distribution and the actual distribution is wider, the biases introduced by such ""correction methods"" are greater. We introduce a heuristic method to reduce batch effect. The method does not rely on any assumptions regarding the distribution and the behavior of data elements. Hence, it does not introduce any new biases in the process of correcting the batch effect. It strictly maintains the integrity of measurements within the original batches.© The Author(s) 2023."

Nonetheless, ctDNA testing is rarely utilized for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). We report a case in which ctDNA testing uncovered an actionable biomarker that was not detected by comprehensive genomic profiling of tumor tissue. An 81-year-old woman with a remote history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presented with primary masses in the ascending colon and sigmoid colon. The ascending colon and sigmoid colon tumors were classified as microsatellite stable (MSS) and mismatch repair proficient (pMMR), and both ctDNA and tissue next-generation sequencing (NGS) from the ascending colon mass were ordered. Because tissue NGS results indicated that the ascending colon tumor was MSS, palliative 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) chemotherapy was started. However, the ctDNA NGS results that arrived after the start of FOLFOX found high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) disease with a serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAFV600E) mutation. To treat both her MSS/pMMR ascending colon and sigmoid colon tumors and MSI-H/dMMR metastatic disease, the immunotherapy nivolumab was added to FOLFOX. After 8 months of combined nivolumab and chemotherapy, the patient's metastatic disease had a complete clinical response. This case highlights the complementary role of ctDNA testing for biomarker identification. By performing simultaneous ctDNA testing at the time of diagnosis, an actionable biomarker was discovered that significantly altered this patient's prognosis and treatment options. Orthogonal testing of key molecular alterations offers significant advantages for identifying actionable biomarkers and improving management of metastatic CRC.© 2023 The Author(s). Published by S.

A machine-learning classifier was used to analyze the methylation patterns of >105 genomic targets covering >1 million methylation sites. Analytical sensitivity (limit of detection [95% probability]) was characterized with respect to tumor content by expected variant allele frequency and was determined to be 0.07%-0.17% across five tumor cases and 0.51% for the lymphoid neoplasm case. Test specificity was 99.3% (95% confidence interval, 98.6-99.7%). In the reproducibility and repeatability study, results were consistent in 31/34 (91.2%) pairs with cancer and 17/17 (100%) pairs without cancer; between runs, results were concordant for 129/133 (97.0%) cancer and 37/37 (100%) non-cancer sample pairs. Across 3- to 100-ng input levels of cell-free DNA, cancer was detected in 157/182 (86.3%) cancer samples but not in any of the 62 non-cancer samples. In input titration tests, cancer signal origin was correctly predicted in all tumor samples detected as cancer. No cross-contamination events were observed. No potential interferent (hemoglobin, bilirubin, triglycerides, genomic DNA) affected performance.

While multiple brain areas have been implicated, dysfunction of prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuitry has been consistently documented in MDD, as well as in animal models for stress-induced depression-like behavioral states. During brain development, axonal guidance cues organize neuronal wiring by directing axonal pathfinding and arborization, dendritic growth, and synapse formation. Guidance cue systems continue to be expressed in the adult brain and are emerging as important mediators of synaptic plasticity and fine-tuning of mature neural networks. Dysregulation or interference of guidance cues has been linked to depression-like behavioral abnormalities in rodents and MDD in humans. In this review, we focus on the emerging role of guidance cues in stress-induced changes in adult prefrontal cortex circuitry and in precipitating depression-like behaviors. We discuss how modulating axonal guidance cue systems could be a novel approach for precision medicine and the treatment of depression.Copyright © 2023 Mahmud, Avramescu, Niu and Flores."
"36972319","Identification of gene networks mediating regional resistance to tauopathy in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.","PLoS Genet","Neurofibrillary lesions composed of tau protein aggregates are defining hallmarks of Alzheimer's Disease. Despite tau filaments appearing to spread between networked brain regions in a prion-like manner, certain areas including cerebellum resist trans-synaptic spread of tauopathy and degeneration of their constituent neuronal cell bodies. To identify molecular correlates of resistance, we derived and implemented a ratio of ratios approach for disaggregating gene expression data on the basis of regional vulnerability to tauopathic neurodegeneration. When applied to vulnerable pre-frontal cortex as an internal reference for resistant cerebellum, the approach segregated adaptive changes in expression into two components. The first was enriched for neuron-derived transcripts associated with proteostasis including specific members of the molecular chaperone family and was unique to resistant cerebellum. When produced as purified proteins, each of the identified chaperones depressed aggregation of 2N4R tau in vitro at sub-stoichiometric concentrations, consistent with the expression polarity deduced from ratio of ratios testing. In contrast, the second component enriched for glia- and microglia-derived transcripts associated with neuroinflammation, segregating these pathways from susceptibility to tauopathy. These data support the utility of ratio of ratios testing for establishing the polarity of gene expression changes with respect to selective vulnerability. The approach has the potential to identify new targets for drug discovery predicated on their ability to promote resistance to disease in vulnerable neuron populations.Copyright: © 2023 Ayoub et al.

Here we sought to connect the structural changes atcis-regulatory elements to alterations in cellular fate and function. To do this we developed PRINT, a computational method that uses deep learning to correct sequence bias in chromatin accessibility data and identifies multi-scale footprints of DNA-protein interactions. We find that multi-scale footprints enable more accurate inference of TF and nucleosome binding. Using PRINT with single-cell multi-omics, we discover wide-spread changes to the structure and function of candidatecis-regulatory elements (cCREs) across hematopoiesis, wherein nucleosomes slide, expose DNA for TF binding, and promote gene expression. Activity segmentation using the co-variance across cell states identifies ""sub-cCREs"" as modular cCRE subunits of regulatory DNA. We apply this single-cell and PRINT approach to characterize the age-associated alterations to cCREs within hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Remarkably, we find a spectrum of aging alterations among HSCs corresponding to a global gain of sub-cCRE activity while preserving cCRE accessibility. Collectively, we reveal the functional importance of cCRE structure across cell states, highlighting changes to gene regulation at single-cell and single-base-pair resolution."
"36810156","Kinetic networks identify TWIST2 as a key regulatory node in adipogenesis.","Genome Res","Adipocytes contribute to metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Prior characterizations of the transcriptional network driving adipogenesis have overlooked transiently acting transcription factors (TFs), genes, and regulatory elements that are essential for proper differentiation. Moreover, traditional gene regulatory networks provide neither mechanistic details about individual regulatory element-gene relationships nor temporal information needed to define a regulatory hierarchy that prioritizes key regulatory factors. To address these shortcomings, we integrate kinetic chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and nascent transcription (PRO-seq) data to generate temporally resolved networks that describe TF binding events and resultant effects on target gene expression. Our data indicate which TF families cooperate with and antagonize each other to regulate adipogenesis. Compartment modeling of RNA polymerase density quantifies how individual TFs mechanistically contribute to distinct steps in transcription. The glucocorticoid receptor activates transcription by inducing RNA polymerase pause release, whereas SP and AP-1 factors affect RNA polymerase initiation. We identifyTwist2as a previously unappreciated effector of adipocyte differentiation. We find that TWIST2 acts as a negative regulator of 3T3-L1 and primary preadipocyte differentiation. We confirm thatTwist2knockout mice have compromised lipid storage within subcutaneous and brown adipose tissue. Previous phenotyping ofTwist2knockout mice and Setleis syndromeTwist2-/-patients noted deficiencies in subcutaneous adipose tissue.

Cocaine use is common among HIV+ individuals and is associated with accelerated disease progression. However, the mechanisms underlying cocaine-induced immune perturbations remain obscure.We evaluated plasma levels of anti-CD4 IgG and markers of microbial translocation, as well as B-cell gene expression profiles and activation in HIV+ chronic cocaine users and non-users on suppressive ART, as well as uninfected controls. Plasma purified anti-CD4 IgGs were assessed for antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC).HIV+ cocaine users had increased plasma levels of anti-CD4 IgGs, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and soluble CD14 (sCD14) versus non-users. An inverse correlation was observed in cocaine users, but not non-drug users. Anti-CD4 IgGs from HIV+ cocaine users mediated CD4+ T cell death through ADCCin vitro. B cells from HIV+ cocaine users exhibited activation signaling pathways and activation (cycling and TLR4 expression) related to microbial translocation versus non-users.This study improves our understanding of cocaine associated B cell perturbations and immune failure and the new appreciation for autoreactive B cells as novel therapeutic targets.© 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston."

Numerous mediators secreted by inflammatory cells can cause neuronal degeneration. Neuritis may coexist with other mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease, contributing to disease progression, and may also directly underlie AD. Although much has been established about the inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of AD, many aspects remain unexplained.

Pediatricians may play a key role in helping children access special education services. The number of children ages 6-21 in the United States receiving special education services increased 10.4% from 2006 to 2021. Children receiving special education services under the autism category increased 242% during the same period. The demand for special education services for children under the developmental delay and other health impaired categories increased by 184% and 83% respectively. Although student enrollment in American schools has remained stable since 2006, the percentage distribution of children receiving special education services nearly tripled for the autism category and quadrupled for the developmental delay category by 2021. Allowable heavy metal residues remain persistent in the American food supply due to food ingredient manufacturing processes. Numerous clinical trial data indicate heavy metal exposures and poor diet are the primary epigenetic factors responsible for the autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder epidemics. Dietary heavy metal exposures, especially inorganic mercury and lead may impact gene behavior across generations. In 2021, the United States Congress found heavy metal residues problematic in the American food supply but took no legislative action. Mandatory health warning labels on select foods may be the only way to reduce dietary heavy metal exposures and improve child learning across generations.©The Author(s) 2023.

While multimodal single-cell sequencing technologies are rapidly advancing, scalable and flexible profiling of cell signaling states alongside other molecular modalities remains challenging. Here we present Phospho-seq, an integrated approach that aims to quantify phosphorylated intracellular and intranuclear proteins, and to connect their activity with cis-regulatory elements and transcriptional targets. We utilize a simplified benchtop antibody conjugation method to create large custom antibody panels for simultaneous protein and scATAC-seq profiling on whole cells, and integrate this information with scRNA-seq datasets via bridge integration. We apply our workflow to cell lines, induced pluripotent stem cells, and 3-month-old brain organoids to demonstrate its broad applicability. We demonstrate that Phospho-seq can define cellular states and trajectories, reconstruct gene regulatory relationships, and characterize the causes and consequences of heterogeneous cell signaling in neurodevelopment."

Hence, we can get a more comprehensive view by integrating or matching data from different spaces corresponding to the same object. However, it is particularly challenging in the single-cell multi-omics scenario because such data are very sparse with extremely high dimensions. Though some techniques can be used to measure scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq simultaneously, the data are usually highly noisy due to the limitations of the experimental environment.To promote single-cell multi-omics research, we overcome the above challenges, proposing a novel framework, contrastive cycle adversarial autoencoders, which can align and integrate single-cell RNA-seq data and single-cell ATAC-seq data. Con-AAE can efficiently map the above data with high sparsity and noise from different spaces to a coordinated subspace, where alignment and integration tasks can be easier. We demonstrate its advantages on several datasets.Zenodo link: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/368779433. github: https://github.com/kakarotcq/Con-AAE.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37024668","Deep learning-based polygenic risk analysis for Alzheimer's disease prediction.","Commun Med (Lond)","The polygenic nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggests that multiple variants jointly contribute to disease susceptibility. As an individual's genetic variants are constant throughout life, evaluating the combined effects of multiple disease-associated genetic risks enables reliable AD risk prediction. Because of the complexity of genomic data, current statistical analyses cannot comprehensively capture the polygenic risk of AD, resulting in unsatisfactory disease risk prediction. However, deep learning methods, which capture nonlinearity within high-dimensional genomic data, may enable more accurate disease risk prediction and improve our understanding of AD etiology. Accordingly, we developed deep learning neural network models for modeling AD polygenic risk.We constructed neural network models to model AD polygenic risk and compared them with the widely used weighted polygenic risk score and lasso models. We conducted robust linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the AD polygenic risk derived from deep learning methods and AD endophenotypes (i.e., plasma biomarkers and individual cognitive performance). We stratified individuals by applying unsupervised clustering to the outputs from the hidden layers of the neural network model.The deep learning models outperform other statistical models for modeling AD risk. Moreover, the polygenic risk derived from the deep learning models enables the identification of disease-associated biological pathways and the stratification of individuals according to distinct pathological mechanisms.Our results suggest that deep learning methods are effective for modeling the genetic risks of AD and other diseases, classifying disease risks, and uncovering disease mechanisms.© 2023.

However, relevant studies are limited to postnatal short-term follow-up and lack of diverse sample sources analysis other than blood.In this study, a mouse model was used to explore the effects of ART on fetal development and gene expression in the organs of offspring in the adulthood using next-generation sequencing. The sequencing results were then analyzed.The results showed that it caused abnormal expression in 1060 genes and 179 genes in the heart and spleen, respectively. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the heart are mainly enriched in RNA synthesis and processing, and the cardiovascular system development also shows enrichment. STRING analysis identifiedCcl2, Ptgs2, Rock1, Mapk14, Agt, andWnt5aas the core interacting factors. DEGs in the spleen are significantly enriched in anti-infection and immune responses, which include the core factorsFos, JunandIl1r2. Further exploration revealed the abnormal expression of 42 and 5 epigenetic modifiers in the heart and spleen, respectively. The expression of the imprinted genesDhcr7, Igf2, MestandSmoc1decreased in the hearts of ART offspring, and the DNA methylation levels ofIgf2-andMest-imprinting control regions (ICRs) increased abnormally.In the mouse model, ART can interfere with the gene expression pattern in the heart and spleen of the adult offspring and that these changes are related to the aberrant expression of epigenetic regulators.Copyright © 2023 Chen, Zhang, Yue, Cui, Li, Zhang, Liang, Meng and Zhang."

"37064330","Transcriptional memory of dFOXO activation in youth curtails later-life mortality through chromatin remodelling and Xbp1.","Nat Aging","A transient, homeostatic transcriptional response can result in transcriptional memory, programming subsequent transcriptional outputs. Transcriptional memory has great but unappreciated potential to alter animal ageing as animals encounter a multitude of diverse stimuli throughout their lifespan. Here we show that activating an evolutionarily conserved, longevity-promoting transcription factor, dFOXO, solely in early adulthood of female fruit flies is sufficient to improve their subsequent health and survival in mid- and late life. This youth-restricted dFOXO activation causes persistent changes to chromatin landscape in the fat body and requires chromatin remodellers such as the SWI/SNF and ISWI complexes to program health and longevity. Chromatin remodelling is accompanied by a long-lasting transcriptional programme that is distinct from that observed during acute dFOXO activation and includes induction ofXbp1.We show that this later-life induction ofXbp1is sufficient to curtail later-life mortality. Our study demonstrates that transcriptional memory can profoundly alter how animals age."

Mesenchymal stem cells develop various aging phenotypes including the onset of senescence, intrinsic loss of regenerative potential and exacerbation of inflammatory microenvironment via secretory factors. This review elaborates on the emerging concepts on the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms of MSC senescence, such as the accumulation of oxidative stress, DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Senescent MSCs aggravate local inflammation, disrupt bone remodeling and bone-fat balance, thereby contributing to the progression of age-related bone diseases. Various rejuvenation strategies to target senescent MSCs could present a promising paradigm to restore skeletal aging."
"37020120","Proteome alterations in human autopsy tissues in relation to time after death.","Cell Mol Life Sci","Protein expression is a primary area of interest for routine histological diagnostics and tissue-based research projects, but the limitations of its post-mortem applicability remain largely unclear. On the other hand, tissue specimens obtained during autopsies can provide unique insight into advanced disease states, especially in cancer research. Therefore, we aimed to identify the maximum post-mortem interval (PMI) which is still suitable for characterizing protein expression patterns, to explore organ-specific differences in protein degradation, and to investigate whether certain proteins follow specific degradation kinetics. Therefore, the proteome of human tissue samples obtained during routine autopsies of deceased patients with accurate PMI (6, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96 h) and without specific diseases that significantly affect tissue preservation, from lungs, kidneys and livers, was analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For the kidney and liver, significant protein degradation became apparent at 48 h. For the lung, the proteome composition was rather static for up to 48 h and substantial protein degradation was detected only at 72 h suggesting that degradation kinetics appear to be organ specific. More detailed analyses suggested that proteins with similar post-mortem kinetics are not primarily shared in their biological functions. The overrepresentation of protein families with analogous structural motifs in the kidney indicates that structural features may be a common factor in determining similar postmortem stability. Our study demonstrates that a longer post-mortem period may have a significant impact on proteome composition, but sampling within 24 h may be appropriate, as degradation is within acceptable limits even in organs with faster autolysis.© 2023.

Although the effects of COVID-19 are limited for most people, a large number of people continue to show symptoms for a long period of time (long COVID).

The pathogenesis of PD has been related to many dysfunctional cellular mechanisms, however, most of its monogenic forms are caused by pathogenic variants in genes involved in endolysosomal function (LRRK2,VPS35,VPS13C, andATP13A2) and synaptic vesicle trafficking (SNCA,RAB39B,SYNJ1, andDNAJC6). Moreover, an extensive search for PD risk variants revealed strong risk variants in several lysosomal genes (e.g.,GBA1,SMPD1,TMEM175, andSCARB2) highlighting the key role of lysosomal dysfunction in PD pathogenesis. Furthermore, large genetic studies revealed that PD status is associated with the overall ""lysosomal genetic burden"", namely the cumulative effect of strong and weak risk variants affecting lysosomal genes. In this context, understanding the complex mechanisms of impaired vesicular trafficking and dysfunctional endolysosomes in dopaminergic neurons of PD patients is a fundamental step to identifying precise therapeutic targets and developing effective drugs to modify the neurodegenerative process in PD."

Many STR loci have been associated with a range of human genetic disorders. However, most population-scale studies on STR variation in humans have focused on European ancestry cohorts or are limited by sequencing depth. Here, we depicted a comprehensive map of 366,013 polymorphic STRs (pSTRs) constructed from 6487 deeply sequenced genomes, comprising 3983 Chinese samples (~31.5x, NyuWa) and 2504 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project (~33.3x, 1KGP). We found that STR mutations were affected by motif length, chromosome context and epigenetic features. We identified 3273 and 1117 pSTRs whose repeat numbers were associated with gene expression and 3'UTR alternative polyadenylation, respectively. We also implemented population analysis, investigated population differentiated signatures, and genotyped 60 known disease-causing STRs. Overall, this study further extends the scale of STR variation in humans and propels our understanding of the semantics of STRs.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Pioneer SCNT work culminated with cloned amphibians from tadpoles, while technical and biology-driven advances led to cloned mammals from adult animals. Cloning technology has been addressing fundamental questions in biology, propagating desired genomes, and contributing to the generation of transgenic animals or patient-specific stem cells. Nonetheless, SCNT remains technically complex and cloning efficiency relatively low. Genome-wide technologies revealed barriers to nuclear reprogramming, such as persistent epigenetic marks of somatic origin and reprogramming resistant regions of the genome. To decipher the rare reprogramming events that are compatible with full-term cloned development, it will likely require technical advances for large-scale production of SCNT embryos alongside extensive profiling by single-cell multi-omics. Altogether, cloning by SCNT remains a versatile technology, while further advances should continuously refresh the excitement of its applications.© 2023.

Precision dosing of sirolimus using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of sirolimus concentrations in whole blood drawn at the trough (before the next dose) time-point is the current standard of care. For sirolimus, trough concentrations are only modestly correlated with the area under the curve, withR2values ranging from 0.52 to 0.84. Thus, it should not be surprising, even with the use of sirolimus TDM, that patients treated with sirolimus have variable pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and effectiveness. Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) will be beneficial and should be implemented. The data do not suggest dried blood spots point-of-care sampling of sirolimus concentrations for precision dosing of sirolimus.

In this work, we identify six uncharacterized Cas12f1 proteins with nuclease activity in mammalian cells from assembled bacterial genomes. Among them, OsCas12f1 (433 aa) from Oscillibacter sp. and RhCas12f1 (415 aa) from Ruminiclostridium herbifermentans, which respectively target 5' T-rich Protospacer Adjacent Motifs (PAMs) and 5' C-rich PAMs, show the highest editing activity. Through protein and sgRNA engineering, we generate enhanced OsCas12f1 (enOsCas12f1) and enRhCas12f1 variants, with 5'-TTN and 5'-CCD (D = not C) PAMs respectively, exhibiting much higher editing efficiency and broader PAMs, compared with the engineered variant Un1Cas12f1 (Un1Cas12f1_ge4.1). Furthermore, by fusing the destabilized domain with enOsCas12f1, we generate inducible-enOsCas12f1 and demonstate its activity in vivo by single adeno-associated virus delivery. Finally, dead enOsCas12f1-based epigenetic editing and gene activation can also be achieved in mammalian cells.

"37027099","Recent advances in therapeutic CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing: mechanisms and applications.","Mol Biomed","Recently, clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 derived editing tools had significantly improved our ability to make desired changes in the genome. Wild-type Cas9 protein recognizes the target genomic loci and induced local double strand breaks (DSBs) in the guidance of small RNA molecule. In mammalian cells, the DSBs are mainly repaired by endogenous non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is error prone and results in the formation of indels. The indels can be harnessed to interrupt gene coding sequences or regulation elements. The DSBs can also be fixed by homology directed repair (HDR) pathway to introduce desired changes, such as base substitution and fragment insertion, when proper donor templates are provided, albeit in a less efficient manner. Besides making DSBs, Cas9 protein can be mutated to serve as a DNA binding platform to recruit functional modulators to the target loci, performing local transcriptional regulation, epigenetic remolding, base editing or prime editing. These Cas9 derived editing tools, especially base editors and prime editors, can introduce precise changes into the target loci at a single-base resolution and in an efficient and irreversible manner. Such features make these editing tools very promising for therapeutic applications.

The molecular effector mechanisms of these lncRNAs are diverse. Overall, cell-type selective modulation of gene expression is the largest common denominator. New methods, such as single-cell profiling and CRISPR/Cas9-screening, reveal additional novel mechanistic principles: For example, many lncRNAs establish RNA-based spatial compartments that concentrate effector proteins. Also, RNA modifications and splicing features can be determinants of lncRNA function.lncRNA research is passing the stage of enumerating lncRNAs or recording simplified on-off expression switches.

However, mechanisms underlying age-related niche defects, and whether restoring niche function can improve stem cell fitness, remain unclear. Here, we sought to determine whether aged blood stem cell function can be restored by rejuvenating their supportive niches within the bone marrow (BM). We identify Netrin-1 as a critical regulator of BM niche cell aging. Niche-specific deletion of Netrin-1 induces premature aging phenotypes within the BM microenvironment, while supplementation of aged mice with Netrin-1 rejuvenates aged niche cells and restores competitive fitness of aged blood stem cells to youthful levels. We show that Netrin-1 plays an essential role in maintaining active DNA damage responses (DDR), and that aging-associated decline in niche-derived Netrin-1 results in DNA damage accumulation within the BM microenvironment. We show that Netrin-1 supplementation is sufficient to resolve DNA damage and restore regenerative potential of the aged BM niche and blood stem cells to endure serial chemotherapy regimens.© 2023.

"37013186","Age or lifestyle-induced accumulation of genotoxicity is associated with a length-dependent decrease in gene expression.","iScience","DNA damage has long been advocated as a molecular driver of aging. DNA damage occurs in a stochastic manner, and is therefore more likely to accumulate in longer genes. The length-dependent accumulation of transcription-blocking damage, unlike that of somatic mutations, should be reflected in gene expression datasets of aging. We analyzed gene expression as a function of gene length in several single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of mouse and human aging. We found a pervasive age-associated length-dependent underexpression of genes across species, tissues, and cell types. Furthermore, we observed length-dependent underexpression associated with UV-radiation and smoke exposure, and in progeroid diseases, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy. Finally, we studied published gene sets showing global age-related changes. Genes underexpressed with aging were significantly longer than overexpressed genes. These data highlight a previously undetected hallmark of aging and show that accumulation of genotoxicity in long genes could lead to reduced RNA polymerase II processivity.© 2023 The Author(s)."

We first conducted differential expression and methylation analysis between the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and healthy controls. FEM was employed to identify functional epigenetic modules, from which a diagnostic model for COVID-19 was built. SKA1 and WSB1 modules were identified, with SKA1 module enriched in COVID-19 replication and transcription, and WSB1 module related to ubiquitin-protein activity. The differentially expressed or differentially methylated genes in these two modules could be used to distinguish COVID-19 from healthy controls, with AUC reaching 1 and 0.98 for SKA1 and WSB1 modules, respectively. Two epigenetically activated genes (CENPM and KNL1) from the SKA1 module were upregulated in HPV- or HBV-positive tumor samples and were found to be significantly associated with the survival of tumor patients.

However, a detailed DNA methylation (DNAme) landscape has not yet been elucidated. Our study combined DNAme and transcriptome profiles for HCM myocardium and identify aberrant DNAme associated with altered myocardial function in HCM. The transcription of methylation-related genes did not significantly differ between HCM and normal myocardium. Nevertheless, the former had an altered DNAme profile compared with the latter. The hypermethylated and hypomethylated sites in HCM tissues had chromosomal distributions and functional enrichment of correlated genes differing from those of their normal tissue counterparts. The GO analysis of network underlying the genes correlated with DNAme alteration and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shows functional clusters centred on immune cell function and muscle system processes. In KEGG analysis, only the calcium signalling pathway was enriched either by the genes correlated with changes in DNAme or DEGs. The protein-protein interactions (PPI) underlying the genes altered at both the DNAme and transcriptional highlighted two important functional clusters. One of these was related to the immune response and had the estrogen receptor-encodingESR1gene as its node. The other cluster comprised cardiac electrophysiology-related genes. Intelliectin-1 (ITLN1), a component of the innate immune system, was transcriptionally downregulated in HCM and had a hypermethylated site within 1500 bp upstream of theITLN1transcription start site. Estimates of immune infiltration demonstrated a relative decline in immune cell population diversity in HCM. A combination of DNAme and transcriptome profiles may help identify and develop new therapeutic targets for HCM."

As the most important protein-DNA complex, its structural and dynamic features have been successively revealed in recent years. However, its regulatory mechanism, which is modulated by multiple factors, still requires systemic discussion. This study summarizes the regulatory factors of the nucleosome's dynamic features from the perspective of histone modification, DNA methylation, and the nucleosome-interacting factors (transcription factors and nucleosome-remodeling proteins and cations) and focuses on the research exploring the molecular mechanism through both computational and experimental approaches. The regulatory factors that affect the dynamic features of nucleosomes are also discussed in detail, such as unwrapping, wrapping, sliding, and stacking. Due to the complexity of the high-order topological structures of nucleosomes and the comprehensive effects of regulatory factors, the research on the functional modulation mechanism of nucleosomes has encountered great challenges. The integration of computational and experimental approaches, the construction of physical modes for nucleosomes, and the application of deep learning techniques will provide promising opportunities for further exploration."
"36972316","An associative memory Hamiltonian model for DNA and nucleosomes.","PLoS Comput Biol","A model for DNA and nucleosomes is introduced with the goal of studying chromosomes from a single base level all the way to higher-order chromatin structures. This model, dubbed the Widely Editable Chromatin Model (WEChroM), reproduces the complex mechanics of the double helix including its bending persistence length and twisting persistence length, and the temperature dependence of the former. The WEChroM Hamiltonian is composed of chain connectivity, steric interactions, and associative memory terms representing all remaining interactions leading to the structure, dynamics, and mechanical characteristics of the B-DNA. Several applications of this model are discussed to demonstrate its applicability. WEChroM is used to investigate the behavior of circular DNA in the presence of positive and negative supercoiling. We show that it recapitulates the formation of plectonemes and of structural defects that relax mechanical stress. The model spontaneously manifests an asymmetric behavior with respect to positive or negative supercoiling, similar to what was previously observed in experiments. Additionally, we show that the associative memory Hamiltonian is also capable of reproducing the free energy of partial DNA unwrapping from nucleosomes. WEChroM is designed to emulate the continuously variable mechanical properties of the 10nm fiber and, by virtue of its simplicity, is ready to be scaled up to molecular systems large enough to investigate the structural ensembles of genes. WEChroM is implemented in the OpenMM simulation toolkits and is freely available for public use.Copyright: © 2023 Lu et al.

The current study aimed to holistically map the regulatory networks driven by SARS-CoV-2 related circRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs to uncover plausible interactions and interplay amongst them in order to explore possible therapeutic options in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patient datasets were analyzed systematically in a unified approach to explore circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA expression profiles. CircRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed based on cytokine storm related circRNAs forming a total of 165 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA pairs. This study implies the potential regulatory role of the obtained circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network and proposes that two differentially expressed circRNAs hsa_circ_0080942 and hsa_circ_0080135 might serve as a potential theranostic agents for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, the results shed light on the functional role of circRNAs as ceRNAs to sponge miRNA and regulate mRNA expression during SARS-CoV-2 infection.Copyright: © 2023 Ayaz et al.

"36944267","Seqpac: a framework for sRNA-seq analysis in R using sequence-based counts.","Bioinformatics","Feature-based counting is commonly used in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses. Here, sequences must align to target features (like genes or non-coding RNAs) and related sequences with different compositions are counted into the same feature. Consequently, sequence integrity is lost, making results less traceable against raw data.Small RNA (sRNA) often maps to multiple features and shows an incredible diversity in form and function. Therefore, applying feature-based strategies may increase the risk of misinterpretation. We present a strategy for sRNA-seq analysis that preserves the integrity of the raw sequence making the data lineage fully traceable. We have consolidated this strategy into Seqpac: An R package that makes a complete sRNA analysis available on multiple platforms. Using published biological data, we show that Seqpac reveals hidden bias and adds new insights to studies that were previously analyzed using feature-based counting.We have identified limitations in the concurrent analysis of RNA-seq data. We call it the traceability dilemma in alignment-based sequencing strategies. By building a flexible framework that preserves the integrity of the read sequence throughout the analysis, we demonstrate better interpretability in sRNA-seq experiments, which are particularly vulnerable to this problem. Applying similar strategies to other transcriptomic workflows may aid in resolving the replication crisis experienced by many fields that depend on transcriptome analyses.Seqpac is available on Bioconductor (https://bioconductor.org/packages/seqpac) and GitHub (https://github.com/danis102/seqpac).© The Author(s) 2023.

"37020289","Exploring the association of physical activity with the plasma and urine metabolome in adolescents and young adults.","Nutr Metab (Lond)","Regular physical activity elicits many health benefits. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms through which physical activity influences overall health are less understood. Untargeted metabolomics enables system-wide mapping of molecular perturbations which may lend insights into physiological responses to regular physical activity. In this study, we investigated the associations of habitual physical activity with plasma and urine metabolome in adolescents and young adults.This cross-sectional study included participants from the DONALD (DOrtmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed) study with plasma samples n = 365 (median age: 18.4 (18.1, 25.0) years, 58% females) and 24 h urine samples n = 215 (median age: 18.1 (17.1, 18.2) years, 51% females). Habitual physical activity was assessed using a validated Adolescent Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire. Plasma and urine metabolite concentrations were determined using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS) methods. In a sex-stratified analysis, we conducted principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of metabolite data and to create metabolite patterns. Multivariable linear regression models were then applied to assess the associations between self-reported physical activity (metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hours per week) with single metabolites and metabolite patterns, adjusted for potential confounders and controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at 5% for each set of regressions.Habitual physical activity was positively associated with the ""lipid, amino acids and xenometabolite"" pattern in the plasma samples of male participants only (β = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04, p = 0.001, adjusted p = 0.042). In both sexes, no association of physical activity with single metabolites in plasma and urine and metabolite patterns in urine was found (all adjusted p > 0.05).Our explorative study suggests that habitual physical activity is associated with alterations of a group of metabolites reflected in the plasma metabolite pattern in males. These perturbations may lend insights into some of underlying mechanisms that modulate effects of physical activity.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37064248","Development of a biomarker signature using grating-coupled fluorescence plasmonic microarray for diagnosis of MIS-C.","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious condition that can develop 4-6 weeks after a school age child becomes infected by SARS-CoV-2. To date, in the United States more than 8,862 cases of MIS-C have been identified and 72 deaths have occurred. This syndrome typically affects children between the ages of 5-13; 57% are Hispanic/Latino/Black/non-Hispanic, 61% of patients are males and 100% have either tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or had direct contact with someone with COVID-19. Unfortunately, diagnosis of MIS-C is difficult, and delayed diagnosis can lead to cardiogenic shock, intensive care admission, and prolonged hospitalization. There is no validated biomarker for the rapid diagnosis of MIS-C. In this study, we used Grating-coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) microarray technology to develop biomarker signatures in pediatric salvia and serum samples from patients with MIS-C in the United States and Colombia. GCFP measures antibody-antigen interactions at individual regions of interest (ROIs) on a gold-coated diffraction grating sensor chip in a sandwich immunoassay to generate a fluorescent signal based on analyte presence within a sample. Using a microarray printer, we designed a first-generation biosensor chip with the capability of capturing 33 different analytes from 80 μLof sample (saliva or serum). Here, we show potential biomarker signatures in both saliva and serum samples in six patient cohorts. In saliva samples, we noted occasional analyte outliers on the chip within individual samples and were able to compare those samples to 16S RNA microbiome data. These comparisons indicate differences in relative abundance of oral pathogens within those patients. Microsphere Immunoassay (MIA) of immunoglobulin isotypes was also performed on serum samples and revealed MIS-C patients had several COVID antigen-specific immunoglobulins that were significantly higher than other cohorts, thus identifying potential new targets for the second-generation biosensor chip. MIA also identified additional biomarkers for our second-generation chip, verified biomarker signatures generated on the first-generation chip, and aided in second-generation chip optimization. Interestingly, MIS-C samples from the United States had a more diverse and robust signature than the Colombian samples, which was also illustrated in the MIA cytokine data. These observations identify new MIS-C biomarkers and biomarker signatures for each of the cohorts. Ultimately, these tools may represent a potential diagnostic tool for use in the rapid identification of MIS-C.Copyright © 2023 Maltz-Matyschsyk, Melchiorre, Herbst, Hogan, Dibble, O’Sullivan, Graf, Jadhav, Lawrence, Lee, Carson, Radolf, Salazar, Lynes and Connecticut Children’s COVID Collaborative."

The goal of our study was to analyze the features of blood coagulation, platelet aggregation, and plasma proteomics in COVID-19 convalescents with AMI. The study included 66 AMI patients and 58 healthy volunteers. The groups were divided according to the anti-N IgG levels (AMI post-COVID (n= 44), AMI control (n= 22), control post-COVID (n= 31), and control (n= 27)). All participants underwent rotational thromboelastometry, thrombodynamics, impedance aggregometry, and blood plasma proteomics analysis. Both AMI groups of patients demonstrated higher values of clot growth rates, thrombus size and density, as well as the elevated levels of components of the complement system, proteins modifying the state of endothelium, acute-phase and procoagulant proteins. In comparison with AMI control, AMI post-COVID patients demonstrated decreased levels of proteins connected to inflammation and hemostasis (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, C4b-binding protein alpha-chain, plasma protease C1 inhibitor, fibrinogen beta-chain, vitamin K-dependent protein S), and altered correlations between inflammation and fibrinolysis. A new finding is that AMI post-COVID patients opposite the AMI control group, are characterized by a less noticeable growth of acute-phase proteins and hemostatic markers that could be explained by prolonged immune system alteration after COVID-19."

Identifying early infections in the setting of CRS and neutropenia represents an unresolved clinical challenge. In this retrospective observational analysis, early fever events (day 0-30) were characterized as infection versus CRS in 62 patients treated with standard-of-care CD19.CAR-T for relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Routine serum inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin-6 [IL-6], procalcitonin [PCT]) were recorded daily. Exploratory plasma proteomics were performed longitudinally in 52 patients using a multiplex proximity extension assay (Olink proteomics). Compared with the CRSonlycohort, we noted increased event-day IL-6 (median 2243 versus 64 pg/mL,P= 0.03) and particularly high PCT levels (median 1.6 versus 0.3 µg/L,P< 0.0001) in the patients that developed severe infections. For PCT, an optimal discriminatory threshold of 1.5 µg/L was established (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUCROC] = 0.78). Next, we incorporated day-of-fever PCT levels with the patient-individual CAR-HEMATOTOX score. In a multicenter validation cohort (n = 125), we confirmed the discriminatory capacity of this so-called HT10 score for early infections at first fever (AUCROC= 0.87,P< 0.0001, sens. 86%, spec. 86%). Additionally, Olink proteomics revealed pronounced immune dysregulation and endothelial dysfunction in patients with severe infections as evidenced by an increased ANGPT2/1 ratio and an altered CD40/CD40L-axis. In conclusion, the high discriminatory capacity of the HT10 score for infections highlights the advantage of dynamic risk assessment and supports the incorporation of PCT into routine inflammatory panels. Candidate markers from Olink proteomics may further refine risk-stratification. If validated prospectively, the score will enable risk-adapted decisions on antibiotic use.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

Whether a genetic predisposition to AI disease associates with WBC counts in populations expected to have low numbers of AI cases is not known. We developed genetic instruments for 7 AI diseases using genome-wide association study summary statistics. Two-sample inverse variance weighted regression (IVWR) was used to determine associations between each instrument and WBC counts. Effect size represents change in transformed WBC counts per change in log odds-ratio of the disease. For AI diseases with significant associations by IVWR, polygenic risk scores (PRS) were used to test for associations with measured WBC counts in individuals of European ancestry in a community-based (ARIC, n = 8926), and a medical-center derived cohort (BioVU, n = 40,461). The IVWR analyses revealed significant associations between 3 AI diseases and WBC counts: systemic lupus erythematous (Beta = - 0.05 [95% CI, - 0.06, - 0.03]), multiple sclerosis (Beta =  - 0.06 [- 0.10, - 0.03]), and rheumatoid arthritis (Beta = 0.02 [0.01, 0.03]). PRS for these diseases showed associations with measured WBC counts in ARIC and BioVU. Effect sizes tended to be larger among females, consistent with the known higher prevalence of these diseases among this group. This study shows that genetic predisposition to systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis was associated with WBC counts, even in populations expected to have very low numbers of disease cases.© 2023.

"37047638","The Melanocortin System: A Promising Target for the Development of New Antidepressant Drugs.","Int J Mol Sci","Major depression is one of the most prevalent mental disorders, causing significant human suffering and socioeconomic loss. Since conventional antidepressants are not sufficiently effective, there is an urgent need to develop new antidepressant medications. Despite marked advances in the neurobiology of depression, the etiology and pathophysiology of this disease remain poorly understood. Classical and newer hypotheses of depression suggest that an imbalance of brain monoamines, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and immune system, or impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and neurotrophic factors pathways are cause of depression. It is assumed that conventional antidepressants improve these closely related disturbances. The purpose of this review was to discuss the possibility of affecting these disturbances by targeting the melanocortin system, which includes adrenocorticotropic hormone-activated receptors and their peptide ligands (melanocortins). The melanocortin system is involved in the regulation of various processes in the brain and periphery. Melanocortins, including peripherally administered non-corticotropic agonists, regulate HPAA activity, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, stimulate the levels of neurotrophic factors, and enhance hippocampal neurogenesis and neurotransmission. Therefore, endogenous melanocortins and their analogs are able to complexly affect the functioning of those body's systems that are closely related to depression and the effects of antidepressants, thereby demonstrating a promising antidepressant potential."
"37056282","Circulating adipokine concentrations and the risk of venous thromboembolism: A Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis.","Front Genet","Background:Previous observational studies have suggested that circulating adipokine concentrations are related to a greater risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, it remained unclear whether these observations reflect causality.Objective:This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between circulating adipokine concentrations (including adiponectin, leptin, PAI-1, MCP-1, leptin receptor, and RETN) and the risk of VTE and its subtypes (DVT and PE) and to determine whether circulating adipokine concentrations are a mediator of venous thromboembolic events in obese patients.Methods:We used Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to determine the effects of the body mass index (BMI), adiponectin, leptin, PAI-1, MCP-1, leptin receptor, and RETN levels on VTE, DVT, and PE in a cohort of 11,288 VTE cases, 5,632 DVT cases, 5,130 PE cases, and 254,771 controls. We then assessed the proportion of the effect of obesity on VTE, DVT, and PE explained by circulating leptin levels.Result:Genetically predicted higher BMI was related to increased VTE (OR = 1.45,p< 0.001), DVT (OR = 1.63,p< 0.001), and PE (OR = 1.37,p< 0.001) risk, and higher circulating leptin levels increase odds of VTE (OR = 1.96, q < 0.001), DVT (OR = 2.52, q < 0.001), and PE (OR = 2.26, q = 0.005). In addition, we found that the causal effect between elevated serum adiponectin and the decreased risk of VTE (OR = 0.85,p= 0.013, q = 0.053) and PE (OR = 0.81,p= 0.032, q = 0.083) and between MCP-1 and the reduced risk of VTE (OR = 0.88,p= 0.048, q = 0.143) is no longer significant after FDR adjustment. In MR mediation analysis, the mediation effect of circulating leptin levels in the causal pathway from BMI to PE was estimated to be 1.28 (0.95-1.71,p= 0.10), accounting for 39.14% of the total effect.Conclusion:The circulating leptin level is a risk factor for VTE, DVT, and PE, but it might be a potential mediator of BMI on the risk of PE, and thus, interventions on the circulating leptin level in obesity might reduce the risk of PE. Adiponectin is a potential protective factor for both VTE and PE.Copyright © 2023 Xiao, Li, Feng and Jin."
"37036840","Identification of copy number variations in the genome of Dairy Gir cattle.","PLoS One","Studying structural variants that can control complex traits is relevant for dairy cattle production, especially for animals that are tolerant to breeding conditions in the tropics, such as the Dairy Gir cattle. This study identified and characterized high confidence copy number variation regions (CNVR) in the Gir breed genome. A total of 38 animals were whole-genome sequenced, and 566 individuals were genotyped with a high-density SNP panel, among which 36 animals had both sequencing and SNP genotyping data available. Two sets of high confidence CNVR were established: one based on common CNV identified in the studied population (CNVR_POP), and another with CNV identified in sires with both sequence and SNP genotyping data available (CNVR_ANI). We found 10 CNVR_POP and 45 CNVR_ANI, which covered 1.05 Mb and 4.4 Mb of the bovine genome, respectively. Merging these CNV sets for functional analysis resulted in 48 unique high confidence CNVR. The overlapping genes were previously related to embryonic mortality, environmental adaptation, evolutionary process, immune response, longevity, mammary gland, resistance to gastrointestinal parasites, and stimuli recognition, among others. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the Gir breed genome. Moreover, the CNV identified in this study can potentially affect genes related to complex traits, such as production, health, and reproduction.Copyright: © 2023 Braga et al.

"37029425","Sperm DNA methylation is predominantly stable in mice offspring born after transplantation of long-term cultured spermatogonial stem cells.","Clin Epigenetics","Spermatogonial stem cell transplantation (SSCT) is proposed as a fertility therapy for childhood cancer survivors. SSCT starts with cryopreserving a testicular biopsy prior to gonadotoxic treatments such as cancer treatments. When the childhood cancer survivor reaches adulthood and desires biological children, the biopsy is thawed and SSCs are propagated in vitro and subsequently auto-transplanted back into their testis. However, culturing stress during long-term propagation can result in epigenetic changes in the SSCs, such as DNA methylation alterations, and might be inherited by future generations born after SSCT. Therefore, SSCT requires a detailed preclinical epigenetic assessment of the derived offspring before this novel cell therapy is clinically implemented. With this aim, the DNA methylation status of sperm from SSCT-derived offspring, with in vitro propagated SSCs, was investigated in a multi-generational mouse model using reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing.Although there were some methylation differences, they represent less than 0.5% of the total CpGs and methylated regions, in all generations. Unsupervised clustering of all samples showed no distinct grouping based on their pattern of methylation differences. After selecting the few single genes that are significantly altered in multiple generations of SSCT offspring compared to control, we validated the results with quantitative Bisulfite Sanger sequencing and RT-qPCRin various organs. Differential methylation was confirmed only for Tal2, being hypomethylated in sperm of SSCT offspring and presenting higher gene expression in ovaries of SSCT F1 offspring compared to control F1.We found no major differences in DNA methylation between SSCT-derived offspring and control, both in F1 and F2 sperm. The reassuring outcomes from our study are a prerequisite for promising translation of SSCT to the human situation.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Interestingly, the trio exome sequencing analysis also detected eight apparent de novo mosaic variants with variant allele fraction (VAF) ranging between 11.5 and 37%. Here, using whole genome sequencing and a 'home-brew' variant filtering pipeline and DeepMosaic module, we investigated the number and signature of de novo heterozygous and mosaic variants and the hypothesis of a rare phenomenon of hypermutation. Eight-hundred-thirty apparent de novo SNVs and 21 de novo indels had VAFs below 37.41% and were considered postzygotic somatic mosaic variants. The VAFs showed a bimodal distribution, with one component having an average VAF of 25% (range: 18.7-37.41%) (n = 446), representing potential postzygotic first mitotic events, and the other component with an average VAF of 12.5% (range 9.55-18.69%) (n = 384), describing potential second mitotic events. No increased rate of CNV formation was observed. The mutational pattern analysis for somatic single base substitution showed SBS40, SBS5, and SBS3 as the top recognized signatures. SBS3 is a known signature associated with homologous recombination-based DNA damage repair error. Our data demonstrate that biallelic RAD51C variants show evidence for defective genomic DNA damage repair and thereby result in a hypermutator phenotype with the accumulation of postzygotic de novo mutations, at least in the prenatal period. This 'genome hypermutator phenomenon' might contribute to the observed hematological manifestations and the predisposition to tumors in patients with FA. We propose that other FA groups should be investigated for genome-wide de novo variants.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

"37069411","The causal role of intestinal microbiome in development of pre-eclampsia.","Funct Integr Genomics","The correlation of pre-eclampsia (PE) and intestinal microbiome has been widely demonstrated in existing research, whereas their causal relationship has been rarely explored. The causal relationship between intestinal microbiome and PE risk was examined using large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. To be specific, the causal microbial taxa for PE were identified using the two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method. The results were verified to be robust through comprehensive sensitive analyses, and the independence of causal relationship was ensured through novel multivariable MR analyses. The possibility of reverse relationships was ruled out through reverse-direction MR analyses. Lastly, the biofunction was explored through enrichment analysis, and a series of validations of PE results in a second GWAS were performed to confirm the results. After correction, four microbial taxa, including Streptococcus genus for PE (FDR q = 0.085), Olsenella genus for PE (FDR q = 0.085), Enterobacteriales order for PE (FDR q = 0.0134), and Akkermansia genus for PE (FDR q = 0.015), had a causal relationship to diverse joint PE (FDR q < 0.15). Moreover, when three different methods were employed on basis of the nominal significance (P < 0.05), five suggestive microbial taxa took on significance. The effect of heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy was excluded through sensitive analysis, and the possibility of horizontal pleiotropy of BMI was ruled out through multivariable MR analysis. The protective mechanism of the identified taxa against PE was illustrated through GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathways. A number of microbial taxa had a causal relationship to PE. The result of this study provides more insights into intestinal microbiome in the pathology of PE.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Obesity has been associated with the risk of developing solid and hematological cancers, but its role as a risk factor for MM needs to be further explored. Here, we evaluated whether 32 genome-wide association study (GWAS)-identified variants for obesity were associated with the risk of MM in 4189 German subjects from the German Multiple Myeloma Group (GMMG) cohort (2121 MM cases and 2068 controls) and 1293 Spanish subjects (206 MM cases and 1087 controls). Results were then validated through meta-analysis with data from the UKBiobank (554 MM cases and 402,714 controls) and FinnGen cohorts (914 MM cases and 248,695 controls). Finally, we evaluated the correlation of these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with cQTL data, serum inflammatory proteins, steroid hormones, and absolute numbers of blood-derived cell populations (n =520). The meta-analysis of the four European cohorts showed no effect of obesity-related variants on the risk of developing MM. We only found a very modest association of thePOC5rs2112347GandADCY3rs11676272Galleles with MM risk that did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing (per-allele OR=1.08,p =0.0083 and per-allele OR=1.06,p =0.046). No correlation between these SNPs and functional data was found, which confirms that obesity-related variants do not influence MM risk."
"37045821","Predictive and robust gene selection for spatial transcriptomics.","Nat Commun","A prominent trend in single-cell transcriptomics is providing spatial context alongside a characterization of each cell's molecular state. This typically requires targeting an a priori selection of genes, often covering less than 1% of the genome, and a key question is how to optimally determine the small gene panel. We address this challenge by introducing a flexible deep learning framework, PERSIST, to identify informative gene targets for spatial transcriptomics studies by leveraging reference scRNA-seq data. Using datasets spanning different brain regions, species, and scRNA-seq technologies, we show that PERSIST reliably identifies panels that provide more accurate prediction of the genome-wide expression profile, thereby capturing more information with fewer genes. PERSIST can be adapted to specific biological goals, and we demonstrate that PERSIST's binarization of gene expression levels enables models trained on scRNA-seq data to generalize with to spatial transcriptomics data, despite the complex shift between these technologies.© 2023.

"37011102","Applying a GAN-based classifier to improve transcriptome-based prognostication in breast cancer.","PLoS Comput Biol","Established prognostic tests based on limited numbers of transcripts can identify high-risk breast cancer patients, yet are approved only for individuals presenting with specific clinical features or disease characteristics. Deep learning algorithms could hold potential for stratifying patient cohorts based on full transcriptome data, yet the development of robust classifiers is hampered by the number of variables in omics datasets typically far exceeding the number of patients. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a classifier based on a data augmentation pipeline consisting of a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (GAN) with gradient penalty and an embedded auxiliary classifier to obtain a trained GAN discriminator (T-GAN-D). Applied to 1244 patients of the METABRIC breast cancer cohort, this classifier outperformed established breast cancer biomarkers in separating low- from high-risk patients (disease specific death, progression or relapse within 10 years from initial diagnosis). Importantly, the T-GAN-D also performed across independent, merged transcriptome datasets (METABRIC and TCGA-BRCA cohorts), and merging data improved overall patient stratification. In conclusion, the reiterative GAN-based training process allowed generating a robust classifier capable of stratifying low- vs high-risk patients based on full transcriptome data and across independent and heterogeneous breast cancer cohorts.Copyright: © 2023 Guttà et al.

"37038099","Maternal patterns of inheritance alter transcript expression in eggs.","BMC Genomics","Modifications to early development can lead to evolutionary diversification. The early stages of development are under maternal control, as mothers produce eggs loaded with nutrients, proteins and mRNAs that direct early embryogenesis. Maternally provided mRNAs are the only expressed genes in initial stages of development and are tightly regulated. Differences in maternal mRNA provisioning could lead to phenotypic changes in embryogenesis and ultimately evolutionary changes in development. However, the extent that maternal mRNA expression in eggs can vary is unknown for most developmental models. Here, we use a species with dimorphic development- where females make eggs and larvae of different sizes and life-history modes-to investigate the extent of variation in maternal mRNA provisioning to the egg.We find that there is significant variation in gene expression across eggs of different development modes, and that there are both qualitative and quantitative differences in mRNA expression. We separate parental effects from allelic effects, and find that both mechanisms contribute to mRNA expression differences. We also find that offspring of intraspecific crosses differentially provision their eggs based on the parental cross direction (a parental effect), which has not been previously demonstrated in reproductive traits like oogenesis.We find that maternally controlled initiation of development is functionally distinct between eggs of different sizes and maternal genotypes. Both allele-specific effects and parent-of-origin effects contribute to gene expression differences in eggs. The latter indicates an intergenerational effect where a parent's genotype can affect gene expression in an egg made by the next generation.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36862326","The third barrier to transgenerational inheritance in animals: somatic epigenetic resetting.","EMBO Rep","After early controversy, it is now increasingly clear that acquired responses to environmental factors may perpetuate across multiple generations-a phenomenon termed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI). Experiments with Caenorhabditis elegans, which exhibits robust heritable epigenetic effects, demonstrated small RNAs as key factors of TEI. Here, we discuss three major barriers to TEI in animals, two of which, the ""Weismann barrier"" and germline epigenetic reprogramming, have been known for decades. These are thought to effectively prevent TEI in mammals but not to the same extent in C. elegans. We argue that a third barrier-that we termed ""somatic epigenetic resetting""-may further inhibit TEI and, unlike the other two, restricts TEI in C. elegans as well. While epigenetic information can overcome the Weismann barrier and transmit from the soma to the germline, it usually cannot ""travel back"" directly from the germline to the soma in subsequent generations. Nevertheless, heritable germline memory may still influence the animal's physiology by indirectly modifying gene expression in somatic tissues.© 2023 The Authors.

"36919677","Performance comparisons of methylation and structural variants from low-input whole-genome methylation sequencing.","Epigenomics","Aim:Whole-genome methylation sequencing carries both DNA methylation and structural variant information (single nucleotide variant [SNV]; copy number variant [CNV]); however, limited data is available on the reliability of obtaining this information simultaneously from low-input DNA using various library preparation and sequencing protocols.Methods:A HapMap NA12878 sample was sequenced with three protocols (EM-sequencing, QIA-sequencing and Swift-sequencing) and their performance was compared on CpG methylation measurement and SNV and CNV detection.Results:At low DNA input (10-25 ng), EM-sequencing was superior in almost all metrics except CNV detection where all protocols were similar. EM-sequencing captured the highest number of CpGs and true SNVs.Conclusion:EM-sequencing is suitable to detect methylation, SNVs and CNVs from single sequencing with low-input DNA."
"37019930","Systematic comparison of tools used for m(6)A mapping from nanopore direct RNA sequencing.","Nat Commun","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has been increasingly recognized as a new and important regulator of gene expression. To date, transcriptome-wide m6A detection primarily relies on well-established methods using next-generation sequencing (NGS) platform. However, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform has recently emerged as a promising alternative method to study m6A. While multiple computational tools are being developed to facilitate the direct detection of nucleotide modifications, little is known about the capabilities and limitations of these tools. Here, we systematically compare ten tools used for mapping m6A from ONT DRS data. We find that most tools present a trade-off between precision and recall, and integrating results from multiple tools greatly improve performance. Using a negative control could improve precision by subtracting certain intrinsic bias. We also observed variation in detection capabilities and quantitative information among motifs, and identified sequencing depth and m6A stoichiometry as potential factors affecting performance. Our study provides insight into the computational tools currently used for mapping m6A based on ONT DRS data and highlights the potential for further improving these tools, which may serve as the basis for future research.© 2023.

"36993179","Mechanisms of transcription control by distal enhancers from high-resolution single-gene imaging.","bioRxiv","How distal enhancers physically control promoters over large genomic distances, to enable cell-type specific gene expression, remains obscure. Using single-gene super-resolution imaging and acute targeted perturbations, we define physical parameters of enhancer-promoter communication and elucidate processes that underlie target gene activation. Productive enhancer-promoter encounters happen at 3D distances δ200 nm - a spatial scale corresponding to unexpected enhancer-associated clusters of general transcription factor (GTF) components of the Pol II machinery. Distal activation is achieved by increasing transcriptional bursting frequency, a process facilitated by embedding a promoter into such GTF clusters and by accelerating an underlying multi-step cascade comprising early phases in the Pol II transcription cycle. These findings help clarify molecular/biochemical signals involved in long-range activation and their means of transmission from enhancer to promoter."

As a maternally inherited genome that encodes essential components of the electron transport chain, the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is ideally positioned to serve as a conduit for the transgenerational transmission of metabolic information. Here, we provide evidence that mtDNA ofC. eleganscontains the epigenetic mark N6-methyldeoxyadenosine (6mA). Bioinformatic analysis of SMRT sequencing data and methylated DNA IP sequencing data reveal thatC. elegansmtDNA is methylated at high levels in a site-specific manner. We further confirmed that mtDNA contains 6mA by leveraging highly specific anti-6mA antibodies. Additionally, we find that mtDNA methylation is dynamically regulated in response to antimycin, a mitochondrial stressor. Further, 6mA is increased innmad-1mutants and is accompanied by a significant decrease in mtDNA copy number. Our discovery paves the way for future studies to investigate the regulation and inheritance of mitochondrial epigenetics."

Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) recently released R10.4 flow cell, which claimed an improved read accuracy compared to R9.4.1 flow cell. To evaluate the benefits and defects of R10.4 flow cell for cancer cell profiling on MinION devices, we used the human non-small-cell lung-carcinoma cell line HCC78 to construct libraries for both single-cell whole-genome amplification (scWGA) and whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The R10.4 and R9.4.1 reads were benchmarked in terms of read accuracy, variant detection, modification calling, genome recovery rate and compared with the next generation sequencing (NGS) reads. The results highlighted that the R10.4 outperforms R9.4.1 reads, achieving a higher modal read accuracy of over 99.1%, superior variation detection, lower false-discovery rate (FDR) in methylation calling, and comparable genome recovery rate. To achieve high yields scWGA sequencing in the ONT platform as NGS, we recommended multiple displacement amplification with a modified T7 endonuclease Ⅰ cutting procedure as a promising method. In addition, we provided a possible solution to filter the likely false positive sites among the whole genome region with R10.4 by using scWGA sequencing result as a negative control. Our study is the first benchmark of whole genome single-cell sequencing using ONT R10.4 and R9.4.1 MinION flow cells by clarifying the capacity of genomic and epigenomic profiling within a single flow cell. A promising method for scWGA sequencing together with the methylation calling results can benefit researchers who work on cancer cell genomic and epigenomic profiling using third-generation sequencing.© 2023 The Authors."
"36972227","The effect of non-linear signal in classification problems using gene expression.","PLoS Comput Biol","Those building predictive models from transcriptomic data are faced with two conflicting perspectives. The first, based on the inherent high dimensionality of biological systems, supposes that complex non-linear models such as neural networks will better match complex biological systems. The second, imagining that complex systems will still be well predicted by simple dividing lines prefers linear models that are easier to interpret. We compare multi-layer neural networks and logistic regression across multiple prediction tasks on GTEx and Recount3 datasets and find evidence in favor of both possibilities. We verified the presence of non-linear signal when predicting tissue and metadata sex labels from expression data by removing the predictive linear signal with Limma, and showed the removal ablated the performance of linear methods but not non-linear ones. However, we also found that the presence of non-linear signal was not necessarily sufficient for neural networks to outperform logistic regression. Our results demonstrate that while multi-layer neural networks may be useful for making predictions from gene expression data, including a linear baseline model is critical because while biological systems are high-dimensional, effective dividing lines for predictive models may not be.Copyright: © 2023 Heil et al.

COMM domain containing 7 (COMMD7) is a recently-identified oncogene linked to poor prognosis in AML. COMMD7 regulates multiple signaling pathways, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. Here, we report that COMMD7 is highly expressed in the AML cell lines KG1a and U937 and that its inhibition by shRNA reduced proliferation, promoted apoptosis and facilitated cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in relation to depression of the NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, zinc finger protein 460 (ZNF460) is overexpressed in AML and regulates COMMD7. We found that knockdown of ZNF460 downregulated the expression of COMMD7 while the NF-κB pathway was also inhibited. In addition, we noticed that knockdown of ZNF460 reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis rate of AML cells and that the cell cycle was blocked in the G2/M phase. In brief, our results revealed a critical effect of the ZNF460-COMMD7-NF-κB axis for the proliferation of AML cells. Therefore, COMMD7 may be a possible therapeutic target for AML.© The author(s)."

Given the critical role of the brain in body weight regulation, we set out to determine whether genetic variants linked with body mass index (BMI) could be mapped to brain proteins. Using genetic colocalization, we mapped 25 loci from the largest BMI GWAS (n = 806,834) to brain protein concentrations obtained from publicly available datasets. We also performed a proteome-wide Mendelian randomization on 696 brain proteins followed by genetic colocalization and identified 35 additional brain proteins. Only a minority of these proteins (<30%) had a colocalization signal with cortex gene expression levels, highlighting the value of moving beyond gene expression levels and examining brain protein levels. In conclusion, we identified 60 unique proteins expressed in the brain that may be critical regulators of body weight in humans.© 2023 The Author(s)."

We investigated the effect of glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) exposure on gametes and four developmental stages of Clarius gariepinus (C. gariepinus) (African Catfish). Gametes from healthy gravid female and mature male C. gariepinuswere exposed to GBH in sublethal concentrations of 0.0 (G1, control), 0.02 (G2), 0.05 (G3), 0.1 (G4), 0.5 (G5), and 1.0 (G6) mg/L for 24 h at the standard conditions of temperature and water quality parameters. The surviving embryos were examined microscopically for malformation rate and edema occurrence post-GBH exposure. In a separate experiment; postfryer, fingerling, posfingerling and juvenile C. gariepinuswere exposed to G1, G2, G3, G4, G5 and G6 of GBH concentrations daily consecutively for 28 days. Fish growth performance, behavioural changes, haematology, oxidative stress, and histology were assessed. From our results, GBH showed altered morphology 24 h post-fertilization, decreased body weight, growth parameters, behavioural indices, and survival rate in the various developmental stages. Oxidative stress metabolite, malondialdehyde levels, increases in the postfryer > postfingerlin > fingerling > juvenile C. gariepinusfollowing GBH exposure. Leukopenia and thrombocytosis were observed in the postfingerlings and juvenile fish and decrease in the levels of reduced glutathione and activity of superoxide dismutase compared with the control. Histology showed gross necrosis of the fish gills, liver, brain, and cardiac myocytes in the exposed fish. Hence, our findings provide an insight into C. gariepinusdevelopmental toxicity due to GBH, although continuous measurement of glyphosate levels in the fish and fish environment is essential.©2023PublishedbyElsevierLtd."
"37031275","The hunger strikes back: an epigenetic memory for autophagy.","Cell Death Differ","Historical and demographical human cohorts of populations exposed to famine, as well as animal studies, revealed that exposure to food deprivation is associated to lasting health-related effects for the exposed individuals, as well as transgenerational effects in their offspring that affect their diseases' risk and overall longevity. Autophagy, an evolutionary conserved catabolic process, serves as cellular response to cope with nutrient starvation, allowing the mobilization of an internal source of stored nutrients and the production of energy. We review the evidence obtained in multiple model organisms that support the idea that autophagy induction, including through dietary regimes based on reduced food intake, is in fact associated to improved health span and extended lifespan. Thereafter, we expose autophagy-induced chromatin remodeling, such as DNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications that are known heritable epigenetic marks, as a plausible mechanism for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of hunger.© 2023.

"36972454","Tonic-signaling chimeric antigen receptors drive human regulatory T cell exhaustion.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Regulatory T cell (Treg) therapy is a promising approach to improve outcomes in transplantation and autoimmunity. In conventional T cell therapy, chronic stimulation can result in poor in vivo function, a phenomenon termed exhaustion. Whether or not Tregs are also susceptible to exhaustion, and if so, if this would limit their therapeutic effect, was unknown. To ""benchmark"" exhaustion in human Tregs, we used a method known to induce exhaustion in conventional T cells: expression of a tonic-signaling chimeric antigen receptor (TS-CAR). We found that TS-CAR-expressing Tregs rapidly acquired a phenotype that resembled exhaustion and had major changes in their transcriptome, metabolism, and epigenome. Similar to conventional T cells, TS-CAR Tregs upregulated expression of inhibitory receptors and transcription factors such as PD-1, TIM3, TOX and BLIMP1, and displayed a global increase in chromatin accessibility-enriched AP-1 family transcription factor binding sites. However, they also displayed Treg-specific changes such as high expression of 4-1BB, LAP, and GARP. DNA methylation analysis and comparison to a CD8+T cell-based multipotency index showed that Tregs naturally exist in a relatively differentiated state, with further TS-CAR-induced changes. Functionally, TS-CAR Tregs remained stable and suppressive in vitro but were nonfunctional in vivo, as tested in a model of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease. These data are the first comprehensive investigation of exhaustion in Tregs and reveal key similarities and differences with exhausted conventional T cells. The finding that human Tregs are susceptible to chronic stimulation-driven dysfunction has important implications for the design of CAR Treg adoptive immunotherapy strategies."
"37047616","Unraveling the Complex Interplay between Alpha-Synuclein and Epigenetic Modification.","Int J Mol Sci","Alpha-synuclein (αS) is a small, presynaptic neuronal protein encoded by theSNCAgene. Point mutations and gene multiplication ofSNCAcause rare familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Misfolded αS is cytotoxic and is a component of Lewy bodies, which are a pathological hallmark of PD. BecauseSNCAmultiplication is sufficient to cause full-blown PD, gene dosage likely has a strong impact on pathogenesis. In sporadic PD, increasedSNCAexpression resulting from a minor genetic background and various environmental factors may contribute to pathogenesis in a complementary manner. With respect to genetic background, several risk loci neighboring theSNCAgene have been identified, and epigenetic alterations, such as CpG methylation and regulatory histone marks, are considered important factors. These alterations synergistically upregulate αS expression and some post-translational modifications of αS facilitate its translocation to the nucleus. Nuclear αS interacts with DNA, histones, and their modifiers to alter epigenetic status; thereby, influencing the stability of neuronal function. Epigenetic changes do not affect the gene itself but can provide an appropriate transcriptional response for neuronal survival through DNA methylation or histone modifications. As a new approach, publicly available RNA sequencing datasets from human midbrain-like organoids may be used to compare transcriptional responses through epigenetic alterations. This informatic approach combined with the vast amount of transcriptomics data will lead to the discovery of novel pathways for the development of disease-modifying therapies for PD."
"37037942","Uropathogenic Escherichia coli infection-induced epithelial trained immunity impacts urinary tract disease outcome.","Nat Microbiol","Previous urinary tract infections (UTIs) can predispose one to future infections; however, the underlying mechanisms affecting recurrence are poorly understood. We previously found that UTIs in mice cause differential bladder epithelial (urothelial) remodelling, depending on disease outcome, that impacts susceptibility to recurrent UTI. Here we compared urothelial stem cell (USC) lines isolated from mice with a history of either resolved or chronic uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) infection, elucidating evidence of molecular imprinting that involved epigenetic changes, including differences in chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic marks in USCs from chronically infected mice enhanced caspase-1-mediated cell death upon UPEC infection, promoting bacterial clearance. Increased Ptgs2os2 expression also occurred, potentially contributing to sustained cyclooxygenase-2 expression, bladder inflammation and mucosal wounding-responses associated with severe recurrent cystitis. Thus, UPEC infection acts as an epi-mutagen reprogramming the urothelial epigenome, leading to urothelial-intrinsic remodelling and training of the innate response to subsequent infection.© 2023.

However, there is a limited understanding on the transfer mechanism of the increased reproductive sensitivity to subsequent generations. This study examines changes in DNA methylation at epigenetic mark N6-methyl-2'-deoxyadenosine (6mdA) after multigenerational exposure ofC. elegansto pristine and transformed-via-sulfidation Ag-NPs and AgNO3. Levels of 6mdA were measured as 6mdA/dA ratios prior toC. elegansexposure (F0) after two generations of exposure (F2) and two generations of rescue (F4) using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Although both AgNO3and Ag-NPs induced multigenerational reproductive toxicity, only AgNO3exposure caused a significant increase in global 6mdA levels after exposures (F2). However, after two generations of rescue (F4), the 6mdA levels in AgNO3treatment returned to F0levels, suggesting other epigenetic modifications may be also involved. No significant changes in global DNA methylation levels were observed after exposure to pristine and sulfidized sAg-NPs. This study demonstrates the involvement of an epigenetic mark in AgNO3reproductive toxicity and suggests that AgNO3and Ag-NPs may have different toxicity mechanisms."

Recent studies have proposed prognostic meningioma classification systems using DNA methylation profiling, copy number variants, DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, histology, or integrated models based on multiple combined features. Targeted gene expression profiling has generated robust biomarkers integrating multiple molecular features for other cancers, but is understudied for meningiomas. Methods Targeted gene expression profiling was performed on 173 meningiomas and an optimized gene expression biomarker (34 genes) and risk score (0 to 1) was developed to predict clinical outcomes. Clinical and analytical validation was performed on independent meningiomas from 12 institutions across 3 continents (N = 1856), including 103 meningiomas from a prospective clinical trial. Gene expression biomarker performance was compared to 9 other classification systems. Results The gene expression biomarker improved discrimination of postoperative meningioma outcomes compared to all other classification systems tested in the independent clinical validation cohort for local recurrence (5-year area under the curve [AUC] 0.81) and overall survival (5-year AUC 0.80). The increase in area under the curve compared to the current standard of care, World Health Organization 2021 grade, was 0.11 for local recurrence (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.17, P < 0.001). The gene expression biomarker identified meningiomas benefiting from postoperative radiotherapy (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.78, P = 0.0001) and re-classified up to 52.0% meningiomas compared to conventional clinical criteria, suggesting postoperative management could be refined for 29.8% of patients. Conclusions A targeted gene expression biomarker improves discrimination of meningioma outcomes compared to recent classification systems and predicts postoperative radiotherapy responses."
"37065762","Syndromic forms of congenital hyperinsulinism.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), also called hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HH), is a very heterogeneous condition and represents the most common cause of severe and persistent hypoglycemia in infancy and childhood. The majority of cases in which a genetic cause can be identified have monogenic defects affecting pancreatic β-cells and their glucose-sensing system that regulates insulin secretion. However, CHI/HH has also been observed in a variety of syndromic disorders. The major categories of syndromes that have been found to be associated with CHI include overgrowth syndromes (e.g. Beckwith-Wiedemann and Sotos syndromes), chromosomal and monogenic developmental syndromes with postnatal growth failure (e.g. Turner, Kabuki, and Costello syndromes), congenital disorders of glycosylation, and syndromic channelopathies (e.g. Timothy syndrome). This article reviews syndromic conditions that have been asserted by the literature to be associated with CHI. We assess the evidence of the association, as well as the prevalence of CHI, its possible pathophysiology and its natural course in the respective conditions. In many of the CHI-associated syndromic conditions, the mechanism of dysregulation of glucose-sensing and insulin secretion is not completely understood and not directly related to known CHI genes. Moreover, in most of those syndromes the association seems to be inconsistent and the metabolic disturbance is transient. However, since neonatal hypoglycemia is an early sign of possible compromise in the newborn, which requires immediate diagnostic efforts and intervention, this symptom may be the first to bring a patient to medical attention. As a consequence, HH in a newborn or infant with associated congenital anomalies or additional medical issues remains a differential diagnostic challenge and may require a broad genetic workup.Copyright © 2023 Zenker, Mohnike and Palm."

However, comprehensive analyses, which identify the prediction value of DTL in diagnosis, prognosis, immune infiltration and treatment, have rarely been reported so far.Combined with the data online databases, the gene expression, gene mutation, function enrichment and the correlations with the immunity status and clinical indexes of DTL were analyzed. Expression of DTL and the degree of immune cell infiltration were examined by immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) and analyzed by statistical analysis. Furthermore, the influences of DTL on the cell cycle, cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by live cell imaging, IF and flow cytometric (FC) analysis. Genomic stability assays were conducted by chromosome slide preparation.DTL was widely expressed in various cells and tissues, while it was overexpressed in tumor tissues except acute myeloid leukemia (LAML). Pan-cancer bioinformatics analysis showed that the expression of DTL was correlated with the prognosis, immunotherapy, and clinical indexes in various cancers. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) uncovered that DTL was enriched in oocyte meiosis, pyrimidine metabolism, the cell cycle, the G2M checkpoint, mTORC1 signaling and E2F targets. Furthermore, the overexpression of DTL, and its association with immune cell infiltration and clinical indexes in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) were verified in our study. It was also verified that overexpression of DTL could regulate the cell cycle, promote cell proliferation and cause genomic instability in cultured cells, which may be the reason why DTL plays a role in the occurrence, progression and treatment of cancer.Collectively, this study suggested that DTL is of clinical value in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of various cancers, and may be a potential biomarker in certain cancers.© 2023.

Limited prior research suggests sex-specific effects of prenatal OPE exposures on fetal development. We evaluated overall and sex-specific associations between prenatal OPE exposures and gestational age (GA) at birth and birthweight for gestational age (BW for GA) z-scores among the predominately low-income, Hispanic MADRES cohort.Nine OPE metabolite concentrations were measured in 421 maternal urine samples collected during a third trimester visit (GA = 31.5 ± 2.0 weeks). We examined associations between single urinary OPE metabolites and GA at birth and BW for GA z-scores using linear regression models and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and effects from OPE mixtures using Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR). We also assessed sex-specific differences in single metabolite analyses by evaluating statistical interactions and stratifying by sex.We did not find significant associations between individual OPE metabolites and birth outcomes in the full infant sample; however, we found that higher bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) was associated with earlier GA at birth among male infants (p = 0.04), and a nonlinear, inverted U-shape association between the sum of dibutyl phosphate and di-isobutyl phosphate (DNBP + DIBP) and GA at birth among female infants (p = 0.03). In mixtures analysis, higher OPE metabolite mixture exposures was associated with lower GA at birth, which was primarily driven by female infants. No associations were observed between OPE mixtures and BW for GA z-scores.Higher BDCIPP and DNBP + DIBP concentrations were associated with earlier GA at birth among male and female infants, respectively. Higher exposure to OPE mixtures was associated with earlier GA at birth, particularly among female infants. However, we saw no associations between prenatal OPEs and BW for GA.

Some kinds of gene expression and/or functional changes of neurons and synaptic connections may result in aberrant neural circuits, which has been recognized as one crucial pathological mechanism for the onset of many neurological diseases. Gradual advances in single-cell sequencing approaches with strong technological advantages, as exemplified by high throughput and increased resolution for live cells, have enabled it to assist us in understanding neuronal diversity across diverse brain regions and further transformed our knowledge of cellular building blocks of neural circuits through revealing numerous molecular signatures. Currently published transcriptomic studies have elucidated various neuronal subpopulations as well as their distribution across prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and dorsal root ganglion, etc. Better characterization of brain region-specific circuits may shed light on new pathological mechanisms involved and assist in selecting potential targets for the prevention and treatment of specific neurological disorders based on their established roles. Given diverse neuronal populations across different brain regions, we aim to give a brief sketch of current progress in understanding neuronal diversity and neural circuit complexity according to their locations. With the special focus on the application of single-cell sequencing, we thereby summarize relevant region-specific findings. Considering the importance of spatial context and connectivity in neural circuits, we also discuss a few published results obtained by spatial transcriptomics. Taken together, these single-cell sequencing data may lay a mechanistic basis for functional identification of brain circuit components, which links their molecular signatures to anatomical regions, connectivity, morphology, and physiology. Furthermore, the comprehensive characterization of neuron subtypes, their distributions, and connectivity patternsviasingle-cell sequencing is critical for understanding neural circuit properties and how they generate region-dependent interactions in different context.Copyright © 2023 Xing, Zan and Liu."
"37034735","A high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial atlas of cell types in the whole mouse brain.","bioRxiv","The mammalian brain is composed of millions to billions of cells that are organized into numerous cell types with specific spatial distribution patterns and structural and functional properties. An essential step towards understanding brain function is to obtain a parts list, i.e., a catalog of cell types, of the brain. Here, we report a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and spatial cell type atlas for the whole adult mouse brain. The cell type atlas was created based on the combination of two single-cell-level, whole-brain-scale datasets: a single- cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset of ∼7 million cells profiled, and a spatially resolved transcriptomic dataset of ∼4.3 million cells using MERFISH. The atlas is hierarchically organized into five nested levels of classification: 7 divisions, 32 classes, 306 subclasses, 1,045 supertypes and 5,200 clusters. We systematically analyzed the neuronal, non-neuronal, and immature neuronal cell types across the brain and identified a high degree of correspondence between transcriptomic identity and spatial specificity for each cell type. The results reveal unique features of cell type organization in different brain regions, in particular, a dichotomy between the dorsal and ventral parts of the brain: the dorsal part contains relatively fewer yet highly divergent neuronal types, whereas the ventral part contains more numerous neuronal types that are more closely related to each other. We also systematically characterized cell-type specific expression of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and transcription factors. The study uncovered extraordinary diversity and heterogeneity in neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression and co-expression patterns in different cell types across the brain, suggesting they mediate a myriad of modes of intercellular communications. Finally, we found that transcription factors are major determinants of cell type classification in the adult mouse brain and identified a combinatorial transcription factor code that defines cell types across all parts of the brain. The whole-mouse-brain transcriptomic and spatial cell type atlas establishes a benchmark reference atlas and a foundational resource for deep and integrative investigations of cell type and circuit function, development, and evolution of the mammalian brain."

Most such methods, however, measure only a limited panel of transcripts, which need to be selected in advance to inform on the cell types or processes being studied. A limitation of existing gene selection methods is that they rely on scRNA-seq data, ignoring platform effects between technologies. Here we describe gpsFISH, a computational method to perform gene selection through optimizing detection of known cell types. By modeling and adjusting for platform effects, gpsFISH outperforms other methods. Furthermore, gpsFISH can incorporate cell type hierarchies and custom gene preferences to accommodate diverse design requirements."
"37036577","Differences in the intraspecies copy number variation of Arabidopsis thaliana conserved and nonconserved miRNA genes.","Funct Integr Genomics","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression by RNA interference mechanism. In plants, miRNA genes (MIRs) which are grouped into conserved families, i.e. they are present among the different plant taxa, are involved in the regulation of many developmental and physiological processes. The roles of the nonconserved MIRs-which are MIRs restricted to one plant family, genus, or even species-are less recognized; however, many of them participate in the responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Both over- and underproduction of miRNAs may influence various biological processes. Consequently, maintaining intracellular miRNA homeostasis seems to be crucial for the organism. Deletions and duplications in the genomic sequence may alter gene dosage and/or activity. We evaluated the extent of copy number variations (CNVs) among Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) MIRs in over 1000 natural accessions, using population-based analysis of the short-read sequencing data. We showed that the conserved MIRs were unlikely to display CNVs and their deletions were extremely rare, whereas nonconserved MIRs presented moderate variation. Transposon-derived MIRs displayed exceptionally high diversity. Conversely, MIRs involved in the epigenetic control of transposons reactivated during development were mostly invariable. MIR overlap with the protein-coding genes also limited their variability. At the expression level, a higher rate of nonvariable, nonconserved miRNAs was detectable in Col-0 leaves, inflorescence, and siliques compared to nonconserved variable miRNAs, although the expression of both groups was much lower than that of the conserved MIRs. Our data indicate that CNV rate of Arabidopsis MIRs is related with their age, function, and genomic localization.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Population strongholds in Mongolia and China face growing challenges from climate change, habitat fragmentation, poaching, and other sources. These threats, combined withO. manul's zoo collection popularity and value in evolutionary biology, necessitate improvement of species genomic resources. We used standalone nanopore sequencing to assemble a 2.5 Gb, 61-contig nuclear assembly and 17097 bp mitogenome forO. manul. The primary nuclear assembly had 56× sequencing coverage, a contig N50 of 118 Mb, and a 94.7% BUSCO completeness score forCarnivora-specific genes. High genome collinearity withinFelidaepermitted alignment-based scaffolding onto the fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) reference genome. Manul contigs spanned all 19 felid chromosomes with an inferred total gap length of less than 400 kilobases. Modified basecalling and variant phasing produced an alternate pseudohaplotype assembly and allele-specific DNA methylation calls; 61 differentially methylated regions were identified between haplotypes. Nearest features included classical imprinted genes, non-coding RNAs, and putative novel imprinted loci. The assembled mitogenome successfully resolved existing discordance betweenFelinaenuclear and mtDNA phylogenies.

The study of large patient cohorts incorporating longitudinal plasma sampling and extended follow-up is required to determine the role of ctDNA as a phylogenetic biomarker of relapse in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here we developed ctDNA methods tracking a median of 200 mutations identified in resected NSCLC tissue across 1,069 plasma samples collected from 197 patients enrolled in the TRACERx study2. A lack of preoperative ctDNA detection distinguished biologically indolent lung adenocarcinoma with good clinical outcome. Postoperative plasma analyses were interpreted within the context of standard-of-care radiological surveillance and administration of cytotoxic adjuvant therapy. Landmark analyses of plasma samples collected within 120 days after surgery revealed ctDNA detection in 25% of patients, including 49% of all patients who experienced clinical relapse; 3 to 6 monthly ctDNA surveillance identified impending disease relapse in an additional 20% of landmark-negative patients. We developed a bioinformatic tool (ECLIPSE) for non-invasive tracking of subclonal architecture at low ctDNA levels. ECLIPSE identified patients with polyclonal metastatic dissemination, which was associated with a poor clinical outcome. By measuring subclone cancer cell fractions in preoperative plasma, we found that subclones seeding future metastases were significantly more expanded compared with non-metastatic subclones. Our findings will support (neo)adjuvant trial advances and provide insights into the process of metastatic dissemination using low-ctDNA-level liquid biopsy.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Despite relatively low sensitivity, plasma ctDNA sequencing has several advantages over tissue-based assays, including ease of sampling, rapid turnaround time, repeatability, and the ability to overcome spatial heterogeneity, which makes it ideal for investigating acquired resistance and monitoring tumor evolution and dynamics. With technological advancement and declining costs, the clinical application of plasma ctDNA is expanding, and numerous ongoing clinical trials are examining its potential to guide the management of advanced, localized, and even preclinical cancers of various tumor types. The ability of plasma ctDNA analysis to detect minimal residual disease following curative treatment in the absence of clinical disease is among its most promising attributes. Plasma ctDNA sequencing can also facilitate the conduct of clinical trials and drug development, particularly in immunotherapy. In order to incorporate plasma ctDNA sequencing for clinical decision-making, it is important to understand the preanalytical and analytical factors that may affect its sensitivity and reliability."
"37047814","A Basic Review on Estrogen Receptor Signaling Pathways in Breast Cancer.","Int J Mol Sci","Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the deadliest among women worldwide. Estrogen signaling is closely associated with hormone-dependent breast cancer (estrogen and progesterone receptor positive), which accounts for two-thirds of tumors. Hormone therapy using antiestrogens is the gold standard, but resistance to these treatments invariably occurs through various biological mechanisms, such as changes in estrogen receptor activity, mutations in the ESR1 gene, aberrant activation of the PI3K pathway or cell cycle dysregulations. All these factors have led to the development of new therapies, such as selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs), or combination therapies with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4/6 or PI3K inhibitors. Therefore, understanding the estrogen pathway is essential for the treatment and new drug development of hormone-dependent cancers. This mini-review summarizes current literature on the signalization, mechanisms of action and clinical implications of estrogen receptors in breast cancer."

"37045990","Differences in the post-stroke innate immune response between young and old.","Semin Immunopathol","Aging is associated to progressive changes impairing fundamental cellular and tissue functions, and the relationships amongst them through the vascular and immune systems. Aging factors are key to understanding the pathophysiology of stroke since they increase its risk and worsen its functional outcome. Most currently recognised hallmarks of aging are also involved in the cerebral responses to stroke. Notably, age-associated chronic low-grade inflammation is related to innate immune responses highlighted by induction of type-I interferon. The interferon program is prominent in microglia where it interrelates cell damage, danger signals, and phagocytosis with immunometabolic disturbances and inflammation. Microglia engulfment of damaged myelin and cell debris may overwhelm the cellular capacity for waste removal inducing intracellular lipid accumulation. Acute inflammation and interferon-stimulated gene expression are also typical features of acute stroke, where danger signal recognition by microglia trigger immunometabolic alterations underscored by lipid droplet biogenesis. Aging reduces the capacity to control these responses causing increased and persistent inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and impaired cellular waste disposal. In turn, chronic peripheral inflammation during aging induces immunosenescence further worsening stroke-induced immunodepression, thus increasing the risk of post-stroke infection. Aging also alters gut microbiota composition inducing dysbiosis. These changes are enhanced by age-related diseases, such as atherosclerosis and type-II diabetes, that further promote vascular aging, predispose to stroke, and exacerbate brain inflammation after stroke. Current advances in aging research suggest that some age-associated alterations may be reversed. Future work will unravel whether such evolving anti-aging research may enable designing strategies to improve stroke outcome in the elderly.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37034589","The Road Less Traveled: Uncovering the Convergence Toward Specific Pleiotropic Phenotypes in Aging.","bioRxiv","Aging is a complex process influenced by a wide range of environmental and molecular factors. Despite this complexity, individuals tend to age in highly similar ways, leading to the question of what drives this convergence. Recent research, including my own discoveries, suggests that the length of transcript molecules plays a crucial role in age-dependent changes to the transcriptome. Drawing inspiration from the road trip analogy of cellular transcription, I propose that a non-linear scaling law drives convergence towards specific pleiotropic phenotypes in biological aging. This scaling law is based on the notion that molecular changes observed during aging may reflect unspecific damage to cellular physiology. By validating this hypothesis, I can improve our understanding of biological aging and identify new candidate compounds for anti-aging interventions, as well as re-identify one known intervention.

In this study, we investigated the characteristic fragmentation patterns and explored the potential in tissue injury assessment of plasma cell-free DNA in COVID-19 patients. Through recruitment of 37 COVID-19 patients, 32 controls and analysis of 208 blood samples upon diagnosis and during treatment, we report gross abnormalities in cfDNA of COVID-19 patients, including elevated GC content, altered molecule size and end motif patterns. More importantly, such cfDNA fragmentation characteristics reflect patient-specific physiological changes during treatment. Further analysis on cfDNA tissue-of-origin tracing reveals frequent tissue injuries in COVID-19 patients, which is supported by clinical diagnoses. Hence, our work demonstrates and extends the translational merit of cfDNA fragmentation pattern as valuable analyte for effective treatment monitoring, as well as tissue injury assessment in COVID-19.© 2023.

In practice such approaches are too costly given that for each tested sample they require the resequencing of the reference panel to avoid technical bias. Within-sample testing methods utilize the observation that bins on one chromosome can be judged relative to the behavior of similarly behaving bins on other chromosomes, allowing the bins of a sample to be compared among themselves, avoiding technical bias.We present a comprehensive performance analysis of the within-sample testing method Wisecondor and its variants, using both experimental and simulated data. We introduced alterations to Wisecondor to explicitly address and exploit paired-end sequencing data. Wisecondor was found to yield the most stable results across different bin size scales while producing more robust calls by assigning higher Z-scores at all fetal fraction ranges.Our findings show that the most recent available version of Wisecondor performs best.Copyright: © 2023 Mokveld et al.

Attribution of personhood to any individual human being cannot be disconnected from the underlying biological events and processes of early human development. Nonetheless, the philosophical, sociological and legal components that are integral to the meaning of the term as commonly used cannot be deduced from biology alone. The challenge for biomedical scientists to inform discussion in this arena then rests on profiling the key biological events and processes that must be assessed when considering how one might objectively reason about the task of superimposing the concept of personhood onto the developing biological entity of a potential human being. Endogenous genetic and epigenetic events and exogenous developmentalmilieuprocesses diversify developmental trajectories of potential individual humans prior to livebirth. First, fertilization and epigenetic resetting of each individual's organismic clock to time zero (t = 0) at the gastrulation/primitive streak stage (day 15 of embryogenesis), are two discrete unseen biological events that impact a potential individual human's attributes. Second, those two discrete unseen biological events are immersed in the continuous developmental process spanning pre-fertilization and gestation, further driving individualization of diverse attributes of each future human before the third discrete and blatant biological event of parturition and livebirth. Exposures of the gravida to multiple diverse exogenous exposures means that morphogenesis and physiogenesis of every embryo/fetus has individualized attributes for its future human lifespan. Our proposed framework based on the biological discrete events and processes spanning pre-fertilization and prenatal development, implies that personhood should be incrementally attributed, and societal protections should be graduated and applied progressively across the pre-birth timespan.© 2023 Hughes and Hughes."

Pathological changes in astrocytes play a pivotal role in MDD. While hypidone hydrochloride (YL-0919), an independently developed antidepressant, has shown rapid action with low side effects, its underlying astrocyte-specific mechanisms remain unclear.Methods:In our study, mice were exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS) for 14 days or concomitantly administered YL-0919/fluoxetine. Behavioral tests were applied to evaluate the depression model; immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining were used to explore morphological changes in astrocytes; astrocyte-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis was performed to capture transcriptome wide alterations; and ATP and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) levels of primary astrocytes were measured, followed by YL-0919 incubation to appraise the alteration of energy metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).Results:YL-0919 alleviated CRS-induced depressive-like behaviors faster than fluoxetine and attenuated the number and morphologic deficits in the astrocytes of depressed mice. The changes of gene expression profile in astrocytes after CRS were partially reversed by YL-0919.

"37048051","STAT3 Drives GFAP Accumulation and Astrocyte Pathology in a Mouse Model of Alexander Disease.","Cells","Alexander disease (AxD) is caused by mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament expressed by astrocytes in the central nervous system. AxD-associated mutations cause GFAP aggregation and astrogliosis, and GFAP is elevated with the astrocyte stress response, exacerbating mutant protein toxicity. Studies in mouse models suggest disease severity is tied toGfapexpression levels, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 regulatesGfapduring astrocyte development and in response to injury and is activated in astrocytes in rodent models of AxD. In this report, we show that STAT3 is also activated in the human disease. To determine whether STAT3 contributes to GFAP elevation, we used a combination of genetic approaches to knockout or reduce STAT3 activation in AxD mouse models. Conditional knockout ofStat3in cells expressingGfapreducedGfaptransactivation and prevented protein accumulation. Astrocyte-specificStat3knockout in adult mice with existing pathology reversed GFAP accumulation and aggregation. Preventing STAT3 activation reduced markers of reactive astrocytes, stress-related transcripts, and microglial activation, regardless of disease stage or genetic knockout approach. These results suggest that pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 could potentially reduce GFAP toxicity and provide a therapeutic benefit in patients with AxD."
"37047031","Deletion of Transglutaminase 2 from Mouse Astrocytes Significantly Improves Their Ability to Promote Neurite Outgrowth on an Inhibitory Matrix.","Int J Mol Sci","Astrocytes are the primary support cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that help maintain the energetic requirements and homeostatic environment of neurons. CNS injury causes astrocytes to take on reactive phenotypes with an altered overall function that can range from supportive to harmful for recovering neurons. The characterization of reactive astrocyte populations is a rapidly developing field, and the underlying factors and signaling pathways governing which type of reactive phenotype that astrocytes take on are poorly understood. Our previous studies suggest that transglutaminase 2 (TG2) has an important role in determining the astrocytic response to injury. Selectively deleting TG2 from astrocytes improves functional outcomes after CNS injury and causes widespread changes in gene regulation, which is associated with its nuclear localization. To begin to understand how TG2 impacts astrocytic function, we used a neuron-astrocyte co-culture paradigm to compare the effects of TG2-/- and wild-type (WT) mouse astrocytes on neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Neurons were grown on a control substrate or an injury-simulating matrix comprised of inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). Compared to WT astrocytes, TG2-/- astrocytes supported neurite outgrowth to a significantly greater extent only on the CSPG matrix, while synapse formation assays showed mixed results depending on the pre- and post-synaptic markers analyzed. We hypothesize that TG2 regulates the supportive functions of astrocytes in injury conditions by modulating gene expression through interactions with transcription factors and transcription complexes. Based on the results of a previous yeast two-hybrid screen for TG2 interactors, we further investigated the interaction of TG2 with Zbtb7a, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor. Co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization analyses confirmed the interaction of TG2 and Zbtb7a in the nucleus of astrocytes. Overexpression or knockdown of Zbtb7a levels in WT and TG2-/- astrocytes revealed that Zbtb7a robustly influenced astrocytic morphology and the ability of astrocytes to support neuronal outgrowth, which was significantly modulated by the presence of TG2. These findings support our hypothesis that astrocytic TG2 acts as a transcriptional regulator to influence astrocytic function, with greater influence under injury conditions that increase its expression, and Zbtb7a likely contributes to the overall effects observed with astrocytic TG2 deletion."
"37046137","Exploring the Causal Relationship Between Telomere Biology and Alzheimer's Disease.","Mol Neurobiol","Telomeres, also known as the ""protective caps"" of our chromosomes, shorten with each cell cycle due to the end replication problem. This process, termed telomere attrition, is associated with many age-related disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the numerous studies conducted in this field, the role of telomere attrition in the onset of the disease remains unclear. To investigate the causal relationship between short telomeres and AD, this review aims to highlight the primary factors that regulate telomere length and maintain its integrity, with an additional outlook on the role of oxidative stress, which is commonly associated with aging and molecular damage. Although some findings thus far might be contradictory, telomere attrition likely plays a crucial role in the progression of AD due to its close association with oxidative stress. The currently available treatments for AD are only symptomatic without affecting the progression of the disease. The components of telomere biology discussed in this paper have previously been studied as an alternative treatment option for several diseases and have exhibited promising in vitro and in vivo results. Hence, this should provide a basis for future research to develop a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. (Created with BioRender.com).© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here, we used the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) and its pathogenBacillus thuringiensis(Bt) as a model for exploring an adaptive evolutionary mechanism. We found that insect host adaptation to the primary Bt virulence factors was tightly associated with a short interspersed nuclear element (SINE - named SE2) insertion into the promoter of the transcriptionally activatedMAP4K4gene. This retrotransposon insertion coopts and potentiates the effect of the transcription factor forkhead box O (FOXO) in inducing a hormone-modulated Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, leading to an enhancement of a host defense mechanism against the pathogen. This work demonstrates that reconstructing acis-transinteraction can escalate a host response mechanism into a more stringent resistance phenotype to resist pathogen infection, providing a new insight into the coevolutionary mechanism of host organisms and their microbial pathogens."
