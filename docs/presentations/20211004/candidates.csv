no,epigenetics,34551299,DNA methylation is required to maintain both DNA replication timing precision and 3D genome organization integrity.,Cell Rep,"DNA replication timing and three-dimensional (3D) genome organization are associated with distinct epigenome patterns across large domains. However, whether alterations in the epigenome, in particular cancer-related DNA hypomethylation, affects higher-order levels of genome architecture is still unclear. Here, using Repli-Seq, single-cell Repli-Seq, and Hi-C, we show that genome-wide methylation loss is associated with both concordant loss of replication timing precision and deregulation of 3D genome organization. Notably, we find distinct disruption in 3D genome compartmentalization, striking gains in cell-to-cell replication timing heterogeneity and loss of allelic replication timing in cancer hypomethylation models, potentially through the gene deregulation of DNA replication and genome organization pathways. Finally, we identify ectopic H3K4me3-H3K9me3 domains from across large hypomethylated domains, where late replication is maintained, which we purport serves to protect against catastrophic genome reorganization and aberrant gene transcription. Our results highlight a potential role for the methylome in the maintenance of 3D genome regulation.Copyright Â© 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
no,epigenetics,34526716,UTX condensation underlies its tumour-suppressive activity,Nature,"UTX (also known as KDM6A) encodes a histone H3K27 demethylase and is an important tumour suppressor that is frequently mutated in human cancers1. However, as the demethylase activity of UTX is often dispensable for mediating tumour suppression and developmental regulation2-8, the underlying molecular activity of UTX remains unknown. Here we show that phase separation of UTX underlies its chromatin-regulatory activity in tumour suppression. A core intrinsically disordered region (cIDR) of UTX forms phase-separated liquid condensates, and cIDR loss caused by the most frequent cancer mutation of UTX is mainly responsible for abolishing tumour suppression. Deletion, mutagenesis and replacement assays of the intrinsically disordered region demonstrate a critical role of UTX condensation in tumour suppression and embryonic stem cell differentiation. As shown by reconstitution in vitro and engineered systems in cells, UTX recruits the histone methyltransferase MLL4 (also known as KMT2D) to the same condensates and enriches the H3K4 methylation activity of MLL4. Moreover, UTX regulates genome-wide histone modifications and high-order chromatin interactions in a condensation-dependent manner. We also found that UTY, the Y chromosome homologue of UTX with weaker tumour-suppressive activity, forms condensates with reduced molecular dynamics. These studies demonstrate a crucial biological function of liquid condensates with proper material states in enabling the tumour-suppressive activity of a chromatin regulator."

Correlation between DNA methylation at the significantly associated CpGs and expression of nearby genes in theÂ placenta was tested.Results:Depression and stress were associated with methylation of 16 CpGs and twoÂ CpGs, respectively, at a 5% false discovery rate. Methylation levels at two of the CpGs associated with depression were significantly associated with expression ofADAM23andCTDP1, genes implicated in neurodevelopment and neuropsychiatric diseases.Conclusion:Placental epigenetic changes linked to antenatal depression suggest potential fetal brain programming.

yes,EWAS,34583751,Investigating the DNA methylation profile of e-cigarette use.,Clin Epigenetics,"Little evidence exists on the health effects of e-cigarette use. DNA methylation may serve as a biomarker for exposure and could be predictive of future health risk. We aimed to investigate the DNA methylation profile of e-cigarette use.Among 117 smokers, 117 non-smokers and 116 non-smoking vapers, we evaluated associations between e-cigarette use and epigenome-wide methylation from saliva. DNA methylation at 7 cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs) was associated with e-cigarette use at pâ€‰<â€‰1â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5and none at pâ€‰<â€‰5.91â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8. 13 CpGs were associated with smoking at pâ€‰<â€‰1â€‰Ã—â€‰10-5and one at pâ€‰<â€‰5.91â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8. CpGs associated with e-cigarette use were largely distinct from those associated with smoking. There was strong enrichment of known smoking-related CpGs in the smokers but not the vapers. We also tested associations between e-cigarette use and methylation scores known to predict smoking and biological ageing. Methylation scores for smoking and biological ageing were similar between vapers and non-smokers. Higher levels of all smoking scores and a biological ageing score (GrimAge) were observed in smokers. A methylation score for e-cigarette use showed poor prediction internally (AUC 0.55, 0.41-0.69) and externally (AUC 0.57, 0.36-0.74) compared with a smoking score (AUCs 0.80) and was less able to discriminate lung squamous cell carcinoma from adjacent normal tissue (AUC 0.64, 0.52-0.76 versus AUC 0.73, 0.61-0.85).The DNA methylation profile for e-cigarette use is largely distinct from that of cigarette smoking, did not replicate in independent samples, and was unable to discriminate lung cancer from normal tissue. The extent to which methylation related to long-term e-cigarette use translates into chronic effects requires further investigation.Â© 2021. The Author(s)."
yes,EWAS,34569420,"Associations between infant sex and DNA methylation across umbilical cord blood, artery, and placenta samples.",Epigenetics,"DNA methylation (DNAm) is vulnerable to dysregulation by environmental exposures during epigenetic reprogramming that occurs in embryogenesis. Sexual dimorphism in environmentally induced DNAm dysregulation has been identified and therefore it is important to understand sex-specific DNAm patterns. DNAm at several autosomal sites has been consistently associated with sex in cord blood and placental fetal tissues. However, there is limited research comparing sex-specific DNAm across tissues, particularly differentially methylated regions (DMRs). This study leverages DNAm data measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip in cord blood (N = 179), placenta (N = 229), and umbilical artery samples (N = 229) in the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort to identify autosomal DMRs and differentially methylated positions (DMPs). A replication analyses was conducted in an independent cohort (GEO Accession GSE129841). We identified 183, 257, and 419 DMRs and 2119, 2281, and 3405 DMPs (pBonferroni< 0.05) in cord blood, placenta, and artery samples, respectively. Thirty-nine DMRs overlapped in all three tissues, overlapping with genes involved in spermatogenesis (NKAPL, PIWIL2, AURKC) and X-inactivation (LRIF1). In replication analysis, 85% of DMRs overlapped with those identified in PRISM. Overall DMRs and DMPs had higher methylation levels among females in cord blood and artery samples, but higher methylation levels among males in placenta samples. Further research is necessary to understand biological mechanisms that contribute to differences in sex-specific DNAm signatures across tissues, as well as to determine if sexual dimorphism in the epigenome impacts response to environmental stressors."
yes,EWAS,34561420,SLC25A24 gene methylation and gray matter volume in females with and without conduct disorder: an exploratory epigenetic neuroimaging study.,Transl Psychiatry,"Conduct disorder (CD), a psychiatric disorder characterized by a repetitive pattern of antisocial behaviors, results from a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. The clinical presentation of CD varies both according to the individual's sex and level of callous-unemotional (CU) traits, but it remains unclear how genetic and environmental factors interact at the molecular level to produce these differences. Emerging evidence in males implicates methylation of genes associated with socio-affective processes. Here, we combined an epigenome-wide association study with structural neuroimaging in 51 females with CD and 59 typically developing (TD) females to examine DNA methylation in relation to CD, CU traits, and gray matter volume (GMV). We demonstrate an inverse pattern of correlation between CU traits and methylation of a chromosome 1 region in CD females (positive) as compared to TD females (negative). The identified region spans exon 1 of the SLC25A24 gene, central to energy metabolism due to its role in mitochondrial function. Increased SLC25A24 methylation was also related to lower GMV in multiple brain regions in the overall cohort. These included the superior frontal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus, secondary visual cortex and ventral posterior cingulate cortex, which are regions that have previously been implicated in CD and CU traits. While our findings are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger samples, they provide novel evidence that CU traits in females are associated with methylation levels in a fundamentally different way in CD and TD, which in turn may relate to observable variations in GMV across the brain.Â© 2021.

The objective of this study is to use DNA methylation analysis to detect DNA methylation loci linked to obesity phenotypes, i.e. waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI.Two-hundred and ten healthy European participants from the STANISLAS Family Study (SFS), comprising 73 nuclear families, were comprehensively assessed for methylation status using Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. An epigenome-wide association study was performed, which identified a CpG site cg16170243 located on chromosome 18q21.2 significantly associated with waist circumference, after adjusting for BMI (Î²â€‰=â€‰2.32, SEâ€‰=â€‰0.41, Padjâ€‰=â€‰0.048). Cg16170243 corresponds to a 50Â bp-length human methylation oligoprobe located within the AC090241.2 gene that overlaps ST8SIA5 gene. No significant association was observed with waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (Padjâ€‰>â€‰0.05).A novel association between DNA methylation and WC was identified, which is demonstrating that epigenetic mechanisms may have a significant impact on waist circumference ratio in healthy individuals. Further studies are warranted to address the causal effects of this association.Â© 2021. The Author(s)."

This sex bias first emerges during puberty and then persists across the reproductive years. As the cause remains largely elusive, we performed a methylation-wide association study (MWAS) to generate novel hypotheses.We assayed nearly all 28 million possible methylation sites in blood in 595 blood samples from 487 participants aged 9-17. MWASs were performed to identify methylation sites associated with increasing sex differences in depression symptoms as a function of pubertal stage. Epigenetic deconvolution was applied to perform analyses on a cell-type specific level.In monocytes, a substantial number of significant associations were detected after controlling the FDR at 0.05. These results could not be explained by plasma testosterone/estradiol or current/lifetime trauma. Our top results in monocytes were significantly enriched (ratio of 2.48) for genes in the top of a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of depression and neurodevelopment-related Gene Ontology (GO) terms that remained significant after correcting for multiple testing. Focusing on our most robust findings (70 genes overlapping with the GWAS meta-analysis and the significant GO terms), we find genes coding for members of each of the major classes of axon guidance molecules (netrins, slits, semaphorins, ephrins, and cell adhesion molecules). Many of these genes were previously implicated in rodent studies of brain development and depression-like phenotypes, as well as human methylation, gene expression and GWAS studies.Our study suggests that the emergence of sex differences in depression may be related to the differential rewiring of brain circuits between boys and girls during puberty.Â© 2021 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health."
yes,EWAS,34539625,Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Profile in Whole Blood of Patients With Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria.,Front Immunol,"Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a common autoimmune skin disease. Little is known about the role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of CSU. This study aimed to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation profile in whole blood of patients with CSU.Genome-wide DNA methylation levels in whole blood samples of 95 Chinese Han ethnicity adult CSU patients and 95 ethnicity-, age- and sex-matched healthy controls were analyzed using Illumina 850K methylation chip. The differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were screened out and then functionally annotated by the gene ontology and the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes databases.A total of 439 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) (p< 0.01 and |Î”Î²| â‰¥ 0.06) were identified with 380 hypomethylated and 59 hypermethylated. The average global DNA methylation levels of the 439 DMPs in the CSU patients were significantly lower than those in the healthy controls (p< 0.001). The distribution of the 439 DMPs was wide on chromosome 1 to 22 and chromosome X. Chromosome 6 embodied the largest number of DMPs (n= 51) and their annotated genes were predominantly related to autoimmunity. The 304 annotated DMGs were mainly enriched in autoimmune disease- and immune-related pathways. A total of 41 DMPs annotated to 28 DMGs were identified whenp< 0.01 and |Î”Î²| â‰¥ 0.1. Of the 28 DMGs, HLA-DPB2, HLA-DRB1, PPP2R5C, and LTF were associated with autoimmunity. CSU cases with elevated total IgE, positive anti-thyroid peroxidase IgG autoantibodies, positive anti-thyroglobulin IgG autoantibodies, angioedema, UASday > 4, or recurrent CSU showed phenotype-specific DMPs as compared with cases with normal total IgE, negative anti-thyroid peroxidase IgG autoantibodies, negative anti-thyroglobulin IgG autoantibodies, no angioedema, UASday â‰¤ 4, or non-recurrent CSU respectively.This study shows a distinct genome-wide DNA methylation profile in Chinese Han ethnicity adult CSU patients and indicates a role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of CSU. The predominant enrichment of the CSU-associated DMGs in immunological pathways provides supportive evidence for the immunopathogenesis of CSU. Future research on the CSU-associated DMPs and DMGs will help discover potential therapeutic targets for CSU.Copyright Â© 2021 Qi, Zhang, Yang, Tang and Xiao."
yes,EWAS,34529553,Prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals is associated with altered DNA methylation in cord blood.,Epigenetics,"Prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals can interfere with development, and has been associated with social-cognitive functioning and adverse health outcomes later in life. Exposure-associated changes of DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns have been suggested as a possible mediator of this relationship. This study investigated whether prenatal low-dose exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) is associated with altered DNAm patterns across the genome in a Western urban-industrial population. In 142 mother-infant pairs from the Duisburg Birth Cohort Study, PCBs and PCDD/Fs levels were quantified from maternal blood during late pregnancy and associated with DNAm levels in cord blood using the Illumina EPIC beadchip. The epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) identified 32 significantly differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and eight differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with six congeners of PCB and PCDD in females or males (FDRs < 0.05). DMPs and DMRs mapped to genes involved in neurodevelopment, gene regulation, and immune functioning. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) showed 31 co-methylated modules (FDRs < 0.05) associated with one congener of PCDF levels in females. Results of both analytical strategies indicate that prenatal exposure to PCBs and PCDD/Fs is associated with altered DNAm of genes involved in neurodevelopment, gene expression and immune functioning. DNAm and gene expression levels of several of these genes were previously associated with EDC exposure in rodent models. Follow-up studies will clarify whether these epigenetic changes might contribute to the origin for adverse mental and health outcomes."
yes,EWAS,34584077,Identical twins carry a persistent epigenetic signature of early genome programming.,Nat Commun,"Monozygotic (MZ) twins and higher-order multiples arise when a zygote splits during pre-implantation stages of development. The mechanisms underpinning this event have remained a mystery. Because MZ twinning rarely runs in families, the leading hypothesis is that it occurs at random. Here, we show that MZ twinning is strongly associated with a stable DNA methylation signature in adult somatic tissues. This signature spans regions near telomeres and centromeres, Polycomb-repressed regions and heterochromatin, genes involved in cell-adhesion, WNT signaling, cell fate, and putative human metastable epialleles. Our study also demonstrates a never-anticipated corollary: because identical twins keep a lifelong molecular signature, we can retrospectively diagnose if a person was conceived as monozygotic twin.Â© 2021.

Can psychotherapy reorganise these memories through changes in DNA methylation signatures? Using a randomised controlled parallel group design, we examined methylome-wide changes in saliva samples of 84 female former child soldiers from Eastern DR Congo before and six months after Narrative Exposure Therapy. Treatment predicted differentially methylated positions (DMPs) related to ALCAM, RIPOR2, AFAP1 and MOCOS. In addition, treatment associations overlapped at gene level with baseline clinical and social outcomes. Treatment related DMPs are involved in memory formation-the key agent in trauma focused treatments-and enriched for molecular pathways commonly affected by trauma related disorders. Results were partially replicated in an independent sample of 53 female former child soldiers from Northern Uganda.

no,methods,34548083,Revisiting genetic artifacts on DNA methylation microarrays exposes novel biological implications.,Genome Biol,"Illumina DNA methylation microarrays enable epigenome-wide analysis vastly used for the discovery of novel DNA methylation variation in health and disease. However, the microarrays' probe design cannot fully consider the vast human genetic diversity, leading to genetic artifacts. Distinguishing genuine from artifactual genetic influence is of particular relevance in the study of DNA methylation heritability and methylation quantitative trait loci. But despite its importance, current strategies to account for genetic artifacts are lagging due to a limited mechanistic understanding on how such artifacts operate.To address this, we develop and benchmark UMtools, an R-package containing novel methods for the quantification and qualification of genetic artifacts based on fluorescence intensity signals. With our approach, we model and validate known SNPs/indels on a genetically controlled dataset of monozygotic twins, and we estimate minor allele frequency from DNA methylation data and empirically detect variants not included in dbSNP. Moreover, we identify examples where genetic artifacts interact with each other or with imprinting, X-inactivation, or tissue-specific regulation. Finally, we propose a novel strategy based on co-methylation that can discern between genetic artifacts and genuine genomic influence.We provide an atlas to navigate through the huge diversity of genetic artifacts encountered on DNA methylation microarrays. Overall, our study sets the ground for a paradigm shift in the study of the genetic component of epigenetic variation in DNA methylation microarrays.Â© 2021. The Author(s)."

With the increasing amount and complexity of data, scalability and reproducibility have become essential not just for experiments, but also for computational analysis. However, transforming data into information involves running a large number of tools, optimizing parameters, and integrating dynamically changing reference data. Workflow managers were developed in response to such challenges. They simplify pipeline development, optimize resource usage, handle software installation and versions, and run on different compute platforms, enabling workflow portability and sharing. In this Perspective, we highlight key features of workflow managers, compare commonly used approaches for bioinformatics workflows, and provide a guide for computational and noncomputational users. We outline community-curated pipeline initiatives that enable novice and experienced users to perform complex, best-practice analyses without having to manually assemble workflows. In sum, we illustrate how workflow managers contribute to making computational analysis in biomedical research shareable, scalable, and reproducible.Â© 2021. Springer Nature America, Inc."
no,methods,34527193,Application of long-read sequencing to the detection of structural variants in human cancer genomes.,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,"In recent years, the so-called long-read sequencing technology has had a substantial impact on various aspects of genome sciences. Here, we introduce recent studies of cancerous structural variants (SVs) using long-read sequencing technologies, namely Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencers, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencers, and linked-read methods. By taking advantage of long-read lengths, these technologies have enabled the precise detection of SVs, including long insertions by transposable elements, such as LINE-1. In addition to SV detection, the epigenome status (including DNA methylation and haplotype information) surrounding SV loci has also been unveiled by long-read sequencing technologies, to identify the effects of SVs. Among the various research fields in which long-read sequencing has been applied, cancer genomics has shown the most remarkable advances. In fact, many studies are beginning to shed light on the detection of SVs and the elucidation of their complex structures in various types of cancer. In the particular case of cancers, we summarize the technical limitations of the application of this technology to the analysis of clinical samples. We will introduce recent achievements from this viewpoint. However, a similar approach will be started for other applications in the near future. Therefore, by complementing the current short-read sequencing analysis, long-read sequencing should reveal the complex nature of human genomes in their healthy and disease states, which will open a new opportunity for a better understanding of disease development and for a novel strategy for drug development.Â© 2021 The Authors."

We utilized a systems biology multi-""omics"" approach to identify predictive biomarkers for ARDS mortality. Integrating analyses were designed to differentiate ARDS non-survivors and survivors (568 subjects, 27% overall 28-day mortality) using datasets derived from multiple 'omics' studies in a multi-institution ARDS cohort (54% European descent, 40% African descent). 'Omics' data was available for each subject and included genome-wide association studies (GWAS, nâ€‰=â€‰297), RNA sequencing (nâ€‰=â€‰93), DNA methylation data (nâ€‰=â€‰61), and selective proteomic network analysis (nâ€‰=â€‰240).

Pathway analysis identified TP53-, HDAC1-, TGF-Î²-, and IL-6-signaling pathways to be associated with ARDS mortality. Predictive biomarker discovery identified transcription levels of the 9-gene set (AUC-0.83) and Day 7 angiopoietin 2 protein levels as potential candidate predictors of ARDS mortality (AUC-0.70).

Moreover, early life stress has been associated with substance use initiation at a younger age, a risk factor for developing substance use disorders. However, no studies to date have investigated whether NR3C1 methylation can predict substance use in young individuals. This study included adolescents 13-14 years of age that reported no history of substance use at baseline, (Nâ€‰=â€‰1041; malesâ€‰=â€‰46%). Participants contributed saliva DNA samples and were followed in middle adolescence as part of KUPOL, a prospective cohort study of 7th-grade students in Sweden. Outcome variables were self-reports of (i) recent use, (ii) lifetime use, and (iii) use duration of (a) alcohol, (b) tobacco products, (c) cannabis, or (d) any substance. Outcomes were measured annually for three consecutive years. The predictor variable was DNA methylation at the exon 1â€‰F locus of NR3C1. Risk and rate ratios were calculated as measures of association, with or without adjustment for internalizing symptoms and parental psychiatric disorders. For a subset of individuals (Nâ€‰=â€‰320), there were also morning and afternoon salivary cortisol measurements available that were analyzed in relation to NR3C1 methylation levels. Baseline NR3C1 hypermethylation associated with future self-reports of recent use and use duration of any substance, before and after adjustment for potential confounders. The overall estimates were attenuated when considering lifetime use. Sex-stratified analyses revealed the strongest association for cigarette use in males. Cortisol analyses revealed associations between NR3C1 methylation and morning cortisol levels. Findings from this study suggest that saliva NR3C1 hypermethylation can predict substance use in middle adolescence. Additional longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm these findings.Â© 2021.

no,methods,34019650,Long-read whole-genome methylation patterning using enzymatic base conversion and nanopore sequencing,Nucleic Acids Res,"Long-read whole-genome sequencing analysis of DNA methylation would provide useful information on the chromosomal context of gene expression regulation. Here we describe the development of a method that improves the read length generated by using the bisulfite-sequencing-based approach. In this method, we combined recently developed enzymatic base conversion, where an unmethylated cytosine (C) should be converted to thymine (T), with nanopore sequencing. After methylation-sensitive base conversion, the sequencing library was constructed using long-range polymerase chain reaction. This type of analysis is possible using a minimum of 1 ng genomic DNA, and an N50 read length of 3.4–7.6 kb is achieved. To analyze the produced data, which contained a substantial number of base mismatches due to sequence conversion and an inaccurate base read of the nanopore sequencing, a new analytical pipeline was constructed. To demonstrate the performance of long-read methylation sequencing, breast cancer cell lines and clinical specimens were subjected to analysis, which revealed the chromosomal methylation context of key cancer-related genes, allele-specific methylated genes, and repetitive or deletion regions. This method should convert the intractable specimens for which the amount of available genomic DNA is limited to the tractable targets."
