"37309088","Whole-genome methylation analysis of aging human tissues identifies age-related changes in developmental and neurological pathways.","Aging Cell","Age-associated changes in the DNA methylation state can be used to assess the pace of aging. However, it is not understood what mechanisms drive these changes and whether these changes affect the development of aging phenotypes and the aging process in general. This study was aimed at gaining a more comprehensive understanding of aging-related methylation changes across the whole genome, and relating these changes to biological functions. It has been shown that skeletal muscle and blood monocytes undergo typical changes with aging. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we sought to characterize the genome-wide changes in methylation of DNA derived from both skeletal muscle and blood monocytes, and link these changes to specific genes and pathways through enrichment analysis. We found that methylation changes occur with aging at the locations enriched for developmental and neuronal pathways regulated in these two peripheral tissues. These results contribute to our understanding of changes in epigenome in human aging.Published 2023. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

"37308824","Transcriptome-wide 5-methylcytosine modification profiling of long non-coding RNAs in A549 cells infected with H1N1 influenza A virus.","BMC Genomics","In recent years, accumulating evidences have revealed that influenza A virus (IAV) infections induce significant differential expression of host long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), some of which play important roles in the regulation of virus-host interactions and determining the virus pathogenesis. However, whether these lncRNAs bear post-translational modifications and how their differential expression is regulated remain largely unknown. In this study, the transcriptome-wide 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification of lncRNAs in A549 cells infected with an H1N1 influenza A virus was analyzed and compared with uninfected cells by Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq).Our data identified 1317 upregulated m5C peaks and 1667 downregulated peaks in the H1N1 infected group. Gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses showed that the differentially modified lncRNAs were associated with protein modification, organelle localization, nuclear export and other biological processes. Furthermore, conjoint analysis of the differentially modified (DM) and differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs identified 143 'hyper-up', 81 'hypo-up', 6 'hypo-down' and 4 'hyper-down' lncRNAs. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that these DM and DE lncRNAs were predominantly associated with pathogen recognition and disease pathogenesis pathways, indicating that m5C modifications could play an important role in the regulation of host response to IAV replication by modulating the expression and/or stability of lncRNAs.This study presented the first m5C modification profile of lncRNAs in A549 cells infected with IAV and demonstrated a significant alteration of m5C modifications on host lncRNAs upon IAV infection. These data could give a reference to future researches on the roles of m5C methylation in virus infection.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, the positive predictive value for HLA-B∗13:01 is only 7.8%. To explore the potential coexisting factors involved in the occurrence of DHS, we carried out a GWAS and a genome-wide DNA methylation profile analysis comparing patients with DHS with dapsone-tolerant control subjects (all carrying HLA-B∗13:01). No non-HLA SNPs associated with DHS were identified at the genome-wide level. However, the pathway of antigen processing and presentation was enriched in patients with DHS, and the gene TAP2 was identified. Expression of TAP2 and its molecular chaperone, TAP1, were validated by quantitative PCR, and in vitro functional experiments were performed. The results showed that patients with DHS have higher mRNA levels of TAP1 and TAP2 and an enhanced capacity for antigen-presenting cells activating dapsone-specific T cells compared with dapsone-tolerant controls. Activation of dapsone-specific T cells was inhibited when TAP function of antigen-presenting cells was impaired. This study shows that epigenetic regulation of TAP1 and TAP2 affects the function of antigen-presenting cells and is a critical factor that mediates the development of DHS.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Although encompassing any condition that affects the circulatory system, including thrombotic blockage, stenosis, aneurysms, blood clots and arteriosclerosis (general hardening of the arteries), the most prevalent underlying hallmark of CVD is atherosclerosis; the plaque-associated arterial thickening. Further, distinct CVD conditions have overlapping dysregulated molecular and cellular characteristics which underlie their development and progression, suggesting some common aetiology. The identification of heritable genetic mutations associated with the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease (AVD), in particular resulting from Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) studies has significantly improved the ability to identify individuals at risk. However, it is increasingly recognised that environmentally-acquired, epigenetic changes are key factors associated with atherosclerosis development. Increasing evidence suggests that these epigenetic changes, most notably DNA methylation and the misexpression of non-coding, microRNAs (miRNAs) are potentially both predictive and causal in AVD development. This, together with their reversible nature, makes them both useful biomarkers for disease and attractive therapeutic targets potentially to reverse AVD progression. We consider here the association of aberrant DNA methylation and dysregulated miRNA expression with the aetiology and progression of atherosclerosis, and the potential development of novel cell-based strategies to target these epigenetic changes therapeutically.© 2023 Sum and Brewer."
"37304952","Genome-wide detection of m6A-associated SNPs in atrial fibrillation pathogenesis.","Front Cardiovasc Med","N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) modification is of great importance in both the pathological conditions and physiological process. The m6A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with cardiovascular diseases including coronary artery disease, heart failure. However, it is unclear whether m6A-SNPs are involved in atrial fibrillation (AF). Here, we aimed to explore the relationship between m6A-SNPs and AF.The relationship between m6A-SNPs and AF was evaluated by analyzing the AF genome-wide association study (GWAS) and m6A-SNPs annotated by the m6AVar database. Further, eQTL and gene differential expression analysis were performed to confirm the association between these identified m6A-SNPs and their target genes in the development of AF. Moreover, we did the GO enrichment analysis to figure out the potential functions of these m6A-SNPs affected genes.Totally, 105 m6A-SNPs were identified to be significantly associated with AF (FDR < 0.05), among which 7 showed significant eQTL signals on local genes in the atrial appendage. By using four public AF gene expression datasets, we identified genesSYNE2,USP36, andTHAP9containing SNPs rs35648226, rs900349, and rs1047564 were differentially expressed in AF population. Further, SNPs rs35648226 and rs1047564 are potentially associated with AF by affecting m6A modification and both of them might have an interaction with RNA-binding protein, PABPC1.In summary, we identified m6A-SNPs associated with AF.

"37300819","Sex-specific DNA methylation in saliva from the multi-ethnic Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study.","Epigenetics","The prevalence and severity of many diseases differs by sex, potentially due to sex-specific patterns in DNA methylation. Autosomal sex-specific differences in DNA methylation have been observed in cord blood and placental tissue but are not well studied in saliva or in diverse populations. We sought to characterize sex-specific DNA methylation on autosomal chromosomes in saliva samples from children in the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a multi-ethnic prospective birth cohort containing an oversampling of Black, Hispanic and low-income families. DNA methylation from saliva samples was analysed on 796 children (50.6% male) at both ages 9 and 15 with DNA methylation measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450k array. An epigenome-wide association analysis of the age 9 samples identified 8,430 sex-differentiated autosomal DNA methylation sites (P < 2.4 × 10-7), of which 76.2% had higher DNA methylation in female children. The strongest sex-difference was in the cg26921482 probe, in theAMDHD2gene, with 30.6% higher DNA methylation in female compared to male children (P < 1 × 10-300). Treating the age 15 samples as an internal replication set, we observed highly consistent results between the ages 9 and 15 measurements, indicating stable and replicable sex-differentiation. Further, we directly compared our results to previously published DNA methylation sex differences in both cord blood and saliva and again found strong consistency. Our findings support widespread and robust sex-differential DNA methylation across age, human tissues, and populations. These findings help inform our understanding of potential biological processes contributing to sex differences in human physiology and disease."

"37298088","DNA Methylation Biomarkers for Young Children with Idiopathic Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review.","Int J Mol Sci","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition, the underlying pathological mechanisms of which are not yet completely understood. Although several genetic and genomic alterations have been linked to ASD, for the majority of ASD patients, the cause remains unknown, and the condition likely arises due to complex interactions between low-risk genes and environmental factors. There is increasing evidence that epigenetic mechanisms that are highly sensitive to environmental factors and influence gene function without altering the DNA sequence, particularly aberrant DNA methylation, are involved in ASD pathogenesis. This systematic review aimed to update the clinical application of DNA methylation investigations in children with idiopathic ASD, investigating its potential application in clinical settings. To this end, a literature search was performed on different scientific databases using a combination of terms related to the association between peripheral DNA methylation and young children with idiopathic ASD; this search led to the identification of 18 articles. In the selected studies, DNA methylation is investigated in peripheral blood or saliva samples, at both gene-specific and genome-wide levels. The results obtained suggest that peripheral DNA methylation could represent a promising methodology in ASD biomarker research, although further studies are needed to develop DNA-methylation-based clinical applications."

Colon tissue was collected for histopathological evaluation, genome-wide methylation analyses (Digital Restriction Enzyme Assay of Methylation), and gene expression profiling (RNA-Seq).A dose-dependent increase in the multiplicity of colonic dysplasias was observed, with the multiplicity of total and polypoid dysplasias higher (64% and 225%, respectively) in the 8 mg FA vs. the 0 mg FA group (p< 0.001). Polypoid dysplasias were hypomethylated, as compared to the non-neoplastic colonic mucosa (p< 0.05), irrespective of FA treatment. The colonic mucosa of the 8 mg FA group was markedly hypomethylated as compared to the 0 mg FA group. Differential methylation of genes involved in Wnt/β-catenin and MAPK signaling resulted in corresponding alterations in gene expression within the colonic mucosa.High-dose FA created an altered epigenetic field effect within the non-neoplastic colonic mucosa. The observed decrease in site-specific DNA methylation altered oncogenic pathways and promoted colitis-associated CRC."
"37295475","Epigenome-Wide Association Studies of Allergic Disease and the Environment.","J Allergy Clin Immunol","The epigenome is at the intersection of the environment, genotype, and cellular response. DNA methylation of cytosine nucleotides, the most studied epigenetic modification, has been systematically evaluated in human studies using untargeted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and shown to be both sensitive to environmental exposures and associated with allergic diseases. In this narrative review, we summarize findings from key EWAS previously conducted on this topic, interpret results from recent studies, and discuss the strengths, challenges, and opportunities regarding epigenetics research on the environment-allergy relationship. The majority of EWAS have systematically investigated select environmental exposures, during the prenatal and early childhood period, and allergic diseases mostly in leukocyte-isolated DNA and more recently in nasal cells. Overall, many studies found consistent DNA methylation associations across cohorts for certain exposures, such as smoking (e.g., AHRR gene), and allergic diseases (e.g., EPX gene). We recommend the integration of both environmental exposures and allergy or asthma within long-term prospective designs to strengthen causality as well as biomarker development. Future studies should collect paired target tissues to examine compartment-specific epigenetic response, incorporate genetic influences in DNA methylation (meQTL), replicate findings across diverse populations, and carefully interpret epigenetic signatures from bulk, target tissue or isolated cells.Copyright © 2023.

"37294468","Epigenomics in stress tolerance of plants under the climate change.","Mol Biol Rep","Climate change has had a tremendous impact on the environment in general as well as agricultural crops grown in these situations as time passed. Agricultural production of crops is less suited and of lower quality due to disturbances in plant metabolism brought on by sensitivity to environmental stresses, which are brought on by climate change. Abiotic stressors that are specific to climate change, including as drought, extremes in temperature, increasing CO2, waterlogging from heavy rain, metal toxicity, and pH changes, are known to negatively affect an array of species. Plants adapt to these challenges by undergoing genome-wide epigenetic changes, which are frequently accompanied by differences in transcriptional gene expression. The sum of a cell's biochemical modifications to its nuclear DNA, post-translational modifications to histones, and variations in the synthesis of non-coding RNAs is called an epigenome. These modifications frequently lead to variations in gene expression that occur without any alteration in the underlying base sequence.The methylation of homologous loci by three different modifications-genomic (DNA methylation), chromatin (histone modifications), and RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)-could be regarded as epigenetic mechanisms that control the regulation of differential gene expression. Stresses from the environment cause chromatin remodelling, which enables plant cells to adjust their expression patterns temporarily or permanently. EPIGENOMICS' CONSEQUENCES FOR GENOME STABILITY AND GENE EXPRESSION: DNA methylation affects gene expression in response to abiotic stressors by blocking or suppressing transcription. Environmental stimuli cause changes in DNA methylation levels, either upward in the case of hypermethylation or downward in the case of hypomethylation. The type of stress response that occurs as a result also affects the degree of DNA methylation alterations. Stress is also influenced by DRM2 and CMT3 methylating CNN, CNG, and CG. Both plant development and stress reactions depend on histone changes. Gene up-regulation is associated with histone tail phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, while gene down-regulation is associated with de-acetylation and biotinylation. Plants undergo a variety of dynamic changes to histone tails in response to abiotic stressors. The relevance of these transcripts against stress is highlighted by the accumulation of numerous additional antisense transcripts, a source of siRNAs, caused by abiotic stresses. The study highlights the finding that plants can be protected from a range of abiotic stresses by epigenetic mechanisms such DNA methylation, histone modification, and RNA-directed DNA methylation. TRANSGENERATIONAL INHERITANCE AND SOURCES OF EPIGENETIC VARIATION: Stress results in the formation of epialleles, which are either transient or enduring epigenetic stress memory in plants. After the stress is gone, the stable memory is kept for the duration of the plant's remaining developmental cycles or passed on to the next generations, leading to plant evolution and adaptability. The bulk of epigenetic changes brought on by stress are temporary and return to normal after the stress has passed. Some of the modifications, however, might be long-lasting and transmitted across mitotic or even meiotic cell divisions. Epialleles often have genetic or non-genetic causes. Epialleles can arise spontaneously due to improper methylation state maintenance, short RNA off-target effects, or other non-genetic causes. Developmental or environmental variables that influence the stability of epigenetic states or direct chromatin modifications may also be non-genetic drivers of epigenetic variation. Transposon insertions that change local chromatin and structural rearrangements, such copy number changes that are genetically related or unrelated, are two genetic sources of epialleles.To include epigenetics into crop breeding, it is necessary to create epigenetic variation as well as to identify and evaluate epialleles. Epigenome editing or epi-genomic selection may be required for epiallele creation and identification. In order to combat the challenges given by changing environments, these epigenetic mechanisms have generated novel epialleles that can be exploited to develop new crop types that are more climate-resilient. Numerous techniques can be used to alter the epigenome generally or at specific target loci in order to induce the epigenetic alterations necessary for crop development. Technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 and dCas, which have recently advanced, have opened up new avenues for the study of epigenetics. Epialleles could be employed in epigenomics-assisted breeding in addition to sequence-based markers for crop breeding.A few of the exciting questions that still need to be resolved in the area of heritable epigenetic variation include a better understanding of the epigenetic foundation of characteristics, the stability and heritability of epialleles, and the sources of epigenetic variation in crops. Investigating long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) as an epigenetic process might open up a new path to understanding crop plant's ability to withstand abiotic stress. For many of these technologies and approaches to be more applicable and deployable at a lower cost, technological breakthroughs will also be necessary. Breeders will probably need to pay closer attention to crop epialleles and how they can affect future responses to climate changes. The development of epialleles suitable for particular environmental circumstances may be made possible by creating targeted epigenetic changes in pertinent genes and by comprehending the molecular underpinnings of trans generational epigenetic inheritance. More research on a wider variety of plant species is required in order to fully comprehend the mechanisms that produce and stabilise epigenetic variation in crops. In addition to a collaborative and multidisciplinary effort by researchers in many fields of plant science, this will require a greater integration of the epigenomic data gathered in many crops. Before it may be applied generally, more study is required.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"37293596","DNA methylation differences in noncoding regions in ER negative breast tumors between Black and White women.","Front Oncol","Incidence of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer, an aggressive tumor subtype associated with worse prognosis, is higher among African American/Black women than other US racial and ethnic groups. The reasons for this disparity remain poorly understood but may be partially explained by differences in the epigenetic landscape.We previously conducted genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of ER- breast tumors from Black and White women and identified a large number of differentially methylated loci (DML) by race. Our initial analysis focused on DML mapping to protein-coding genes. In this study, motivated by increasing appreciation for the biological importance of the non-protein coding genome, we focused on 96 DMLs mapping to intergenic and noncoding RNA regions, using paired Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450K array and RNA-seq data to assess the relationship between CpG methylation and RNA expression of genes located up to 1Mb away from the CpG site.Twenty-three (23) DMLs were significantly correlated with the expression of 36 genes (FDR<0.05), with some DMLs associated with the expression of single gene and others associated with more than one gene. One DML (cg20401567), hypermethylated in ER- tumors from Black versus White women, mapped to a putative enhancer/super-enhancer element located 1.3 Kb downstream ofHOXB2. Increased methylation at this CpG correlated with decreased expression ofHOXB2(Rho=-0.74, FDR<0.001) and otherHOXB/HOXB-ASgenes. Analysis of an independent set of 207 ER- breast cancers from TCGA similarly confirmed hypermethylation at cg20401567 and reducedHOXB2expression in tumors from Black versus White women (Rho=-0.75, FDR<0.001).Our findings indicate that epigenetic differences in ER- tumors between Black and White women are linked to altered gene expression and may hold functional significance in breast cancer pathogenesis.Copyright © 2023 Chen, Higgins, Hu, Khoury, Liu, Ambrosone and Gong."

Single-cell DNA methylomic studies offer unprecedented resolution for detecting and profiling cell subsets based on methylomic features. However, existing single-cell methylomic technologies are all based on use of tubes or well plates and these platforms are not easily scalable for handling a large number of single cells. Here we demonstrate a droplet-based microfluidic technology, Drop-BS, to construct single-cell bisulfite sequencing libraries for DNA methylome profiling. Drop-BS takes advantage of the ultrahigh throughput offered by droplet microfluidics to prepare bisulfite sequencing libraries of up to 10,000 single cells within 2 d. We applied the technology to profile mixed cell lines, mouse and human brain tissues to reveal cell type heterogeneity.

However, the International Human Epigenome Consortium propose a full DNA methylome should have at least 30 fold redundant coverage of the reference genome from a single biological replicate. Therefore, it remains cost prohibitive for large-scale studies. To find a solution, the DNBSEQ-Tx sequencing was developed that can generate up to 6 Tb data in a single run for projects involving large-scale sequencing.In this study, we provided two WGBS library construction methods DNB_PREBSseq and DNB_SPLATseq optimized for the DNBSEQ-Tx sequencer, and demonstrated the performance of these two methods on the DNBSEQ-Tx platform, using the DNA extracted from four different cell lines. We also compared the sequencing data from these two WGBS library construction methods with HeLa cell line data from ENCODE sequenced on Illumina HiSeq X Ten and WGBS data of two other cell lines sequenced on HiSeq2500. Various quality control (QC) analyses such as the base quality scores, methylation-bias (m-bias), and conversion efficiency indicated that the data sequenced on the DNBSEQ-Tx platform met the WGBS-required quality controls. Meanwhile, our data closely resembled the coverage shown by the data generated by the Illumina platform.Our study showed that with our optimized methods, DNBSEQ-Tx could generate high-quality WGBS data with relatively good stability for large-scale WGBS sequencing applications. Thus, we conclude that DNBSEQ-Tx can be used for a wide range of WGBS research.© 2023 The Authors."

However, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis has not been applied thus far. The present study aimed to provide the first DNA methylation profiling for ITP.Peripheral blood CD4+T lymphocytes samples were collected from 4 primary refractory ITP cases and 4 age-matched healthy controls, and DNA methylome profiling was performed using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Differentially methylated CpG sites were further validated in another independent cohort of 10 ITP patients and 10 healthy controls using qRT-PCR.The DNA methylome profiling identified a total of 260 differentially methylated CpG sites mapping to 72 hypermethylated and 64 hypomethylated genes. These genes were mainly enriched in the actin nucleation of the Arp2/3 complex, vesicle transport, histone H3-K36 demethylation, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, and Notch signaling pathway according to the GO and KEGG databases. The mRNA expression of CASP9, C1orf109, and AMD1 were significantly different.Given the altered DNA methylation profiling of ITP, our study provides new insights into its genetic mechanism and suggests candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of ITP.© 2023.

"37289025","The genomic and epigenomic landscape of double-negative metastatic prostate cancer.","Cancer Res","Systemic targeted therapy in prostate cancer is primarily focused on ablating androgen signaling. Androgen deprivation therapy and second-generation androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy selectively favor the development of treatment-resistant subtypes of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), defined by AR and neuroendocrine (NE) markers. Molecular drivers of double-negative (AR-/NE-) mCRPC are poorly defined. In this study, we comprehensively characterized treatment-emergent mCRPC by integrating matched RNA sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing from 210 tumors. AR-/NE- tumors were clinically and molecularly distinct from other mCRPC subtypes, with the shortest survival, amplification of the chromatin remodeler CHD7, and PTEN loss. Methylation changes in CHD7 candidate enhancers were linked to elevated CHD7 expression in AR-/NE+ tumors. Genome-wide methylation analysis nominated KLF5 as a driver of the AR-/NE- phenotype, and KLF5 activity was linked to RB1 loss. These observations reveal the aggressiveness of AR-/NE- mCRPC and could facilitate the identification of therapeutic targets in this highly aggressive disease."

Surprisingly, the functional annotation of porcine neutrophils is still limited. The transcriptomic and epigenetic assessment of porcine neutrophils from healthy pigs was performed by bulk RNA sequencing and transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq). First, we sequenced and compared the transcriptome of porcine neutrophils with eight other immune cell transcriptomes to identify a neutrophil-enriched gene list within a detected neutrophil co-expression module. Second, we used ATAC-seq analysis to report for the first time the genome-wide chromatin accessible regions of porcine neutrophils. A combined analysis using both transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data further defined the neutrophil co-expression network controlled by transcription factors likely important for neutrophil lineage commitment and function. We identified chromatin accessible regions around promoters of neutrophil-specific genes that were predicted to be bound by neutrophil-specific transcription factors. Additionally, published DNA methylation data from porcine immune cells including neutrophils were used to link low DNA methylation patterns to accessible chromatin regions and genes with highly enriched expression in porcine neutrophils. In summary, our data provides the first integrative analysis of the accessible chromatin regions and transcriptional status of porcine neutrophils, contributing to the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes (FAANG) project, and demonstrates the utility of chromatin accessible regions to identify and enrich our understanding of transcriptional networks in a cell type such as neutrophils.Copyright © 2023 Herrera-Uribe, Lim, Byrne, Daharsh, Liu, Corbett, Marco, Schroyen, Koltes, Loving and Tuggle."

We have previously shown that DNA methylation of Id2/Id4 is highly involved in OPC differentiation and remyelination. In this study, we took an unbiased approach by determining genome-wide DNA methylation patterns within chronically demyelinated MS lesions and investigated how certain epigenetic signatures relate to OPC differentiation capacity. We compared genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptional profiles between chronically demyelinated MS lesions and matched normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), making use of post-mortem brain tissue (n = 9/group). DNA methylation differences that inversely correlated with mRNA expression of their corresponding genes were validated for their cell-type specificity in laser-captured OPCs using pyrosequencing. The CRISPR-dCas9-DNMT3a/TET1 system was used to epigenetically edit human-iPSC-derived oligodendrocytes to assess the effect on cellular differentiation. Our data show hypermethylation of CpGs within genes that cluster in gene ontologies related to myelination and axon ensheathment. Cell type-specific validation indicates a region-dependent hypermethylation of MBP, encoding for myelin basic protein, in OPCs obtained from white matter lesions compared to NAWM-derived OPCs. By altering the DNA methylation state of specific CpGs within the promotor region of MBP, using epigenetic editing, we show that cellular differentiation and myelination can be bidirectionally manipulated using the CRISPR-dCas9-DNMT3a/TET1 system in vitro. Our data indicate that OPCs within chronically demyelinated MS lesions acquire an inhibitory phenotype, which translates into hypermethylation of crucial myelination-related genes. Altering the epigenetic status of MBP can restore the differentiation capacity of OPCs and possibly boost (re)myelination.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37284022","Insights into the epigenetics of chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps: a systematic review.","Front Allergy","Epigenetics facilitates insights on the impact of host environment on the genesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) through modulations of host gene expression and activity. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation cause reversible but heritable changes in gene expression over generations of progeny, without altering the DNA base-pair sequences. These studies offer a critical understanding of the environment-induced changes that result in host predisposition to disease and may help in developing novel biomarkers and therapeutics. The goal of this systematic review is to summarize the current evidence on epigenetics of CRS with a focus on chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and highlight gaps that merit further research.A systematic review of the English language literature was performed to identify investigations related to epigenetic studies in subjects with CRS.The review identified 65 studies. These have focused on DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs, with only a few on histone deacetylation, alternative polyadenylation, and chromatin accessibility. Studies include those investigatingin vivoandin vitrochanges or both. Studies also include animal models of CRS. Almost all have been conducted in Asia. The genome-wide studies of DNA methylation found differences in global methylation between CRSwNP and controls, while others specifically found significant differences in methylation of the CpG sites of the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP),IL-8, andPLAT. In addition, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors were studied as potential therapeutic agents. Majority of the studies investigating non-coding RNAs focused on micro-RNAs (miRNA) and found differences in global expression of miRNA levels. These studies also revealed some previously known as well as novel targets and pathways such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, TGF beta-1, IL-10,EGR2, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, PI3K/AKT pathway, mucin secretion, and vascular permeability. Overall, the studies have found a dysregulation in pathways/genes involving inflammation, immune regulation, tissue remodeling, structural proteins, mucin secretion, arachidonic acid metabolism, and transcription.Epigenetic studies in CRS subjects suggest that there is likely a major impact of the environment. However, these are association studies and do not directly imply pathogenesis. Longitudinal studies in geographically and racially diverse population cohorts are necessary to quantify genetic vs. environmental risks for CRSwNP and CRS without nasal polyps and assess heritability risk, as well as develop novel biomarkers and therapeutic agents.© 2023 Brar, Marks and Lal."

Aberrant DNA methylation has been identified in peripheral blood and bulk intestinal tissue from CD patients. However, the DNA methylome of disease-associated intestinal CD4 + lymphocytes has not been evaluated.Genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing was performed from terminal ileum CD4 + cells from 21 CD patients and 12 age and sex matched controls. Data was analyzed for differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) and methylated regions (DMRs). Integration was performed with RNA-sequencing data to evaluate the functional impact of DNA methylation changes on gene expression. DMRs were overlapped with regions of differentially open chromatin (by ATAC-seq) and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites (by ChIP-seq) between peripherally-derived Th17 and Treg cells.CD4+ cells in CD patients had significantly increased DNA methylation compared to those from the controls. A total of 119,051 DMCs and 8,113 DMRs were detected. While hyper-methylated genes were mostly related to cell metabolism and homeostasis, hypomethylated genes were significantly enriched within the Th17 signaling pathway. The differentially enriched ATAC regions in Th17 cells (compared to Tregs) were hypomethylated in CD patients, suggesting heightened Th17 activity. There was significant overlap between hypomethylated DNA regions and CTCF-associated binding sites.The methylome of CD patients demonstrate an overall dominant hypermethylation yet hypomethylation is more concentrated in proinflammatory pathways, including Th17 differentiation. Hypomethylation of Th17-related genes associated with areas of open chromatin and CTCF binding sites constitutes a hallmark of CD-associated intestinal CD4 + cells.© The Author(s) 2023.

To date, PCa genomic studies have largely under-represented tumour samples from AA men. We measured genome-wide DNA methylation in benign and tumor prostate tissues from AA men using the Illumina Infunium 850 K EPIC array. mRNA expression database from a subset of the AA biospecimen were used to assess correlation of transcriptome and methylation datasets. Genome-wide methylation analysis identified 11,460 probes that were significant (p < 0.01) and differentially methylated in AA PCa compared to normal prostate tissues and showed significant (p < 0.01) inverse-correlation with mRNA expression. Ingenuity pathway analysis and Gene Ontology analysis in our AA dataset compared with TCGA dataset showed similarities in methylation patterns: top candidate genes with significant hypermethylation and corresponding down-regulated gene expression were associated with biological pathways in hemidesmosome assembly, mammary gland development, epidermis development, hormone biosynthesis, and cell communication. In addition, top candidate genes with significant hypomethylation and corresponding up-regulated gene expression were associated with biological pathways in macrophage differentiation, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, protein destabilization, transcription co-repression, and fatty acid biosynthesis. In contrast, differences in genome-wide methylation in our AA dataset compared with TCGA dataset were enriched for genes in steroid signalling, immune signalling, chromatin structure remodelling and RNA processing. Overall, differential methylation ofAMIGO3,IER3,UPB1,GRM7,TFAP2C,TOX2,PLSCR2,ZNF292,ESR2,MIXL1,BOLL,andFGF6 were significant and uniquely associated with PCa progression in our AA cohort."
"37275549","Underexplored reciprocity between genome-wide methylation status and long non-coding RNA expression reflected in breast cancer research: potential impacts for the disease management in the framework of 3P medicine.","EPMA J","Breast cancer (BC) is the most common female malignancy reaching a pandemic scale worldwide. A comprehensive interplay between genetic alterations and shifted epigenetic regions synergistically leads to disease development and progression into metastatic BC. DNA and histones methylations, as the most studied epigenetic modifications, represent frequent and early events in the process of carcinogenesis. To this end, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are recognized as potent epigenetic modulators in pathomechanisms of BC by contributing to the regulation of DNA, RNA, and histones' methylation. In turn, the methylation status of DNA, RNA, and histones can affect the level of lncRNAs expression demonstrating the reciprocity of mechanisms involved. Furthermore, lncRNAs might undergo methylation in response to actual medical conditions such as tumor development and treated malignancies. The reciprocity between genome-wide methylation status and long non-coding RNA expression levels in BC remains largely unexplored. Since the bio/medical research in the area is, per evidence, strongly fragmented, the relevance of this reciprocity for BC development and progression has not yet been systematically analyzed. Contextually, the article aims at:consolidating the accumulated knowledge on both-the genome-wide methylation status and corresponding lncRNA expression patterns in BC andhighlighting the potential benefits of this consolidated multi-professional approach for advanced BC management. Based on a big data analysis and machine learning for individualized data interpretation, the proposed approach demonstrates a great potential to promote predictive diagnostics and targeted prevention in the cost-effective primary healthcare (sub-optimal health conditions and protection against the health-to-disease transition) as well as advanced treatment algorithms tailored to the individualized patient profiles in secondary BC care (effective protection against metastatic disease). Clinically relevant examples are provided, including mitochondrial health control and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved.© The Author(s) 2023."
"37274792","Genome-wide search identified DNA methylation sites that regulate the metabolome.","Front Genet","Background:Identifying DNA methylation sites that regulate the metabolome is important for several purposes. In this study, publicly available GWAS data were integrated to find methylation sites that impact metabolome through a discovery and replication scheme and by using Mendelian randomization.Results:The outcome of analyses revealed 107 methylation sites associated with 84 metabolites at the genome-wide significance level (p<5e-8) at both the discovery and replication stages. A large percentage of the observed associations (85%) were with lipids, significantly higher than expected (p= 0.0003). A number of CpG (methylation) sites showed specificity e.g., cg20133200 withinPFKPwas associated with glucose only and cg10760299 withinGATMimpacted the level of creatinine; in contrast, there were sites associated with numerous metabolites e.g., cg20102877 on the 2p23.3 region was associated with 39 metabolites. Integrating transcriptome data enabled identifying genes (N = 82) mediating the impact of methylation sites on the metabolome and cardiometabolic traits. For example,PABPC4mediated the impact of cg15123755-HDL on type-2 diabetes.KCNK7mediated the impact of cg21033440-lipids on hypertension.POC5, ILRUN, FDFT1,andNEIL2mediated the impact of CpG sites on obesity through metabolic pathways.Conclusion:This study provides a catalog of DNA methylation sites that regulate the metabolome for downstream applications.Copyright © 2023 Nikpay."
"37272752","Deficiency of the Polycomb protein RYBP and TET methylcytosine oxidases promotes extensive CpG island hypermethylation and malignant transformation.","Cancer Res","Hypermethylation of CpG islands is a common feature of cancer cells and predominantly affects Polycomb-associated genomic regions. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms leading to DNA hypermethylation in human cancer could help identify chemoprevention strategies. Here, we evaluated the role of Polycomb complexes and 5-methylcytosine oxidases in protecting CpG islands from DNA methylation and observed that four genes coding for components of Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) are downregulated in tumors. Inactivation of RYBP, a key activator of variant PRC1 complexes, in combination with all three 5-methylcytosine oxidases (TET proteins) in nontumorigenic bronchial epithelial cells led to widespread hypermethylation of Polycomb-marked CpG islands affecting almost 4,000 target genes, which closely resembled the DNA hypermethylation landscape observed in human squamous cell lung tumors. The RYBP- and TET-deficient cells showed methylation-associated aberrant regulation of cancer-relevant pathways, including defects in the Hippo tumor suppressor network. Notably, the quadruple knockout cells acquired a transformed phenotype, including anchorage-independent growth and formation of squamous cell carcinomas in mice. This work provides a mechanism promoting hypermethylation of CpG islands and shows that such hypermethylation can lead to cell transformation. The breakdown of a two-pronged protection mechanism can be a route towards genome-wide hypermethylation of CpG islands in tumors."

We hypothesized that m6A RNA methylation plays an important role in the cardiac developmental toxicity of PM2.5. In this study, we demonstrated that extractable organic matter (EOM) from PM2.5 significantly decreased global m6A RNA methylation levels in the heart of zebrafish larvae, which were restored by the methyl donor, betaine. Betaine also attenuated EOM-induced ROS overgeneration, mitochondrial damage, apoptosis and heart defects. Furthermore, we found that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which was activated by EOM,directly repressed the transcription of methyltransferases mettl14 and mettl3. EOM also induced genome-wide m6A RNA methylation changes, which led us to focus more on the aberrant m6A methylation changes that were subsequently alleviated by the AHR inhibitor, CH223191. In addition, we found that the expression levels of traf4a and bbc3, two apoptosis related genes, were upregulated by EOM but restored to control levels by the forced expression of mettl14. Moreover, knockdown of either traf4a or bbc3 attenuated EOM-induced ROS overproduction and apoptosis. In conclusion, our results indicate that PM2.5induces m6A RNA methylation changes via AHR-mediated mettl14 downregulation, which upregulates traf4a and bbc3, leading to apoptosis and cardiac malformations.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Tumour molecular profiles of MLH1 epimutation CRCs were used to classify germline MLH1 promoter variants of uncertain significance and MLH1 methylated early-onset CRCs (EOCRCs). Genome-wide DNA methylation and somatic mutational profiles of tumours from two germline MLH1: c.-11C > T and one MLH1: c.-[28A > G; 7C > T] carriers and three MLH1 methylated EOCRCs (< 45 years) were compared with 38 reference CRCs. Methylation-sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to detect mosaic MLH1 methylation in blood, normal mucosa and buccal DNA.Genome-wide methylation-based Consensus Clustering identified four clusters where the tumour methylation profiles of germline MLH1: c.-11C > T carriers and MLH1 methylated EOCRCs clustered with the constitutional MLH1 epimutation CRCs but not with the sporadic MLH1 methylated CRCs. Furthermore, monoallelic MLH1 methylation and APC promoter hypermethylation in tumour were observed in both MLH1 epimutation and germline MLH1: c.-11C > T carriers and MLH1 methylated EOCRCs. Mosaic constitutional MLH1 methylation in MLH1: c.-11C > T carriers and 1 of 3 MLH1 methylated EOCRCs was identified by methylation-sensitive ddPCR.Mosaic MLH1 epimutation underlies the CRC aetiology in MLH1: c.-11C > T germline carriers and a subset of MLH1 methylated EOCRCs.

"37269647","Integrated insight into the molecular mechanisms of selenium-modulated, MPP(+)-induced cytotoxicity in a Parkinson's disease model.","J Trace Elem Med Biol","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is associated with oxidative stress. Due to the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions of Selenium (Se), this molecule may have neuroprotective functions in PD; however, the involvement of Se in such a protective function is unclear.1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), which inhibits mitochondrial respiration, is generally used to produce a reliable cellular model of PD. In this study, a MPP+-induced PD model was used to test if Se could modulate cytotoxicity, and we further capture gene expression profiles following PC12 cell treatment with MPP+with or without Se by genome wide high-throughput sequencing.We identified 351 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 14 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DELs) in MPP+-treated cells when compared to controls. We further document 244 DEGs and 27 DELs in cells treated with MPP+and Se vs. cells treated with MPP+only. Functional annotation analysis of DEGs and DELs revealed that these groups were enriched in genes that respond to reactive oxygen species (ROS), metabolic processes, and mitochondrial control of apoptosis. Thioredoxin reductase 1 (Txnrd1) was also identified as a biomarker of Se treatment.Our data suggests that the DEGs Txnrd1, Siglec1 and Klf2, and the DEL AABR07044454.1 which we hypothesize to function in cis on the target gene Cdkn1a, may modulate the underlying neurodegenerative process, and act a protective function in the PC12 cell PD model. This study further systematically demonstrated that mRNAs and lncRNAs induced by Se are involved in neuroprotection in PD, and provides novel insight into how Se modulates cytotoxicity in the MPP+-induced PD model.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

"37264042","On the thermodynamics of DNA methylation process.","Sci Rep","DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that plays important roles in various biological processes including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, genomic imprinting, aging, and stress response to environmental changes and disease. Consistent with thermodynamic principles acting within living systems and the application of maximum entropy principle, we propose a theoretical framework to understand and decode the DNA methylation process. A central tenet of this argument is that the probability density function of DNA methylation information-divergence summarizes the statistical biophysics underlying spontaneous methylation background and implicitly bears on the channel capacity of molecular machines conforming to Shannon's capacity theorem. On this theoretical basis, contributions from the molecular machine (enzyme) logical operations to Gibb entropy (S) and Helmholtz free energy (F) are intrinsic. Application to the estimations of S on datasets from Arabidopsis thaliana suggests that, as a thermodynamic state variable, individual methylome entropy is completely determined by the current state of the system, which in biological terms translates to a correspondence between estimated entropy values and observable phenotypic state. In patients with different types of cancer, results suggest that a significant information loss occurs in the transition from differentiated (healthy) tissues to cancer cells. This type of analysis may have important implications for early-stage diagnostics. The analysis of entropy fluctuations on experimental datasets revealed existence of restrictions on the magnitude of genome-wide methylation changes originating by organismal response to environmental changes. Only dysfunctional stages observed in the Arabidopsis mutant met1 and in cancer cells do not conform to these rules.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37260089","Nsp14 of SARS-CoV-2 inhibits mRNA processing and nuclear export by targeting the nuclear cap-binding complex.","Nucleic Acids Res","To facilitate selfish replication, viruses halt host gene expression in various ways. The nuclear export of mRNA is one such process targeted by many viruses. SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, also prevents mRNA nuclear export. In this study, Nsp14, a bifunctional viral replicase subunit, was identified as a novel inhibitor of mRNA nuclear export. Nsp14 induces poly(A)+ RNA nuclear accumulation and the dissolution/coalescence of nuclear speckles. Genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed the global dysregulation of splicing and 3'-end processing defects of replication-dependent histone mRNAs by Nsp14. These abnormalities were also observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. A mutation introduced at the guanine-N7-methyltransferase active site of Nsp14 diminished these inhibitory activities. Targeted capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry analysis (CE-MS) unveiled the production of N7-methyl-GTP in Nsp14-expressing cells. Association of the nuclear cap-binding complex (NCBC) with the mRNA cap and subsequent recruitment of U1 snRNP and the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) were impaired by Nsp14. These data suggest that the defects in mRNA processing and export arise from the compromise of NCBC function by N7-methyl-GTP, thus exemplifying a novel viral strategy to block host gene expression.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37259877","[Development of a widely-targeted metabolomics method based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry].","Se Pu","Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) detectors are widely used detection instruments owing to their distinct advantages over other analytical techniques, including lower sample consumption, higher sensitivity, faster analysis speed, and simultaneous separation and analysis. Metabolomics is an important component of system physiology that concerns systematic studies of the metabolite spectrum in one or more biological systems, such as cells, tissues, organs, body fluids, and organisms. Unfortunately, conventional GC-MS detectors also feature low scan rates, high ion loss rates, and a narrow concentration detection range, which limit their applications in the field of metabolomics. Therefore, establishing a GC-MS-based metabolomic analysis method with wide coverage is of great importance. In this research, a widely-targeted metabolomics method based on GC-MS is proposed. This method combines the universality of untargeted metabolomics with the accuracy of targeted metabolomics to realize the qualitative and semi-quantitative detection of numerous metabolites. It does not require a self-built database and exhibits high sensitivity, good repeatability, and strong support for a wide range of metabolic substances. The proposed method was used to establish the relationship between the retention time of straight-chain fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and their retention index (RI) in the FiehnLib database based on the metabolite information stored in this database. We obtained a linear relationship that could be described by the equationy=40878x-47530,r2=0.9999. We then calculated the retention times of metabolites in the FiehnLib database under the experimental conditions based on their RI. In this way, the effects of significant variations in peak retention times owing to differences in the chromatographic column, temperature, carrier gas flow rate, and so on can be avoided. The retention time of a substance fluctuates within a certain threshold because of variations in instrument performance, matrix interference, and other factors. As such, the retention time threshold of the substance must be determined. In this paper, the retention time threshold was set to 0.15 min to avoid instrument fluctuations. The optimal scan interval was optimized to 0.20 s (possible values=0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, and 0.30 s) because longer sampling periods can lead to spectral data loss and reductions in the resolution of adjacent chromatographic peaks, whereas shorter sampling periods can result in deterioration of the signal-to-noise ratio of the collected signals. The metabolite quantification ions were optimized to avoid the interference of quantification ion peak accumulation in the case of similar peak times, and a selected ion monitoring (SIM) method table was constructed for 611 metabolites, covering 65% of the metabolic pathways in the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes). The developed method covered 39 pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and biosynthesis. Compared with the full-scan untargeted GC-MS method, the widely-targeted GC-MS method demonstrated a 20%-30% increase in the number of metabolites detected, as well as a 15%-20% increase in signal-to-noise ratio. The results of stability tests showed that 84% of the intraday relative standard deviations (RSDs) of metabolite retention times were less than 2% and 91% of that were less than 3%; moreover, 54% of the interday RSDs of metabolite retention times were less than 2% and 76% of that were less than 3%. The detection and analysis results of common biological samples confirmed that the proposed method greatly improved the quantity and signal-to-noise ratio of the detected metabolites and is applicable to substances that are thermally stable, volatile, or volatile after derivation and have relative molecular masses lower than 600. Thus, the widely-targeted GC-MS method can expand the application scope of GC-MS in metabolomics."

Despite the growing number of individuals using marijuana, studies investigating the association between epigenetic factors and recent and cumulative marijuana use remain limited. We therefore investigated the association between recent and cumulative marijuana use and DNA methylation levels. Participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study with whole blood collected at examination years (Y) 15 and Y20 were randomly selected to undergo DNA methylation profiling at both timepoints using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Recent use of marijuana was queried at each examination and used to estimate cumulative marijuana use from Y0 to Y15 and Y20. At Y15 (n = 1023), we observed 22 and 31 methylation markers associated (FDR P ≤ 0.05) with recent and cumulative marijuana use and 132 and 16 methylation markers at Y20 (n = 883), respectively. We replicated 8 previously reported methylation markers associated with marijuana use. We further identified 640 cis-meQTLs and 198 DMRs associated with recent and cumulative use at Y15 and Y20. Differentially methylated genes were statistically overrepresented in pathways relating to cellular proliferation, hormone signaling, and infections as well as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and substance-related disorders. We identified numerous methylation markers, pathways, and diseases associated with recent and cumulative marijuana use in middle-aged adults, providing additional insight into the association between marijuana use and the epigenome.

RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) plays a fundamental role in regulating the expression of neuronal genes, and in particular their silencing in non-neuronal tissues, by inducing chromatin modifications, including DNA methylation changes, not only in the proximity of its binding sites but also in the flanking regions. REST has been found aberrantly expressed in brain cancer and other cancer types. In this work, we investigated DNA methylation alterations at REST binding sites and their flanking regions in a brain cancer (pilocytic astrocytoma), two gastrointestinal tumours (colorectal cancer and biliary tract cancer) and a blood cancer (chronic lymphocytic leukemia).Differential methylation analyses focused on REST binding sites and their flanking regions were conducted between tumour and normal samples from our experimental datasets analysed by Illumina microarrays and the identified alterations were validated using publicly available datasets. We discovered distinct DNA methylation patterns between pilocytic astrocytoma and the other cancer types in agreement with the opposite oncogenic and tumour suppressive role of REST in glioma and non-brain tumours.Our results suggest that these DNA methylation alterations in cancer may be associated with REST dysfunction opening the enthusiastic possibility to develop novel therapeutic interventions based on the modulation of this master regulator in order to restore the aberrant methylation of its target regions into a normal status.© 2023.

"37268982","Epigenetic age acceleration mediates the association between smoking and diabetes-related outcomes.","Clin Epigenetics","Smoking can lead to the deterioration of lung function and susceptibility to diabetes. Recently, smoking was found to induce DNA methylation (DNAm) changes in some cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs). As linear combinations of DNAm levels of aging-related CpGs, five measures of epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) have received extensive attention: HannumEAA, IEAA, PhenoEAA, GrimEAA, and DunedinPACE. It is of interest to explore whether some measures of EAA can mediate the associations of smoking with diabetes-related outcomes and indices of ventilatory lung function.In this study, we included self-reported smoking variables (smoking status, the number of pack-years, and years since smoking cessation), seven DNAm markers (HannumEAA, IEAA, PhenoEAA, GrimEAA, DNAm-based smoking pack-years, DNAm plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 [PAI-1] levels, and DunedinPACE), and four health outcomes (fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, forced expiratory volume in 1.0 s [FEV1], and forced vital capacity [FVC]) from 2474 Taiwan Biobank participants. Mediation analyses were conducted while adjusting for chronological age, sex, body mass index, drinking status, regular exercise status, educational attainment, and five cell-type proportions. We demonstrated that GrimEAA, DNAm-based smoking pack-years, DNAm PAI-1 levels, DunedinPACE, and PhenoEAA mediated smoking associations with diabetes-related outcomes. Moreover, current and former smoking both had an adverse indirect effect on FVC through DNAm PAI-1 levels. For former smokers, a long time since smoking cessation had a positive indirect impact on FVC through GrimEAA and on FEV1 through PhenoEAA.This is one of the first studies to comprehensively investigate the role of five measures of EAA in mediating the associations of smoking with the health outcomes of an Asian population. The results showed that the second-generation epigenetic clocks (GrimEAA, DunedinPACE, and PhenoEAA) significantly mediated the associations between smoking and diabetes-related outcomes. In contrast, the first-generation epigenetic clocks (HannumEAA and IEAA) did not significantly mediate any associations of smoking variables with the four health outcomes. Cigarette smoking can, directly and indirectly, deteriorate human health through DNAm changes in aging-related CpG sites.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Epigenetic alterations, including changes in DNA methylation patterns, have been reported to be one of the hallmarks of aging. Being a malleable process, the role of site-specific DNA methylation in aging is being extensively investigated; however, much less attention has been given to alterations in global DNA methylation with aging at the population level. The present study aims to explore overall and sex-specific variations in global DNA methylation patterns with age.Methods:A total of 1,127 adult individuals (792 females) aged 30-75 years belonging to Haryana, North India, were recruited. Socio-demographic data was collected using a pretested interview schedule. Global DNA methylation analysis, of peripheral blood leucocyte (PBL) DNA, was performed using the ELISA-based colorimetric technique.Results:Though the overall correlation analysis revealed a weak inverse trend between global DNA methylation and age, the adjusted regression model showed no significant association between global DNA methylation and age. In age-stratified analysis, global DNA methylation levels were found to be fairly stable until 60 years of age, followed by a decline in the above-60 age group. Further, no significant difference in DNA patterns methylation pattern was observed between males and females.Conclusion:Overall, the study suggests a lack of association between global DNA methylation and age, especially until 60 years of age, and a similar DNA methylation pattern between males and females with respect to age.Copyright © 2023 Kaushik, Chaudhary, Longkumer, Saraswathy and Jain."
"37259015","A metabolomic signature of decelerated physiological aging in human plasma.","Geroscience","The degenerative processes that occur during aging increase the risk of disease and impaired health. Meanwhile, interventions that target aging to promote healthy longevity are gaining interest, both academically and in the public. While nutritional and physical interventions exist, efficacy is often difficult to determine. It is therefore imperative that an aging score measuring the biological aging process is available to the wider public. However, simple, interpret, and accessible biological aging scores are lacking. Here, we developed PhysiAge, a physiological aging score based on five accessible parameters that have influence on or reflect the aging process: (1) average daily step count, (2) blood glucose, (3) systolic blood pressure, (4) sex, and (5) age. Here, we found that compared to calendar age alone, PhysiAge better predicts mortality, as well as established muscle aging markers such as decrease in NAD+levels, increase in oxidative stress, and decline in physical functioning. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of PhysiAge in identifying relevant factors associated with decelerated aging, we calculated PhysiAges for a cohort of aged individuals and obtained mass spectrometry-based blood plasma metabolomic profiles for each individual. Here, we identified a metabolic signature of decelerated aging, which included components of the TCA cycle, including malate, citrate, and isocitrate. Higher abundance of these metabolites was associated with decelerated aging, in line with supplementation studies in model organisms. PhysiAge represents an accessible way for people to track and intervene in their aging trajectories, and identifies a metabolic signature of decelerated aging in human blood plasma, which can be further studied for its causal involvement in human aging.© 2023.

"37256150","Emerging epigenetic dynamics in gut-microglia brain axis: experimental and clinical implications for accelerated brain aging in schizophrenia.","Front Cell Neurosci","Brain aging, which involves a progressive loss of neuronal functions, has been reported to be premature in probands affected by schizophrenia (SCZ). Evidence shows that SCZ and accelerated aging are linked to changes in epigenetic clocks. Recent cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging analyses have uncovered reduced brain reserves and connectivity in patients with SCZ compared to typically aging individuals. These data may indicate early abnormalities of neuronal function following cyto-architectural alterations in SCZ. The current mechanistic knowledge on brain aging, epigenetic changes, and their neuropsychiatric disease association remains incomplete. With this review, we explore and summarize evidence that the dynamics of gut-resident bacteria can modulate molecular brain function and contribute to age-related neurodegenerative disorders. It is known that environmental factors such as mode of birth, dietary habits, stress, pollution, and infections can modulate the microbiota system to regulate intrinsic neuronal activity and brain reserves through the vagus nerve and enteric nervous system. Microbiota-derived molecules can trigger continuous activation of the microglial sensome, groups of receptors and proteins that permit microglia to remodel the brain neurochemistry based on complex environmental activities. This remodeling causes aberrant brain plasticity as early as fetal developmental stages, and after the onset of first-episode psychosis. In the central nervous system, microglia, the resident immune surveillance cells, are involved in neurogenesis, phagocytosis of synapses and neurological dysfunction. Here, we review recent emerging experimental and clinical evidence regarding the gut-brain microglia axis involvement in SCZ pathology and etiology, the hypothesis of brain reserve and accelerated aging induced by dietary habits, stress, pollution, infections, and other factors. We also include in our review the possibilities and consequences of gut dysbiosis activities on microglial function and dysfunction, together with the effects of antipsychotics on the gut microbiome: therapeutic and adverse effects, role of fecal microbiota transplant and psychobiotics on microglial sensomes, brain reserves and SCZ-derived accelerated aging. We end the review with suggestions that may be applicable to the clinical setting. For example, we propose that psychobiotics might contribute to antipsychotic-induced therapeutic benefits or adverse effects, as well as reduce the aging process through the gut-brain microglia axis. Overall, we hope that this review will help increase the understanding of SCZ pathogenesis as related to chronobiology and the gut microbiome, as well as reveal new concepts that will serve as novel treatment targets for SCZ.Copyright © 2023 Ben-Azu, del Re, VanderZwaag, Carrier, Keshavan, Khakpour and Tremblay."
"37140344","Limitations of principal components in quantitative genetic association models for human studies.","Elife","Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Linear Mixed-effects Model (LMM), sometimes in combination, are the most common genetic association models. Previous PCA-LMM comparisons give mixed results, unclear guidance, and have several limitations, including not varying the number of principal components (PCs), simulating simple population structures, and inconsistent use of real data and power evaluations. We evaluate PCA and LMM both varying number of PCs in realistic genotype and complex trait simulations including admixed families, subpopulation trees, and real multiethnic human datasets with simulated traits. We find that LMM without PCs usually performs best, with the largest effects in family simulations and real human datasets and traits without environment effects. Poor PCA performance on human datasets is driven by large numbers of distant relatives more than the smaller number of closer relatives. While PCA was known to fail on family data, we report strong effects of family relatedness in genetically diverse human datasets, not avoided by pruning close relatives. Environment effects driven by geography and ethnicity are better modeled with LMM including those labels instead of PCs. This work better characterizes the severe limitations of PCA compared to LMM in modeling the complex relatedness structures of multiethnic human data for association studies.© 2023, Yao and Ochoa."
"37280519","Genotype-degree of hemolysis correlation in hereditary spherocytosis.","BMC Genomics","Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a common inherited hemolytic anemia, caused by mutations in five genes that encode erythrocyte membrane skeleton proteins. The red blood cell (RBC) lifespan could directly reflect the degree of hemolysis. In the present cohort of 23 patients with HS, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Levitt's carbon monoxide (CO) breath test to investigate the potential genotype-degree of hemolysis correlation.In the present cohort, we identified 8 ANK1,9 SPTB,5 SLC4A1 and 1 SPTA1 mutations in 23 patients with HS, and the median RBC lifespan was 14(8-48) days. The median RBC lifespan of patients with ANK1, SPTB and SLC4A1 mutations was 13 (8-23), 13 (8-48) and 14 (12-39) days, respectively, with no statistically significant difference (P = 0.618). The median RBC lifespan of patients with missense, splice and nonsense/insertion/deletion mutations was 16.5 (8-48), 14 (11-40) and 13 (8-20) days, respectively, with no significant difference (P = 0.514). Similarly, we found no significant difference in the RBC lifespan of patients with mutations located in the spectrin-binding domain and the nonspectrin-binding domain [14 (8-18) vs. 12.5 (8-48) days, P = 0.959]. In terms of the composition of mutated genes, 25% of patients with mild hemolysis carried ANK1 or SPTA1 mutations, while 75% of patients with mild hemolysis carried SPTB or SLC4A1 mutations. In contrast, 46.7% of patients with severe hemolysis had ANK1 or SPTA1 mutations and 53.3% of patients with severe hemolysis had SPTB or SLC4A1 mutations. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of mutated genes between the two groups (P = 0.400).The present study is the first to investigate the potential association between genotype and degree of hemolysis in HS. The present findings indicated that there is no significant correlation between genotype and degree of hemolysis in HS.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be engineered to bind biomolecules efficiently and differentially. Cross-reactive sensor arrays have high sensitivity for sensing proteins using differential interactions between sensor elements and bioanalytes. A new sensor array was fabricated using surface-charged AuNPs with dyes supramolecularly encapsulated into the AuNP monolayer. The fluorescence of dyes is partially quenched by the AuNPs and can be restored or further quenched due to the differential interactions between AuNPs with proteins. This sensing system enables the discrimination of proteins in both buffer and human serum, providing a potential tool for real-world disease diagnostics."
"37261347","The role of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosome in epigenetic modifications in inflammatory diseases.","Front Immunol","Epigenetic modification is a complex process of reversible and heritable alterations in gene function, and the combination of epigenetic and metabolic alterations is recognized as an important causative factor in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), osteoarthritis (OA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and even tumors. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) and MSC-derived exosome (MSC-EXO) are widely studied in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, where they appear to be promising therapeutic agents, partly through the potent regulation of epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and expression of regulatory non-coding RNAs, which affects the occurrence and development of inflammatory diseases. In this review, we summarize the current research on the role of MSC-EXO in inflammatory diseases through their modulation of epigenetic modifications and discuss its potential application in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2023 Zhao, Zhang, Ocansey, Wang and Mao."
"37277399","Cell-attribute aware community detection improves differential abundance testing from single-cell RNA-Seq data.","Nat Commun","Variations of cell-type proportions within tissues could be informative of biological aging and disease risk. Single-cell RNA-sequencing offers the opportunity to detect such differential abundance patterns, yet this task can be statistically challenging due to the noise in single-cell data, inter-sample variability and because such patterns are often of small effect size. Here we present a differential abundance testing paradigm called ELVAR that uses cell attribute aware clustering when inferring differentially enriched communities within the single-cell manifold. Using simulated and real single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq datasets, we benchmark ELVAR against an analogous algorithm that uses Louvain for clustering, as well as local neighborhood-based methods, demonstrating that ELVAR improves the sensitivity to detect cell-type composition shifts in relation to aging, precancerous states and Covid-19 phenotypes. In effect, leveraging cell attribute information when inferring cell communities can denoise single-cell data, avoid the need for batch correction and help retrieve more robust cell states for subsequent differential abundance testing. ELVAR is available as an open-source R-package.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Yet, studies typically capture only a limited number of donors and disagree on cell type definitions. Integrating many single-cell datasets can address these limitations of individual studies and capture the variability present in the population. Here we present the integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA), combining 49 datasets of the human respiratory system into a single atlas spanning over 2.4 million cells from 486 individuals. The HLCA presents a consensus cell type re-annotation with matching marker genes, including annotations of rare and previously undescribed cell types. Leveraging the number and diversity of individuals in the HLCA, we identify gene modules that are associated with demographic covariates such as age, sex and body mass index, as well as gene modules changing expression along the proximal-to-distal axis of the bronchial tree. Mapping new data to the HLCA enables rapid data annotation and interpretation. Using the HLCA as a reference for the study of disease, we identify shared cell states across multiple lung diseases, including SPP1+profibrotic monocyte-derived macrophages in COVID-19, pulmonary fibrosis and lung carcinoma. Overall, the HLCA serves as an example for the development and use of large-scale, cross-dataset organ atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Previous genetic studies have largely focused on insulin resistance in the fasting state, where hepatic insulin action dominates. Here we studied genetic variants influencing insulin levels measured 2 h after a glucose challenge in >55,000 participants from three ancestry groups. We identified ten new loci (P < 5 × 10-8) not previously associated with postchallenge insulin resistance, eight of which were shown to share their genetic architecture with type 2 diabetes in colocalization analyses. We investigated candidate genes at a subset of associated loci in cultured cells and identified nine candidate genes newly implicated in the expression or trafficking of GLUT4, the key glucose transporter in postprandial glucose uptake in muscle and fat. By focusing on postprandial insulin resistance, we highlighted the mechanisms of action at type 2 diabetes loci that are not adequately captured by studies of fasting glycemic traits.© 2023.

"37258574","Leveraging genetic overlap between irritability and psychiatric disorders to identify genetic variants of major psychiatric disorders.","Exp Mol Med","Irritability is a heritable core mental trait associated with several psychiatric illnesses. However, the genomic basis of irritability is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to 1) identify the genetic variants associated with irritability and investigate the associated biological pathways, genes, and tissues as well as single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability; 2) explore the relationships between irritability and various traits, including psychiatric disorders; and 3) identify additional and shared genetic variants for irritability and psychiatric disorders. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 379,506 European samples (105,975 cases and 273,531 controls) from the UK Biobank. We utilized various post-GWAS analyses, including linkage disequilibrium score regression, the bivariate causal mixture model (MiXeR), and conditional and conjunctional false discovery rate approaches. This GWAS identified 15 independent loci associated with irritability; the total SNP heritability estimate was 4.19%. Genetic correlations with psychiatric disorders were most pronounced for major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar II disorder (BD II). MiXeR analysis revealed polygenic overlap with schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar I disorder (BD I), and MDD. Conditional false discovery rate analyses identified additional loci associated with SCZ (number [n] of additional SNPs = 105), BD I (n = 54), MDD (n = 107), and irritability (n = 157). Conjunctional false discovery rate analyses identified 85, 41, and 198 shared loci between irritability and SCZ, BD I, and MDD, respectively. Multiple genetic loci were associated with irritability and three main psychiatric disorders. Given that irritability is a cross-disorder trait, these findings may help to elucidate the genomics of psychiatric disorders.© 2023. The Author(s)."

It uses gene-level GWAS-derived data and gene expression data to train a model for the identification of disease risk genes and relevant cell types. Gene prioritization information is then coupled with known drug target data to search for applicable drug agents based on their estimated functional effects on the identified risk genes. We illustrate the utility of our approach in different settings: identification of the cell types, implicated in disease pathogenesis, was tested in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Alzheimer disease (AD); gene target and drug prioritization was tested in IBD and schizophrenia. The analysis of phenotypes with known disease-affected cell types and/or existing drug candidates shows that GCDPipe is an effective tool to unify genetic risk factors with cellular context and known drug targets. Next, analysis of the AD data with GCDPipe suggested that gene targets of diuretics, as an Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical drug subgroup, are significantly enriched among the genes prioritized by GCDPipe, indicating their possible effect on the course of the disease.© 2023 The Authors."
"37216417","Transcriptome-wide gene-gene interaction associations elucidate pathways and functional enrichment of complex traits.","PLoS Genet","It remains unknown to what extent gene-gene interactions contribute to complex traits. Here, we introduce a new approach using predicted gene expression to perform exhaustive transcriptome-wide interaction studies (TWISs) for multiple traits across all pairs of genes expressed in several tissue types. Using imputed transcriptomes, we simultaneously reduce the computational challenge and improve interpretability and statistical power. We discover (in the UK Biobank) and replicate (in independent cohorts) several interaction associations, and find several hub genes with numerous interactions. We also demonstrate that TWIS can identify novel associated genes because genes with many or strong interactions have smaller single-locus model effect sizes. Finally, we develop a method to test gene set enrichment of TWIS associations (E-TWIS), finding numerous pathways and networks enriched in interaction associations. Epistasis is may be widespread, and our procedure represents a tractable framework for beginning to explore gene interactions and identify novel genomic targets.Copyright: © 2023 Evans et al.

"37293293","Network medicine: facilitating a new view on complex diseases.","Front Bioinform","Complex diseases are prevalent medical conditions which are characterized by inter-patient heterogeneity with regards to symptom profiles, disease trajectory, comorbidities, and treatment response. Their pathophysiology involves a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychosocial factors. The intricacies of complex diseases, encompassing different levels of biological organization in the context of environmental and psychosocial factors, makes them difficult to study, understand, prevent, and treat. The field of network medicine has progressed our understanding of these complex mechanisms and highlighted mechanistic overlap between diagnoses as well as patterns of symptom co-occurrence. These observations call into question the traditional conception of complex diseases, where diagnoses are treated as distinct entities, and prompts us to reconceptualize our nosological models. Thus, this manuscript presents a novel model, in which the individual disease burden is determined as a function of molecular, physiological, and pathological factors simultaneously, and represented as a state vector. In this conceptualization the focus shifts from identifying the underlying pathophysiology of diagnosis cohorts towards identifying symptom-determining traits in individual patients. This conceptualization facilitates a multidimensional approach to understanding human physiology and pathophysiology in the context of complex diseases. This may provide a useful concept to address both the significant interindividual heterogeneity of diagnose cohorts as well as the lack of clear distinction between diagnoses, health, and disease, thus facilitating the progression towards personalized medicine.Copyright © 2023 Cvijovic and Polster."
"37286935","Evaluating the mouse neural precursor line, SN4741, as a suitable proxy for midbrain dopaminergic neurons.","BMC Genomics","To overcome the ethical and technical limitations of in vivo human disease models, the broader scientific community frequently employs model organism-derived cell lines to investigate disease mechanisms, pathways, and therapeutic strategies. Despite the widespread use of certain in vitro models, many still lack contemporary genomic analysis supporting their use as a proxy for the affected human cells and tissues. Consequently, it is imperative to determine how accurately and effectively any proposed biological surrogate may reflect the biological processes it is assumed to model. One such cellular surrogate of human disease is the established mouse neural precursor cell line, SN4741, which has been used to elucidate mechanisms of neurotoxicity in Parkinson disease for over 25 years. Here, we are using a combination of classic and contemporary genomic techniques - karyotyping, RT-qPCR, single cell RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and ATAC-seq - to characterize the transcriptional landscape, chromatin landscape, and genomic architecture of this cell line, and evaluate its suitability as a proxy for midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the study of Parkinson disease. We find that SN4741 cells possess an unstable triploidy and consistently exhibits low expression of dopaminergic neuron markers across assays, even when the cell line is shifted to the non-permissive temperature that drives differentiation. The transcriptional signatures of SN4741 cells suggest that they are maintained in an undifferentiated state at the permissive temperature and differentiate into immature neurons at the non-permissive temperature; however, they may not be dopaminergic neuron precursors, as previously suggested. Additionally, the chromatin landscapes of SN4741 cells, in both the differentiated and undifferentiated states, are not concordant with the open chromatin profiles of ex vivo, mouse E15.5 forebrain- or midbrain-derived dopaminergic neurons. Overall, our data suggest that SN4741 cells may reflect early aspects of neuronal differentiation but are likely not a suitable proxy for dopaminergic neurons as previously thought. The implications of this study extend broadly, illuminating the need for robust biological and genomic rationale underpinning the use of in vitro models of molecular processes.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37264206","Genetically adjusted PSA levels for prostate cancer screening.","Nat Med","Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer remains controversial because it increases overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignificant tumors. Accounting for genetic determinants of constitutive, non-cancer-related PSA variation has potential to improve screening utility. In this study, we discovered 128 genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 × 10-8) in a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of 95,768 men and developed a PSA polygenic score (PGSPSA) that explains 9.61% of constitutive PSA variation. We found that, in men of European ancestry, using PGS-adjusted PSA would avoid up to 31% of negative prostate biopsies but also result in 12% fewer biopsies in patients with prostate cancer, mostly with Gleason score <7 tumors. Genetically adjusted PSA was more predictive of aggressive prostate cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 3.44, P = 6.2 × 10-14, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.755) than unadjusted PSA (OR = 3.31, P = 1.1 × 10-12, AUC = 0.738) in 106 cases and 23,667 controls. Compared to a prostate cancer PGS alone (AUC = 0.712), including genetically adjusted PSA improved detection of aggressive disease (AUC = 0.786, P = 7.2 × 10-4). Our findings highlight the potential utility of incorporating PGS for personalized biomarkers in prostate cancer screening.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37264201","Single-cell dissection of aggression in honeybee colonies.","Nat Ecol Evol","Understanding how genotypic variation results in phenotypic variation is especially difficult for collective behaviour because group phenotypes arise from complex interactions among group members. A genome-wide association study identified hundreds of genes associated with colony-level variation in honeybee aggression, many of which also showed strong signals of positive selection, but the influence of these 'colony aggression genes' on brain function was unknown. Here we use single-cell (sc) transcriptomics and gene regulatory network (GRN) analyses to test the hypothesis that genetic variation for colony aggression influences individual differences in brain gene expression and/or gene regulation. We compared soldiers, which respond to territorial intrusion with stinging attacks, and foragers, which do not. Colony environment showed stronger influences on soldier-forager differences in brain gene regulation compared with brain gene expression. GRN plasticity was strongly associated with colony aggression, with larger differences in GRN dynamics detected between soldiers and foragers from more aggressive relative to less aggressive colonies. The regulatory dynamics of subnetworks composed of genes associated with colony aggression genes were more strongly correlated with each other across different cell types and brain regions relative to other genes, especially in brain regions involved with olfaction and vision and multimodal sensory integration, which are known to mediate bee aggression. These results show how group genetics can shape a collective phenotype by modulating individual brain gene regulatory network architecture.© 2023.

"37214854","Decreasing LTP2 expression increases phenotypic variation in early seedling traits of Arabidopsis thaliana.","bioRxiv","Isogenic individuals can display seemingly stochastic phenotypic differences, limiting the accuracy of genotype-to-phenotype predictions. The extent of this phenotypic variation depends in part on genetic background, raising questions about the genes involved in controlling stochastic phenotypic variation. Focusing on early seedling traits in Arabidopsisthaliana, we found that hypomorphs of the cuticle-related geneLTP2greatly increased variation in seedling phenotypes, including hypocotyl length, gravitropism and cuticle permeability. Manyltp2hypocotyls were significantly shorter than wild-type hypocotyls while others resembled the wild type. Differences in epidermal properties and gene expression betweenltp2seedlings with long and short hypocotyls suggest a loss of cuticle integrity as the primary determinant of the observed phenotypic variation. We identified environmental conditions that reveal or mask the increased variation inltp2hypomorphs, and found that increased expression of its closest paralogLTP1is necessary forltp2phenotypes. Our results illustrate how decreased expression of a single gene can generate starkly increased phenotypic variation in isogenic individuals in response to an environmental challenge."

In this study, we aimed to explore the origin of LCSCs and the role of the TOP2A/β-catenin/YAP1 axis in tumor stemness and progression. Using single-cell RNA-seq analysis, we identifiedTOP2A+CENPF+LCSCs, which were mainly regulated byCD168+M2-like macrophages. Furthermore, spatial location analysis and fluorescent staining confirmed that LCSCs were enriched at tumor margins, constituting the spatial heterogeneity of HCC. Mechanistically, TOP2A competitively binds to β-catenin, leading to disassociation of β-catenin from YAP1, promoting HCC stemness and overgrowth. Our study provides valuable insights into the spatial transcriptome heterogeneity of the HCC microenvironment and the critical role of TOP2A/β-catenin/YAP1 axis in HCC stemness and progression.© 2023 The Authors."

"37214934","CpG island turnover events predict evolutionary changes in enhancer activity.","bioRxiv","Genetic changes that modify the function of transcriptional enhancers have been linked to the evolution of biological diversity across species. Multiple studies have focused on the role of nucleotide substitutions, transposition, and insertions and deletions in altering enhancer function. Here we show that turnover of CpG islands (CGIs), which contribute to enhancer activation, is broadly associated with changes in enhancer activity across mammals, including humans. We integrated maps of CGIs and enhancer activity-associated histone modifications obtained from multiple tissues in nine mammalian species and found that CGI content in enhancers was strongly associated with increased histone modification levels. CGIs showed widespread turnover across species and species-specific CGIs were strongly enriched for enhancers exhibiting species-specific activity across all tissues and species we examined. Genes associated with enhancers with species-specific CGIs showed concordant biases in their expression, supporting that CGI turnover contributes to gene regulatory innovation. Our results also implicate CGI turnover in the evolution of Human Gain Enhancers (HGEs), which show increased activity in human embryonic development and may have contributed to the evolution of uniquely human traits. Using a humanized mouse model, we show that a highly conserved HGE with a large CGI absent from the mouse ortholog shows increased activity at the human CGI in the humanized mouse diencephalon. Collectively, our results point to CGI turnover as a mechanism driving gene regulatory changes potentially underlying trait evolution in mammals."

The degree of change in NLR values before and after surgery (delta-NLR) can represent the inflammatory response induced by surgery and serve as a meaningful prognostic biomarker in surgical patients; however, this has not been well investigated. We aimed to investigate the predictive value of the perioperative NLR and delta-NLR for outcomes of off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery by evaluating ""days alive and out of hospital (DAOH)"", a novel patient-centered outcome.In this single-center retrospective study, perioperative data, including NLR data, from 1322 patients were analyzed. The primary endpoint was DOAH at 90 days postoperatively (DAOH 90), and the secondary endpoint was long-term mortality. Linear regression analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to identify independent risk factors for the endpoints. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to assess long-term mortality.The median NLR values significantly increased from 2.2 (1.6-3.1) at baseline to 7.4 (5.4-10.3) postoperatively, with median delta-NLR values of 5.0 (3.2-7.6). Preoperative NLR and delta-NLR were independent risk factors for short DAOH 90 in the linear regression analysis. In Cox regression analysis, delta-NLR, but not preoperative NLR, was an independent risk factor for long-term mortality. When patients were divided into two groups according to delta-NLR, the high delta-NLR group had a shorter DAOH 90 than the low delta-NLR group. Kaplan-Meier curves showed higher long-term mortality in the high delta-NLR group than in the low delta-NLR group.In OPCAB patients, preoperative NLR and delta-NLR were significantly associated with DAOH 90, and delta-NLR was an independent risk factor for long-term mortality, indicating their role in risk assessment, which is essential for perioperative management.© 2023 Bae et al."

These infections were shown to be accompanied by immune dysregulation. We aimed to test whether the admission neutrophil-to-leukocyte ratio, a marker of an aberrant immune response, can predict adverse outcome.We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of RSV patients admitted to the Tel Aviv Medical Center from January 2010 to October 2020d. Laboratory, demographic and clinical parameters were collected. Two-way analysis of variance was used to test the association between neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) values and poor outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied to test the discrimination ability of NLR.In total, 482 RSV patients (median age 79 years, 248 [51%] females) were enrolled. There was a significant interaction between a poor clinical outcome and a sequential rise in NLR levels (positive delta NLR). The ROC curve analysis revealed an area under curve (AUC) of poor outcomes for delta NLR of (0.58). Using a cut-off of delta = 0 (the second NLR is equal to the first NLR value), multivariate logistic regression identified a rise in NLR (delta NLR>0) as being a prognostic factor for poor clinical outcome, after adjusting for age, sex and Charlson comorbidity score, with an odds ratio of 1.914 (P = 0.014) and a total AUC of 0.63.A rise in NLR levels within the first 48 h of hospital admission can serve as a prognostic marker for adverse outcome.© 2023 The Authors."
"37277361","Long-read direct RNA sequencing reveals epigenetic regulation of chimeric gene-transposon transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana.","Nat Commun","Transposable elements (TEs) are accumulated in both intergenic and intragenic regions in plant genomes. Intragenic TEs often act as regulatory elements of associated genes and are also co-transcribed with genes, generating chimeric TE-gene transcripts. Despite the potential impact on mRNA regulation and gene function, the prevalence and transcriptional regulation of TE-gene transcripts are poorly understood. By long-read direct RNA sequencing and a dedicated bioinformatics pipeline, ParasiTE, we investigated the transcription and RNA processing of TE-gene transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified a global production of TE-gene transcripts in thousands of A. thaliana gene loci, with TE sequences often being associated with alternative transcription start sites or transcription termination sites. The epigenetic state of intragenic TEs affects RNAPII elongation and usage of alternative poly(A) signals within TE sequences, regulating alternative TE-gene isoform production. Co-transcription and inclusion of TE-derived sequences into gene transcripts impact regulation of RNA stability and environmental responses of some loci. Our study provides insights into TE-gene interactions that contributes to mRNA regulation, transcriptome diversity, and environmental responses in plants.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Protease serine 3 (PRSS3), possessing four splice variants (PRSS3-SVs;PRSS3-V1-V4), is an indispensable trypsin that shows paradoxical effects on cancer development. Here, we found thatPRSS3transcripts and their isoforms were divergently expressed in lung cancer, exhibiting opposing functions and clinical outcomes, namely, oncogenic PRSS3-V1 and PRSS3-V2versustumor-suppressive PRSS3-V3, by targeting different downstream genes. We identified an intragenic CpG island (iCpGI) inPRSS3. Hypermethylation of iCpGI was mediated by UHRF1/DNMT1 complex interference with the binding of myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) to regulatePRSS3transcription. The garlic-derived compound diallyl trisulfide cooperated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine to exert antitumor effects in lung adenocarcinoma cells through site-specific iCpGI demethylation specifically allowing MZF1 to upregulatePRSS3-V3expression. Epigenetic silencing ofPRSS3-V3 viaiCpGI methylation (iCpGIm) in BALF and tumor tissues was associated with early clinical progression in patients with lung cancer but not in those with squamous cell carcinoma or inflammatory disease. Thus, UHRF1/DNMT1-MZF1 axis-modulated site-specific iCpGIm regulates divergent expression ofPRSS3-SVs, conferring nongenetic functional ITH, with implications for early detection of lung cancer and targeted therapies.© 2023 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

"37154769","The SETD2 Methyltransferase Supports Productive HPV31 Replication through the LEDGF/CtIP/Rad51 Pathway.","J Virol","The human papillomavirus (HPV) life cycle takes place in the stratified epithelium, with the productive phase being activated by epithelial differentiation. The HPV genome is histone-associated, and the life cycle is epigenetically regulated, in part, by histone tail modifications that facilitate the recruitment of DNA repair factors that are required for viral replication. We previously showed that the SETD2 methyltransferase facilitates the productive replication of HPV31 through the trimethylation of H3K36 on viral chromatin. SETD2 regulates numerous cellular processes, including DNA repair via homologous recombination (HR) and alternative splicing, through the recruitment of various effectors to histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3). We previously demonstrated that the HR factor Rad51 is recruited to HPV31 genomes and is required for productive replication; however, the mechanism of Rad51 recruitment has not been defined. SET domain containing 2 (SETD2) promotes the HR repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in actively transcribed genes through the recruitment of carboxy-terminal binding protein (CtBP)-interacting protein (CtIP) to lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)-bound H3K36me3, which promotes DNA end resection and thereby allows for the recruitment of Rad51 to damaged sites. In this study, we found that reducing H3K36me3 through the depletion of SETD2 or the overexpression of an H3.3K36M mutant leads to an increase in γH2AX, which is a marker of damage, on viral DNA upon epithelial differentiation. This is coincident with decreased Rad51 binding. Additionally, LEDGF and CtIP are bound to HPV DNA in a SETD2-dependent and H3K36me3-dependent manner, and they are required for productive replication. Furthermore, CtIP depletion increases DNA damage on viral DNA and blocks Rad51 recruitment upon differentiation. Overall, these studies indicate that H3K36me3 enrichment on transcriptionally active viral genes promotes the rapid repair of viral DNA upon differentiation through the LEDGF-CtIP-Rad51 axis.IMPORTANCEThe productive phase of the HPV life cycle is restricted to the differentiating cells of the stratified epithelium. The HPV genome is histone-associated and subject to epigenetic regulation, though the manner in which epigenetic modifications contribute to productive replication is largely undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that SETD2-mediated H3K36me3 on HPV31 chromatin promotes productive replication through the repair of damaged DNA. We show that SETD2 facilitates the recruitment of the homologous recombination repair factors CtIP and Rad51 to viral DNA through LEDGF binding to H3K36me3. CtIP is recruited to damaged viral DNA upon differentiation, and, in turn, recruits Rad51. This likely occurs through the end resection of double-strand breaks. SETD2 trimethylates H3K36me3 during transcription, and active transcription is necessary for Rad51 recruitment to viral DNA. We propose that the enrichment of SETD2-mediated H3K36me3 on transcriptionally active viral genes upon differentiation facilitates the repair of damaged viral DNA during the productive phase of the viral life cycle."
"37251669","Dose-response association of Chinese visceral adiposity index with comorbidity of hypertension and diabetes mellitus among elderly people.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Chinese visceral adiposity index (CVAI) is a reliable indicator of visceral obesity, but little is known about the association of CVAI with comorbidity of hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM). This study aimed to explore the associations of CVAI with HTN-DM comorbidity, HTN or DM, HTN, and DM in elderly people and evaluate the mediating role of insulin resistance in the associations.A total of 3,316 Chinese participants aged ≥60 years were included in this cross-sectional study. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Restricted cubic splines were applied to explore the dose-response associations. Mediation analyses were used to assess the mediating effect of triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index in the associations.The prevalence rate of HTN-DM comorbidity, HTN or DM, HTN, and DM was 13.78%, 72.26%, 67.16%, and 18.88%, respectively. Linear associations between CVAI and HTN-DM comorbidity, HTN or DM, HTN, and DM were found, and ORs (95%CIs) were 1.45 (1.30-1.61), 1.39 (1.28-1.52), 1.36 (1.25-1.48), and 1.28 (1.16-1.41) for per SD increase in CVAI. Compared with quartile 1 of CVAI, the risk of HTN-DM comorbidity, HTN or DM, HTN, and DM increased 190%, 125%, 112%, and 96% for quartile 4. In addition, we found TyG index playing a key role in the associations of CVAI with HTN-DM comorbidity, HTN or DM, and DM.CVAI is linearly and positively correlated with HTN-DM comorbidity, HTN or DM, HTN, and DM. The potential mechanism is insulin resistance largely mediating the associations.Copyright © 2023 Ren, Cheng, Qie, Han, Kong, Yan, Li, Li and Lei."
"37216410","Canonical correlation analysis for multi-omics: Application to cross-cohort analysis.","PLoS Genet","Integrative approaches that simultaneously model multi-omics data have gained increasing popularity because they provide holistic system biology views of multiple or all components in a biological system of interest. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a correlation-based integrative method designed to extract latent features shared between multiple assays by finding the linear combinations of features-referred to as canonical variables (CVs)-within each assay that achieve maximal across-assay correlation. Although widely acknowledged as a powerful approach for multi-omics data, CCA has not been systematically applied to multi-omics data in large cohort studies, which has only recently become available. Here, we adapted sparse multiple CCA (SMCCA), a widely-used derivative of CCA, to proteomics and methylomics data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Jackson Heart Study (JHS). To tackle challenges encountered when applying SMCCA to MESA and JHS, our adaptations include the incorporation of the Gram-Schmidt (GS) algorithm with SMCCA to improve orthogonality among CVs, and the development of Sparse Supervised Multiple CCA (SSMCCA) to allow supervised integration analysis for more than two assays. Effective application of SMCCA to the two real datasets reveals important findings. Applying our SMCCA-GS to MESA and JHS, we identified strong associations between blood cell counts and protein abundance, suggesting that adjustment of blood cell composition should be considered in protein-based association studies. Importantly, CVs obtained from two independent cohorts also demonstrate transferability across the cohorts. For example, proteomic CVs learned from JHS, when transferred to MESA, explain similar amounts of blood cell count phenotypic variance in MESA, explaining 39.0% ~ 50.0% variation in JHS and 38.9% ~ 49.1% in MESA. Similar transferability was observed for other omics-CV-trait pairs. This suggests that biologically meaningful and cohort-agnostic variation is captured by CVs. We anticipate that applying our SMCCA-GS and SSMCCA on various cohorts would help identify cohort-agnostic biologically meaningful relationships between multi-omics data and phenotypic traits.Copyright: © 2023 Jiang et al.

"37293664","Relationship between cognitive dysfunction and the promoter methylation of PER1 and CRY1 in patients with cerebral small vessel disease.","Front Aging Neurosci","The prevalence of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is increasing due to the accelerating global aging process, resulting in a substantial burden on all countries, as cognitive dysfunction associated with CSVD is also on the rise. Clock genes have a significant impact on cognitive decline and dementia. Furthermore, the pattern of DNA methylation in clock genes is strongly associated with cognitive impairment. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the connection between DNA promoter methylation of PER1 and CRY1 and cognitive dysfunction in patients with CSVD.We recruited patients with CSVD admitted to the Geriatrics Department of the Lianyungang Second People's Hospital between March 2021 and June 2022. Based on their Mini-Mental State Examination score, patients were categorized into two groups: 65 cases with cognitive dysfunction and 36 cases with normal cognitive function. Clinical data, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring parameters, and CSVD total load scores were collected. Moreover, we employed methylation-specific PCR to analyze the peripheral blood promoter methylation levels of clock genes PER1 and CRY1 in all CSVD patients who were enrolled. Finally, we used binary logistic regression models to assess the association between the promoter methylation of clock genes (PER1 and CRY1) and cognitive dysfunction in patients with CSVD.(1) A total of 101 individuals with CSVD were included in this study. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in baseline clinical data except MMSE and AD8 scores. (2) After B/H correction, the promoter methylation rate of PER1 was higher in the cognitive dysfunction group than that in the normal group, and the difference was statistically significant (adjustedp< 0.001). (3) There was no significant correlation between the promoter methylation rates of PER1 and CRY1 in peripheral blood and circadian rhythm of blood pressure (p > 0.05). (4) Binary logistic regression models showed that the influence of promoter methylation of PER1 and CRY1 on cognitive dysfunction were statistically significant in Model 1 (p< 0.001;p= 0.025), and it still existed after adjusting for confounding factors in Model 2. Patients with the promoter methylation of PER1 gene (OR= 16.565, 95%CI, 4.057-67.628;p< 0.001) and the promoter methylation of CRY1 gene (OR= 6.017, 95%CI, 1.290-28.069;p= 0.022) were at greater risk of cognitive dysfunction compared with those with unmethylated promoters of corresponding genes in Model 2.The promoter methylation rate of PER1 gene was higher in the cognitive dysfunction group among CSVD patients. And the hypermethylation of the promoters of clock genes PER1 and CRY1 may be involved in affecting cognitive dysfunction in patients with CSVD.Copyright © 2023 Xu, Wang, Jiang, Liu, Zhong, Ge, Sun and Shen."
"37260510","Refining the genomic determinants underlying escape from X-chromosome inactivation.","NAR Genom Bioinform","X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) epigenetically silences one X chromosome in every cell in female mammals. Although the majority of X-linked genes are silenced, in humans 20% or more are able to escape inactivation and continue to be expressed. Such escape genes are important contributors to sex differences in gene expression, and may impact the phenotypes of X aneuploidies; yet the mechanisms regulating escape from XCI are not understood. We have performed an enrichment analysis of transcription factor binding on the X chromosome, providing new evidence for enriched factors at the transcription start sites of escape genes. The top escape-enriched transcription factors were detected at theRPS4Xpromoter, a well-described human escape gene previously demonstrated to escape from XCI in a transgenic mouse model. Using a cell line model system that allows for targeted integration and inactivation of transgenes on the mouse X chromosome, we further assessed combinations ofRPS4Xpromoter and genic elements for their ability to drive escape from XCI. We identified a small transgenic construct of only 6 kb capable of robust escape from XCI, establishing that gene-proximal elements are sufficient to permit escape, and highlighting the additive effect of multiple elements that work together in a context-specific fashion.© The Author(s) 2023.

However, new findings in recent years on the mechanisms of oxygen-sensing and epigenetic control underpin the multifaceted role of vitamin C in a biological context and have therefore renewed interest in it.

Here, we perform direct neuronal reprogramming of longitudinally collected human fibroblasts to reveal genetic pathways altered at different ages. Comparative transcriptome analysis of longitudinally aged striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), a primary neuronal subtype affected in Huntington's disease (HD), identified pathways associated with RCAN1, a negative regulator of calcineurin. Notably, RCAN1 undergoes age-dependent increase at the protein level detected in reprogrammed MSNs as well as in human postmortem striatum. In patient-derived MSNs of adult-onset HD (HD-MSNs), counteractingRCAN1by gene knockdown (KD) rescued HD-MSNs from degeneration. The protective effect ofRCAN1KD was associated with enhanced chromatin accessibility of genes involved in longevity and autophagy, mediated through enhanced calcineurin activity, which in turn dephosphorylates and promotes nuclear localization of TFEB transcription factor. Furthermore, we reveal that G2-115 compound, an analog of glibenclamide with autophagy-enhancing activities, reduces the RCAN1-Calcineurin interaction, phenocopying the effect ofRCAN1KD. Our results demonstrate that RCAN1 is a potential genetic or pharmacological target whose reduction-of-function increases neuronal resilience to neurodegeneration in HD through chromatin reconfiguration."

Previous studies have indicated the association between treatment response and genetic and epigenetic factors, but no effective biomarkers have been identified. Hence, further research is imperative to enhance precision medicine in SCZ treatment.Participants with SCZ were recruited from two randomized trials. The discovery cohort was recruited from the CAPOC trial (n = 2307) involved 6 weeks of treatment and equally randomized the participants to the Olanzapine, Risperidone, Quetiapine, Aripiprazole, Ziprasidone, and Haloperidol/Perphenazine (subsequently equally assigned to one or the other) groups. The external validation cohort was recruited from the CAPEC trial (n = 1379), which involved 8 weeks of treatment and equally randomized the participants to the Olanzapine, Risperidone, and Aripiprazole groups. Additionally, healthy controls (n = 275) from the local community were utilized as a genetic/epigenetic reference. The genetic and epigenetic (DNA methylation) risks of SCZ were assessed using the polygenic risk score (PRS) and polymethylation score, respectively. The study also examined the genetic-epigenetic interactions with treatment response through differential methylation analysis, methylation quantitative trait loci, colocalization, and promoter-anchored chromatin interaction. Machine learning was used to develop a prediction model for treatment response, which was evaluated for accuracy and clinical benefit using the area under curve (AUC) for classification, R2for regression, and decision curve analysis.Six risk genes for SCZ (LINC01795, DDHD2, SBNO1, KCNG2, SEMA7A, and RUFY1) involved in cortical morphology were identified as having a genetic-epigenetic interaction associated with treatment response. The developed and externally validated prediction model, which incorporated clinical information, PRS, genetic risk score (GRS), and proxy methylation level (proxyDNAm), demonstrated positive benefits for a wide range of patients receiving different APDs, regardless of sex [discovery cohort: AUC = 0.874 (95% CI 0.867-0.881), R2 = 0.478; external validation cohort: AUC = 0.851 (95% CI 0.841-0.861), R2 = 0.507].This study presents a promising precision medicine approach to evaluate treatment response, which has the potential to aid clinicians in making informed decisions about APD treatment for patients with SCZ.

"37286599","Ultraviolet radiation shapes dendritic cell leukaemia transformation in the skin.","Nature","Tumours most often arise from progression of precursor clones within a single anatomical niche. In the bone marrow, clonal progenitors can undergo malignant transformation to acute leukaemia, or differentiate into immune cells that contribute to disease pathology in peripheral tissues1-4. Outside the marrow, these clones are potentially exposed to a variety of tissue-specific mutational processes, although the consequences of this are unclear. Here we investigate the development of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN)-an unusual form of acute leukaemia that often presents with malignant cells isolated to the skin5. Using tumour phylogenomics and single-cell transcriptomics with genotyping, we find that BPDCN arises from clonal (premalignant) haematopoietic precursors in the bone marrow. We observe that BPDCN skin tumours first develop at sun-exposed anatomical sites and are distinguished by clonally expanded mutations induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. A reconstruction of tumour phylogenies reveals that UV damage can precede the acquisition of alterations associated with malignant transformation, implicating sun exposure of plasmacytoid dendritic cells or committed precursors during BPDCN pathogenesis. Functionally, we find that loss-of-function mutations in Tet2, the most common premalignant alteration in BPDCN, confer resistance to UV-induced cell death in plasmacytoid, but not conventional, dendritic cells, suggesting a context-dependent tumour-suppressive role for TET2. These findings demonstrate how tissue-specific environmental exposures at distant anatomical sites can shape the evolution of premalignant clones to disseminated cancer.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37283742","Unveiling the interplay between mutational signatures and tumor microenvironment: a pan-cancer analysis.","Front Immunol","While recent studies have separately explored mutational signatures and the tumor microenvironment (TME), there is limited research on the associations of both factors in a pan-cancer context.We performed a pan-cancer analysis of over 8,000 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Machine learning methods were employed to systematically explore the relationship between mutational signatures and TME and develop a risk score based on TME-associated mutational signatures to predict patient survival outcomes. We also constructed an interaction model to explore how mutational signatures and TME interact and influence cancer prognosis.Our analysis revealed a varied association between mutational signatures and TME, with the Clock-like signature showing the most widespread influence. Risk scores based on mutational signatures mainly induced by Clock-like and AID/APOBEC activity exhibited strong pan-cancer survival stratification ability. We also propose a novel approach to predict transcriptome decomposed infiltration levels using genome-derived mutational signatures as an alternative approach for exploring TME cell types when transcriptome data are unavailable. Our comprehensive analysis revealed that certain mutational signatures and their interaction with immune cells significantly impact clinical outcomes in particular cancer types. For instance, T cell infiltration levels only served as a prognostic biomarker in melanoma patients with high ultraviolet radiation exposure, breast cancer patients with high homologous recombination deficiency signature, and lung adenocarcinoma patients with high tobacco-associated mutational signature.Our study comprehensively explains the complex interplay between mutational signatures and immune infiltration in cancer. The results highlight the importance of considering both mutational signatures and immune phenotypes in cancer research and their significant implications for developing personalized cancer treatments and more effective immunotherapy.Copyright © 2023 Luo, Li, Wei, Ma, Qian, Chen, Wang and Zhao."
"37288160","Casting shadows: later-life outcomes of stature.","Hist Fam","The central question in this special issue is a relatively new one in anthropometric history: how did body height affect the life course? This raises the issue of whether such an effect merely captures the underlying early-life conditions that impact growth, or whether some independent effect of stature can be discerned. Further, the effects of height on later-life outcomes need not be linear. These effects may also differ by gender, by context (time and place), and among life course domains such as occupational success, family formation or health in later life. The ten research articles in this issue use a plethora of historical sources on individuals, such as prison and hospital records, conscript records, genealogies and health surveys. These articles employ a variety of methods to distinguish between early-life and later-life effects, between intra- and intergenerational processes and between biological and socio-economic factors. Importantly, all articles discuss the impact of the specific context on their results to understand these effects. The overall conclusion is that independent later-life outcomes of height are rather ambiguous, and seem to stem more from the perception of physical strength, health and intelligence associated with height than from height itself. This special issue also reflects on intergenerational effects of the later-life outcomes of height. As populations have grown taller, it is possible that height and later-life outcomes have formed a 'virtuous cycle', resulting in taller, healthier and wealthier populations. So far, however, our research offers little support for this hypothesis.© 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Understanding dosage-sensitive processes requires tools to quantitatively modulate protein abundance. Here we present CasTuner, a CRISPR-based toolkit for analog tuning of endogenous gene expression. The system exploits Cas-derived repressors that are quantitatively tuned by ligand titration through a FKBP12F36Vdegron domain. CasTuner can be applied at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level using a histone deacetylase (hHDAC4) fused to dCas9, or the RNA-targeting CasRx, respectively. We demonstrate analog tuning of gene expression homogeneously across cells in mouse and human cells, as opposed to KRAB-dependent CRISPR-interference systems, which exhibit digital repression. Finally, we quantify the system's dynamics and use it to measure dose-response relationships of NANOG and OCT4 with their target genes and with the cellular phenotype. CasTuner thus provides an easy-to-implement tool to study dose-responsive processes in their physiological context.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Yet the development of new light-switchable protein variants remains challenging, and the field still lacks general approaches to engineering or discovering protein variants with light-switchable biological functions. Here, we adapt strategies for protein domain insertion and mammalian-cell expression to generate and screen a library of candidate optogenetic tools directly in mammalian cells. The approach is based on insertion of the AsLOV2 photoswitchable domain at all possible positions in a candidate protein of interest, introduction of the library into mammalian cells, and light/dark selection for variants with photoswitchable activity. We demonstrate the approach's utility using the Gal4-VP64 transcription factor as a model system. Our resulting LightsOut transcription factor exhibits a > 150-fold change in transcriptional activity between dark and blue light conditions. We show that light-switchable function generalizes to analogous insertion sites in two additional Cys6Zn2 and C2H2 zinc finger domains, providing a starting point for optogenetic regulation of a broad class of transcription factors. Our approach can streamline the identification of single-protein optogenetic switches, particularly in cases where structural or biochemical knowledge is limited.© 2023. The Author(s)."

A naturally occurring toggle switch underlies fate decisions toward either nucleolar or mitochondrial decline during the aging of yeast cells. We rewired this endogenous toggle to engineer an autonomous genetic clock that generates sustained oscillations between the nucleolar and mitochondrial aging processes in individual cells. These oscillations increased cellular life span through the delay of the commitment to aging that resulted from either the loss of chromatin silencing or the depletion of heme. Our results establish a connection between gene network architecture and cellular longevity that could lead to rationally designed gene circuits that slow aging."

In this study, 108 855 participants were enrolled, including 12 026 headache cases from the Taiwan Biobank. For broadly defined headache phenotype, we identified a locus on Chromosome 17, with the lead single-nucleotide polymorphism rs8072917 (odds ratio 1.08,P= 4.49 × 10-8), mapped to two protein-coding genesRNF213andENDOV. For severe headache phenotype, we found a strong association on Chromosome 8, with the lead single-nucleotide polymorphism rs13272202 (odds ratio 1.30,P= 1.02 × 10-9), mapped to geneRP11-1101K5.1. We then conducted a conditional analysis and a statistical fine-mapping of the broadly defined headache-associatedlociand identified a single credible set oflociwith rs8072917 supporting that this lead variant was the true causal variant onRNF213gene region.RNF213replicated the result of previous studies and played important roles in the biological mechanism of broadly defined headache. On the basis of the previous results found in the Taiwan Biobank, we conducted phenome-wide association studies for the lead variants using data from the UK Biobank and found that the causal variant (single-nucleotide polymorphism rs8072917) was associated with muscle symptoms, cellulitis and abscess of face and neck, and cardiogenic shock. Our findings foster the genetic architecture of headache in individuals of East Asian ancestry.

Two overlapping phenotype groups were selected for examination, namely, preeclampsia and preeclampsia or other maternal hypertension during pregnancy. Data from the Finnish Genetics of Pre-eclampsia Consortium (FINNPEC, 1990-2011), Finnish FinnGen project (1964-2019), Estonian Biobank (1997-2019), and the previously published InterPregGen consortium GWAS were combined. Individuals with preeclampsia or other maternal hypertension during pregnancy and control individuals were selected from the cohorts based on relevant International Classification of Diseases codes. Data were analyzed from July 2020 to February 2023.The association of a genome-wide set of genetic variants and clinical risk factors was analyzed for the 2 phenotypes.A total of 16 743 women with prior preeclampsia and 15 200 with preeclampsia or other maternal hypertension during pregnancy were obtained from FINNPEC, FinnGen, Estonian Biobank, and the InterPregGen consortium study (respective mean [SD] ages at diagnosis: 30.3 [5.5], 28.7 [5.6], 29.7 [7.0], and 28 [not available] years). The analysis found 19 genome-wide significant associations, 13 of which were novel. Seven of the novel loci harbor genes previously associated with blood pressure traits (NPPA, NPR3, PLCE1, TNS2, FURIN, RGL3, and PREX1). In line with this, the 2 study phenotypes showed genetic correlation with blood pressure traits. In addition, novel risk loci were identified in the proximity of genes involved in the development of placenta (PGR, TRPC6, ACTN4, and PZP), remodeling of uterine spiral arteries (NPPA, NPPB, NPR3, and ACTN4), kidney function (PLCE1, TNS2, ACTN4, and TRPC6), and maintenance of proteostasis in pregnancy serum (PZP).The findings indicate that genes related to blood pressure traits are associated with preeclampsia, but many of these genes have additional pleiotropic effects on cardiometabolic, endothelial, and placental function. Furthermore, several of the associated loci have no known connection with cardiovascular disease but instead harbor genes contributing to maintenance of successful pregnancy, with dysfunctions leading to preeclampsialike symptoms."

Potential host factors that accompany greater risk from COVID-19 have been sought and schizophrenia (SCZ) patients seem to present more severe COVID-19 than control counterparts, with certain gene expression similarities between psychiatric and COVID-19 patients reported. We used summary statistics from the last SCZ, bipolar disorder (BD), and depression (DEP) meta-analyses available on the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium webpage to calculate polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for a target sample of 11,977 COVID-19 cases and 5943 subjects with unknown COVID-19 status. Linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) regression analysis was performed when positive associations were obtained from the PRS analysis. The SCZ PRS was a significant predictor in the case/control, symptomatic/asymptomatic, and hospitalization/no hospitalization analyses in the total and female samples; and of symptomatic/asymptomatic status in men. No significant associations were found for the BD or DEP PRS or in the LDSC regression analysis. SNP-based genetic risk for SCZ, but not for BD or DEP, may be associated with higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity, especially among women; however, predictive accuracy barely exceeded chance level. We believe that the inclusion of sexual loci and rare variations in the analysis of genomic overlap between SCZ and COVID-19 will help to elucidate the genetic commonalities between these conditions.© 2023.

"37277458","The genetics of a ""femaleness/maleness"" score in cardiometabolic traits in the UK biobank.","Sci Rep","We recently devised continuous ""sex-scores"" that sum up multiple quantitative traits, weighted by their respective sex-difference effect sizes, as an approach to estimating polyphenotypic ""maleness/femaleness"" within each binary sex. To identify the genetic architecture underlying these sex-scores, we conducted sex-specific genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in the UK Biobank cohort (females: n = 161,906; males: n = 141,980). As a control, we also conducted GWASs of sex-specific ""sum-scores"", simply aggregating the same traits, without weighting by sex differences. Among GWAS-identified genes, while sum-score genes were enriched for genes differentially expressed in the liver in both sexes, sex-score genes were enriched for genes differentially expressed in the cervix and across brain tissues, particularly for females. We then considered single nucleotide polymorphisms with significantly different effects (sdSNPs) between the sexes for sex-scores and sum-scores, mapping to male-dominant and female-dominant genes. Here, we identified brain-related enrichment for sex-scores, especially for male-dominant genes; these findings were present but weaker for sum-scores. Genetic correlation analyses of sex-biased diseases indicated that both sex-scores and sum-scores were associated with cardiometabolic, immune, and psychiatric disorders.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37268996","Modeling the longitudinal changes of ancestry diversity in the Million Veteran Program.","Hum Genomics","The Million Veteran Program (MVP) participants represent 100 years of US history, including significant social and demographic changes over time. Our study assessed two aspects of the MVP: (i) longitudinal changes in population diversity and (ii) how these changes can be accounted for in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To investigate these aspects, we divided MVP participants into five birth cohorts (N-range = 123,888 [born from 1943 to 1947] to 136,699 [born from 1948 to 1953]).Ancestry groups were defined by (i) HARE (harmonized ancestry and race/ethnicity) and (ii) a random-forest clustering approach using the 1000 Genomes Project and the Human Genome Diversity Project (1kGP + HGDP) reference panels (77 world populations representing six continental groups). In these groups, we performed GWASs of height, a trait potentially affected by population stratification. Birth cohorts demonstrate important trends in ancestry diversity over time. More recent HARE-assigned Europeans, Africans, and Hispanics had lower European ancestry proportions than older birth cohorts (0.010 < Cohen's d < 0.259, p < 7.80 × 10-4). Conversely, HARE-assigned East Asians showed an increase in European ancestry proportion over time. In GWAS of height using HARE assignments, genomic inflation due to population stratification was prevalent across all birth cohorts (linkage disequilibrium score regression intercept = 1.08 ± 0.042). The 1kGP + HGDP-based ancestry assignment significantly reduced the population stratification (mean intercept reduction = 0.045 ± 0.007, p < 0.05) confounding in the GWAS statistics.This study provides a characterization of ancestry diversity of the MVP cohort over time and compares two strategies to infer genetically defined ancestry groups by assessing differences in controlling population stratification in genome-wide association studies.© 2023.

We report a multivariate genome-wide association meta-analysis that disaggregates general and substance-specific loci for published summary statistics of problematic alcohol use, problematic tobacco use, cannabis use disorder, and opioid use disorder in a sample of1,025,550individuals of European descent and92,630 individuals ofAfrican descent. Nineteen independent SNPs were genome-wide significant (P< 5e-8) for the general addiction risk factor (addiction-rf), which showed high polygenicity. Across ancestries,PDE4Bwas significant (among other genes), suggesting dopamine regulation as a cross-substance vulnerability. Anaddiction-rfpolygenic risk score was associated with substance use disorders, psychopathologies, somatic conditions, and environments associated with the onset of addictions. Substance-specific loci (9 for alcohol, 32 for tobacco, 5 for cannabis, 1 for opioids) included metabolic and receptor genes. These findings provide insight into genetic risk loci for substance use disorders that could be leveraged as treatment targets."
"37074034","Sparse dimensionality reduction approaches in Mendelian randomisation with highly correlated exposures.","Elife","Multivariable Mendelian randomisation (MVMR) is an instrumental variable technique that generalises the MR framework for multiple exposures. Framed as a regression problem, it is subject to the pitfall of multicollinearity. The bias and efficiency of MVMR estimates thus depends heavily on the correlation of exposures. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) provide transformations of all the included variables that are effectively uncorrelated. We propose the use of sparse PCA (sPCA) algorithms that create principal components of subsets of the exposures with the aim of providing more interpretable and reliable MR estimates. The approach consists of three steps. We first apply a sparse dimension reduction method and transform the variant-exposure summary statistics to principal components. We then choose a subset of the principal components based on data-driven cutoffs, and estimate their strength as instruments with an adjustedF-statistic. Finally, we perform MR with these transformed exposures. This pipeline is demonstrated in a simulation study of highly correlated exposures and an applied example using summary data from a genome-wide association study of 97 highly correlated lipid metabolites. As a positive control, we tested the causal associations of the transformed exposures on coronary heart disease (CHD). Compared to the conventional inverse-variance weighted MVMR method and a weak instrument robust MVMR method (MR GRAPPLE), sparse component analysis achieved a superior balance of sparsity and biologically insightful grouping of the lipid traits.© 2023, Karageorgiou et al."
"37293200","Association of genetic polymorphisms in the C19orf66 gene and biochemical indices of HBV infected individuals in Yunnan.","Front Cell Infect Microbiol","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causes serious liver diseases and is a healthy problem worldwide. Although vaccines are administered to infants after birth, there is no effective medicine for HBV infection. The interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are important factors in the host that can aid in restraining the virus, and theC19orf66gene has a wide-antiviral spectrum.In this study, three SNPs in theC19orf66gene were sequenced and genotyped, and their potential function were predicted and further verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay.Although no significant difference of genotype and allele frequency was observed between HBV patients and the controls, the genotype and allele frequency showed significant difference between HBV patients with HBsAg-positive and HBV patients with HBsAg-negative or controls. Genotype AA (P= 0.009) and AT (P= 0.019) of rs77076061 showed higher and lower frequency in HBV patients with HBsAg-positive than in patients with HBsAg-negative, respectively. Genotype AG of rs1979262 played a risk role in HBV patients with HBsAg-positive (13.22%) than in patients with HBsAg-negative (7.53%,P= 0.036) or controls (8.48%,P= 0.033). The frequency of allele A of rs1979262 was higher in patients with HBsAg-positive (6.61%) than in patients with HBsAg-negative (3.77%,P= 0.042), while it was the opposite for the allele G. Moreover, the associations between genotypes of SNPs in theC19orf66gene and the ALT, AST, and DBIL level were also identified. The functional assay suggested that the SNPs might influence theC19orf66expression by changing the connection of transcriptional factors.In summary, the association between genetic polymorphisms in theC19orf66gene and HBV infection/biochemical indices of patients was firstly identified in Yunnan Province.Copyright © 2023 Liu, Liu, Yang, Dong, Yue, Huang, Xia and Zhang."
"37280210","Chromatin alternates between A and B compartments at kilobase scale for subgenic organization.","Nat Commun","Nuclear compartments are prominent features of 3D chromatin organization, but sequencing depth limitations have impeded investigation at ultra fine-scale. CTCF loops are generally studied at a finer scale, but the impact of looping on proximal interactions remains enigmatic. Here, we critically examine nuclear compartments and CTCF loop-proximal interactions using a combination of in situ Hi-C at unparalleled depth, algorithm development, and biophysical modeling. Producing a large Hi-C map with 33 billion contacts in conjunction with an algorithm for performing principal component analysis on sparse, super massive matrices (POSSUMM), we resolve compartments to 500 bp. Our results demonstrate that essentially all active promoters and distal enhancers localize in the A compartment, even when flanking sequences do not. Furthermore, we find that the TSS and TTS of paused genes are often segregated into separate compartments. We then identify diffuse interactions that radiate from CTCF loop anchors, which correlate with strong enhancer-promoter interactions and proximal transcription. We also find that these diffuse interactions depend on CTCF's RNA binding domains. In this work, we demonstrate features of fine-scale chromatin organization consistent with a revised model in which compartments are more precise than commonly thought while CTCF loops are more protracted.© 2023.

Yet, only 15-60% of patients respond significantly. Therefore, accurate responder identification and timely ICI administration are critical issues in tumor ICI therapy. Recent rapid developments at the intersection of oncology, immunology, biology, and computer science have provided an abundance of predictive biomarkers for ICI efficacy. These biomarkers can be invasive or non-invasive, depending on the specific sample collection method. Compared with invasive markers, a host of non-invasive markers have been confirmed to have superior availability and accuracy in ICI efficacy prediction.

"37256461","m6A Regulator-mediated RNA Methylation Modulates Immune Microenvironment of Hepatitis B Virus-related Acute Liver Failure.","Inflammation","Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare and complicated disease with a high mortality rate. Emergency liver transplantation is the only treatment method that can improve the ALF prognosis. However, its clinical application remains limited owing to the aggressive nature of liver transplantation, limited donors, and high postoperative mortality. The study investigated the effect of m6A on the immune microenvironment of hepatitis B virus-related ALF (HBV-ALF). In this study, the gene expression data of 47 normal people and 42 HBV-ALF patients were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibu (GEO) database. The known 23 m6A regulators which mediated RNA modification patterns were compared and analyzed in these two groups, and the gene diagnosis model of HBV-ALF patients was established based on the analysis results. In addition, we used unsupervised clustering to identify different m6A RNA methylation modification patterns in HBV-ALF based on m6A regulators, and evaluated the immune infiltration and biological differences in these subtypes. In addition, the relationship between m6A genes and immune cell activation in HBV-ACLF patients was explored by immune infiltration analysis. Nineteen m6A regulators mediated RNA methylation (m6A regulators for short) were differentially expressed in HBV-ALF and control groups. m6A regulators could well distinguish control samples from HBV-ALF samples, and m6A regulators might be used as a basis for diagnosing HBV-ALF patients. Immune cells such as activated CD8 T cells, activated B cells, and activated CD4 T cells might play important roles in HBV-ALF, and m6A regulators were closely associated with immune cell infiltration. ALKBH15, CBLL1, IGF2BP2, IGF2BP3, and ZC3H13 were significantly associated with immune cells. Considering 23 m6A regulators, HBV-ALF patients could be classified into two subtypes (cluster 1 and cluster 2) based on different immune cell infiltration. m6A regulators of the IGFBP and YHDF families have extremely different levels in these two subtypes. Differential immune cell infiltration among these subtypes was observed, a total of 913 differentially expressed genes among different m6A modification patterns was identified, and their biological functions were explored. m6A modification might play a crucial role in the diverse and complex immune microenvironment of HBV-ALF patients.© 2023.

Our study aimed to determine whether PPP1R14B could be a prognostic biomarker for KIRC and its role in the development of KIRC.In this work, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to explore the expression of PPP1R14B in tumor tissues, its relationship with the prognosis of tumor patients, and its role in tumor occurrence and development. We validated our findings using the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) cohort, our clinical samples, and in vitro experiments.PPP1R14B was upregulated in KIRC compared to adjacent normal tissue. Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed that upregulated PPP1R14B expression was an independent risk factor for KIRC progression. High-PPP1R14B groups had shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in TCGA and ICGC cohorts. We used Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) and scratch wound healing assay to explore the proliferation and migration of KIRC cells following PPP1R14B knockdown. Our results indicated that PPP1R14B knockdown significantly reduced the proliferation and migration of KIRC cells in vitro. We also explored the possible cellular mechanisms of PPP1R14B through the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene ontology (GO) analysis, and TISIDB analysis. The function enrich analysis revealed that PPP1R14B-related genes were mainly enriched in purine metabolism and the macromolecule catabolic process. PPP1R14B expression was associated with tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) in the TCGA cohort, and the results of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA) further demonstrated that PPP1R14B expression was associated with the enhanced infiltration of CD8 + T lymphocytes.PPP1R14B may serve as a prognostic biomarker in KIRC, affect purine metabolism, activate immune infiltration, and promote KIRC cell migration.© 2023.

"37284149","Alzheimer's disease is an inherent, natural part of human brain aging: an integrated perspective.","Free Neuropathol","Alzheimer disease is one of the most challenging demons in our society due to its very high prevalence and its clinical manifestations which cause deterioration of cognition, intelligence, and emotions - the very capacities that distinguishHomo sapiensfrom other animal species. Besides the personal, social, and economical costs, late stages of AD are vivid experiences for the family, relatives, friends, and general observers of the progressive ruin of an individual who turns into a being with lower mental and physical capacities than less evolved species. A human brain with healthy cognition, conscience, and emotions can succeed in dealing with most difficulties that life may pose. Without these capacities, the same person probably cannot. Due, in part, to this emotional impact, the absorbing study of AD has generated, over the years, a fascinating and complex story of theories, hypotheses, controversies, fashion swings, and passionate clashes, together with tremendous efforts and achievements geared to improve understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of the disorder. Familal AD is rare and linked to altered genetic information associated with three genes. Sporadic AD (sAD) is much more common and multifactorial. A major point of clinical discussion has been, and still is, establishing the differences between brain aging and sAD. This is not a trivial question, as the neuropathological and molecular characteristics of normal brain aging and the first appearance of early stages of sAD-related pathology are not easily distinguishable in most individuals. Another important point is confidence in assigning responsibility for the beginning of sAD to a few triggering molecules, without considering the wide number of alterations that converge in the pathogenesis of aging and sAD. Genetic risk factors covering multiple molecular signals are increasing in number. In the same line, molecular pathways are altered at early stages of sAD pathology, currently grouped under the aegis of normal brain aging, only to increase massively at advanced stages of the process. Sporadic AD is here considered an inherent, natural part of human brain aging, which is prevalent in all humans, and variably present or not in a few individuals in other species. The progression of the process has devastating effects in a relatively low percentage of human beings eventually evolving to dementia. The continuum of brain aging and sAD implies the search for a different approach in the study of human brain aging at the first stages of the biological process, and advances in the use of new technologies aimed at slowing down the molecular defects underlying human brain aging and sAD at the outset, and transfering information and tasks to AI and coordinated devices."

The aim of the study was to explore maternal DPs longitudinally, examine trajectories over 12 years after pregnancy and identify associated factors.Of 14,541 pregnant women enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) complete dietary information was available for 5336 women. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to derive DPs. DP scores at each time point were used to create DP trajectories using group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM). Multinomial logistic regression assessed the association with maternal factors.A total of six distinct DPs were identified over time with different numbers of DPs at each time point. The ""healthy"" and ""processed"" DPs persisted over the 12-year post-pregnancy. Three trajectories of ""healthy"" and ""processed"" DPs were identified from GBTM. Half the women were on the moderately healthy DP trajectory with 37% on the lower trajectory and 9% on the higher healthy DP trajectory. 59% of women were on the lower processed DP trajectory with 38% on the moderate trajectory and 3.3% on the higher processed DP trajectory. Low educational attainment, low social class and smoking in pregnancy were independently associated with being on a less favourable DP trajectory over the 12 years.Health professionals should provide support on smoking cessation along with healthy eating advice during ante-natal counselling. Continued support on eating healthily after pregnancy would be beneficial for mothers and families.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The Web of Science database search used descriptive terms to investigate the interaction among PM2.5exposure, systemic effects, and COVID-19 disease. Analyzed studies have indicated that cardiovascular and respiratory systems have been extensively investigated and indicated as the main air pollution targets. Nevertheless, PM2.5reaches other organic systems and harms the renal, neurological, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems. Pathologies onset and/or get worse due to toxicological effects associated with the exposure to this particle type, since it can trigger several reactions, such as inflammatory responses, oxidative stress generation and genotoxicity. These cellular dysfunctions lead to organ malfunctions, as shown in the current review. In addition, the correlation between COVID-19/Sars-CoV-2 and PM2.5exposure was also assessed to help better understand the role of atmospheric pollution in the pathophysiology of this disease.

The data used in this study was retrieved from the COVID-19 positive cohort in National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Multivariable logistic regression models were conducted on populations that were matched using either exact matching or propensity score matching (PSM) with varying age difference between PLWH and non-PLWH to examine the impact of HIV and aging process on all-cause mortality and hospitalization among COVID-19 patients. Subgroup analyses by CD4 counts and viral load (VL) levels were conducted using similar approaches. Among the 2,422,864 adults with a COVID-19 diagnosis, 15,188 were PLWH. PLWH had a significantly higher odds of death compared to non-PLWH until age difference reached 6 years or more, while PLWH were still at an elevated risk of hospitalization across all matched cohorts. The odds of both severe outcomes were persistently higher among PLWH with CD4 < 200 cells/mm3. VL ≥ 200 copies/ml was only associated with higher hospitalization, regardless of the predefined age differences. Age advancement in HIV might significantly contribute to the higher risk of COVID-19 mortality and HIV infection may still impact COVID-19 hospitalization independent of the age advancement in HIV.© 2023.

In this study we investigate the methylation of ten target genes in 105 CRC and paired normal adjacent colonic tissue samples using a MethylLight droplet digital PCR (ML-ddPCR) assay. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the diagnostic performance of all target genes individually and in combination. All 515 different combinations of genes showed significantly higher levels of methylation in CRC tissue. The combination of multiple target genes into a single test generally resulted in greater diagnostic accuracy when compared to single target genes.

Long-read sequencing platforms offer the opportunity to make definitive molecular diagnoses using a single assay capable of detecting variants, characterizing methylation patterns, resolving complex rearrangements, and assigning findings to long-range haplotypes. Here, we demonstrate the clinical utility of Nanopore long-read sequencing by validating a confirmatory test for copy number variants (CNVs) in neurodevelopmental disorders and illustrate the broader applications of this platform to assess genomic features with significant clinical implications.We used adaptive sampling on the Oxford Nanopore platform to sequence 25 genomic DNA samples and 5 blood samples collected from patients with known or false-positive copy number changes originally detected using short-read sequencing. Across the 30 samples (a total of 50 with replicates), we assayed 35 known unique CNVs (a total of 55 with replicates) and one false-positive CNV, ranging in size from 40 kb to 155 Mb, and assessed the presence or absence of suspected CNVs using normalized read depth.Across 50 samples (including replicates) sequenced on individual MinION flow cells, we achieved an average on-target mean depth of 9.5X and an average on-target read length of 4805 bp. Using a custom read depth-based analysis, we successfully confirmed the presence of all 55 known CNVs (including replicates) and the absence of one false-positive CNV. Using the same CNV-targeted data, we compared genotypes of single nucleotide variant loci to verify that no sample mix-ups occurred between assays. For one case, we also used methylation detection and phasing to investigate the parental origin of a 15q11.2-q13 duplication with implications for clinical prognosis.We present an assay that efficiently targets genomic regions to confirm clinically relevant CNVs with a concordance rate of 100%. Furthermore, we demonstrate how integration of genotype, methylation, and phasing data from the Nanopore sequencing platform can potentially simplify and shorten the diagnostic odyssey.© 2023.

Many of these loops are stabilized by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) proteins at their base. Despite the relevance of chromatin structure and the key role of CTCF, the role of the epigenetic factors that are involved in the regulation of CTCF binding, and thus, in the formation of structural loops in the chromatin, is not thoroughly understood.Here we describe a CTCF binding predictor based on Random Forest that employs different epigenetic data and genomic features. Importantly, given the ability of Random Forests to determine the relevance of features for the prediction, our approach also shows how the different types of descriptors impact the binding of CTCF, confirming previous knowledge on the relevance of chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation, but demonstrating the effect of epigenetic modifications on the activity of CTCF. We compared our approach against other predictors and found improved performance in terms of areas under PR and ROC curves (PRAUC-ROCAUC), outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.© 2023 The Authors."

The weight loss process is slow and complex, and involves lifestyle changes with an emphasis on nutritional therapy, physical activity practice, psychological interventions, and pharmacological or surgical treatment. Because the management of obesity is a long-term process, it is essential that the nutritional treatment contributes to the maintenance of the individual's global health. The main diet-related causes associated with excess weight are the high consumption of ultraprocessed foods, which are high in fats, sugars, and have high energy density; increased portion sizes; and low intake of fruits, vegetables, and grains. In addition, some situations negatively interfere with the weight loss process, such as fad diets that involve the belief in superfoods, the use of teas and phytotherapics, or even the avoidance of certain food groups, as has currently been the case for foods that are sources of carbohydrates. Individuals with obesity are often exposed to fad diets and, on a recurring basis, adhere to proposals with promises of quick solutions, which are not supported by the scientific literature. The adoption of a dietary pattern combining foods such as grains, lean meats, low-fat dairy, fruits, and vegetables, associated with an energy deficit, is the nutritional treatment recommended by the main international guidelines. Moreover, an emphasis on behavioral aspects including motivational interviewing and the encouragement for the individual to develop skills will contribute to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Therefore, this Position Statement was prepared based on the analysis of the main randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses that tested different nutrition interventions for weight loss. Topics in the frontier of knowledge such as gut microbiota, inflammation, and nutritional genomics, as well as the processes involved in weight regain, were included in this document.

Deep sequencing analysis have pointed out that epigenetic dysregulations, including mutations in epigenetic enzymes, such as chromatin modifiers and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), are prevalent in both B- cell and T-cell lymphomas. Accordingly, over the past decade, a large number of epigenetic-modifying agents have been developed and introduced into the clinical management of these entities, and a few specific inhibitors have already been approved for clinical use. Here we summarize the main epigenetic alterations described in B- and T-NHL, that further supported the clinical development of a selected set of epidrugs in determined diseases, including inhibitors of DNMTs, histone deacetylases (HDACs), and extra-terminal domain proteins (bromodomain and extra-terminal motif; BETs). Finally, we highlight the most promising future directions of research in this area, explaining how bioinformatics approaches can help to identify new epigenetic targets in B- and T-cell lymphoid neoplasms.© The Author(s), 2023."

Collectively, these methods are revolutionizing molecular cell biology research. In this comprehensive Review, we discuss established multi-omics technologies as well as cutting-edge and state-of-the-art methods in the field. We discuss how multi-omics technologies have been adapted and improved over the past decade using a framework characterized by optimization of throughput and resolution, modality integration, uniqueness and accuracy, and we also discuss multi-omics limitations. We highlight the impact that single-cell multi-omics technologies have had in cell lineage tracing, tissue-specific and cell-specific atlas production, tumour immunology and cancer genetics, and in mapping of cellular spatial information in fundamental and translational research. Finally, we discuss bioinformatics tools that have been developed to link different omics modalities and elucidate functionality through the use of better mathematical modelling and computational methods.© 2023.

The molecular changes during liver transitions are pivotal to improve liver diagnostics and therapeutics yet still remain elusive. Cumulative large-scale liver transcriptomic studies have been revealing molecular landscape of various liver conditions at bulk and single-cell resolution, however, neither single experiment nor databases enabled thorough investigations of transcriptomic dynamics along the progression of liver diseases. Here we establish GepLiver, a longitudinal and multidimensional liver expression atlas integrating expression profiles of 2469 human bulk tissues, 492 mouse samples, 409,775 single cells from 347 human samples and 27 liver cell lines spanning 16 liver phenotypes with uniformed processing and annotating methods. Using GepLiver, we have demonstrated dynamic changes of gene expression, cell abundance and crosstalk harboring meaningful biological associations. GepLiver can be applied to explore the evolving expression patterns and transcriptomic features for genes and cell types respectively among liver phenotypes, assisting the investigation of liver transcriptomic dynamics and informing biomarkers and targets for liver diseases.© 2023.

"37269418","Molecular Characterization and Landscape of Breast cancer Models from a multi-omics Perspective.","J Mammary Gland Biol Neoplasia","Breast cancer is well-known to be a highly heterogenous disease. This facet of cancer makes finding a research model that mirrors the disparate intrinsic features challenging. With advances in multi-omics technologies, establishing parallels between the various models and human tumors is increasingly intricate. Here we review the various model systems and their relation to primary breast tumors using available omics data platforms. Among the research models reviewed here, breast cancer cell lines have the least resemblance to human tumors since they have accumulated many mutations and copy number alterations during their long use. Moreover, individual proteomic and metabolomic profiles do not overlap with the molecular landscape of breast cancer. Interestingly, omics analysis revealed that the initial subtype classification of some breast cancer cell lines was inappropriate. In cell lines the major subtypes are all well represented and share some features with primary tumors. In contrast, patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) are superior in mirroring human breast cancers at many levels, making them suitable models for drug screening and molecular analysis. While patient derived organoids are spread across luminal, basal- and normal-like subtypes, the PDX samples were initially largely basal but other subtypes have been increasingly described. Murine models offer heterogenous tumor landscapes, inter and intra-model heterogeneity, and give rise to tumors of different phenotypes and histology. Murine models have a reduced mutational burden compared to human breast cancer but share some transcriptomic resemblance, and representation of many breast cancer subtypes can be found among the variety subtypes. To date, while mammospheres and three- dimensional cultures lack comprehensive omics data, these are excellent models for the study of stem cells, cell fate decision and differentiation, and have also been used for drug screening. Therefore, this review explores the molecular landscapes and characterization of breast cancer research models by comparing recent published multi-omics data and analysis.© 2023. The Author(s)."

It is urgent to discover a novel biomarker to predict immune cells infiltration status and immunotherapy response of different cancers. CLSPN has been reported to play a pivotal role in various biological processes. However, a comprehensive analysis of CLSPN in cancers has not been conducted.To show the whole picture of CLSPN in cancers, a pan-cancer analysis was conducted in 9125 tumor samples across 33 cancer types by integrating transcriptomic, epigenomic and pharmacogenomics data. Moreover, the role of CLSPN in cancer was validated by CCK-8, EDU, colony formation and flow cytometry in vitro and tumor cell derived xenograft model in vivo.CLSPN expression was generally upregulated in most cancer types and was significantly associated with prognosis in different tumor samples. Moreover, elevated CLSPN expression was closely correlated with immune cells infiltration, TMB (tumor mutational burden), MSI (microsatellite instability), MMR (mismatch repair), DNA methylation and stemness score across 33 cancer types. Enrichment analysis of functional genes revealed that CLSPN participated in the regulation of numerous signaling pathways involved in cell cycle and inflammatory response. The expression of CLSPN in LUAD patients were further analyzed at the single-cell level. Knockdown CLSPN significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle related cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family and Cyclin family expression in LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma) both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Finally, we conducted structure-based virtual screening by modelling the structure of CHK1 kinase domain and Claspin phosphopeptide complex. The top five hit compounds were screened and validated by molecular docking and Connectivity Map (CMap) analysis.Our multi-omics analysis offers a systematic understanding of the roles of CLSPN in pan-cancer and provides a potential target for future cancer treatment.© 2023.

"37268606","Lipid droplets are a metabolic vulnerability in melanoma.","Nat Commun","Melanoma exhibits numerous transcriptional cell states including neural crest-like cells as well as pigmented melanocytic cells. How these different cell states relate to distinct tumorigenic phenotypes remains unclear. Here, we use a zebrafish melanoma model to identify a transcriptional program linking the melanocytic cell state to a dependence on lipid droplets, the specialized organelle responsible for lipid storage. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of these tumors show a concordance between genes regulating pigmentation and those involved in lipid and oxidative metabolism. This state is conserved across human melanoma cell lines and patient tumors. This melanocytic state demonstrates increased fatty acid uptake, an increased number of lipid droplets, and dependence upon fatty acid oxidative metabolism. Genetic and pharmacologic suppression of lipid droplet production is sufficient to disrupt cell cycle progression and slow melanoma growth in vivo. Because the melanocytic cell state is linked to poor outcomes in patients, these data indicate a metabolic vulnerability in melanoma that depends on the lipid droplet organelle.© 2023.

"37158102","Oxidative stress enhances the therapeutic action of a respiratory inhibitor in MYC-driven lymphoma.","EMBO Mol Med","MYC is a key oncogenic driver in multiple tumor types, but concomitantly endows cancer cells with a series of vulnerabilities that provide opportunities for targeted pharmacological intervention. For example, drugs that suppress mitochondrial respiration selectively kill MYC-overexpressing cells. Here, we unravel the mechanistic basis for this synthetic lethal interaction and exploit it to improve the anticancer effects of the respiratory complex I inhibitor IACS-010759. In a B-lymphoid cell line, ectopic MYC activity and treatment with IACS-010759 added up to induce oxidative stress, with consequent depletion of reduced glutathione and lethal disruption of redox homeostasis. This effect could be enhanced either with inhibitors of NADPH production through the pentose phosphate pathway, or with ascorbate (vitamin C), known to act as a pro-oxidant at high doses. In these conditions, ascorbate synergized with IACS-010759 to kill MYC-overexpressing cells in vitro and reinforced its therapeutic action against human B-cell lymphoma xenografts. Hence, complex I inhibition and high-dose ascorbate might improve the outcome of patients affected by high-grade lymphomas and potentially other MYC-driven cancers.© 2023 The Authors.

Nevertheless, the exact factors linking early life malnutrition with metabolic syndrome remain poorly characterized. We hypothesize that the microbiota plays a crucial role in this trajectory and that the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying under- and overnutrition are, to some extent, shared. We further hypothesize that a ""dysbiotic seed microbiota"" is transmitted to children during the birth process, altering the children's microbiota composition and metabolic health. The overall objective of this project is to understand the precise causes and biological mechanisms linking prenatal or early life under- or overnutrition with the predisposition to develop overnutrition and/or metabolic disease in later life, as well as to investigate the possibility of a dysbiotic seed microbiota inheritance in the context of maternal malnutrition.VITERBI GUT is a prospective birth cohort allowing to study the link between early life malnutrition, the microbiota and metabolic health. VITERBI GUT will include 100 undernourished, 100 normally nourished and 100 overnourished pregnant women living in Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR). Women will be recruited during their third trimester of pregnancy and followed with their child until its second birthday. Anthropometric, clinical, metabolic and nutritional data are collected from both the mother and the child. The microbiota composition of maternal and child's fecal and oral samples as well as maternal vaginal and breast milk samples will be determined using amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Epigenetic modifications and lipid profiles will be assessed in the child's blood at 2 years of age. We will investigate for possible associations between metabolic health, epigenetics, and microbial changes.We expect the VITERBI GUT project to contribute to the emerging literature linking the early life microbiota, epigenetic changes and growth/metabolic health. We also expect this project to give new (molecular) insights into the mechanisms linking malnutrition-induced early life dysbiosis and metabolic health in later life, opening new avenues for microbiota-engineering using microbiota-targeted interventions.Copyright © 2023 Tamarelle, Creze, Savathdy, Phonekeo, Wallenborn, Siengsounthone, Fink, Odermatt, Kounnavong, Sayasone and Vonaesch."
"37270501","Novel insights into systemic sclerosis using a sensitive computational method to analyze whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data.","Clin Epigenetics","Abnormal DNA methylation is thought to contribute to the onset and progression of systemic sclerosis. Currently, the most comprehensive assay for profiling DNA methylation is whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), but its precision depends on read depth and it may be subject to sequencing errors. SOMNiBUS, a method for regional analysis, attempts to overcome some of these limitations. Using SOMNiBUS, we re-analyzed WGBS data previously analyzed using bumphunter, an approach that initially fits single CpG associations, to contrast DNA methylation estimates by both methods.Purified CD4+ T lymphocytes of 9 SSc and 4 control females were sequenced using WGBS. We separated the resulting sequencing data into regions with dense CpG data, and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were inferred with the SOMNiBUS region-level test, adjusted for age. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed with ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). We compared the results obtained by SOMNiBUS and bumphunter.Of 8268 CpG regions of ≥ 60 CpGs eligible for analysis with SOMNiBUS, we identified 131 DMRs and 125 differentially methylated genes (DMGs; p-values less than Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 6.05-06 controlling family-wise error rate at 0.05; 1.6% of the regions). In comparison, bumphunter identified 821,929 CpG regions, 599 DMRs (of which none had ≥ 60 CpGs) and 340 DMGs (q-value of 0.05; 0.04% of all regions). The top ranked gene identified by SOMNiBUS was FLT4, a lymphangiogenic orchestrator, and the top ranked gene on chromosome X was CHST7, known to catalyze the sulfation of glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix. The top networks identified by IPA included connective tissue disorders.SOMNiBUS is a complementary method of analyzing WGBS data that enhances biological insights into SSc and provides novel avenues of investigation into its pathogenesis.© 2023.

Anisometropia was defined by an interocular difference in SE of ≥1 diopter (D) (Aniso-SE) and an interocular difference in axial length (AL) of ≥0.3 mm (Aniso-AL), respectively. Genetic associations of individual SNPs and joint SNP effects were analyzed.ZFHX1B rs13382811 was associated nominally with Aniso-AL (odds ratio [OR], 1.66; P = 0.003) at baseline. At 3 years, rs13382811 was significantly associated with Aniso-AL (OR, 1.49; P = 0.001) and became nominally associated with Aniso-SE (OR, 1.40; P = 0.01). In addition, PAX6 rs644242 was significantly associated with Aniso-AL at 3 years (OR, 1.45; P = 0.002). At the 3-year follow-up, PAX6 rs644242 was associated significantly with Aniso-AL development (OR, 1.61; P = 0.0003) and nominally with Aniso-SE development (P = 0.03) in children who were not anisometropic at baseline, whereas ZFHX1B rs13382811 was associated nominally with Aniso-AL development (P = 0.02). An additive SNP analysis indicated children carrying the risk allele T of ZFHX1B rs13382811 and allele A of PAX6 rs644242 might have a 4.33- and 6.90-fold of increased risk of Aniso-SE and Aniso-AL development by 3 years, respectively.This study identified two susceptible gene variants, ZFHX1B rs13382811 and PAX6 rs644242, for anisometropia development in Hong Kong Chinese children, implicating their role in imbalanced refractive change and axial elongation between both eyes."

Although increasing lines of evidence suggest that both the placenta and the decidua likely play roles in the pathogenesis of PE, the molecular mechanism of PE remains elusive partly because of the heterogeneity nature of the maternal-fetal interface. In this study, we perform single-cell RNA-seq on the placenta and the decidual from patients with late-onset PE (LOPE) and women in normal pregnancy. Analyses of single-cell transcriptomes reveal that in LOPE, there are likely a global development deficiency of trophoblasts with impaired invasion of extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) and increased maternal immune rejection and inflammation in the placenta, while there are likely insufficient decidualization of decidual stromal cells (DSC), increased inflammation, and suppressed regulatory functions of decidual immune cells.

"37215021","Signal recovery in single cell batch integration.","bioRxiv","Data integration to align cells across batches has become a cornerstone of most single cell data analysis pipelines, critically affecting downstream analyses. Yet, when the batches are expected to biologically differ, how much signal is erased during integration? Currently, there are no guidelines for when the biological differences between samples are separable from batch effects, and thus, data integration usually involve a lot of guesswork: Cells across batches should be aligned to be ""appropriately"" mixed, while preserving ""main cell type clusters"". We show evidence that current paradigms for single cell data integration are unnecessarily aggressive, removing biologically meaningful variation. To remedy this, we present a novel statistical model and computationally scalable algorithm, CellANOVA, to recover biological signal that is lost during single cell data integration. CellANOVA utilizes a ""pool-of-controls"" design concept, applicable across diverse settings, to separate unwanted variation from biological variation of interest. When applied with existing integration methods, CellANOVA allows the recovery of subtle biological signals and corrects, to a large extent, the data distortion introduced by integration. Further, CellANOVA explicitly estimates cell- and gene-specific batch effect terms which can be used to identify the cell types and pathways exhibiting the largest batch variations, providing clarity as to which biological signals can be recovered."

Gene-searching efforts are well underway, but the identification of environmental risk factors is at least as important and should be a priority because some of them may be amenable to prevention or early intervention strategies. Genetically informative studies, particularly those employing the discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin design, are ideally suited to study environmental risk factors. This protocol paper describes the study rationale, aims, and methods of OCDTWIN, an open cohort of MZ twin pairs who are discordant for the diagnosis of OCD.MethodsOCDTWIN has two broad aims. In Aim 1, we are recruiting MZ twin pairs from across Sweden, conducting thorough clinical assessments, and building a biobank of biological specimens, including blood, saliva, urine, stool, hair, nails, and multimodal brain imaging. A wealth of early life exposures (e.g., perinatal variables, health-related information, psychosocial stressors) are available through linkage with the nationwide registers and the Swedish Twin Registry. Blood spots stored in the Swedish phenylketonuria (PKU) biobank will be available to extract DNA, proteins, and metabolites, providing an invaluable source of biomaterial taken at birth. In Aim 2, we will perform within-pair comparisons of discordant MZ twins, which will allow us to isolate unique environmental risk factors that are in the causal pathway to OCD, while strictly controlling for genetic and early shared environmental influences. To date (May 2023), 43 pairs of twins (21 discordant for OCD) have been recruited.DiscussionOCDTWIN hopes to generate unique insights into environmental risk factors that are in the causal pathway to OCD, some of which have the potential of being actionable targets."

Although multiple studies have been conducted in Ethiopia to show the magnitude of stunting and factors, all are concentrated on children aged between 6 to 59 months. Therefore, this study was done to determine the prevalence and associated factors of stunting at birth among new-borns.A community-based cross-sectional study design was employed on 512 neonates in Shebadino Woreda, Sidama Region South Ethiopia 2022. A multistage sampling technique was employed. The data was collected door-to-door using pretested and structured questionnaires, through face-to-face interviews. The collected data were cleaned manually, coded, entered into Epidata version 4.6, and exported to SPSS version 26 software for analysis. Bi-variable analysis was conducted to assess the association of independent variables with the outcome variable. Variables with a p-value < 0.25 in bi-variable logistic regression were further analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. The odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI was used as a measure of association, and variables that had a p-value less than 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression were considered as significantly associated variables.The prevalence of stunting in this study was 27.5%: 95% CI 22.6 to 31.9. Factors such as residence (AOR = 4.1, 95% CI: 1.49, 11.25), ANC follow up (AOR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.34, 5.27), started taking Amessa (AOR = 3.48, 95% CI: 1.27, 9.55) and Sex of the neonate (AOR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.54, 5.23) were significantly associated with stunting at a p-value of < 0.05.About 27% of neonates were stunted, which implies, it require a quick public health measurement. New-born who were live in rural area and those who were started traditional medication (Amessa) were more stunted. Besides this, stunting was prevalently observed among a mother who had no ANC follow-up and male neonates. Thus, the regional health bureau and Shebedino woreda health office should increase awareness creation to bring behavioural change at community level to prevent traditional medication usage, ANC follow-up and giving priority for those who live in rural area.© 2023.

Moreover, the role of complement component C3 in diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy has been implicated, and C3 N-glycome was found to be altered in young T1D patients. Therefore, we investigated associations between C3 N-glycan profiles and albuminuria and retinopathy accompanying T1D, as well as glycosylation connection with other known T1D complication risk factors.Complement component C3 N-glycosylation profiles have been analyzed from 189 serum samples of T1D patients (median age 46) recruited at a Croatian hospital centre. Using our recently developed high-throughput method, relative abundances of all six of the C3 glycopeptides have been determined. Assessment of C3 N-glycome interconnection with T1D complications, hypertension, smoking status, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), glycaemic control and duration of the disease was done using linear modelling.Significant changes of C3 N-glycome in severe albuminuria accompanying type 1 diabetes were observed, as well as in T1D subjects with hypertension. All except one of the C3 glycopeptides proved to be associated with measured HbA1c levels. One of the glycoforms was shown to be changed in non-proliferative T1D retinopathy. Smoking and eGFR showed no effect on C3 N-glycome. Furthermore, C3 N-glycosylation profile was shown to be independent of disease duration.This study empowered the role of C3 N-glycosylation in T1D, showing value in distinguishing subjects with different diabetic complications. Being independent of the disease duration, these changes may be associated with the disease onset, making C3 N-glycome a potential novel marker of the disease progression and severity.Copyright © 2023 Šoić, Štambuk, Tijardović, Keser, Lauc, Bulum, Lovrenčić, Rebrina, Tomić, Novokmet, Smirčić-Duvnjak and Gornik."

Next, we developed a Nomogram by integrating a prognostic model with clinical features. Finally, we performed experimental validation in vitro to verify our prognostic risk model. In our study, we classified UCEC patients into three clusters using consensus clustering. We hypothesized that cluster C1 represents the immune inflammation type, cluster C2 represents the immune rejection type, and cluster C3 represents the immune desert type. The hub genes identified in the training cohort were primarily enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway, as well as the PD-L1 expression and PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer, all of which are immune-related pathways. Cluster C1 may be a more suitable for immunotherapy. The prognostic risk model showed a strong predictive ability.

AD diagnosis and treatment are challenging, but molecular biomarkers show diagnostic potential. This study aimed to investigate AD biomarkers in the peripheral blood.Utilizing three microarray datasets, we systematically analyzed the differences in expression and predictive value of mitophagy-related hub genes (MRHGs) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with AD to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to identify hub genes, and functional enrichment analyses were performed. Using consistent clustering analysis, AD subtypes with significant differences were determined. Finally, infiltration patterns of immune cells in AD subtypes and the relationship between MRHGs and immune cells were investigated by two algorithms, CIBERSORT and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA).Our study identified 53 AD- and mitophagy-related differentially expressed genes and six MRHGs, which may be potential biomarkers for diagnosing AD. Functional analysis revealed that six MRHGs significantly affected biologically relevant functions and signaling pathways such as IL-4 Signaling Pathway, RUNX3 Regulates Notch Signaling Pathway, IL-1 and Megakaryocytes in Obesity Pathway, and Overview of Leukocyteintrinsic Hippo Pathway. Furthermore, CIBERSORT and ssGSEA algorithms were used for all AD samples to analyze the abundance of infiltrating immune cells in the two disease subtypes. The results showed that these subtypes were significantly related to immune cell types such as activated mast cells, regulatory T cells, M0 macrophages, and neutrophils. Moreover, specific MRHGs were significantly correlated with immune cell levels.Our findings suggest that MRHGs may contribute to the development and prognosis of AD. The six identified MRHGs could be used as valuable diagnostic biomarkers for further research on AD.

Hence, this research aimed to find and evaluate ICD-related genetic signatures as cervical cancer (CC) prognostic factors.Data of CC patients from the Tumor Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used as the basis to obtain immunogenic cell-death-related prognostic genes (IPGs) in patients with CC, using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and Cox regression screening, and the IPGs scoring system was constructed to classify patients into high- and low-risk groups, with the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset as the validation group. Finally, the difference analysis of single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, tumor microenvironment (TME), immune cells, tumor mutational burden, and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity between the high-risk and low-risk groups was investigated.A prognostic model with four IPGs (PDIA3, CASP8, IL1, and LY96) was developed, and it was found that the group of CC patients with a higher risk score of IPGs expression had a lower survival rate. Single and multifactor Cox regression analysis also showed that this risk score was a reliable predictor of overall survival. In comparison to the low-risk group, the high-risk group had lower TME scores and immune cell infiltration, and gene set variation analysis showed that immune-related pathways were more enriched in the high-risk group.A risk model constructed from four IPGs can independently predict the prognosis of CC patients and recommend more appropriate immunotherapy strategies for patients.© 2023 Jiang et al."
"37277852","Harnessing male germline epigenomics for the genetic improvement in cattle.","J Anim Sci Biotechnol","Sperm is essential for successful artificial insemination in dairy cattle, and its quality can be influenced by both epigenetic modification and epigenetic inheritance. The bovine germline differentiation is characterized by epigenetic reprogramming, while intergenerational and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance can influence the offspring's development through the transmission of epigenetic features to the offspring via the germline. Therefore, the selection of bulls with superior sperm quality for the production and fertility traits requires a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanism and more accurate identifications of epigenetic biomarkers. We have comprehensively reviewed the current progress in the studies of bovine sperm epigenome in terms of both resources and biological discovery in order to provide perspectives on how to harness this valuable information for genetic improvement in the cattle breeding industry.© 2023.

"37204295","An acetylation-mediated chromatin switch governs H3K4 methylation read-write capability.","Elife","In nucleosomes, histone N-terminal tails exist in dynamic equilibrium between free/accessible and collapsed/DNA-bound states. The latter state is expected to impact histone N-termini availability to the epigenetic machinery. Notably, H3 tail acetylation (e.g. K9ac, K14ac, K18ac) is linked to increased H3K4me3 engagement by the BPTF PHD finger, but it is unknown if this mechanism has a broader extension. Here, we show that H3 tail acetylation promotes nucleosomal accessibility to other H3K4 methyl readers, and importantly, extends to H3K4 writers, notably methyltransferase MLL1. This regulation is not observed on peptide substrates yet occurs on thecisH3 tail, as determined with fully-defined heterotypic nucleosomes. In vivo, H3 tail acetylation is directly and dynamically coupled withcisH3K4 methylation levels. Together, these observations reveal an acetylation 'chromatin switch' on the H3 tail that modulates read-write accessibility in nucleosomes and resolves the long-standing question of why H3K4me3 levels are coupled with H3 acetylation.© 2023, Jain et al."
"37150325","The T1150A cancer mutant of the protein lysine dimethyltransferase NSD2 can introduce H3K36 trimethylation.","J Biol Chem","Protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) play essential roles in gene expression regulation and cancer development. Somatic mutations in PKMTs are frequently observed in cancer cells. In biochemical experiments, we show here that the NSD1 mutations Y1971C, R2017Q, and R2017L observed mostly in solid cancers are catalytically inactive suggesting that NSD1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene in these tumors. In contrast, the frequently observed T1150A in NSD2 and its T2029A counterpart in NSD1, both observed in leukemia, are hyperactive and introduce up to three methyl groups in H3K36 in biochemical and cellular assays, while wildtype NSD2 and NSD1 only introduce up to two methyl groups. In Molecular Dynamics simulations, we determined key mechanistic and structural features controlling the product specificity of this class of enzymes. Simulations with NSD2 revealed that H3K36me3 formation is possible due to an enlarged active site pocket of T1150A and loss of direct contacts of T1150 to critical residues which regulate the product specificity of NSD2. Bioinformatic analyses of published data suggested that the generation of H3K36me3 by NSD2 T1150A could alter gene regulation by antagonizing H3K27me3 finally leading to the upregulation of oncogenes.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

"37098340","NSD1 deposits histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation to pattern non-CG DNA methylation in neurons.","Mol Cell","During postnatal development, the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A deposits high levels of non-CG cytosine methylation in neurons. This methylation is critical for transcriptional regulation, and loss of this mark is implicated in DNMT3A-associated neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Here, we show in mice that genome topology and gene expression converge to shape histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2) profiles, which in turn recruit DNMT3A and pattern neuronal non-CG methylation. We show that NSD1, an H3K36 methyltransferase mutated in NDD, is required for the patterning of megabase-scale H3K36me2 and non-CG methylation in neurons. We find that brain-specific deletion of NSD1 causes altered DNA methylation that overlaps with DNMT3A disorder models to drive convergent dysregulation of key neuronal genes that may underlie shared phenotypes in NSD1- and DNMT3A-associated NDDs. Our findings indicate that H3K36me2 deposited by NSD1 is important for neuronal non-CG DNA methylation and suggest that the H3K36me2-DNMT3A-non-CG-methylation pathway is likely disrupted in NSD1-associated NDDs.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Dual species clocks were developed that apply to both humans and frogs (human-clawed frog clocks), supporting that epigenetic aging processes are evolutionary conserved outside mammals. Highly conserved positively age-related CpGs are located in neural-developmental genes such as uncx, tfap2d as well as nr4a2 implicated in age-associated disease. We conclude that signatures of epigenetic aging are evolutionary conserved between frogs and mammals and that the associated genes relate to neural processes, altogether opening opportunities to employ Xenopus as a model organism to study aging.© 2023.

"37287817","The Comprehensive Analysis Illustrates the Role of CDCA5 in Breast Cancer: An Effective Diagnosis and Prognosis Biomarker.","Int J Genomics","Several studies have been conducted to investigate the role of cell division cycle-associated 5 (CDCA5) in cancer. Its role in breast cancer, however, remains unknown.The Gene Expression Omnibus and Cancer Genome Atlas Program databases provided the open-access information needed for the research. The CCK8 and colony formation assays were used to measure cell proliferation. The capacity of breast cancer cells to invade and migrate was assessed using the transwell assay.In our study, CDCA5 was identified as the interested gene through a series of bioinformatics analysis. We found a higher CDCA5 expression level in tissue and cells of breast cancer. Meanwhile, CDCA5 has been linked to increased proliferation, invasion, and migration of breast cancer cells, which was also associated with worse clinical features. The biochemical pathways, in which CDCA5 was engaged, were identified using biological enrichment analysis. Immune infiltration research revealed that CDCA5 was linked to enhanced activity of several immune function terms. Meanwhile, DNA methylation might be responsible for the aberrant level of CDCA5 in tumor tissue. In addition, CDCA5 could significantly increase the paclitaxel and docetaxel sensitivity, indicating that it has the potential for clinical application. Also, we found that CDCA5 is mainly localized in cell nucleoplasm. Moreover, in the breast cancer microenvironment, we found that CDCA5 is mainly expressed in malignant cells, proliferation T cells, and neutrophils.Overall, our findings suggest that CDCA5 is a potential prognostic indicator and target for breast cancer, which can indicate the direction of the relevant research.Copyright © 2023 Yang Gao et al."

We hypothesized that exposure to maternal hyperglycemia would be associated with more behavioral problems in offspring.We included 548 mother-child pairs from the prospective pre-birth Gen3G cohort (Canada). Glycemic markers were measured during a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in the second trimester of pregnancy. Based on OGTT, we classified 59 women (10.8%) as having GDM according to international diagnostic criteria. Mothers reported offspring behavior using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) at 3 and 5 years, and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at 5 years. We used linear mixed models and multivariate regression to assess the associations between GDM or glycemic markers and children's behavior, adjusted for child sex and age, and maternal demographic factors, body mass index and family history of diabetes.Exposure to GDM was associated with higher SDQ externalizing scores at 3 and 5 years [B = 1.12, 95% CI (0.14, 2.10)] in fully adjusted linear mixed models. These results were supported by the CBCL at 5 years. Higher levels of maternal glucose at 1 h and 2 h during OGTT were associated with greater SDQ externalizing scores. Fasting glucose levels were not associated with child behavior scores. We did not observe associations between glycemic markers and internalizing behaviors.Exposure to higher levels of maternal glycemia during pregnancy was associated with more externalizing behaviors in children at 3 and 5 years.© 2023.

"37255932","Long-term outcomes and potential mechanisms of offspring exposed to intrauterine hyperglycemia.","Front Nutr","Diabetes mellitus during pregnancy, which can be classified into pregestational diabetes and gestational diabetes, has become much more prevalent worldwide. Maternal diabetes fosters an intrauterine abnormal environment for fetus, which not only influences pregnancy outcomes, but also leads to fetal anomaly and development of diseases in later life, such as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, neuropsychiatric outcomes, reproduction malformation, and immune dysfunction. The underlying mechanisms are comprehensive and ambiguous, which mainly focus on microbiota, inflammation, reactive oxygen species, cell viability, and epigenetics. This review concluded with the influence of intrauterine hyperglycemia on fetal structure development and organ function on later life and outlined potential mechanisms that underpin the development of diseases in adulthood. Maternal diabetes leaves an effect that continues generations after generations through gametes, thus more attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment of diabetes to rescue the pathological attacks of maternal diabetes from the offspring.Copyright © 2023 Yan, Feng, Yu, Tian, Zhou, Huang, Cai, Chen, Zhu and Jin."
"37264412","Genome-wide mapping of gene-microbe interactions in the murine lung microbiota based on quantitative microbial profiling.","Anim Microbiome","Mammalian lungs comprise a complex microbial ecosystem that interacts with host physiology. Previous research demonstrates that the environment significantly contributes to bacterial community structure in the upper and lower respiratory tract. However, the influence of host genetics on the makeup of lung microbiota remains ambiguous, largely due to technical difficulties related to sampling, as well as challenges inherent to investigating low biomass communities. Thus, innovative approaches are warranted to clarify host-microbe interactions in the mammalian lung.Here, we aimed to characterize host genomic regions associated with lung bacterial traits in an advanced intercross mouse line (AIL). By performing quantitative microbial profiling (QMP) using the highly precise method of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), we refined 16S rRNA gene amplicon-based traits to identify and map candidate lung-resident taxa using a QTL mapping approach. In addition, the two abundant core taxa Lactobacillus and Pelomonas were chosen for independent microbial phenotyping using genus-specific primers. In total, this revealed seven significant loci involving eight bacterial traits. The narrow confidence intervals afforded by the AIL population allowed us to identify several promising candidate genes related to immune and inflammatory responses, cell apoptosis, DNA repair, and lung functioning and disease susceptibility. Interestingly, one genomic region associated with Lactobacillus abundance contains the well-known anti-inflammatory cytokine Il10, which we confirmed through the analysis of Il10 knockout mice.Our study provides the first evidence for a role of host genetic variation contributing to variation in the lung microbiota. This was in large part made possible through the careful curation of 16S rRNA gene amplicon data and the incorporation of a QMP-based methods. This approach to evaluating the low biomass lung environment opens new avenues for advancing lung microbiome research using animal models.© 2023. The Author(s)."

This study aims to screen and identify biomarkers of PD for earlier intervention. We performed a differential analysis of postmortem brain transcriptome studies. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify biomarkers related to Braak stage. We found 58 genes with significantly different expression in both PD brain tissue and blood samples. PD gene signature and risk score model consisting of nine genes were constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) and logistic regression. PLOD3 and LRRN3 in gene signature were identified to serve as key genes as well as potential risk factors in PD. Gene function enrichment analysis and evaluation of immune cell infiltration revealed that PLOD3 was implicated in suppression of cellular metabolic function and inflammatory cell infiltration, whereas LRRN3 exhibited an inverse trend. The cellular subpopulation expression of the PLOD3 and LRRN3 has significant distributional variability. The expression of PLOD3 was more enriched in inflammatory cell subpopulations, such as microglia, whereas LRRN3 was more enriched in neurons and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells clusters (OPC). Additionally, the expression of PLOD3 and LRRN3 in Qilu cohort was verified to be consistent with previous results. Collectively, we screened and identified the functions of PLOD3 and LRRN3 based the integrated study. The combined detection of PLOD3 and LRRN3 expression in blood samples can improve the early detection of PD.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37079675","The evolution of two transmissible cancers in Tasmanian devils.","Science","Tasmanian devils have spawned two transmissible cancer lineages, named devil facial tumor 1 (DFT1) and devil facial tumor 2 (DFT2). We investigated the genetic diversity and evolution of these clones by analyzing 78 DFT1 and 41 DFT2 genomes relative to a newly assembled, chromosome-level reference. Time-resolved phylogenetic trees reveal that DFT1 first emerged in 1986 (1982 to 1989) and DFT2 in 2011 (2009 to 2012). Subclone analysis documents transmission of heterogeneous cell populations. DFT2 has faster mutation rates than DFT1 across all variant classes, including substitutions, indels, rearrangements, transposable element insertions, and copy number alterations, and we identify a hypermutated DFT1 lineage with defective DNA mismatch repair. Several loci show plausible evidence of positive selection in DFT1 or DFT2, including loss of chromosome Y and inactivation ofMGA, but none are common to both cancers. This study reveals the parallel long-term evolution of two transmissible cancers inhabiting a common niche in Tasmanian devils."
"37220953","Emerging organoid-immune co-culture models for cancer research: from oncoimmunology to personalized immunotherapies.","J Immunother Cancer","In the past decade, treatments targeting the immune system have revolutionized the cancer treatment field. Therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved as first-line treatment in a variety of solid tumors such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer while other therapies, for instance, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) lymphocyte transfer therapies, are still in development. Although promising results are obtained in a small subset of patients, overall clinical efficacy of most immunotherapeutics is limited due to intertumoral heterogeneity and therapy resistance. Therefore, prediction of patient-specific responses would be of great value for efficient use of costly immunotherapeutic drugs as well as better outcomes. Because many immunotherapeutics operate by enhancing the interaction and/or recognition of malignant target cells by T cells, in vitro cultures using the combination of these cells derived from the same patient hold great promise to predict drug efficacy in a personalized fashion. The use of two-dimensional cancer cell lines for such cultures is unreliable due to altered phenotypical behavior of cells when compared with the in vivo situation. Three-dimensional tumor-derived organoids, better mimic in vivo tissue and are deemed a more realistic approach to study the complex tumor-immune interactions. In this review, we present an overview of the development of patient-specific tumor organoid-immune co-culture models to study the tumor-specific immune interactions and their possible therapeutic infringement. We also discuss applications of these models which advance personalized therapy efficacy and understanding the tumor microenvironment such as: (1) Screening for efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition and CAR therapy screening in a personalized manner. (2) Generation of tumor reactive lymphocytes for adoptive cell transfer therapies. (3) Studying tumor-immune interactions to detect cell-specific roles in tumor progression and remission. Overall, these onco-immune co-cultures might hold a promising future toward developing patient-specific therapeutic approaches as well as increase our understanding of tumor-immune interactions.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

The present study aimed to unveil potential mechanisms, and to inform prognosis and treatment.Plasma proteome from Long-COVID outpatients was analyzed in comparison to matched acutely ill COVID-19 (mild and severe) inpatients and healthy control subjects. The expression of 3072 protein biomarkers was determined with proximity extension assays and then deconvoluted with multiple bioinformatics tools into both cell types and signaling mechanisms, as well as organ specificity.Compared to age- and sex-matched acutely ill COVID-19 inpatients and healthy control subjects, Long-COVID outpatients showed natural killer cell redistribution with a dominant resting phenotype, as opposed to active, and neutrophils that formed extracellular traps. This potential resetting of cell phenotypes was reflected in prospective vascular events mediated by both angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1) and vascular-endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA). Several markers (ANGPT1, VEGFA, CCR7, CD56, citrullinated histone 3, elastase) were validated by serological methods in additional patient cohorts. Signaling of transforming growth factor-β1 with probable connections to elevated EP/p300 suggested vascular inflammation and tumor necrosis factor-α driven pathways. In addition, a vascular proliferative state associated with hypoxia inducible factor 1 pathway suggested progression from acute COVID-19 to Long-COVID. The vasculo-proliferative process predicted in Long-COVID might contribute to changes in the organ-specific proteome reflective of neurologic and cardiometabolic dysfunction.Taken together, our findings point to a vasculo-proliferative process in Long-COVID that is likely initiated either prior hypoxia (localized or systemic) and/or stimulatory factors (i.e., cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, angiotensin, etc). Analyses of the plasma proteome, used as a surrogate for cellular signaling, unveiled potential organ-specific prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We identified independent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) quantitative trait loci (pQTL) from COPDGene and Jackson Heart Study (JHS), calculated continuous protein level genotype probabilities, and then applied a naïve Bayesian approach to link SomaScan 1.3K proteomes to genomes for 2812 independent subjects from COPDGene, JHS, SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). We correctly linked 90-95% of proteomes to their correct genome and for 95-99% we identify the 1% most likely links. The linking accuracy in subjects with African ancestry was lower (~ 60%) unless training included diverse subjects. With larger profiling (SomaScan 5K) in the Atherosclerosis Risk Communities (ARIC) correct identification was > 99% even in mixed ancestry populations. We also linked proteomes-to-proteomes and used the proteome only to determine features such as sex, ancestry, and first-degree relatives. When serial proteomes are available, the linking algorithm can be used to identify and correct mislabeled samples. This work also demonstrates the importance of including diverse populations in omics research and that large proteomic datasets (> 1000 proteins) can be accurately linked to a specific genome through pQTL knowledge and should not be considered unidentifiable.© 2023.

While cancer cells have been found with mutated or misexpressed cohesin genes, there is no comprehensive survey about the presence and role of abnormal cohesin binding in cancer cells. Here, we systematically identified ∼1% of cohesin-binding sites (701-2,633) as cancer-aberrant binding sites of cohesin (CASs). We integrated CASs with large-scale transcriptomics, epigenomics, 3D genomics, and clinical information. CASs represent tissue-specific epigenomic signatures enriched for cancer-dysregulated genes with functional and clinical significance. CASs exhibited alterations in chromatin compartments, loops within topologically associated domains, andcis-regulatory elements, indicating that CASs induce dysregulated genes through misguided chromatin structure. Cohesin depletion data suggested that cohesin binding at CASs actively regulates cancer-dysregulated genes. Overall, our comprehensive investigation suggests that aberrant cohesin binding is an essential epigenomic signature responsible for dysregulated chromatin structure and transcription in cancer cells.© 2023 The Authors."

Most single-cell multiomics integration methods focus on shared information among modalities while complementary information specific to each modality is often discarded.To disentangle and combine shared and complementary information across modalities, we develop a dual-modality factor model named scME by using deep factor modeling. Our results demonstrate that scME can generate a better joint representation of multiple modalities than those generated by other single-cell multiomics integration algorithms, which gives a clear elucidation of nuanced differences among cells. We also demonstrate that the joint representation of multiple modalities yielded by scME can provide salient information to improve both single-cell clustering and cell-type classification.

While this scar was traditionally believed to be primarily responsible for axonal regeneration failure, current knowledge takes a more holistic approach that considers the intrinsic growth capacity of axons. Targeting the SCI scar has also not reproducibly yielded nearly the same efficacy in animal models compared to these neuron-directed approaches. These results suggest that the major reason behind central nervous system (CNS) regeneration failure is not the injury scar but a failure to stimulate axon growth adequately. These findings raise questions about whether targeting neuroinflammation and glial scarring still constitute viable translational avenues. We provide a comprehensive review of the dual role of neuroinflammation and scarring after SCI and how future research can produce therapeutic strategies targeting the hurdles to axonal regeneration posed by these processes without compromising neuroprotection.Copyright © 2023 Shafqat, Albalkhi, Magableh, Saleh, Alkattan and Yaqinuddin."

Here, we show that interaction between glial cells - astrocytes and mature myelin-forming oligodendrocytes - is a determinant of remyelination. Using in vivo/ ex vivo/ in vitro rodent models, unbiased RNA sequencing, functional manipulation, and human brain lesion analyses, we discover that astrocytes support the survival of regenerating oligodendrocytes, via downregulation of the Nrf2 pathway associated with increased astrocytic cholesterol biosynthesis pathway activation. Remyelination fails following sustained astrocytic Nrf2 activation in focally-lesioned male mice yet is restored by either cholesterol biosynthesis/efflux stimulation, or Nrf2 inhibition using the existing therapeutic Luteolin. We identify that astrocyte-oligodendrocyte interaction regulates remyelination, and reveal a drug strategy for central nervous system regeneration centred on targeting this interaction.© 2023.

Of these, multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent and studied, as it affects about a million people in the USA alone. The understanding of the mechanisms underlying their pathology has been advancing, although there are still no highly effective disease-modifying treatments for the progressive symptoms and disability in the late stages of disease. Among these mechanisms, the action of glial cells upon lesion and regeneration has become a prominent research topic, helped not only by the discovery of glia as targets of autoantibodies, but also by their role on CNS homeostasis and neuroinflammation. In the present article, we discuss the participation of glial cells in IDDs, as well as their association with demyelination and synaptic dysfunction throughout the course of the disease and in experimental models, with a focus on MS phenotypes. Further, we discuss the involvement of microglia and astrocytes in lesion formation and organization, remyelination, synaptic induction and pruning through different signaling pathways. We argue that evidence of the several glia-mediated mechanisms in the course of CNS demyelinating diseases supports glial cells as viable targets for therapy development.Copyright © 2023 Coutinho Costa, Araújo, Alves-Leon and Gomes."

Aging induces changes that affect all systems of the body. The risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer increases with age. In particular, the age-induced adaptation of the immune system causes a greater susceptibility to infections and contributes to the inability to control pathogen growth and immune-mediated tissue damage. Since the impact of aging on immune function, is still to be fully elucidated, this review addresses some of the recent understanding of age-related changes affecting key components of immunity.

"37291105","Inflammation and aging: signaling pathways and intervention therapies.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Aging is characterized by systemic chronic inflammation, which is accompanied by cellular senescence, immunosenescence, organ dysfunction, and age-related diseases. Given the multidimensional complexity of aging, there is an urgent need for a systematic organization of inflammaging through dimensionality reduction. Factors secreted by senescent cells, known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), promote chronic inflammation and can induce senescence in normal cells. At the same time, chronic inflammation accelerates the senescence of immune cells, resulting in weakened immune function and an inability to clear senescent cells and inflammatory factors, which creates a vicious cycle of inflammation and senescence. Persistently elevated inflammation levels in organs such as the bone marrow, liver, and lungs cannot be eliminated in time, leading to organ damage and aging-related diseases. Therefore, inflammation has been recognized as an endogenous factor in aging, and the elimination of inflammation could be a potential strategy for anti-aging. Here we discuss inflammaging at the molecular, cellular, organ, and disease levels, and review current aging models, the implications of cutting-edge single cell technologies, as well as anti-aging strategies. Since preventing and alleviating aging-related diseases and improving the overall quality of life are the ultimate goals of aging research, our review highlights the critical features and potential mechanisms of inflammation and aging, along with the latest developments and future directions in aging research, providing a theoretical foundation for novel and practical anti-aging strategies.© 2023.

"37277738","The role of peripheral inflammatory insults in Alzheimer's disease: a review and research roadmap.","Mol Neurodegener","Peripheral inflammation, defined as inflammation that occurs outside the central nervous system, is an age-related phenomenon that has been identified as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. While the role of chronic peripheral inflammation has been well characterized in the context of dementia and other age-related conditions, less is known about the neurologic contribution of acute inflammatory insults that take place outside the central nervous system. Herein, we define acute inflammatory insults as an immune challenge in the form of pathogen exposure (e.g., viral infection) or tissue damage (e.g., surgery) that causes a large, yet time-limited, inflammatory response. We provide an overview of the clinical and translational research that has examined the connection between acute inflammatory insults and Alzheimer's disease, focusing on three categories of peripheral inflammatory insults that have received considerable attention in recent years: acute infection, critical illness, and surgery. Additionally, we review immune and neurobiological mechanisms which facilitate the neural response to acute inflammation and discuss the potential role of the blood-brain barrier and other components of the neuro-immune axis in Alzheimer's disease. After highlighting the knowledge gaps in this area of research, we propose a roadmap to address methodological challenges, suboptimal study design, and paucity of transdisciplinary research efforts that have thus far limited our understanding of how pathogen- and damage-mediated inflammatory insults may contribute to Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we discuss how therapeutic approaches designed to promote the resolution of inflammation may be used following acute inflammatory insults to preserve brain health and limit progression of neurodegenerative pathology.© 2023.

Since our mouse AVF model recapitulates sex differences in human AVF maturation, we hypothesized that sex hormones mediate these differences during AVF maturation. C57BL/6 mice (9-11 wk) were treated with aortocaval AVF surgery and/or gonadectomy. AVF hemodynamics were measured via ultrasound (days 0-21). Blood was collected for FACS and tissue for immunofluorescence and ELISA (days 3and7); wall thickness was assessed by histology (day 21). Inferior vena cava shear stress was higher in male mice (P= 0.0028) after gonadectomy, and they had increased wall thickness (22.0 ± 1.8 vs. 12.7 ± 1.2 µm;P< 0.0001). Conversely, female mice had decreased wall thickness (6.8 ± 0.6 vs. 15.3 ± 0.9 µm;P= 0.0002).

This disappeared after gonadectomy. Furthermore, female mice had higher IL-10 (P= 0.0217) and TNF-α (P= 0.0417) levels in their AVF walls than male mice. Sex hormones mediate AVF maturation, suggesting that hormone receptor signaling may be a target to improve AVF maturation.NEW & NOTEWORTHYAfter arteriovenous fistula creation, females have lower rates of maturation and higher rates of failure than males. In a mouse model of venous adaptation that recapitulates human fistula maturation, sex hormones may be mechanisms of the sexual dimorphism: testosterone is associated with reduced shear stress, whereas estrogen is associated with increased immune cell recruitment. Modulating sex hormones or downstream effectors suggests sex-specific therapies and could address disparities in sex differences in clinical outcomes."
"37293552","Unsupervised neural network for single cell Multi-omics INTegration (UMINT): an application to health and disease.","Front Mol Biosci","Multi-omics studies have enabled us to understand the mechanistic drivers behind complex disease states and progressions, thereby providing novel and actionable biological insights into health status. However, integrating data from multiple modalities is challenging due to high dimensionality and diverse nature of data, and noise associated with each platform. Sparsity in data, non-overlapping features and technical batch effects make the task of learning more complicated. Conventional machine learning (ML) tools are not quite effective against such data integration hazards due to their simplistic nature with less capacity. In addition, existing methods for single cell multi-omics integration are computationally expensive. Therefore, in this work, we have introduced a novel Unsupervised neural network for single cell Multi-omics INTegration (UMINT). UMINT serves as a promising model for integrating variable number of single cell omics layers with high dimensions. It has a light-weight architecture with substantially reduced number of parameters. The proposed model is capable of learning a latent low-dimensional embedding that can extract useful features from the data facilitating further downstream analyses. UMINT has been applied to integrate healthy and disease CITE-seq (paired RNA and surface proteins) datasets including a rare disease Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) tumor. It has been benchmarked against existing state-of-the-art methods for single cell multi-omics integration. Furthermore, UMINT is capable of integrating paired single cell gene expression and ATAC-seq (Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) assays as well.Copyright © 2023 Maitra, Seal, Das and De."
"37289906","Air Pollution, Built Environment, and Early Cardiovascular Disease.","Circ Res","As the world's population becomes increasingly urbanized, there is growing concern about the impact of urban environments on cardiovascular health. Urban residents are exposed to a variety of adverse environmental exposures throughout their lives, including air pollution, built environment, and lack of green space, which may contribute to the development of early cardiovascular disease and related risk factors. While epidemiological studies have examined the role of a few environmental factors with early cardiovascular disease, the relationship with the broader environment remains poorly defined. In this article, we provide a brief overview of studies that have examined the impact of the environment including the built physical environment, discuss current challenges in the field, and suggest potential directions for future research. Additionally, we highlight the clinical implications of these findings and propose multilevel interventions to promote cardiovascular health among children and young adults."

We found changes associated with PD, cognitive status, levodopa levels, and disease progression. The affected pathways include neurotransmitters, bile acids, homocysteine metabolism, amino acids, TCA cycle, polyamines, β-alanine metabolism, fatty acids, acylcarnitines, ceramides, phosphatidylcholines, and several microbiome-derived metabolites. Previously reported levodopa-related homocysteine accumulation in cortex still best explains the dementia status in PD, which can be modified by dietary supplementation.

"37284065","Expression quantitative trait locus studies in the era of single-cell omics.","Front Genet","Genome-wide association studies have revealed that the regulation of gene expression bridges genetic variants and complex phenotypes. Profiling of the bulk transcriptome coupled with linkage analysis (expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping) has advanced our understanding of the relationship between genetic variants and gene regulation in the context of complex phenotypes. However, bulk transcriptomics has inherited limitations as the regulation of gene expression tends to be cell-type-specific. The advent of single-cell RNA-seq technology now enables the identification of the cell-type-specific regulation of gene expression through a single-cell eQTL (sc-eQTL). In this review, we first provide an overview of sc-eQTL studies, including data processing and the mapping procedure of the sc-eQTL. We then discuss the benefits and limitations of sc-eQTL analyses. Finally, we present an overview of the current and future applications of sc-eQTL discoveries.Copyright © 2023 Luo, Wu, Cheng, Chen, Wang and Song."

Germline mutations were detected by GATK tools. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data on ACGEJ samples were taken from our previous studies. Public single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were used to produce the proportion of epithelial cells. Matrix eQTL and a linear mixed model were used to identify condition-specific cis-eQTLs. The R package coloc was used to perform co-localization analysis with the public data of genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Log-rank and Cox regression tests were used to identify survival-associated eQTL and genes. Functions of candidate risk loci were explored by experimental validation.Results:Refined eQTL analyses of paired ACGEJ samples were performed and 2,036 potential ACGEJ-specific eQTLs with East Asian specificity were identified in total. ACGEJ-gain eQTLs were enriched at promoter regions more than ACGEJ-loss eQTLs. rs658524 was identified as the top eQTL close to the transcription start site of its paired gene (CTSW). rs2240191-RASAL1, rs4236599-FOXP2, rs4947311-PSORS1C1, rs13134812-LOC391674, and rs17508585-CDK13-DTwere identified as ACGEJ-specific susceptibility eQTLs. rs309483-LINC01355was associated with the overall survival of ACGEJ patients. We explored functions of candidate eQTLs such as rs658524, rs309483, rs2240191, and rs4947311 by experimental validation.Conclusion:This study provides new risk loci for ACGEJ susceptibility and effective disease prognosis biomarkers.Copyright © 2023 Zhong, Wu, Lin and Lin."

However, LBH expression in most cancer types remains unknown, impeding understanding of its mechanistic function Here, we performed systematic bioinformatic and TMA analysis for LBH in >20 different cancer types. LBH was overexpressed in most cancers compared to normal tissues (>1.5-fold; p < 0.05), including colon-rectal, pancreatic, esophageal, liver, stomach, bladder, kidney, prostate, testicular, brain, head & neck cancers, and sarcoma, correlating with poor prognosis. The cancer types showing LBH downregulation were lung, melanoma, ovarian, cervical, and uterine cancer, while both LBH over- and under-expression were observed in hematopoietic malignancies. In cancers with LBH overexpression, the LBH locus was frequently hypomethylated, identifying DNA hypomethylation as a potential mechanism for LBH dysregulation. Pathway analysis identified a universal, prognostically significant correlation between LBH overexpression and the WNT-Integrin signaling pathways. Validation of the clinical association of LBH with WNT activation in gastrointestinal cancer cell lines, and in colorectal patient samples by IHC uncovered that LBH is specifically expressed in tumor cells with nuclear beta-catenin at the invasive front. Collectively, these data reveal a high degree of LBH dysregulation in cancer and establish LBH as pan-cancer biomarker for detecting WNT hyperactivation in clinical specimens.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We take a developmentally-sensitive approach to examine the neurodevelopmental sequelae of early adversity in a preregistered meta-analysis of 27,234 youth (birth to 18-years-old), providing the largest group of adversity-exposed youth to date. Findings demonstrate that early-life adversity does not have an ontogenetically uniform impact on brain volumes, but instead exhibits age-, experience-, and region-specific associations. Relative to non-exposed comparisons, interpersonal early adversity (e.g., family-based maltreatment) was associated with initially larger volumes in frontolimbic regions until ∼10-years-old, after which these exposures were linked to increasingly smaller volumes. By contrast, socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., poverty) was associated with smaller volumes in temporal-limbic regions in childhood, which were attenuated at older ages. These findings advance ongoing debates regarding why, when, and how early-life adversity shapes later neural outcomes.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"37287865","Healthcare is not about health.","FASEB Bioadv","Initiatives designed to reduce the disease burden and improve the health of the US population that focus on increasing access to health care have been disappointing. Progress requires multifaceted change. We must first acknowledge that the healthcare system is focused on reversing or modifying disease, not enhancing health. Our conceptualization of the development of ill health and disease must also change. Scientific advances are clarifying the complex interactions among the development of ill health and disease and an individual's behaviors, their microbiota, and their physical, social, and emotional environments. A person's genetic makeup predisposes them to a wide array of disease conditions but is rarely deterministic in and of itself. Factors extrinsic to the individual, including the social determinants of health, play a major role in disease development, often decades later. The complexity of health and disease requires a ""team"" accountable for the health of our populations, and these teams must be expanded beyond the medical professions. Governmental officials, architects, business leaders, civic organizations, social and neighborhood groups are among the key stakeholders on the health side of the equation. If and when disease does become manifest, then the care part of the healthcare system assumes the larger role. This has major implications for the education of our clinically focused health science students, but also of professional disciplines previously deemed peripheral to health. Simply redoubling our efforts and focusing on our current healthcare system is insufficient to make progress in the health of the populace.

"37205426","Association between circulating inflammatory markers and adult cancer risk: a Mendelian randomization analysis.","medRxiv","Tumour-promoting inflammation is a ""hallmark"" of cancer and conventional epidemiological studies have reported links between various inflammatory markers and cancer risk. The causal nature of these relationships and, thus, the suitability of these markers as intervention targets for cancer prevention is unclear.We meta-analysed 6 genome-wide association studies of circulating inflammatory markers comprising 59,969 participants of European ancestry. We then used combinedcis-Mendelian randomization and colocalisation analysis to evaluate the causal role of 66 circulating inflammatory markers in risk of 30 adult cancers in 338,162 cancer cases and up to 824,556 controls. Genetic instruments for inflammatory markers were constructed using genome-wide significant (P< 5.0 x 10-8)cis-acting SNPs (i.e. in or ±250 kb from the gene encoding the relevant protein) in weak linkage disequilibrium (LD, r2< 0.10). Effect estimates were generated using inverse-variance weighted random-effects models and standard errors were inflated to account for weak LD between variants with reference to the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 CEU panel. A false discovery rate (FDR)-correctedP-value (""q-value"") < 0.05 was used as a threshold to define ""strong evidence"" to support associations and 0.05 ≤q-value < 0.20 to define ""suggestive evidence"". A colocalisation posterior probability (PPH4) > 70% was employed to indicate support for shared causal variants across inflammatory markers and cancer outcomes.We found strong evidence to support an association of genetically-proxied circulating pro-adrenomedullin concentrations with increased breast cancer risk (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.10-1.29,q-value=0.033, PPH4=84.3%) and suggestive evidence to support associations of interleukin-23 receptor concentrations with increased pancreatic cancer risk (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.20-1.69,q-value=0.055, PPH4=73.9%), prothrombin concentrations with decreased basal cell carcinoma risk (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53-0.81,q-value=0.067, PPH4=81.8%), macrophage migration inhibitory factor concentrations with increased bladder cancer risk (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.23,q-value=0.072, PPH4=76.1%), and interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 concentrations with decreased triple-negative breast cancer risk (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.97,q-value=0.15), PPH4=85.6%). For 22 of 30 cancer outcomes examined, there was little evidence (q-value ≥ 0.20) that any of the 66 circulating inflammatory markers examined were associated with cancer risk.Our comprehensive joint Mendelian randomization and colocalisation analysis of the role of circulating inflammatory markers in cancer risk identified potential roles for 5 circulating inflammatory markers in risk of 5 site-specific cancers. Contrary to reports from some prior conventional epidemiological studies, we found little evidence of association of circulating inflammatory markers with the majority of site-specific cancers evaluated."

Initially, microarrays are used to study the bulk transcriptome; but now short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) predominates. Positioned as a superior technology, that makes the discovery of novel transcripts routine, most RNA-seq analyses are in fact modeled on the known transcriptome. Limitations of the RNA-seq methodology have emerged, while the design of, and the analysis strategies applied to, arrays have matured. An equitable comparison between these technologies is provided, highlighting advantages that modern arrays hold over RNA-seq. Array protocols more accurately quantify constitutively expressed protein coding genes across tissue replicates, and are more reliable for studying lower expressed genes. Arrays reveal long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) are neither sparsely nor lower expressed than protein coding genes. Heterogeneous coverage of constitutively expressed genes observed with RNA-seq, undermines the validity and reproducibility of pathway analyses. The factors driving these observations, many of which are relevant to long-read or single-cell sequencing are discussed. As proposed herein, a reappreciation of bulk transcriptomic methods is required, including wider use of the modern high-density array data-to urgently revise existing anatomical RNA reference atlases and assist with more accurate study of lncRNAs.© 2023 The Authors.

"37127253","Pre- and postnatal developmental exposure to the polychlorinated biphenyl mixture aroclor 1221 alters female rat pituitary gonadotropins and estrogen receptor alpha levels.","Reprod Toxicol","Polychlorinated-biphenyls (PCBs) are industrial compounds, which were widely used in manufacturing of electrical parts and transformers. Despite being banned in 1979 due to human health concerns, they persist in the environment. In humans and experimental model systems, PCBs elicit toxicity in part by acting as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Aroclor 1221 (A1221) is a weakly estrogenic PCB mixture known to alter reproductive function in rodents. EDCs can impact hormone signaling at any level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, and we investigated the effects of A1221 exposure during the prenatal and postnatal developmental periods on pituitary hormone and steroid receptor expression in female rats. Examining offspring at 3 ages, postnatal day 8 (P8), P32 and P60, we found that prenatal exposure to A1221 increased P8 neonate pituitary luteinizing hormone beta (Lhb) mRNA and LHβ gonadotrope cell number while decreasing LH serum hormone concentration. No changes in pituitary hormone or hormone receptor gene expression were observed peri-puberty at P32. In reproductively mature rats at P60, we found pituitary follicle stimulating hormone beta (Fshb) mRNA levels increased by prenatal A1221 exposure with no corresponding alterations in FSH hormone or FSHβ expressing cell number. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) mRNA and protein levels were also increased at P60, but only following postnatal A1221 dosing. Together, these data illustrate that exposure to the PCB A1221, during critical developmental windows, alters pituitary gonadotropin hormone subunits and ERα levels in offspring at different phases of maturation, potentially impacting reproductive function in concert with other components of the HPG axis.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

The prognostic relevance of PCD-related genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, there is still a lack of efforts to compare the methylation status of different types of PCD genes in HCC and their roles in its surveillance. The methylation status of genes related to pyroptosis, apoptosis, autophagy, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis was analyzed in tumor and non-tumor tissues from TCGA. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data of paired tumor tissue and buffy coat samples were used to filter the potential interference of blood leukocytes in cell-free DNA (cfDNA). The WGBS data of healthy individuals' and early-stage HCC patients' cfDNA were analyzed to evaluate the distinguishing ability. The average gene body methylation (gbDNAme) of pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) was significantly altered in HCC tissues relative to normal tissues, and their distinguishing ability was higher compared to the other types of PCD-related genes. The gbDNAme of NLRP7, NLRP2, and NLRP3 was reflective of the hypomethylation in HCC tissues, and methylation levels of NLRP3 correlated positively with its expression level (r=0.51). The candidate hypomethylated PRGs could discriminate between early HCC patients and healthy controls in cfDNA analysis with high accuracy (area under the receiver operation curve, AUC=0.94). Furthermore, the hypomethylation of PRGs was associated with poor prognosis of HCC. Gene body hypomethylation of PRGs is a promising biomarker for early HCC detection, monitoring of tumor recurrence, and prognosis prediction.© 2023.

Preconception period and pregnancy are crucial windows for the implementation of child obesity prevention interventions with parental lifestyle factors as relevant targets. So far, most studies have evaluated their role separately, with only a few having investigated their potential synergistic effect on childhood obesity. Our objective was to investigate parental lifestyle patterns in the preconception and pregnancy periods and their association with the risk of child overweight after 5 years.We harmonized and interpreted results from four European mother-offspring cohorts participating in the EndObesity Consortium [EDEN, France; Elfe, France; Lifeways, Ireland; and Generation R, Netherlands] with data available for 1,900, 18,000, 1,100, and 9,500 families, respectively. Lifestyle factors were collected using questionnaires and included parental smoking, body mass index (BMI), gestational weight gain, diet, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. We applied principal component analyses to identify parental lifestyle patterns in preconception and pregnancy. Their association with risk of overweight (including obesity; OW-OB) and BMIz-scores between 5 and 12 years were assessed using cohort-specific multivariable logistic and linear and regression models (adjusted for potential confounders including parental age, education level, employment status, geographic origin, parity, and household income).Among the various lifestyle patterns derived in all cohorts, the two explaining the most variance were characterized by (1) ""high parental smoking, low maternal diet quality (and high maternal sedentary behavior in some cohorts)"" and, (2) ""high parental BMI and low gestational weight gain."" Patterns characterized by high parental BMI, smoking, low diet quality or high sedentary lifestyle before or during pregnancy were associated with higher risk of OW-OB in children, and BMIz-score at any age, with consistent strengths of associations in the main cohorts, except for lifeways.This project provides insight into how combined parental lifestyle factors in the preconception and pregnancy periods are associated with the future risk of child obesity. These findings are valuable to inform family-based and multi-behavioural child obesity prevention strategies in early life.Copyright © 2023 Lecorguillé, Schipper, O’Donnell, Aubert, Tafflet, Gassama, Douglass, Hébert, de Lauzon-Guillain, Kelleher, Charles, Phillips, Gaillard, Lioret and Heude."
"37293545","Olink proteomics profiling platform reveals non-invasive inflammatory related protein biomarkers in autism spectrum disorder.","Front Mol Neurosci","Owing to the lack of valid biomarkers, the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis relies solely on the behavioral phenotypes of children. Several researchers have suggested an association between ASD and inflammation; however, the complex relationship between the two is unelucidated to date. Therefore, the current study aims to comprehensively identify novel circulating ASD inflammatory biomarkers.Olink proteomics was applied to compare the plasma inflammation-related protein changes in a group of the healthy children (HC,n = 33) and another with ASD (n = 31). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were calculated. The functional analysis of the DEPs was performed using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes and Genomes. Pearson correlation tests were used employed to analyze the correlation between the DEPs and clinical features.A total of 13 DEPs were significantly up-regulated in the ASD group compared with the HC group. The four proteins, namely, STAMBP, ST1A1, SIRT2, and MMP-10 demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy with the corresponding AUCs (95% confidence interval, CI) of 0.7218 (0.5946-0.8489), 0.7107 (0.5827-0.8387), 0.7016 (0.5713-0.8319), and 0.7006 (0.568-0.8332). Each panel of STAMBP and any other differential protein demonstrated a better classification performance [AUC values from 0.7147 (0.5858-0.8436, STAMBP/AXIN1) to 0.7681 (0.6496-0.8867, STAMBP/MMP-10)]. These DEP profiles were enriched in immune and inflammatory response pathways, including TNF and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. The interaction between STAMBP and SIRT2 (R = 0.97,p = 8.52 × 10-39) was found to be the most significant. In addition, several DEPs related to clinical features in patients with ASD, particularly AXIN1 (R = 0.36,p = 0.006), SIRT2 (R = 0.34,p = 0.010) and STAMBP (R = 0.34,p = 0.010), were positively correlated with age and parity, indicating that older age and higher parity may be the inflammation-related clinical factors in ASD.Inflammation plays a crucial role in ASD, and the up-regulated inflammatory proteins may serve as potential early diagnostic biomarkers for ASD.Copyright © 2023 Bao, Chen, Liu, Tan, Chen, Zhang, Lu and Li."

Glioblastoma is one of the aggressive and prevalent malignant diseases characterized by rapid growth and invasion resulting from cell migration and degradation of extracellular matrix. While the latter is characterized by extracellular plaques of amyloid and intracellular tangles of tau proteins. Both possess a high degree of resistance to treatment owing to the restricted transport of corresponding drugs to the brain protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Development of optimized therapies using advanced technologies is a great need of today. One such approach is the designing of nanoparticles (NPs) to facilitate the drug delivery at the target site. The present article elaborates the advances in nanomedicines in treatment of both AD as well as Gliomas. The intention of this review is to provide an overview of different types of NPs with their physical properties emphasizing their importance in traversing the BBB and hitting the target site. Further, we discuss the therapeutic applications of these NPs along with their specific targets. Multiple overlapping factors with a common pathway in development of AD and Glioblastoma are discussed in details that will assist the readers in developing the conceptual approach to target the NP for an aging population in the given circumstances with limitations of currently designed NPs, and the challenges to meet and the future perspectives.© 2023 Anwar et al."
"37268723","Neural cell state shifts and fate loss in ageing and age-related diseases.","Nat Rev Neurol","Most age-related neurodegenerative diseases remain incurable owing to an incomplete understanding of the disease mechanisms. Several environmental and genetic factors contribute to disease onset, with human biological ageing being the primary risk factor. In response to acute cellular damage and external stimuli, somatic cells undergo state shifts characterized by temporal changes in their structure and function that increase their resilience, repair cellular damage, and lead to their mobilization to counteract the pathology. This basic cell biological principle also applies to human brain cells, including mature neurons that upregulate developmental features such as cell cycle markers or glycolytic reprogramming in response to stress. Although such temporary state shifts are required to sustain the function and resilience of the young human brain, excessive state shifts in the aged brain might result in terminal fate loss of neurons and glia, characterized by a permanent change in cell identity. Here, we offer a new perspective on the roles of cell states in sustaining health and counteracting disease, and we examine how cellular ageing might set the stage for pathological fate loss and neurodegeneration. A better understanding of neuronal state and fate shifts might provide the means for a controlled manipulation of cell fate to promote brain resilience and repair.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37264161","Single-nucleus multiregion transcriptomic analysis of brain vasculature in Alzheimer's disease.","Nat Neurosci","Cerebrovascular dysregulation is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the changes that occur in specific cell types have not been fully characterized. Here, we profile single-nucleus transcriptomes in the human cerebrovasculature in six brain regions from 220 individuals with AD and 208 age-matched controls. We annotate 22,514 cerebrovascular cells, including 11 subtypes of endothelial, pericyte, smooth muscle, perivascular fibroblast and ependymal cells. We identify 2,676 differentially expressed genes in AD, including downregulation of PDGFRB in pericytes, and of ABCB1 and ATP10A in endothelial cells, and validate the downregulation of SLC6A1 and upregulation of APOD, INSR and COL4A1 in postmortem AD brain tissues. We detect vasculature, glial and neuronal coexpressed gene modules, suggesting coordinated neurovascular unit dysregulation in AD. Integration with AD genetics reveals 125 AD differentially expressed genes directly linked to AD-associated genetic variants. Lastly, we show that APOE4 genotype-associated differences are significantly enriched among AD-associated genes in capillary and venule endothelial cells, as well as subsets of pericytes and fibroblasts.© 2023.

The aim of this study was to investigate the epigenetic regulation of ICOS in melanoma by DNA methylation.We comprehensively investigate ICOS DNA methylation of specific CpG sites and expression pattern within the melanoma microenvironment with regard to immune correlates, differentiation, clinical outcomes, and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response.Our study revealed a sequence-contextual CpG methylation pattern consistent with an epigenetically regulated gene. We found a cell type-specific methylation pattern and locus-specific correlations and associations of CpG methylation with ICOS mRNA expression, immune infiltration, melanoma differentiation, prognosis, and response to ICB. High ICOS mRNA expression was identified as a surrogate for enriched immune cell infiltration and was associated with favorable overall survival (OS) in non-ICB-treated patients and predicted response and a prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) following ICB therapy initiation. ICOS hypomethylation, however, significantly correlated with poor OS in non-ICB patients but predicted higher response and prolonged PFS and OS in ICB-treated patients. Moreover, we observed cytoplasmic and sporadically nuclear tumor cell-intrinsic ICOS protein expression. Tumor cell-intrinsic ICOS protein and mRNA expression was inducible by pharmacological demethylation with decitabine.Our study identified ICOS DNA methylation and mRNA expression as promising prognostic and predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy in melanoma and points towards a hitherto undescribed role of ICOS in tumor cells.© 2023.

"37285076","Loss of Y chromosome in leukocytes can be regarded as a male-specific age predictor for age group estimation in forensic genetics.","Mol Genet Genomics","Age prediction is an important field in forensic and aging research. Traditional methods used DNA methylation, telomere shortening, and mitochondrial DNA mutations to conduct age prediction models. Sex chromosomes, like the Y chromosome, have a significant role in aging as previously reported in hematopoietic disease and many non-reproductive cancers. Until now, there is no age predictor based on the percentage of loss of Y chromosome (LOY). LOY has been previously revealed to be correlated with Alzheimer's disease, short survival, and higher risk of cancer. The possible correlation of LOY between normal aging was not fully explored. In this study, we conducted age prediction by measuring LOY percentage by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), based on 232 healthy male samples, including 171 blood samples, 49 saliva samples, 12 semen samples. The age group of samples ranges from 0 to 99 years, with two individuals in almost every single age. Pearson correlation method was performed to calculate the correlation index. The result indicated a correlation index of 0.21 (p = 0.0059) between age and LOY percentage in blood samples, with the regression formula being y = - 0.016823 + 0.001098x. The correlation between LOY percentage and age is obvious only when the individuals were divided into different age groups (R = 0.73, p = 0.016). In the studied saliva and semen samples, p-values of the correlation are 0.11 and 0.20, respectively, showing no significant association between age and LOY percentage in these two biological materials. For the first time, we investigated male-specific age predictor based on LOY. The study showed that LOY in leukocytes can be regarded as a male-specific age predictor for age group estimation in forensic genetics. This study might be indicative for forensic applications and aging research.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"37259007","Regulation of chromatin organization during animal regeneration.","Cell Regen","Activation of regeneration upon tissue damages requires the activation of many developmental genes responsible for cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and tissue patterning. Ample evidence revealed that the regulation of chromatin organization functions as a crucial mechanism for establishing and maintaining cellular identity through precise control of gene transcription. The alteration of chromatin organization can lead to changes in chromatin accessibility and/or enhancer-promoter interactions. Like embryogenesis, each stage of tissue regeneration is accompanied by dynamic changes of chromatin organization in regeneration-responsive cells. In the past decade, many studies have been conducted to investigate the contribution of chromatin organization during regeneration in various tissues, organs, and organisms. A collection of chromatin regulators were demonstrated to play critical roles in regeneration. In this review, we will summarize the progress in the understanding of chromatin organization during regeneration in different research organisms and discuss potential common mechanisms responsible for the activation of regeneration response program.© 2023.

"37296226","Y chromosome sequence and epigenomic reconstruction across human populations.","Commun Biol","Recent advances in long-read sequencing technologies have allowed the generation and curation of more complete genome assemblies, enabling the analysis of traditionally neglected chromosomes, such as the human Y chromosome (chrY). Native DNA was sequenced on a MinION Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing device to generate genome assemblies for seven major chrY human haplogroups. We analyzed and compared the chrY enrichment of sequencing data obtained using two different selective sequencing approaches: adaptive sampling and flow cytometry chromosome sorting. We show that adaptive sampling can produce data to create assemblies comparable to chromosome sorting while being a less expensive and time-consuming technique. We also assessed haplogroup-specific structural variants, which would be otherwise difficult to study using short-read sequencing data only. Finally, we took advantage of this technology to detect and profile epigenetic modifications among the considered haplogroups. Altogether, we provide a framework to study complex genomic regions with a simple, fast, and affordable methodology that could be applied to larger population genomics datasets.© 2023.

"37164484","Gaps and complex structurally variant loci in phased genome assemblies.","Genome Res","There has been tremendous progress in phased genome assembly production by combining long-read data with parental information or linked-read data. Nevertheless, a typical phased genome assembly generated by trio-hifiasm still generates more than 140 gaps. We perform a detailed analysis of gaps, assembly breaks, and misorientations from 182 haploid assemblies obtained from a diversity panel of 77 unique human samples. Although trio-based approaches using HiFi are the current gold standard, chromosome-wide phasing accuracy is comparable when using Strand-seq instead of parental data. Importantly, the majority of assembly gaps cluster near the largest and most identical repeats (including segmental duplications [35.4%], satellite DNA [22.3%], or regions enriched in GA/AT-rich DNA [27.4%]). Consequently, 1513 protein-coding genes overlap assembly gaps in at least one haplotype, and 231 are recurrently disrupted or missing from five or more haplotypes. Furthermore, we estimate that 6-7 Mbp of DNA are misorientated per haplotype irrespective of whether trio-free or trio-based approaches are used. Of these misorientations, 81% correspond to bona fide large inversion polymorphisms in the human species, most of which are flanked by large segmental duplications. We also identify large-scale alignment discontinuities consistent with 11.9 Mbp of deletions and 161.4 Mbp of insertions per haploid genome. Although 99% of this variation corresponds to satellite DNA, we identify 230 regions of euchromatic DNA with frequent expansions and contractions, nearly half of which overlap with 197 protein-coding genes. Such variable and incompletely assembled regions are important targets for future algorithmic development and pangenome representation.© 2023 Porubsky et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."
"37269454","Zinc Inhibits Lead-Induced Oxidative Stress and Apoptosis of ST Cells Through ROS/PTEN/PI3K/AKT Axis.","Biol Trace Elem Res","Lead (Pb) is a widely distributed toxic heavy metal element known to have strong male reproductive toxicity, which can result in issues such as abnormal count and morphology of sperm. Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element for the human body that can antagonize the activity of Pb in some physiological environments, and it also possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the specific mechanism of Zn's antagonism against Pb remains largely unclear. In our study, we conducted research using swine testis cells (ST cells) and confirmed that the half maximal inhibitory concentration of Pb on ST cells was 994.4 μM, and the optimal antagonistic concentration of Zn was 10 μM. Based on this information, we treated ST cells with Pb and Zn and detected related indices such as apoptosis, oxidative stress, and the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway using flow cytometry, DCFH-DA staining, RT-PCR, and Western blot. Our results demonstrated that Pb exposure can generate excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), disrupt the antioxidant system, upregulate PTEN expression, and inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway in ST cells. In contrast, Zn significantly inhibited the overproduction of ROS, improved oxidative stress, and decreased PTEN expression, thus protecting the PI3K/AKT pathway compared to Pb-exposed ST cells. Furthermore, we found that Pb exposure exacerbated the expression of genes related to the apoptosis pathway and reduced the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. Furthermore, this situation was significantly improved when co-cultured with Pb and Zn. In summary, our study demonstrated that Zn alleviated Pb-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis through the ROS/PTEN/PI3K/AKT axis in ST cells.© 2023.

"37265937","Study protocol for a Developmental Epidemiological Study of Children born through Reproductive Technologies (DESCRT).","Hum Reprod Open","The primary objective of this study is to determine what parental factors or specific ART may influence the risk for adverse cardiometabolic outcomes among children so conceived and their parents. The secondary objective of this study is to prospectively examine the effects of infertility or ART on the intrauterine environment, obstetric and neonatal outcomes.Pregnancies conceived with ART are at an increased risk of being affected by adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes when compared to spontaneously conceived (SC) pregnancies among fertile women. Small cohort studies have suggested ART-conceived children may have a higher risk of long-term cardiometabolic disturbances as well. Currently, few studies have compared long-term cardiometabolic outcomes among ART-conceived children and non-IVF treated (NIFT) children, to children conceived spontaneously to parents with infertility (subfertile parents).The Developmental Epidemiological Study of Children born through Reproductive Technologies (DESCRT) is a prospective cohort study that aims to: establish a biobank and epidemiological cohort of children born to subfertile or infertile parents who either conceived spontaneously (without assistance) or used reproductive technologies to conceive (all offspring were from couples assessed and/or treated in the same institute); prospectively examine the effects of infertility or ART on the intrauterine environment, obstetric and neonatal outcomes; and determine what parental factors or ART may influence the cardiometabolic risk of children so conceived. Pregnancies and resultant children will be compared by mode of conception, namely offspring that were conceived without medical assistance or SC or following NIFT, IVF with fresh embryo transfer or frozen embryo transfer (FET), and by fertilization method (conventional versus ICSI). DESCRT has a Child group evaluating long-term outcomes of children as well as a Pregnancy group that will compare obstetric and neonatal outcomes of children conceived since the commencement of the study. Recruitment started in May of 2017 and is ongoing. When the study began, we estimated that ∼4000 children would be eligible for enrollment.Eligible participants are first-trimester pregnancies (Pregnancy group) or children (Child group) born to parents who were evaluated at an infertility center in the University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA who were SC or conceived after reproductive treatments (NIFT, IVF ± ICSI, FET). Children in the Child group were conceived at UCSF and born from 2001 onwards. In the Pregnancy group, enrollment began in November of 2017.The primary outcome is the cardiometabolic health of offspring in the Child group, as measured by blood pressure and laboratory data (homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), oral glucose disposition). There are several secondary outcome measures, including: outcomes from parental survey response (assessing parent/child medical history since delivery-incidence of cardiometabolic adverse events), anthropomorphic measurements (BMI, waist circumference, skinfold thickness), and laboratory data (liver enzymes, lipid panel, metabolomic profiles). In the Pregnancy group, outcomes include laboratory assessments (bhCG, maternal serum analytes, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1), and placental growth factor (PlGF)) and placental assessments (placental volume in the second and third trimester and placental weight at delivery). Importantly, aliquots of blood and urine are stored from parents and offspring as part of a biobank. The DESCRT cohort is unique in two ways. First, there is an extensive amount of clinical and laboratory treatment data: parental medical history and physical examination at the time of treatment, along with ovarian reserve and infertility diagnosis; and treatment specifics: for example, fertilization method, culture O2status, embryo quality linked to each participant. These reproductive data will aid in identifying explanatory variables that may influence the primary cardiometabolic outcomes of the offspring-and their parents. Second, the DESCRT control group includes pregnancies and children SC from parents with subfertility, which may help to assess when infertility, as opposed to reproductive treatments, may be affecting offspring cardiometabolic health.This study is funded by the National Institutes of Health NICHD (1R01HD084380-01A1).

However, less is known regarding the effects of these compounds when administered prior to significant senescent cell accumulation. From 4-13 months of age, C57BL/6 male and female mice received monthly oral dosing of either 100 mg/kg Fisetin or a 5 mg/kg Dasatinib (D) plus 50 mg/kg Quercetin (Q) cocktail. During treatment, several aspects of healthy aging were assayed including glucose metabolism using an insulin and glucose tolerance test, cognitive performance using Morris water maze and novel object recognition, and energy metabolism using indirect calorimetry. Afterwards, mice were euthanized for plasma, tissue specific markers of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and white adipose tissue accumulation (WAT). Sexually dimorphic treatment effects were observed. Fisetin treated male mice had reduced SASP, enhanced glucose and energy metabolism, improved cognitive performance, and increased mRNA expression of adiponectin receptor 1 and glucose transporter 4. D + Q treatment had minimal effects in male C57BL/6 mice, but was detrimental to females causing increased SASP expression along with accumulation of WAT depots. Reduced energy metabolism and cognitive performance were also noted. Fisetin treatment had no effect in female C57BL/6 mice potentially due to a slower rate of biological aging. In summary, the senolytic treatment in young adulthood, has beneficial, negligible, or detrimental effects in C57BL/6 mice dependent upon sex and treatment. These observations should serve as a note of caution in this rapidly evolving and expanding field of investigation. Male and female C57BL/6 mice were treated with once monthly oral doses of either Dasatinib (D) + Quercetin (Q) or Fisetin from 4-13 months of age. Males treated with Fisetin had reduced SASP markers (blue spheres) as well as improved metabolism (red flame) and cognition. Females treated with D + Q had increased adiposity and SASP markers (red spheres) along with decreased metabolism (blue flame) and cognitive performance. No effects were observed in females treated with Fisetin or males treated with D + Q.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37275987","Connecting dots in disorders of gut-brain interaction: the interplay of stress and sex hormones in shaping visceral pain.","Front Psychiatry","Visceral pain and stress are tightly intertwined bodily and emotional phenomena, which enable a flexible adaptation to environmental challenges by activating a response repertoire to restore homeostasis along the gut-brain axis. However, visceral pain and stress can persist widely independent of the initial cause, acquiring independent disease values and posing major health burdens as predominant features in disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI). Epidemiological data consistently documents an increased prevalence for women to suffer from chronic visceral pain, possibly shaped by sex hormones and modulated by stress and its biological and psychosocial correlates. Yet, mechanisms underlying the complex interactions between altered visceroception, stress and sex remain widely elusive, especially in clinical populations with DGBI. We herein selectively review mechanisms of interactions between stress and sex in the complex pathophysiology of DGBI. A particular emphasis is laid on visceral pain, in which stress constitutes a major risk factor as well as mediator, and sex-related differences are particularly pronounced. Building on the neurobiology of stress and mechanisms of gut-brain interactions, we highlight putative target mechanismsviawhich visceral pain and stress may converge with sex effects into a triad. Accommodating a global demographic shift, we propose a lifespan perspective in future research, which may enable a more fine-tuned evaluation of this complex interplay exerting distinct challenges during vulnerable developmental phases. This viewpoint may advance our understanding of pathophysiological processes and can ultimately inspire novel tailored prevention strategies and therapeutic approaches in the treatment of chronic visceral pain and DGBI across the lifespan.Copyright © 2023 Labrenz, Merz and Icenhour."

The speed of variety development is limited by long field cycles and advanced generation selections in plant breeding programs. While methods to predict yield from genotype or phenotype data have been proposed, improved performance and integrated models are needed.We propose a machine learning model that leverages both genotype and phenotype measurements by fusing genetic variants with multiple data sources collected by unmanned aerial systems. We use a deep multiple instance learning framework with an attention mechanism that sheds light on the importance given to each input during prediction, enhancing interpretability. Our model reaches 0.754 ± 0.024 Pearson correlation coefficient when predicting yield in similar environmental conditions; a 34.8% improvement over the genotype-only linear baseline (0.559 ± 0.050). We further predict yield on new lines in an unseen environment using only genotypes, obtaining a prediction accuracy of 0.386 ± 0.010, a 13.5% improvement over the linear baseline. Our multi-modal deep learning architecture efficiently accounts for plant health and environment, distilling the genetic contribution and providing excellent predictions. Yield prediction algorithms leveraging phenotypic observations during training therefore promise to improve breeding programs, ultimately speeding up delivery of improved varieties.Available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/PheGeMIL (code) and https://doi.org/doi:10.5061/dryad.kprr4xh5p (data).© The Author(s) 2023.

The aetiologies may include persistent inflammation, unresolved tissue damage or delayed clearance of viral protein or RNA, but the biological differences they represent are not fully understood. Here we evaluate the serum proteome in samples, longitudinally collected from 55 PASC individuals with symptoms lasting ≥60 days after onset of acute infection, in comparison to samples from symptomatically recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected individuals. Our analysis indicates heterogeneity in PASC and identified subsets with distinct signatures of persistent inflammation. Type II interferon signaling and canonical NF-κB signaling (particularly associated with TNF), appear to be the most differentially enriched signaling pathways, distinguishing a group of patients characterized also by a persistent neutrophil activation signature. These findings help to clarify biological diversity within PASC, identify participants with molecular evidence of persistent inflammation, and highlight dominant pathways that may have diagnostic or therapeutic relevance, including a protein panel that we propose as having diagnostic utility for differentiating inflammatory and non-inflammatory PASC.© 2023.

The mechanism of VITT is not well defined and it has not been resolved why cases of VITT are predominated by vaccination with AV vaccines. However, virtually all VITT patients have positive platelet-activating anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibody titers. Subsequently, platelets are activated and depleted in an Fcγ-receptor IIa (FcγRIIa or CD32a)-dependent manner, but it is not clear why or how the anti-PF4 response is mounted.

"37125948","Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes Workshop: Research Priorities Spanning Disease Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Outcomes.","Diabetes Care","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive disorder arising from mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR is expressed in numerous tissues, with high expression in the airways, small and large intestine, pancreatic and hepatobiliary ducts, and male reproductive tract. CFTR loss in these tissues disrupts regulation of salt, bicarbonate, and water balance across their epithelia, resulting in a systemic disorder with progressive organ dysfunction and damage. Pancreatic exocrine damage ultimately manifests as pancreatic exocrine insufficiency that begins as early as infancy. Pancreatic remodeling accompanies this early damage, during which abnormal glucose tolerance can be observed in toddlers. With increasing age, however, insulin secretion defects progress such that CF-related diabetes (CFRD) occurs in 20% of teens and up to half of adults with CF. The relevance of CFRD is highlighted by its association with increased morbidity, mortality, and patient burden. While clinical research on CFRD has greatly assisted in the care of individuals with CFRD, key knowledge gaps on CFRD pathogenesis remain. Furthermore, the wide use of CFTR modulators to restore CFTR activity is changing the CFRD clinical landscape and the field's understanding of CFRD pathogenesis. For these reasons, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation sponsored a CFRD Scientific Workshop, 23-25 June 2021, to define knowledge gaps and needed research areas.

More specifically, AT1R within Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons of the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) has been implicated in selected effects of DOCA-salt. In addition, microglia have been implicated in the cerebrovascular effects of DOCA-salt and angiotensin II. To characterize DOCA-salt effects upon the transcriptomes of individual cell types within the ARC, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) to examine this region from male C57BL/6J mice that underwent sham or DOCA-salt treatment. Thirty-two unique primary cell type clusters were identified. Sub-clustering of neuropeptide-related clusters resulted in identification of three distinct AgRP subclusters. DOCA-salt treatment caused subtype-specific changes in gene expression patterns associated with AT1R and G protein signaling, neurotransmitter uptake, synapse functions, and hormone secretion. In addition, two primary cell type clusters were identified as resting versus activated microglia, and multiple distinct subtypes of activated microglia were suggested by sub-cluster analysis. While DOCA-salt had no overall effect on total microglial density within the ARC, DOCA-salt appeared to cause a redistribution of the relative abundance of activated microglia subtypes. These data provide novel insights into cell-specific molecular changes occurring within the ARC during DOCA-salt treatment, and prompt increased investigation of the physiological and pathophysiological significance of distinct subtypes of neuronal and glial cell types.Copyright © 2023 Wagner, Deng, Claflin, Ritter, Cui, Nakagawa, Sigmund, Morselli, Grobe and Kwitek."

However, no study has analyzed the association of birthweight and gestational age with school trajectory measured simultaneously by school entry, grade repetition, and school dropout. This study aims, first, to analyze the association of birthweight or gestational age with school entry, and second, to explore the relationship between birthweight or gestational age and grade repetition and school dropout among children in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.This study used longitudinal data from the Ouagadougou Health and Demographic Surveillance System. Our samples consisted of children born between 2008 and 2014 who were at least three years old at the beginning of the 2017-18 school year. Samples included 13,676, 3152, and 3498 children for the analysis of the school entry, grade repetition, and dropout, respectively. A discrete-time survival model was used to examine the relationship between birthweight or gestational age and school entry, grade repetition, and dropout. The association between birthweight or gestational age and age at school entry were assessed using a Poisson regression.The incidence rate of school entry was 18.1 per 100 people-years. The incidence of first repetition and dropout were 12.6 and 5.9, respectively. The probability of school entry decreased by 31% (HR:0.69, 95%CI: 0.56-0.85) and 8% (HR:0.92, 95%CI: 0.85-0.99) for children weighing less than 2000 g and those weighing between 2000 and 2499 g, respectively, compared to those born with a normal weight (weight ≥ 2500 g). The age at school entry of children with a birthweight less than 2000 g and between 2000 and 2499 g was 7% (IRR: 1.07, 95%CI: 1.06-1.08) and 3% (IRR: 1.03, 95%CI: 1.00-1.06) higher than children born at a normal birthweight, respectively. Gestational age was not associated with school entry or age at school entry. Similarly, birthweight and gestational age were not associated with grade repetition or dropout.This study shows that low birthweight is negatively associated with school entry and age at school entry in Ouagadougou. Efforts to avoid low birthweights should be part of maternal and prenatal health care because the associated difficulties may be difficult to overcome later in the child's life. Further longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the relationship between development at birth and school trajectory.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, evaluating and choosing causal discovery methods and developing and performing proper workflow remain challenges. We report the workflow and platform CausalCell (http://www.gaemons.net/causalcell/causalDiscovery/) for performing single-cell causal discovery. The workflow/platform is developed upon benchmarking four kinds of causal discovery methods and is examined by analyzing multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets.

ClC-3 is a member of the chloride voltage-gated channel family, and ClC-3 deletion improved the phenotypes of dysglycemic metabolism and the impairment of insulin sensitivity. However, the effects of a healthy diet on transcriptome and epigenetics in ClC-3-/-mice were not explained in detail.Methods:Here, we performed transcriptome sequencing and Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing for the liver of 3 weeks old WT and ClC-3-/-mice consuming a normal diet to insight into the epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations of ClC-3 deficient mice.Results:In the present study, we found that ClC-3-/-mice that were younger than 8 weeks old had smaller bodies compared to ClC-3+/+mice with ad libitum self-feeding normal diet, and ClC-3-/-mice that were older than 10 weeks old had a similar body weight. Except for the spleen, lung, and kidney, the average weight of the heart, liver, and brain in ClC-3-/-mice was lower than that in ClC-3+/+mice. TG, TC, HDL, and LDL in fasting ClC-3-/-mice were not significantly different from those in ClC-3+/+mice. Fasting blood glucose in ClC-3-/-mice was lower than that in ClC-3+/+mice; the glucose tolerance test indicated the response to blood glucose increasing for ClC-3-/-mice was torpid, but the efficiency of lowering blood glucose was much higher once started. Transcriptomic sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing for the liver of unweaned mice indicated that ClC-3 deletion significantly changed transcriptional expression and DNA methylation levels of glucose metabolism-related genes. A total of 92 genes were intersected between DEGs and DMRs-targeted genes, of which Nos3, Pik3r1, Socs1, and Acly were gathered in type II diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, and metabolic pathways. Moreover, Pik3r1 and Acly expressions were obviously correlated with DNA methylation levels, not Nos3 and Socs1. However, the transcriptional levels of these four genes were not different between ClC-3-/-and ClC-3+/+mice at the age of 12 weeks.Discussion:ClC-3 influenced the methylated modification to regulate glucose metabolism, of which the gene expressions could be driven to change again by a personalized diet-style intervention.Copyright © 2023 Jing, Zhang, Wen, Cui, Ren, Liu, Duan, Zhao and Fan."
"37277356","'Multi-omics' data integration: applications in probiotics studies.","NPJ Sci Food","The concept of probiotics is witnessing increasing attention due to its benefits in influencing the host microbiome and the modulation of host immunity through the strengthening of the gut barrier and stimulation of antibodies.

The recent development in system biology approaches to microbial science is paving the way for integrating data generated from different omics techniques for understanding the flow of molecular information from one 'omics' level to the other with clear information on regulatory features and phenotypes. The limitations and tendencies of a 'single omics' application to ignore the influence of other molecular processes justify the need for 'multi-omics' application in probiotics selections and understanding its action on the host. Different omics techniques, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and lipidomics, used for studying probiotics and their influence on the host and the microbiome are discussed in this review. Furthermore, the rationale for 'multi-omics' and multi-omics data integration platforms supporting probiotics and microbiome analyses was also elucidated. This review showed that multi-omics application is useful in selecting probiotics and understanding their functions on the host microbiome. Hence, recommend a multi-omics approach for holistically understanding probiotics and the microbiome.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37275551","Clarifying the effect of gut microbiota on allergic conjunctivitis risk is instrumental for predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine: a Mendelian randomization analysis.","EPMA J","Allergic conjunctivitis is an ocular immune disease which affects the conjunctiva, eyelids, and cornea. Growing evidence implicates the gut microbiota in balancing and modulating immunity response, and in the pathogenesis of allergic disease. As a result, gut microbial imbalance could be a useful indicator for allergic conjunctivitis. From the perspective of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM), clarifying the role of gut microbial imbalance in the development of allergic conjunctivitis could provide a window of opportunity for primary prediction, targeted prevention, and personalized treatment of the disease.In our study, we hypothesized that individuals with microbial dysbiosis may be more susceptible to allergic conjunctivitis due to an increased inflammatory response. To verify the working hypothesis, our analysis selected genetic variants linked with gut microbiota features (N= 18,340) and allergic conjunctivitis (4513 cases, 649,376 controls) from genome-wide association studies. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimate, Mendelian randomization (MR)-Egger, weighted median estimator, maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), and MR robust adjusted profile score (MR.RAPS) were employed to analyze the impact of gut microbiota on the risk of allergic conjunctivitis and identify allergic conjunctivitis-related gut microbes. Ultimately, these findings may enable the identification of individuals at risk of allergic conjunctivitis through screening of gut microbial imbalances, and allow for new targeted prevention and personalized treatment strategies.Genetic liability toRuminococcaceae_UCG_002(OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.99;P= 4.04×10-2),Holdemanella(OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.96;P= 2.04×10-2),Catenibacterium(OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.86;P= 1.09×10-3),Senegalimassilia(OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-0.93;P= 1.23×10-2) genus were associated with a low risk of allergic conjunctivitis with IVW. Besides, we found suggestive associations of a genetic-driven increase in theOscillospira(OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.00-2.00;P= 4.63×10-2) genus with a higher risk of allergic conjunctivitis. Moreover, MLE and MR.RAPS show consistent results with IVW after further validation and strengthened confidence in the true causal associations. No heterogeneity and pleiotropy was detected.Our study suggests that gut microbiota may play a causal role in the development of allergic conjunctivitis and provides new insights into the microbiota-mediated mechanism of the disease. Gut microbiota may serve as a target for future predictive diagnostics, targeted prevention, and individualized therapy in allergic conjunctivitis, facilitating the transition from reactive medical services to PPPM in the management of the disease.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13167-023-00321-9.© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA) 2023.

In the European populations,HLA-DRB1*03:01andDRB1*15:01are susceptibility alleles, butC4locus was reported to account for the association ofDRB1*03:01. With respect toDRB1*15:01, strong linkage disequilibrium with a variant rs2105898T in the XL9 region, located betweenDRB1andDQA1and regulates HLA-class II expression levels, was reported; however, the causative allele remains to be determined. Leveraging the genetic background of the Japanese population, whereDRB1*15:01andDRB1*15:02are commonly present and onlyDRB1*15:01is associated with SLE, this study aimed to distinguish the genetic contribution ofDRB1*15:01and XL9 variants.Among the XL9 variants, two (rs2105898 and rs9271593) previously associated variants in the European populations and two (rs9271375 and rs9271378) which showed a trend towards association in a Japanese Genome-Wide Association Study were selected. Associations of the XL9 variants andHLA-DRB1were examined in 442 Japanese SLE patients and 779 controls. Genotyping of the XL9 variants was performed by TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay and direct sequencing.HLA-DRB1alleles were determined by PCR-reverse sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes.Among the XL9 variants, associations of rs2105898T and rs9271593C were replicated in the Japanese population. However, these associations became no longer significant when conditioned onDRB1*15:01. In contrast, the association ofDRB1*15:01remained significant after conditioning on the XL9 variants.In the Japanese population,HLA-DRB1*15:01was found to be primarily associated with SLE, and to account for the apparent association of XL9 region.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Each identified variant was examined for its association with a wide range of phenotypes and its interactions with glycemic, blood pressure (BP), and lipid controls in incident cardiovascular diseases.We identified a novel variant (rs10171703) for CHD (odds ratio 1.21 [95% CI 1.13-1.30]; P = 2.4 × 10-8) and BP (β ± SE 0.130 ± 0.017; P = 4.1 × 10-14) at PDE1A in Chinese T2D patients but found only a modest association with CHD in general populations. This variant modulated the effects of BP goal attainment (130/80 mmHg) on CHD (Pinteraction = 0.0155) and myocardial infarction (MI) (Pinteraction = 5.1 × 10-4). Patients with CC genotype of rs10171703 had >40% reduction in either cardiovascular events in response to BP control (2.9 × 10-8 < P < 3.6 × 10-5), those with CT genotype had no difference (0.0726 < P < 0.2614), and those with TT genotype had a threefold increase in MI risk (P = 6.7 × 10-3).We discovered a novel CHD- and BP-related variant at PDE1A that interacted with BP goal attainment with divergent effects on CHD risk in Chinese patients with T2D.

To facilitate analysis of such data, we developed Enhlink, a novel computational approach that leverages single -cell signals to infer linkages between regulatory DNA sequences, such as enhancers and promoters. Enhlink uses an ensemble strategy that integrates cell-level technical covariates to control for batch effects and biological covariates to infer robust condition-specific links and their associatedp-values. It can integrate simultaneous gene expression and chromatin accessibility measurements of individual cells profiled by multi-omic experiments for increased specificity. We evaluated Enhlink using simulated and real scATAC-seq data, including those paired with physical enhancer-promoter links enumerated by promoter capture Hi-C and with multi-omic scATAC-/RNA-seq data we generated from the mouse striatum. These examples demonstrated that our method outperforms popular alternative strategies. In conjunction with eQTL analysis, Enhlink revealed a putative super-enhancer regulating key cell type-specific markers of striatal neurons. Taken together, our analyses demonstrate that Enhlink is accurate, powerful, and provides features that can lead to novel biological insights."
"37293508","The oxidative aging model integrated various risk factors in type 2 diabetes mellitus at system level.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic endocrine metabolic disease caused by insulin dysregulation. Studies have shown that aging-related oxidative stress (as ""oxidative aging"") play a critical role in the onset and progression of T2DM, by leading to an energy metabolism imbalance. However, the precise mechanisms through which oxidative aging lead to T2DM are yet to be fully comprehended. Thus, it is urgent to integrate the underlying mechanisms between oxidative aging and T2DM, where meaningful prediction models based on relative profiles are needed.First, machine learning was used to build the aging model and disease model. Next, an integrated oxidative aging model was employed to identify crucial oxidative aging risk factors. Finally, a series of bioinformatic analyses (including network, enrichment, sensitivity, and pan-cancer analyses) were used to explore potential mechanisms underlying oxidative aging and T2DM.The study revealed a close relationship between oxidative aging and T2DM. Our results indicate that nutritional metabolism, inflammation response, mitochondrial function, and protein homeostasis are key factors involved in the interplay between oxidative aging and T2DM, even indicating key indices across different cancer types. Therefore, various risk factors in T2DM were integrated, and the theories of oxi-inflamm-aging and cellular senescence were also confirmed.In sum, our study successfully integrated the underlying mechanisms linking oxidative aging and T2DM through a series of computational methodologies.Copyright © 2023 Chen, Yao, Zhao, Xu, Ren, Xie, Liu and Wang."

Patients with T1 bladder cancer (BC) who underwent transurethral resection of the tumour (TURBT) between 2004 and 2015 were included in the analysis. The predictive abilities of LR and ANN were compared.Overall 32,060 patients with T1 BC were randomly assigned to training and validation cohorts in the proportion of 70:30. There were 5691 (17.75%) cancer-specific deaths and 18,485 (57.7%) all-cause deaths within a median of 116 months of follow-up (IQR 80-153). Multivariable analysis with LR revealed that age, race, tumour grade, histology variant, the primary character, location and size of the tumour, marital status, and annual income constitute independent risk factors for CSS. In the validation cohort, LR and ANN yielded 79.5% and 79.4% accuracy in 5-year CSS prediction respectively. The area under the ROC curve for CSS predictions reached 73.4% and 72.5% for LR and ANN respectively.Available risk factors might be useful to estimate the risk of CSS and OS and thus facilitate optimal treatment choice. The accuracy of survival prediction is still moderate. T1 BC with adverse features requires more aggressive treatment after initial TURBT.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37251933","Evaluation of circulating tumor DNA by electropherogram analysis and methylome profiling in high-risk neuroblastomas.","Front Oncol","Liquid biopsy has emerged as a promising, non-invasive diagnostic approach in oncology because the analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) reflects the precise status of the disease at diagnosis, progression, and response to treatment. DNA methylation profiling is also a potential solution for sensitive and specific detection of many cancers. The combination of both approaches, DNA methylation analysis from ctDNA, provides an extremely useful and minimally invasive tool with high relevance in patients with childhood cancer. Neuroblastoma is an extracranial solid tumor most common in children and responsible for up to 15% of cancer-related deaths. This high death rate has prompted the scientific community to search for new therapeutic targets. DNA methylation also offers a new source for identifying these molecules. However, the limited blood sample size which can be obtained from children with cancer and the fact that ctDNA content may occasionally be diluted by non-tumor cell-free DNA (cfDNA) complicate optimal quantities of material for high-throughput sequencing studies.In this article, we present an improved method for ctDNA methylome studies of blood-derived plasma from high-risk neuroblastoma patients. We assessed the electropherogram profiles of ctDNA-containing samples suitable for methylome studies, using 10 ng of plasma-derived ctDNA from 126 samples of 86 high-risk neuroblastoma patients, and evaluated several bioinformatic approaches to analyze DNA methylation sequencing data.We demonstrated that enzymatic methyl-sequencing (EM-seq) outperformed bisulfite conversion-based method, based on the lower proportion of PCR duplicates and the higher percentage of unique mapping reads, mean coverage, and genome coverage. The analysis of the electropherogram profiles revealed the presence of nucleosomal multimers, and occasionally high molecular weight DNA. We established that 10% content of the mono-nucleosomal peak is sufficient ctDNA for successful detection of copy number variations and methylation profiles. Quantification of mono-nucleosomal peak also showed that samples at diagnosis contained a higher amount of ctDNA than relapse samples.Our results refine the use of electropherogram profiles to optimize sample selection for subsequent high-throughput analysis and support the use of liquid biopsy followed by enzymatic conversion of unmethylated cysteines to assess the methylomes of neuroblastoma patients.Copyright © 2023 Trinidad, Juan-Ribelles, Pisano, Castel, Cañete, Gut, Heath and Font de Mora."
"37270547","Balanced SET levels favor the correct enhancer repertoire during cell fate acquisition.","Nat Commun","Within the chromatin, distal elements interact with promoters to regulate specific transcriptional programs. Histone acetylation, interfering with the net charges of the nucleosomes, is a key player in this regulation. Here, we report that the oncoprotein SET is a critical determinant for the levels of histone acetylation within enhancers. We disclose that a condition in which SET is accumulated, the severe Schinzel-Giedion Syndrome (SGS), is characterized by a failure in the usage of the distal regulatory regions typically employed during fate commitment. This is accompanied by the usage of alternative enhancers leading to a massive rewiring of the distal control of the gene transcription. This represents a (mal)adaptive mechanism that, on one side, allows to achieve a certain degree of differentiation, while on the other affects the fine and corrected maturation of the cells. Thus, we propose the differential in cis-regulation as a contributing factor to the pathological basis of SGS and possibly other the SET-related disorders in humans.© 2023. The Author(s)."

These subnuclear structures, marked by nuclear bodies and histone modifications, are often cell-type specific and affect gene regulation and 3D genome organization1-3. Understanding nuclear organization requires identifying the molecular constituents of subnuclear structures and mapping their associations with specific genomic loci in individual cells, within complex tissues. Here, we introduce two-layer DNA seqFISH+, which allows simultaneous mapping of 100,049 genomic loci, together with nascent transcriptome for 17,856 genes and a diverse set of immunofluorescently labeled subnuclear structures all in single cells in cell lines and adult mouse cerebellum. Using these multi-omics datasets, we showed that repressive chromatin compartments are more variable by cell type than active compartments. We also discovered a single exception to this rule: an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-enriched compartment was associated with long, cell-type specific genes (> 200kb), in a manner distinct from nuclear speckles. Further, our analysis revealed that cell-type specific facultative and constitutive heterochromatin compartments marked by H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 are enriched at specific genes and gene clusters, respectively, and shape radial chromosomal positioning and inter-chromosomal interactions in neurons and glial cells. Together, our results provide a single-cell high-resolution multi-omics view of subnuclear compartments, associated genomic loci, and their impacts on gene regulation, directly within complex tissues."

We find that in Drosophila heads, as well as in human cerebral organoids, 3' end site choice is globally influenced by the site of transcription initiation (TSS). ""Dominant promoters,"" characterized by specific epigenetic signatures including p300/CBP binding, impose a transcriptional constraint to define splice and polyadenylation variants.

To harmonize annotations across datasets, we built a hierarchical model of the cell populations. Our model allows the incorporation of novel cell populations and the refinement of known profiles as more datasets become available. Using MKA and the learned model of cellular hierarchies, we predicted previously missing cell annotations from several studies.

Following a wash to eliminate unbound particles, the exosomes were eluted from the cartridge. A downstream multiplex immunoassay was performed to measure proteins of interest on the exosomes, and a proprietary algorithm provided a score for probability of PDAC.We describe the case of a 60-year-old healthy non-Hispanic white male with acute pancreatitis who underwent numerous invasive diagnostic procedures that failed to detect radiographic evidence of pancreatic lesions. Following the results of our exosome-based liquid biopsy test showing ""High Likelihood of PDAC"", in addition to KRAS and TP53 mutations, the patient decided to undergo a robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) procedure. Surgical pathology confirmed the diagnosis of high-grade intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), which was consistent with the results of our ExoVita®test.

In allergic Siglec-FhiCD101hi, eosinophils are associated with pathology. Research has not shown if equivalent subpopulations of eosinophils are a feature of helminth infection.

"37283765","Differential impact of environmental factors on systemic and localized autoimmunity.","Front Immunol","The influence of environmental factors on the development of autoimmune disease is being broadly investigated to better understand the multifactorial nature of autoimmune pathogenesis and to identify potential areas of intervention. Areas of particular interest include the influence of lifestyle, nutrition, and vitamin deficiencies on autoimmunity and chronic inflammation. In this review, we discuss how particular lifestyles and dietary patterns may contribute to or modulate autoimmunity. We explored this concept through a spectrum of several autoimmune diseases including Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Alopecia Areata (AA) affecting the central nervous system, whole body, and the hair follicles, respectively. A clear commonality between the autoimmune conditions of interest here is low Vitamin D, a well-researched hormone in the context of autoimmunity with pleiotropic immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. While low levels are often correlated with disease activity and progression in MS and AA, the relationship is less clear in SLE. Despite strong associations with autoimmunity, we lack conclusive evidence which elucidates its role in contributing to pathogenesis or simply as a result of chronic inflammation. In a similar vein, other vitamins impacting the development and course of these diseases are explored in this review, and overall diet and lifestyle. Recent work exploring the effects of dietary interventions on MS showed that a balanced diet was linked to improvement in clinical parameters, comorbid conditions, and overall quality of life for patients. In patients with MS, SLE and AA, certain diets and supplements are linked to lower incidence and improved symptoms. Conversely, obesity during adolescence was linked with higher incidence of MS while in SLE it was associated with organ damage. Autoimmunity is thought to emerge from the complex interplay between environmental factors and genetic background. Although the scope of this review focuses on environmental factors, it is imperative to elaborate the interaction between genetic susceptibility and environment due to the multifactorial origin of these disease. Here, we offer a comprehensive review about the influence of recent environmental and lifestyle factors on these autoimmune diseases and potential translation into therapeutic interventions.Copyright © 2023 Touil, Mounts and De Jager."

Surprisingly, we report that treatment of RTHα patients with thyroxine to overcome tissue hormone resistance does not elevate their heart rate. Cardiac telemetry in male, TRα1 mutant, mice indicates that such persistent bradycardia is caused by an intrinsic cardiac defect and not due to altered autonomic control. Transcriptomic analyses show preserved, thyroid hormone (T3)-dependent upregulation of pacemaker channels (Hcn2, Hcn4), but irreversibly reduced expression of several ion channel genes controlling heart rate. Exposure of TRα1 mutant male mice to higher maternal T3 concentrations in utero, restores altered expression and DNA methylation of ion channels, including Ryr2. Our findings indicate that target genes other than Hcn2 and Hcn4 mediate T3-induced tachycardia and suggest that treatment of RTHα patients with thyroxine in high dosage without concomitant tachycardia, is possible.© 2023.

In plasma, higher CFHR5 levels are associated with increased thrombin generation potential and recombinant CFHR5 enhanced platelet activation in vitro. GWAS analysis of ~52,000 participants identifies six loci associated with CFHR5 plasma levels, but Mendelian randomization do not demonstrate causality between CFHR5 and VTE.

Firstly, an esterified glutamic acid analogue (BnE) is genetically encoded into proteins by genetic code expansion with high efficiency, which can be quantitatively converted into an acyl hydrazide via hydrazinolysis. Then, through a reaction with acetyl acetone, the acyl hydrazide is converted to reactive Knorr pyrazole.

However, results from epidemiological studies evaluating these associations are inconsistent.We estimated the associations of pregnancy PFAS concentrations with child body mass index (BMI)z-scores and risk of overweight/obesity in eight U.S. cohorts.We used data from 1,391 mother-child pairs who enrolled in eight Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) cohorts (enrolled: 1999-2019). We quantified concentrations of seven PFAS in maternal plasma or serum in pregnancy. We measured child weight and height between the ages of 2 and 5 y and calculated age- and sex-specific BMIz-scores; 19.6% children had more than one BMI measurement. We estimated covariate-adjusted associations of individual PFAS and their mixture with child BMIz-scores and risk of overweight/obesity using linear mixed models, modified Poisson regression models, and Bayesian approaches for mixtures. We explored whether child sex modified these associations.We observed a pattern of subtle positive associations of PFAS concentrations in pregnancy with BMIz-scores and risk of overweight/obesity. For instance, each doubling in perfluorohexane sulfonic acid concentrations was associated with higher BMIz-scores (β=0.07; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.12). Each doubling in perfluroundecanoic acid [relative risk (RR)=1.10; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.16] andN-methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid (RR=1.06; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.12) was associated with increased risk of overweight/obesity, with some evidence of a monotonic dose-response relation. We observed weaker and more imprecise associations of the PFAS mixture with BMI or risk of overweight/obesity.

"37270462","Discrimination of monozygotic twins using mtDNA heteroplasmy through probe capture enrichment and massively parallel sequencing.","Int J Legal Med","Differentiating between monozygotic (MZ) twins remains difficult because they have the same genetic makeup. Applying the traditional STR genotyping approach cannot differentiate one from the other. Heteroplasmy refers to the presence of two or more different mtDNA copies within a single cell and this phenomenon is common in humans. The levels of heteroplasmy cannot change dramatically during transmission in the female germ line but increase or decrease during germ-line transmission and in somatic tissues during life. As massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technology has advanced, it has shown the extraordinary quantity of mtDNA heteroplasmy in humans. In this study, a probe hybridization technique was used to obtain mtDNA and then MPS was performed with an average sequencing depth of above 4000. The results showed us that all ten pairs of MZ twins were clearly differentiated with the minor heteroplasmy threshold at 1.0%, 0.5%, and 0.1%, respectively. Finally, we used a probe that targeted mtDNA to boost sequencing depth without interfering with nuclear DNA and this technique can be used in forensic genetics to differentiate the MZ twins.© 2023.

"37255673","The genetic and phenotypic correlates of mtDNA copy number in a multi-ancestry cohort.","HGG Adv","Mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtCN) is often treated as a proxy for mitochondrial (dys-) function and disease risk. Pathological changes in mtCN are common symptoms of rare mitochondrial disorders, but reported associations between mtCN and common diseases vary across studies. To understand the biology of mtCN, we carried out genome- and phenome-wide association studies of mtCN in 30,666 individuals from the Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB)-a diverse cohort of largely African and European ancestry. We estimated mtCN in peripheral blood using exome sequence data, taking cell composition into account. We replicated known genetic associations of mtCN in the PMBB and found that their effects are highly correlated between individuals of European and African ancestry. However, the heritability of mtCN was much higher among individuals of largely African ancestry(h2=0.3)compared with European ancestry individuals(h2=0.1). Admixture mapping suggests that there are undiscovered variants underlying mtCN that are differentiated in frequency between individuals with African and European ancestry. We show that mtCN is associated with many health-related phenotypes. We discovered robust associations between mtDNA copy number and diseases of metabolically active tissues, such as cardiovascular disease and liver damage, that were consistent across African and European ancestry individuals. Other associations, such as epilepsy and prostate cancer, were only discovered in either individuals with European or African ancestry but not both. We show that mtCN-phenotype associations can be sensitive to blood cell composition and environmental modifiers, explaining why such associations are inconsistent across studies. Thus, mtCN-phenotype associations must be interpreted with care.© 2023 The Author(s)."

By means of pattern recognition, ML methods are able to find hidden correlations and accomplish accurate predictions regarding different conditions. ML has been successfully used to solve varied problems in different areas of science, such as psychology, economics, biology and chemistry. Therefore, we wondered how far it has penetrated into the field of obstetrics and gynecology.To describe the state of art regarding the use of ML in the context of pregnancy diseases and complications.Publications were searched in PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Seven subjects of interest were considered: gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, perinatal death, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, cesarean section, and fetal malformations.ML has been widely applied in all the included subjects. Its uses are varied, the most common being the prediction of perinatal disorders. Other ML applications include (but are not restricted to) biomarker discovery, risk estimation, correlation assessment, pharmacological treatment prediction, drug screening, data acquisition and data extraction. Most of the reviewed articles were published in the last five years. The most employed ML methods in the field are non-linear. Except for logistic regression, linear methods are rarely used.To improve data recording, storage and update in medical and research settings from different realities. To develop more accurate and understandable ML models using data from cutting-edge instruments. To carry out validation and impact analysis studies of currently existing high-accuracy ML models.The use of ML in pregnancy diseases and complications is quite recent, and has increased over the last few years. The applications are varied and point not only to the diagnosis, but also to the management, treatment, and pathophysiological understanding of perinatal alterations. Facing the challenges that come with working with different types of data, the handling of increasingly large amounts of information, the development of emerging technologies, and the need of translational studies, it is expected that the use of ML continue growing in the field of obstetrics and gynecology.Copyright © 2023 Mennickent, Rodríguez, Opazo, Riedel, Castro, Eriz-Salinas, Appel-Rubio, Aguayo, Damiano, Guzmán-Gutiérrez and Araya."

Yet, how to best detect or predict the emergence of HSCT-related complications remain unresolved. Here, we describe a case of donor-derived, transient Alpha Beta (αβ) T-cell large granular clonal lymphocytosis and cytopenia that emerged post-HSCT in a patient with a history of gamma delta (γδ) T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL). Clonal unrelatedness of post-transplant T-LGL lymphocytosis to the patient's pretransplant T-LGLL was first identified by T-cell receptor (TCR) PCR showing different sized fragments of rearranged gamma chains, in addition to shift from γδ to αβ TCR expression by flow cytometry analyses. Donor-derivation of the patient's post-transplant clonal lymphocytosis was confirmed by serial chimerism analyses of recipient's blood specimens demonstrating 100% donor DNA. Moreover, oncogenicDNMT3AandRUNX1mutations were detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS) only in post-transplant specimens. Intriguingly, despite continued increase inDNMT3AandRUNX1mutation load, the patient's clonal lymphocytosis and anemia eventually largely resolved; yet, the observed mutation profile with persistent thrombocytopenia indicated secondary clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS) in the absence of overt morphologic evidence of myeloid neoplasm in the marrow. This case illustrates the utility of longitudinal chimerism analysis and NGS testing combined with flow cytometric immunophenotyping to evaluate emerging donor-derived hematolymphoid processes and to properly interpret partial functional engraftment.

"37258665","Deterministic evolution and stringent selection during preneoplasia.","Nature","The earliest events during human tumour initiation, although poorly characterized, may hold clues to malignancy detection and prevention1. Here we model occult preneoplasia by biallelic inactivation of TP53, a common early event in gastric cancer, in human gastric organoids. Causal relationships between this initiating genetic lesion and resulting phenotypes were established using experimental evolution in multiple clonally derived cultures over 2 years. TP53 loss elicited progressive aneuploidy, including copy number alterations and structural variants prevalent in gastric cancers, with evident preferred orders. Longitudinal single-cell sequencing of TP53-deficient gastric organoids similarly indicates progression towards malignant transcriptional programmes. Moreover, high-throughput lineage tracing with expressed cellular barcodes demonstrates reproducible dynamics whereby initially rare subclones with shared transcriptional programmes repeatedly attain clonal dominance. This powerful platform for experimental evolution exposes stringent selection, clonal interference and a marked degree of phenotypic convergence in premalignant epithelial organoids. These data imply predictability in the earliest stages of tumorigenesis and show evolutionary constraints and barriers to malignant transformation, with implications for earlier detection and interception of aggressive, genome-instable tumours.© 2023.

Previous research showed that higher folate concentrations are associated with lower blood PFAS concentrations in adolescents and adults. Further studies are needed to explore whether prenatal folate status mitigates PFAS-related adverse birth outcomes.To examine whether prenatal folate status modifies the negative associations between pregnancy PFAS concentrations, birth weight, and gestational age previously observed in a US cohort.In a prospective design, a prebirth cohort of mothers or pregnant women was recruited between April 1999 and November 2002, in Project Viva, a study conducted in eastern Massachusetts. Statistical analyses were performed from May 24 and October 25, 2022.Plasma concentrations of 6 PFAS compounds were measured in early pregnancy (median gestational week, 9.6). Folate status was assessed through a food frequency questionnaire and measured in plasma samples collected in early pregnancy.Birth weight and gestational age, abstracted from delivery records; birth weight z score, standardized by gestational age and infant sex; low birth weight, defined as birth weight less than 2500 g; and preterm birth, defined as birth at less than 37 completed gestational weeks.The cohort included a total of 1400 mother-singleton pairs. The mean (SD) age of the mothers was 32.21 (4.89) years. Most of the mothers were White (73.2%) and had a college degree or higher (69.1%). Early pregnancy plasma perfluorooctanoic acid concentration was associated with lower birth weight and birth weight z score only among mothers whose dietary folate intake (birth weight: β, -89.13 g; 95% CI, -166.84 to -11.42 g; birth weight z score: -0.13; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.003) or plasma folate concentration (birth weight: -87.03 g; 95% CI, -180.11 to 6.05 g; birth weight z score: -0.14; 95% CI, -0.30 to 0.02) were below the 25th percentile (dietary: 660 μg/d, plasma: 14 ng/mL). No associations were found among mothers in the higher folate level groups, although the tests for heterogeneity did not reject the null. Associations between plasma perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) concentrations and lower birth weight, and between PFNA and earlier gestational age were noted only among mothers whose prenatal dietary folate intake or plasma folate concentration was in the lowest quartile range.

"37296477","Detection of germline variants with pathogenic potential in 48 patients with familial colorectal cancer by using whole exome sequencing.","BMC Med Genomics","Hereditary genetic mutations causing predisposition to colorectal cancer are accountable for approximately 30% of all colorectal cancer cases. However, only a small fraction of these are high penetrant mutations occurring in DNA mismatch repair genes, causing one of several types of familial colorectal cancer (CRC) syndromes. Most of the mutations are low-penetrant variants, contributing to an increased risk of familial colorectal cancer, and they are often found in additional genes and pathways not previously associated with CRC. The aim of this study was to identify such variants, both high-penetrant and low-penetrant ones.We performed whole exome sequencing on constitutional DNA extracted from blood of 48 patients suspected of familial colorectal cancer and used multiple in silico prediction tools and available literature-based evidence to detect and investigate genetic variants.We identified several causative and some potentially causative germline variants in genes known for their association with colorectal cancer. In addition, we identified several variants in genes not typically included in relevant gene panels for colorectal cancer, including CFTR, PABPC1 and TYRO3, which may be associated with an increased risk for cancer.Identification of variants in additional genes that potentially can be associated with familial colorectal cancer indicates a larger genetic spectrum of this disease, not limited only to mismatch repair genes. Usage of multiple in silico tools based on different methods and combined through a consensus approach increases the sensitivity of predictions and narrows down a large list of variants to the ones that are most likely to be significant.© 2023.

However, the use of placental pathology in directing or influencing neonatal clinical management continues to be limited for a wide range of reasons, some of which are historical and thus easily overcome today. In this review, we summarize the most recent literature linking placental function to neonatal outcomes, focusing on clinical placental pathology findings and the most common neonatal diagnoses that have been associated with placental dysfunction. We discuss how recent technological advances in neonatal and perinatal medicine may allow us to make a paradigm shift, in which valuable information provided by the placenta could be used to guide neonatal management more effectively, and to ultimately enhance neonatal care in order to improve our patient outcomes. We propose new avenues of clinical management in which the placenta could serve as a diagnostic tool toward more personalized neonatal intensive care unit management.© 2023 Mestan, Leibel, Sajti, Pham, Hietalati, Laurent and Parast."
"37250426","The human brain through the lens of somatic mosaicism.","Front Neurosci","Every cell in the human brain possesses a unique genome that is the product of the accumulation of somatic mutations starting from the first postzygotic cell division and continuing throughout life. Somatic mosaicism in the human brain has been the focus of several recent efforts that took advantage of key technological innovations to start elucidating brain development, aging and disease directly in human tissue. On one side, somatic mutation occurring in progenitor cells has been used as a natural barcoding system to address cell phylogenies of clone formation and cell segregation in the brain lineage. On the other side, analyses of mutation rates and patterns in the genome of brain cells have revealed mechanisms of brain aging and disorder predisposition. In addition to the study of somatic mosaicism in the normal human brain, the contribution of somatic mutation has been investigated in both developmental neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. This review starts with a methodological perspective on the study of somatic mosaicism to then cover the most recent findings in brain development and aging, and ends with the role of somatic mutations in brain disease. Thus, this review underlies what we have learned and what is still possible to discover by looking at somatic mosaicism in the brain genome.Copyright © 2023 Bizzotto."

Increasing evidence indicates that metastasis is an early event in patients with aggressive cancers, often occurring even before primary lesions are clinically detectable. Metastases are usually formed from cancer cells that spread to distant non-malignant tissues via the blood circulation, termed circulating tumour cells (CTCs). CTCs have been detected in patients with early stage cancers and, owing to their association with metastasis, might indicate the presence of aggressive disease, thus providing a possible means to expedite diagnosis and treatment initiation for such patients while avoiding overdiagnosis and overtreatment of those with slow-growing, indolent tumours. The utility of CTCs as an early diagnostic tool has been investigated, although further improvements in the efficiency of CTC detection are required. In this Perspective, we discuss the clinical significance of early haematogenous dissemination of cancer cells, the potential of CTCs to facilitate early detection of clinically relevant cancers, and the technological advances that might improve CTC capture and, thus, diagnostic performance in this setting.© 2023.

Host genomics and epigenomics unveil heredity-related mechanisms of susceptible individuals, while microbiome and metabolomics map host-microbe interactions in CD patients. Proteomics shows great potential in searching for promising biomarkers. Nonetheless, single omics technology cannot holistically connect the mechanisms with heterogeneity of pathological behavior in CD. The rise of multi-omics analysis integrates genetic/epigenetic profiles with protein/microbial metabolite functionality, providing new hope for comprehensive and in-depth exploration of CD.

"37265513","The brain is not mental! coupling neuronal and immune cellular processing in human organisms.","Front Integr Neurosci","Significant efforts have been made in the past decades to understand how mental and cognitive processes are underpinned by neural mechanisms in the brain. This paper argues that a promising way forward in understanding the nature of human cognition is to zoom out from the prevailing picture focusing on its neural basis. It considers instead how neurons work in tandem with other type of cells (e.g., immune) to subserve biological self-organization and adaptive behavior of the human organism as a whole. We focus specifically on the immune cellular processing as key actor in complementing neuronal processing in achieving successful self-organization and adaptation of the human body in an ever-changing environment. We overview theoretical work and empirical evidence on ""basal cognition"" challenging the idea that only the neuronal cells in the brain have the exclusive ability to ""learn"" or ""cognize."" The focus on cellular rather than neural, brain processing underscores the idea that flexible responses to fluctuations in the environment require a carefully crafted orchestration of multiple cellular and bodily systems at multiple organizational levels of the biological organism. Hence cognition can be seen as a multiscale web of dynamic information processing distributed across a vast array of complex cellular (e.g., neuronal, immune, and others) and network systems, operating across the entire body, and not just in the brain. Ultimately, this paper builds up toward the radical claim that cognition should not be confined to one system alone, namely, the neural system in the brain, no matter how sophisticated the latter notoriously is.Copyright © 2023 Ciaunica, Shmeleva and Levin."

Genotype-predicted mean alcohol intake was positively associated with established (n = 28,564; 1.14, 1.09-1.20) and new alcohol-associated (n = 16,138; 1.06, 1.01-1.12) diseases, and with specific diseases such as liver cirrhosis (n = 499; 2.30, 1.58-3.35), stroke (n = 12,176; 1.38, 1.27-1.49) and gout (n = 338; 2.33, 1.49-3.62), but not ischemic heart disease (n = 8,408; 1.04, 0.94-1.14). Among women, 2% drank alcohol resulting in low power to assess associations of self-reported alcohol intake with disease risks, but genetic findings in women suggested the excess male risks were not due to pleiotropic genotypic effects. Among Chinese men, alcohol consumption increased multiple disease risks, highlighting the need to strengthen preventive measures to reduce alcohol intake.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Over the past decade, many techniques were developed for liquid biopsies through next-generation sequencing. This alternative non-invasive biopsy offers several advantages in various types of tumors over traditional tissue biopsy. The process of liquid biopsy is considered minimally invasive and therefore easily repeatable when needed, providing a more dynamic analysis of the tumor cells. Moreover, it has an advantage in patients with tumors that are not candidates for tissue sampling. Besides, it offers a deeper understanding of tumor burden as well as treatment response, thereby enhancing the detection of minimal residual disease and therapeutic guidance for personalized medicine.

As the number of individuals diagnosed with T2D rises, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of the disease in order to prevent further harm to the body caused by elevated blood glucose levels. Recent advances in long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) research may provide insights into the pathogenesis of T2D. Although lncRNAs can be readily detected in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, most published datasets of T2D patients compared to healthy donors focus only on protein-coding genes, leaving lncRNAs to be undiscovered and understudied. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a secondary analysis of published RNA-seq data of T2D patients and of patients with related health complications to systematically analyze the expression changes of lncRNA genes in relation to the protein-coding genes. Since immune cells play important roles in T2D, we conducted loss-of-function experiments to provide functional data on the T2D-related lncRNAUSP30-AS1, using an in vitro model of pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. To facilitate lncRNA research in T2D, we developed a web application, T2DB, to provide a one-stop-shop for expression profiling of protein-coding and lncRNA genes in T2D patients compared to healthy donors or subjects without T2D."

In particular, the throughput required for large cohort clinical validation in biomarker discovery and diagnostic screening has driven the growth of multiplexed targeted liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays paired with sample preparation and analysis in multiwell plates. However, large scale MS-based proteomics studies are often plagued by batch effects: sources of technical variation in the data, which can arise from a diverse array of sources such as sample preparation batches, different reagent lots, or indeed MS signal drift. These batch effects can confound the detection of true signal differences, resulting in incorrect conclusions being drawn about significant biological effects or lack thereof. Here, we present an intraplate batch effect termed the edge effect arising from temperature gradients in multiwell plates, commonly reported in preclinical cell culture studies but not yet reported in a clinical proteomics setting. We present methods herein to ameliorate the phenomenon including proper assessment of heating techniques for multiwell plates and incorporation of surrogate standards, which can normalize for intraplate variation."

We identify 36 proteins with independently reproducible associations with risk of imminent lung cancer diagnosis (all p < 4 × 10-5). These include a few markers (e.g. CA-125/MUC-16 and CEACAM5/CEA) that have previously been reported in studies using pre-diagnostic blood samples for lung cancer. The 36 proteins include several growth factors (e.g. HGF, IGFBP-1, IGFP-2), tumor necrosis factor-receptors (e.g. TNFRSF6B, TNFRSF13B), and chemokines and cytokines (e.g. CXL17, GDF-15, SCF).

To evaluate model performance, we used a round-robin approach in which models were fit in 5 cohorts and evaluated in the 6th cohort. Specifically, we fit a model including 5 proteins and clinical parameters and compared its performance with clinical parameters only.There were 86 proteins nominally associated with mortality (p < 0.05), but only CDCP1 remained statistically significant after accounting for multiple testing (hazard ratio per standard deviation: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.10-1.30, unadjusted p = 0.00004).

Aging entails changes in the immune system characterized by a decrease in thymic output of naïve lymphocytes, an accumulated chronic antigenic stress notably caused by chronic infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), and immune cell senescence with acquisition of an inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). For this reason, and due to the SASP originating from other tissues, aging is commonly accompanied by low-grade chronic inflammation, termed ""inflammaging"". After decades of accumulating evidence regarding age-related processes and chronic inflammation, the domain now appears mature enough to allow an integrative reinterpretation of old data. Here, we provide an overview of the topics discussed in a recent workshop ""Aging and Chronic Inflammation"" to which many of the major players in the field contributed. We highlight advances in systematic measurement and interpretation of biological markers of aging, as well as their implications for human health and longevity and the interventions that can be envisaged to maintain or improve immune function in older people.© 2023.

"37258688","Gâ€‰Ã—â€‰E interactions as a basis for toxicological uncertainty.","Arch Toxicol","To transfer toxicological findings from model systems, e.g. animals, to humans, standardized safety factors are applied to account for intra-species and inter-species variabilities. An alternative approach would be to measure and model the actual compound-specific uncertainties. This biological concept assumes that all observed toxicities depend not only on the exposure situation (environment = E), but also on the genetic (G) background of the model (G × E). As a quantitative discipline, toxicology needs to move beyond merely qualitative G × E concepts. Research programs are required that determine the major biological variabilities affecting toxicity and categorize their relative weights and contributions. In a complementary approach, detailed case studies need to explore the role of genetic backgrounds in the adverse effects of defined chemicals. In addition, current understanding of the selection and propagation of adverse outcome pathways (AOP) in different biological environments is very limited. To improve understanding, a particular focus is required on modulatory and counter-regulatory steps. For quantitative approaches to address uncertainties, the concept of ""genetic"" influence needs a more precise definition. What is usually meant by this term in the context of G × E are the protein functions encoded by the genes. Besides the gene sequence, the regulation of the gene expression and function should also be accounted for. The widened concept of past and present ""gene expression"" influences is summarized here as Ge. Also, the concept of ""environment"" needs some re-consideration in situations where exposure timing (Et) is pivotal: prolonged or repeated exposure to the insult (chemical, physical, life style) affects Ge. This implies that it changes the model system. The interaction of Gewith Etmight be denoted as Ge × Et. We provide here general explanations and specific examples for this concept and show how it could be applied in the context of New Approach Methodologies (NAM).© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37257276","Evolution, mechanism and limits of dietary restriction induced health benefits & longevity.","Redox Biol","Dietary restriction (DR) is the most powerful intervention to enhance health and lifespan across species. However, recent findings indicate that DR started in late life has limited capacity to induce health benefits. Age-dependent changes that impair DR at old age remain to be delineated. This requires a better mechanistic understanding of the different aspects that constitute DR, how they act independently and in concert. Current research efforts aim to tackle these questions: Are fasting periods needed for the induction of DR's health benefits? Does the improvement of cellular and organismal functions depend on the reduction of specific dietary components like proteins or even micronutrients and/or vitamins? How is the aging process intervening with DR-mediated responses? Understanding the evolutionary benefits of nutrient stress responses in driving molecular and cellular adaptation in response to nutrient deprivation is likely providing answers to some of these questions. Cellular memory of early life may lead to post-reproductive distortions of gene regulatory networks and metabolic pathways that inhibit DR-induced stress responses and health benefits when the intervention is started at old age. Inhere we discuss new insights into mechanisms of DR-mediated health benefits and how evolutionary selection for fitness in early life may limit DR-mediated improvements at old age.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

"37274121","Cell type deconvolution of methylated cell-free DNA at the resolution of individual reads.","NAR Genom Bioinform","Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are DNA fragments originating from dying cells that are detectable in bodily fluids, such as the plasma. Accelerated cell death, for example caused by disease, induces an elevated concentration of cfDNA. As a result, determining the cell type origins of cfDNA molecules can provide information about an individual's health. In this work, we aim to increase the sensitivity of methylation-based cell type deconvolution by adapting an existing method, CelFiE, which uses the methylation beta values of individual CpG sites to estimate cell type proportions. Our new method, CelFEER, instead differentiates cell types by the average methylation values within individual reads. We additionally improved the originally reported performance of CelFiE by using a new approach for finding marker regions that are differentially methylated between cell types. We show that CelFEER estimates cell type proportions with a higher correlation (r= 0.94 ± 0.04) than CelFiE (r= 0.86 ± 0.09) on simulated mixtures of cell types. Moreover, we show that the cell type proportion estimated by CelFEER can differentiate between ALS patients and healthy controls, between pregnant women in their first and third trimester, and between pregnant women with and without gestational diabetes.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37275901","Immunometabolic reprogramming, another cancer hallmark.","Front Immunol","Molecular carcinogenesis is a multistep process that involves acquired abnormalities in key biological processes. The complexity of cancer pathogenesis is best illustrated in the six hallmarks of the cancer: (1) the development of self-sufficient growth signals, (2) the emergence of clones that are resistant to apoptosis, (3) resistance to the antigrowth signals, (4) neo-angiogenesis, (5) the invasion of normal tissue or spread to the distant organs, and (6) limitless replicative potential. It also appears that non-resolving inflammation leads to the dysregulation of immune cell metabolism and subsequent cancer progression. The present article delineates immunometabolic reprogramming as a critical hallmark of cancer by linking chronic inflammation and immunosuppression to cancer growth and metastasis. We propose that targeting tumor immunometabolic reprogramming will lead to the design of novel immunotherapeutic approaches to cancer.Copyright © 2023 Kumar and Stewart."
"37273851","Advances in sequencing-based studies of microDNA and ecDNA: Databases, identification methods, and integration with single-cell analysis.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is a class of circular DNA molecules that originate from genomic DNA but are separate from chromosomes. They are common in various organisms, with sizes ranging from a few hundred to millions of base pairs. A special type of large extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is prevalent in cancer cells. Research on ecDNA has significantly contributed to our comprehension of cancer development, progression, evolution, and drug resistance. The use of next-generation (NGS) and third-generation sequencing (TGS) techniques to identify eccDNAs throughout the genome has become a trend in current research. Here, we briefly review current advances in the biological mechanisms and applications of two distinct types of eccDNAs: microDNA and ecDNA. In addition to presenting available identification tools based on sequencing data, we summarize the most recent efforts to integrate ecDNA with single-cell analysis and put forth suggestions to promote the process.© 2023 The Authors."
"37082835","A sting in the tail-are antibodies against the C-terminus of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein protective?","EMBO Mol Med","Malaria remains a huge burden on global public health. Annually there are more than 200 million cases with > 600,000 deaths worldwide, the vast majority of which occur within Sub-Saharan Africa (WHO; World Malaria Report, 2021). Malaria disease is the consequence of infection by a protozoan parasite from the genus Plasmodium with most morbidity and mortality caused by P. falciparum. With rates of infection plateauing and rebounding in some areas (in particular, as a result of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic), there have been increasing calls for new initiatives that can reduce malaria incidence towards local elimination or the hoped for goal of global eradication. In 2021, the World Health Organisation approved the first malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 (also called Mosquirix™), indicating it to be safe for use in young children and advocating its integration into routine immunisation programmes. Approval of this vaccine clearly represents a major landmark in global efforts towards malaria control and eradication aspirations. RTS,S modest efficacy, however, points at the need to better understand immune responses to the parasite if we hope to design next generation malaria vaccines with increased potency.© 2023 The Authors.

"37259917","Exercise, exerkines, and cardiometabolic health: from individual players to a team sport.","J Clin Invest","Exercise confers numerous salutary effects that extend beyond individual organ systems to provide systemic health benefits. Here, we discuss the role of exercise in cardiovascular health. We summarize major findings from human exercise studies in cardiometabolic disease. We next describe our current understanding of cardiac-specific substrate metabolism that occurs with acute exercise and in response to exercise training. We subsequently focus on exercise-stimulated circulating biochemicals (""exerkines"") as a paradigm for understanding the global health circuitry of exercise, and discuss important concepts in this emerging field before highlighting exerkines relevant in cardiovascular health and disease. Finally, this Review identifies gaps that remain in the field of exercise science and opportunities that exist to translate biologic insights into human health improvement."
"37268822","Roles and regulation of microglia activity in multiple sclerosis: insights from animal models.","Nat Rev Neurosci","As resident macrophages of the CNS, microglia are critical immune effectors of inflammatory lesions and associated neural dysfunctions. In multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal models, chronic microglial inflammatory activity damages myelin and disrupts axonal and synaptic activity. In contrast to these detrimental effects, the potent phagocytic and tissue-remodelling capabilities of microglia support critical endogenous repair mechanisms. Although these opposing capabilities have long been appreciated, a precise understanding of their underlying molecular effectors is only beginning to emerge. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the roles of microglia in animal models of MS and demyelinating lesions and the mechanisms that underlie their damaging and repairing activities. We also discuss how the structured organization and regulation of the genome enables complex transcriptional heterogeneity within the microglial cell population at demyelinating lesions.© 2023.

"37240524","Recent Advances and Potential Multi-Omics Approaches in the Early Phases of Inflammatory Bowel Disease.","J Clin Med","Inflammatory bowel disease leads to debilitating gastrointestinal symptoms and reduced quality of life, resulting in a significant burden on healthcare utilization and costs. Despite substantial advancements in diagnosis and treatment, there may still be considerable delays in diagnosing some patients. To reduce disease progression before the full disease spectrum appears and improve prognostic outcomes, several strategies have concentrated on early intervention and prevention. Recent evidence shows that initial immune response changes and endoscopic lesions may exist for years before diagnosis, implying the existence of a preclinical phase of inflammatory bowel disease comparable to findings in other immune-mediated disorders. In this review, we highlight the most relevant findings regarding preclinical inflammatory bowel disease and the prospective role of novel omics techniques in this field."
"37276833","Adenoviral-vectored next-generation respiratory mucosal vaccines against COVID-19.","Curr Opin Virol","The world is in need of next-generation COVID-19 vaccines. Although first-generation injectable COVID-19 vaccines continue to be critical tools in controlling the current global health crisis, continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern has eroded the efficacy of these vaccines, leading to staggering breakthrough infections and posing threats to poor vaccine responders. This is partly because the humoral and T-cell responses generated following intramuscular injection of spike-centric monovalent vaccines are mostly confined to the periphery, failing to either access or be maintained at the portal of infection, the respiratory mucosa (RM). In contrast, respiratory mucosal-delivered vaccine can induce immunity encompassing humoral, cellular, and trained innate immunity positioned at the respiratory mucosa that may act quickly to prevent the establishment of an infection. Viral vectors, especially adenoviruses, represent the most promising platform for RM delivery that can be designed to express both structural and nonstructural antigens of SARS-CoV-2. Boosting RM immunity via the respiratory route using multivalent adenoviral-vectored vaccines would be a viable next-generation vaccine strategy.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"37267125","Comprehensive characterization of tumor microenvironment in colorectal cancer via molecular analysis.","Elife","Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a challenging and deadly disease with high tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity. Using an integrative multi-omics analysis and artificial intelligence-enabled spatial analysis of whole-slide images, we performed a comprehensive characterization of TME in colorectal cancer (CCCRC). CRC samples were classified into four CCCRC subtypes with distinct TME features, namely, C1 as the proliferative subtype with low immunogenicity; C2 as the immunosuppressed subtype with the terminally exhausted immune characteristics; C3 as the immune-excluded subtype with the distinct upregulation of stromal components and a lack of T cell infiltration in the tumor core; and C4 as the immunomodulatory subtype with the remarkable upregulation of anti-tumor immune components. The four CCCRC subtypes had distinct histopathologic and molecular characteristics, therapeutic efficacy, and prognosis. We found that the C1 subtype may be suitable for chemotherapy and cetuximab, the C2 subtype may benefit from a combination of chemotherapy and bevacizumab, the C3 subtype has increased sensitivity to the WNT pathway inhibitor WIKI4, and the C4 subtype is a potential candidate for immune checkpoint blockade treatment. Importantly, we established a simple gene classifier for accurate identification of each CCCRC subtype. Collectively our integrative analysis ultimately established a holistic framework to thoroughly dissect the TME of CRC, and the CCCRC classification system with high biological interpretability may contribute to biomarker discovery and future clinical trial design.© 2023, Wu, Yan, Qiu et al."
"37093976","Elucidating the RNA-Protein Interactomes of Target RNAs in Tissue.","Anal Chem","RNA-protein interactions are key to many aspects of cellular homeostasis and their identification is important to understanding cellular function. Multiple strategies have been developed for the RNA-centric characterization of RNA-protein complexes. However, these studies have all been done in immortalized cell lines that do not capture the complexity of heterogeneous tissue samples. Here, we develop hybridization purification of RNA-protein complexes followed by mass spectrometry (HyPR-MS) for use in tissue samples. We isolated both polyadenylated RNA and the specific long noncoding RNA MALAT1 and characterized their protein interactomes. These results demonstrate the feasibility of HyPR-MS in tissue for the multiplexed characterization of specific RNA-protein complexes."
"37286742","Transposable elements in mammalian chromatin organization.","Nat Rev Genet","Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA elements that comprise almost 50% of mammalian genomic sequence. TEs are capable of making additional copies of themselves that integrate into new positions in host genomes. This unique property has had an important impact on mammalian genome evolution and on the regulation of gene expression because TE-derived sequences can function as cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers, promoters and silencers. Now, advances in our ability to identify and characterize TEs have revealed that TE-derived sequences also regulate gene expression by both maintaining and shaping 3D genome architecture. Studies are revealing how TEs contribute raw sequence that can give rise to the structures that shape chromatin organization, and thus gene expression, allowing for species-specific genome innovation and evolutionary novelty.© 2023.

"37264447","A survey of mapping algorithms in the long-reads era.","Genome Biol","It has been over a decade since the first publication of a method dedicated entirely to mapping long-reads. The distinctive characteristics of long reads resulted in methods moving from the seed-and-extend framework used for short reads to a seed-and-chain framework due to the seed abundance in each read. The main novelties are based on alternative seed constructs or chaining formulations. Dozens of tools now exist, whose heuristics have evolved considerably. We provide an overview of the methods used in long-read mappers. Since they are driven by implementation-specific parameters, we develop an original visualization tool to understand the parameter settings ( http://bcazaux.polytech-lille.net/Minimap2/ ).© 2023.
