,,,,37309088,Whole-genome methylation analysis of aging human tissues identifies age-related changes in developmental and neurological pathways.,Aging Cell,"Age-associated changes in the DNA methylation state can be used to assess the pace of aging. However, it is not understood what mechanisms drive these changes and whether these changes affect the development of aging phenotypes and the aging process in general. This study was aimed at gaining a more comprehensive understanding of aging-related methylation changes across the whole genome, and relating these changes to biological functions. It has been shown that skeletal muscle and blood monocytes undergo typical changes with aging. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we sought to characterize the genome-wide changes in methylation of DNA derived from both skeletal muscle and blood monocytes, and link these changes to specific genes and pathways through enrichment analysis. We found that methylation changes occur with aging at the locations enriched for developmental and neuronal pathways regulated in these two peripheral tissues. These results contribute to our understanding of changes in epigenome in human aging.Published 2023. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

,,,,37300819,Sex-specific DNA methylation in saliva from the multi-ethnic Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study.,Epigenetics,"The prevalence and severity of many diseases differs by sex, potentially due to sex-specific patterns in DNA methylation. Autosomal sex-specific differences in DNA methylation have been observed in cord blood and placental tissue but are not well studied in saliva or in diverse populations. We sought to characterize sex-specific DNA methylation on autosomal chromosomes in saliva samples from children in the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a multi-ethnic prospective birth cohort containing an oversampling of Black, Hispanic and low-income families. DNA methylation from saliva samples was analysed on 796 children (50.6% male) at both ages 9 and 15 with DNA methylation measured using the Illumina HumanMethylation 450k array. An epigenome-wide association analysis of the age 9 samples identified 8,430 sex-differentiated autosomal DNA methylation sites (P < 2.4 × 10-7), of which 76.2% had higher DNA methylation in female children. The strongest sex-difference was in the cg26921482 probe, in theAMDHD2gene, with 30.6% higher DNA methylation in female compared to male children (P < 1 × 10-300). Treating the age 15 samples as an internal replication set, we observed highly consistent results between the ages 9 and 15 measurements, indicating stable and replicable sex-differentiation. Further, we directly compared our results to previously published DNA methylation sex differences in both cord blood and saliva and again found strong consistency. Our findings support widespread and robust sex-differential DNA methylation across age, human tissues, and populations. These findings help inform our understanding of potential biological processes contributing to sex differences in human physiology and disease."
,,,,37264042,On the thermodynamics of DNA methylation process.,Sci Rep,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that plays important roles in various biological processes including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, genomic imprinting, aging, and stress response to environmental changes and disease. Consistent with thermodynamic principles acting within living systems and the application of maximum entropy principle, we propose a theoretical framework to understand and decode the DNA methylation process. A central tenet of this argument is that the probability density function of DNA methylation information-divergence summarizes the statistical biophysics underlying spontaneous methylation background and implicitly bears on the channel capacity of molecular machines conforming to Shannon's capacity theorem. On this theoretical basis, contributions from the molecular machine (enzyme) logical operations to Gibb entropy (S) and Helmholtz free energy (F) are intrinsic. Application to the estimations of S on datasets from Arabidopsis thaliana suggests that, as a thermodynamic state variable, individual methylome entropy is completely determined by the current state of the system, which in biological terms translates to a correspondence between estimated entropy values and observable phenotypic state. In patients with different types of cancer, results suggest that a significant information loss occurs in the transition from differentiated (healthy) tissues to cancer cells. This type of analysis may have important implications for early-stage diagnostics. The analysis of entropy fluctuations on experimental datasets revealed existence of restrictions on the magnitude of genome-wide methylation changes originating by organismal response to environmental changes. Only dysfunctional stages observed in the Arabidopsis mutant met1 and in cancer cells do not conform to these rules.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,,,,37258616,Genome-wide DNA methylation association study of recent and cumulative marijuana use in middle aged adults.,Mol Psychiatry,"Marijuana is a widely used psychoactive substance in the US and medical and recreational legalization has risen over the past decade. Despite the growing number of individuals using marijuana, studies investigating the association between epigenetic factors and recent and cumulative marijuana use remain limited. We therefore investigated the association between recent and cumulative marijuana use and DNA methylation levels. Participants from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study with whole blood collected at examination years (Y) 15 and Y20 were randomly selected to undergo DNA methylation profiling at both timepoints using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Recent use of marijuana was queried at each examination and used to estimate cumulative marijuana use from Y0 to Y15 and Y20. At Y15 (n = 1023), we observed 22 and 31 methylation markers associated (FDR P ≤ 0.05) with recent and cumulative marijuana use and 132 and 16 methylation markers at Y20 (n = 883), respectively. We replicated 8 previously reported methylation markers associated with marijuana use. We further identified 640 cis-meQTLs and 198 DMRs associated with recent and cumulative use at Y15 and Y20. Differentially methylated genes were statistically overrepresented in pathways relating to cellular proliferation, hormone signaling, and infections as well as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and substance-related disorders. We identified numerous methylation markers, pathways, and diseases associated with recent and cumulative marijuana use in middle-aged adults, providing additional insight into the association between marijuana use and the epigenome. These results provide novel insights into the role marijuana has on the epigenome and related health conditions.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,,,,37268982,Epigenetic age acceleration mediates the association between smoking and diabetes-related outcomes.,Clin Epigenetics,"Smoking can lead to the deterioration of lung function and susceptibility to diabetes. Recently, smoking was found to induce DNA methylation (DNAm) changes in some cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpGs). As linear combinations of DNAm levels of aging-related CpGs, five measures of epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) have received extensive attention: HannumEAA, IEAA, PhenoEAA, GrimEAA, and DunedinPACE. It is of interest to explore whether some measures of EAA can mediate the associations of smoking with diabetes-related outcomes and indices of ventilatory lung function.In this study, we included self-reported smoking variables (smoking status, the number of pack-years, and years since smoking cessation), seven DNAm markers (HannumEAA, IEAA, PhenoEAA, GrimEAA, DNAm-based smoking pack-years, DNAm plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 [PAI-1] levels, and DunedinPACE), and four health outcomes (fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, forced expiratory volume in 1.0 s [FEV1], and forced vital capacity [FVC]) from 2474 Taiwan Biobank participants. Mediation analyses were conducted while adjusting for chronological age, sex, body mass index, drinking status, regular exercise status, educational attainment, and five cell-type proportions. We demonstrated that GrimEAA, DNAm-based smoking pack-years, DNAm PAI-1 levels, DunedinPACE, and PhenoEAA mediated smoking associations with diabetes-related outcomes. Moreover, current and former smoking both had an adverse indirect effect on FVC through DNAm PAI-1 levels. For former smokers, a long time since smoking cessation had a positive indirect impact on FVC through GrimEAA and on FEV1 through PhenoEAA.This is one of the first studies to comprehensively investigate the role of five measures of EAA in mediating the associations of smoking with the health outcomes of an Asian population. The results showed that the second-generation epigenetic clocks (GrimEAA, DunedinPACE, and PhenoEAA) significantly mediated the associations between smoking and diabetes-related outcomes. In contrast, the first-generation epigenetic clocks (HannumEAA and IEAA) did not significantly mediate any associations of smoking variables with the four health outcomes. Cigarette smoking can, directly and indirectly, deteriorate human health through DNAm changes in aging-related CpG sites.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,,,,37259015,A metabolomic signature of decelerated physiological aging in human plasma.,Geroscience,"The degenerative processes that occur during aging increase the risk of disease and impaired health. Meanwhile, interventions that target aging to promote healthy longevity are gaining interest, both academically and in the public. While nutritional and physical interventions exist, efficacy is often difficult to determine. It is therefore imperative that an aging score measuring the biological aging process is available to the wider public. However, simple, interpret, and accessible biological aging scores are lacking. Here, we developed PhysiAge, a physiological aging score based on five accessible parameters that have influence on or reflect the aging process: (1) average daily step count, (2) blood glucose, (3) systolic blood pressure, (4) sex, and (5) age. Here, we found that compared to calendar age alone, PhysiAge better predicts mortality, as well as established muscle aging markers such as decrease in NAD+levels, increase in oxidative stress, and decline in physical functioning. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of PhysiAge in identifying relevant factors associated with decelerated aging, we calculated PhysiAges for a cohort of aged individuals and obtained mass spectrometry-based blood plasma metabolomic profiles for each individual. Here, we identified a metabolic signature of decelerated aging, which included components of the TCA cycle, including malate, citrate, and isocitrate. Higher abundance of these metabolites was associated with decelerated aging, in line with supplementation studies in model organisms. PhysiAge represents an accessible way for people to track and intervene in their aging trajectories, and identifies a metabolic signature of decelerated aging in human blood plasma, which can be further studied for its causal involvement in human aging.© 2023.

,,,,37291214,An integrated cell atlas of the lung in health and disease.,Nat Med,"Single-cell technologies have transformed our understanding of human tissues. Yet, studies typically capture only a limited number of donors and disagree on cell type definitions. Integrating many single-cell datasets can address these limitations of individual studies and capture the variability present in the population. Here we present the integrated Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA), combining 49 datasets of the human respiratory system into a single atlas spanning over 2.4 million cells from 486 individuals. The HLCA presents a consensus cell type re-annotation with matching marker genes, including annotations of rare and previously undescribed cell types. Leveraging the number and diversity of individuals in the HLCA, we identify gene modules that are associated with demographic covariates such as age, sex and body mass index, as well as gene modules changing expression along the proximal-to-distal axis of the bronchial tree. Mapping new data to the HLCA enables rapid data annotation and interpretation. Using the HLCA as a reference for the study of disease, we identify shared cell states across multiple lung diseases, including SPP1+profibrotic monocyte-derived macrophages in COVID-19, pulmonary fibrosis and lung carcinoma. Overall, the HLCA serves as an example for the development and use of large-scale, cross-dataset organ atlases within the Human Cell Atlas.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,,,,37264206,Genetically adjusted PSA levels for prostate cancer screening.,Nat Med,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer remains controversial because it increases overdiagnosis and overtreatment of clinically insignificant tumors. Accounting for genetic determinants of constitutive, non-cancer-related PSA variation has potential to improve screening utility. In this study, we discovered 128 genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 × 10-8) in a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of 95,768 men and developed a PSA polygenic score (PGSPSA) that explains 9.61% of constitutive PSA variation. We found that, in men of European ancestry, using PGS-adjusted PSA would avoid up to 31% of negative prostate biopsies but also result in 12% fewer biopsies in patients with prostate cancer, mostly with Gleason score <7 tumors. Genetically adjusted PSA was more predictive of aggressive prostate cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 3.44, P = 6.2 × 10-14, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.755) than unadjusted PSA (OR = 3.31, P = 1.1 × 10-12, AUC = 0.738) in 106 cases and 23,667 controls. Compared to a prostate cancer PGS alone (AUC = 0.712), including genetically adjusted PSA improved detection of aggressive disease (AUC = 0.786, P = 7.2 × 10-4). Our findings highlight the potential utility of incorporating PGS for personalized biomarkers in prostate cancer screening.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,,,,37216410,Canonical correlation analysis for multi-omics: Application to cross-cohort analysis.,PLoS Genet,"Integrative approaches that simultaneously model multi-omics data have gained increasing popularity because they provide holistic system biology views of multiple or all components in a biological system of interest. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a correlation-based integrative method designed to extract latent features shared between multiple assays by finding the linear combinations of features-referred to as canonical variables (CVs)-within each assay that achieve maximal across-assay correlation. Although widely acknowledged as a powerful approach for multi-omics data, CCA has not been systematically applied to multi-omics data in large cohort studies, which has only recently become available. Here, we adapted sparse multiple CCA (SMCCA), a widely-used derivative of CCA, to proteomics and methylomics data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Jackson Heart Study (JHS). To tackle challenges encountered when applying SMCCA to MESA and JHS, our adaptations include the incorporation of the Gram-Schmidt (GS) algorithm with SMCCA to improve orthogonality among CVs, and the development of Sparse Supervised Multiple CCA (SSMCCA) to allow supervised integration analysis for more than two assays. Effective application of SMCCA to the two real datasets reveals important findings. Applying our SMCCA-GS to MESA and JHS, we identified strong associations between blood cell counts and protein abundance, suggesting that adjustment of blood cell composition should be considered in protein-based association studies. Importantly, CVs obtained from two independent cohorts also demonstrate transferability across the cohorts. For example, proteomic CVs learned from JHS, when transferred to MESA, explain similar amounts of blood cell count phenotypic variance in MESA, explaining 39.0% ~ 50.0% variation in JHS and 38.9% ~ 49.1% in MESA. Similar transferability was observed for other omics-CV-trait pairs. This suggests that biologically meaningful and cohort-agnostic variation is captured by CVs. We anticipate that applying our SMCCA-GS and SSMCCA on various cohorts would help identify cohort-agnostic biologically meaningful relationships between multi-omics data and phenotypic traits.Copyright: © 2023 Jiang et al.

Collectively, these methods are revolutionizing molecular cell biology research. In this comprehensive Review, we discuss established multi-omics technologies as well as cutting-edge and state-of-the-art methods in the field. We discuss how multi-omics technologies have been adapted and improved over the past decade using a framework characterized by optimization of throughput and resolution, modality integration, uniqueness and accuracy, and we also discuss multi-omics limitations. We highlight the impact that single-cell multi-omics technologies have had in cell lineage tracing, tissue-specific and cell-specific atlas production, tumour immunology and cancer genetics, and in mapping of cellular spatial information in fundamental and translational research. Finally, we discuss bioinformatics tools that have been developed to link different omics modalities and elucidate functionality through the use of better mathematical modelling and computational methods.© 2023.

,,,,37286633,Large scale proteomic studies create novel privacy considerations.,Sci Rep,"Privacy protection is a core principle of genomic but not proteomic research. We identified independent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) quantitative trait loci (pQTL) from COPDGene and Jackson Heart Study (JHS), calculated continuous protein level genotype probabilities, and then applied a naïve Bayesian approach to link SomaScan 1.3K proteomes to genomes for 2812 independent subjects from COPDGene, JHS, SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). We correctly linked 90-95% of proteomes to their correct genome and for 95-99% we identify the 1% most likely links. The linking accuracy in subjects with African ancestry was lower (~ 60%) unless training included diverse subjects. With larger profiling (SomaScan 5K) in the Atherosclerosis Risk Communities (ARIC) correct identification was > 99% even in mixed ancestry populations. We also linked proteomes-to-proteomes and used the proteome only to determine features such as sex, ancestry, and first-degree relatives. When serial proteomes are available, the linking algorithm can be used to identify and correct mislabeled samples. This work also demonstrates the importance of including diverse populations in omics research and that large proteomic datasets (> 1000 proteins) can be accurately linked to a specific genome through pQTL knowledge and should not be considered unidentifiable.© 2023.

,,,,37205426,Association between circulating inflammatory markers and adult cancer risk: a Mendelian randomization analysis.,medRxiv,"Tumour-promoting inflammation is a ""hallmark"" of cancer and conventional epidemiological studies have reported links between various inflammatory markers and cancer risk. The causal nature of these relationships and, thus, the suitability of these markers as intervention targets for cancer prevention is unclear.We meta-analysed 6 genome-wide association studies of circulating inflammatory markers comprising 59,969 participants of European ancestry. We then used combinedcis-Mendelian randomization and colocalisation analysis to evaluate the causal role of 66 circulating inflammatory markers in risk of 30 adult cancers in 338,162 cancer cases and up to 824,556 controls. Genetic instruments for inflammatory markers were constructed using genome-wide significant (P< 5.0 x 10-8)cis-acting SNPs (i.e. in or ±250 kb from the gene encoding the relevant protein) in weak linkage disequilibrium (LD, r2< 0.10). Effect estimates were generated using inverse-variance weighted random-effects models and standard errors were inflated to account for weak LD between variants with reference to the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 CEU panel. A false discovery rate (FDR)-correctedP-value (""q-value"") < 0.05 was used as a threshold to define ""strong evidence"" to support associations and 0.05 ≤q-value < 0.20 to define ""suggestive evidence"". A colocalisation posterior probability (PPH4) > 70% was employed to indicate support for shared causal variants across inflammatory markers and cancer outcomes.We found strong evidence to support an association of genetically-proxied circulating pro-adrenomedullin concentrations with increased breast cancer risk (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.10-1.29,q-value=0.033, PPH4=84.3%) and suggestive evidence to support associations of interleukin-23 receptor concentrations with increased pancreatic cancer risk (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.20-1.69,q-value=0.055, PPH4=73.9%), prothrombin concentrations with decreased basal cell carcinoma risk (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53-0.81,q-value=0.067, PPH4=81.8%), macrophage migration inhibitory factor concentrations with increased bladder cancer risk (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.23,q-value=0.072, PPH4=76.1%), and interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 concentrations with decreased triple-negative breast cancer risk (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.97,q-value=0.15), PPH4=85.6%). For 22 of 30 cancer outcomes examined, there was little evidence (q-value ≥ 0.20) that any of the 66 circulating inflammatory markers examined were associated with cancer risk.Our comprehensive joint Mendelian randomization and colocalisation analysis of the role of circulating inflammatory markers in cancer risk identified potential roles for 5 circulating inflammatory markers in risk of 5 site-specific cancers. Contrary to reports from some prior conventional epidemiological studies, we found little evidence of association of circulating inflammatory markers with the majority of site-specific cancers evaluated."
,,,,37285076,Loss of Y chromosome in leukocytes can be regarded as a male-specific age predictor for age group estimation in forensic genetics.,Mol Genet Genomics,"Age prediction is an important field in forensic and aging research. Traditional methods used DNA methylation, telomere shortening, and mitochondrial DNA mutations to conduct age prediction models. Sex chromosomes, like the Y chromosome, have a significant role in aging as previously reported in hematopoietic disease and many non-reproductive cancers. Until now, there is no age predictor based on the percentage of loss of Y chromosome (LOY). LOY has been previously revealed to be correlated with Alzheimer's disease, short survival, and higher risk of cancer. The possible correlation of LOY between normal aging was not fully explored. In this study, we conducted age prediction by measuring LOY percentage by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), based on 232 healthy male samples, including 171 blood samples, 49 saliva samples, 12 semen samples. The age group of samples ranges from 0 to 99 years, with two individuals in almost every single age. Pearson correlation method was performed to calculate the correlation index. The result indicated a correlation index of 0.21 (p = 0.0059) between age and LOY percentage in blood samples, with the regression formula being y = - 0.016823 + 0.001098x. The correlation between LOY percentage and age is obvious only when the individuals were divided into different age groups (R = 0.73, p = 0.016). In the studied saliva and semen samples, p-values of the correlation are 0.11 and 0.20, respectively, showing no significant association between age and LOY percentage in these two biological materials. For the first time, we investigated male-specific age predictor based on LOY. The study showed that LOY in leukocytes can be regarded as a male-specific age predictor for age group estimation in forensic genetics. This study might be indicative for forensic applications and aging research.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

,,,,37258665,Deterministic evolution and stringent selection during preneoplasia.,Nature,"The earliest events during human tumour initiation, although poorly characterized, may hold clues to malignancy detection and prevention1. Here we model occult preneoplasia by biallelic inactivation of TP53, a common early event in gastric cancer, in human gastric organoids. Causal relationships between this initiating genetic lesion and resulting phenotypes were established using experimental evolution in multiple clonally derived cultures over 2 years. TP53 loss elicited progressive aneuploidy, including copy number alterations and structural variants prevalent in gastric cancers, with evident preferred orders. Longitudinal single-cell sequencing of TP53-deficient gastric organoids similarly indicates progression towards malignant transcriptional programmes. Moreover, high-throughput lineage tracing with expressed cellular barcodes demonstrates reproducible dynamics whereby initially rare subclones with shared transcriptional programmes repeatedly attain clonal dominance. This powerful platform for experimental evolution exposes stringent selection, clonal interference and a marked degree of phenotypic convergence in premalignant epithelial organoids. These data imply predictability in the earliest stages of tumorigenesis and show evolutionary constraints and barriers to malignant transformation, with implications for earlier detection and interception of aggressive, genome-instable tumours.© 2023.

,,,,37268719,Circulating tumour cells for early detection of clinically relevant cancer.,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,"Given that cancer mortality is usually a result of late diagnosis, efforts in the field of early detection are paramount to reducing cancer-related deaths and improving patient outcomes. Increasing evidence indicates that metastasis is an early event in patients with aggressive cancers, often occurring even before primary lesions are clinically detectable. Metastases are usually formed from cancer cells that spread to distant non-malignant tissues via the blood circulation, termed circulating tumour cells (CTCs). CTCs have been detected in patients with early stage cancers and, owing to their association with metastasis, might indicate the presence of aggressive disease, thus providing a possible means to expedite diagnosis and treatment initiation for such patients while avoiding overdiagnosis and overtreatment of those with slow-growing, indolent tumours. The utility of CTCs as an early diagnostic tool has been investigated, although further improvements in the efficiency of CTC detection are required. In this Perspective, we discuss the clinical significance of early haematogenous dissemination of cancer cells, the potential of CTCs to facilitate early detection of clinically relevant cancers, and the technological advances that might improve CTC capture and, thus, diagnostic performance in this setting.© 2023.

,,,,37264016,The blood proteome of imminent lung cancer diagnosis.,Nat Commun,"Identification of risk biomarkers may enhance early detection of smoking-related lung cancer. We measured between 392 and 1,162 proteins in blood samples drawn at most three years before diagnosis in 731 smoking-matched case-control sets nested within six prospective cohorts from the US, Europe, Singapore, and Australia. We identify 36 proteins with independently reproducible associations with risk of imminent lung cancer diagnosis (all p < 4 × 10-5). These include a few markers (e.g. CA-125/MUC-16 and CEACAM5/CEA) that have previously been reported in studies using pre-diagnostic blood samples for lung cancer. The 36 proteins include several growth factors (e.g. HGF, IGFBP-1, IGFP-2), tumor necrosis factor-receptors (e.g. TNFRSF6B, TNFRSF13B), and chemokines and cytokines (e.g. CXL17, GDF-15, SCF). The odds ratio per standard deviation range from 1.31 for IGFBP-1 (95% CI: 1.17-1.47) to 2.43 for CEACAM5 (95% CI: 2.04-2.89). We map the 36 proteins to the hallmarks of cancer and find that activation of invasion and metastasis, proliferative signaling, tumor-promoting inflammation, and angiogenesis are most frequently implicated.© 2023.

Samples were collected within 3 years prior to lung cancer diagnosis. We used Cox proportional hazards models to identify proteins associated with overall mortality after lung cancer diagnosis. To evaluate model performance, we used a round-robin approach in which models were fit in 5 cohorts and evaluated in the 6th cohort. Specifically, we fit a model including 5 proteins and clinical parameters and compared its performance with clinical parameters only.There were 86 proteins nominally associated with mortality (p < 0.05), but only CDCP1 remained statistically significant after accounting for multiple testing (hazard ratio per standard deviation: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.10-1.30, unadjusted p = 0.00004). The external C-index for the protein-based model was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.61-0.66), compared with 0.62 (95% CI: 0.59-0.64) for the model with clinical parameters only. Inclusion of proteins did not provide a statistically significant improvement in discrimination (C-index difference: 0.015, 95% CI: -0.003 to 0.035).Blood proteins measured within 3 years prior to lung cancer diagnosis were not strongly associated with lung cancer survival, nor did they importantly improve prediction of prognosis beyond clinical information.No explicit funding for this study.

,,,,37274121,Cell type deconvolution of methylated cell-free DNA at the resolution of individual reads.,NAR Genom Bioinform,"Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are DNA fragments originating from dying cells that are detectable in bodily fluids, such as the plasma. Accelerated cell death, for example caused by disease, induces an elevated concentration of cfDNA. As a result, determining the cell type origins of cfDNA molecules can provide information about an individual's health. In this work, we aim to increase the sensitivity of methylation-based cell type deconvolution by adapting an existing method, CelFiE, which uses the methylation beta values of individual CpG sites to estimate cell type proportions. Our new method, CelFEER, instead differentiates cell types by the average methylation values within individual reads. We additionally improved the originally reported performance of CelFiE by using a new approach for finding marker regions that are differentially methylated between cell types. We show that CelFEER estimates cell type proportions with a higher correlation (r= 0.94 ± 0.04) than CelFiE (r= 0.86 ± 0.09) on simulated mixtures of cell types. Moreover, we show that the cell type proportion estimated by CelFEER can differentiate between ALS patients and healthy controls, between pregnant women in their first and third trimester, and between pregnant women with and without gestational diabetes.© The Author(s) 2023.

Accelerated ageing is a key feature of DKD and, therefore, characteristics of accelerated ageing may provide useful biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Harnessing multi-omics, features affecting telomere biology and any associated methylome dysregulation in DKD were explored. Genotype data for nuclear genome polymorphisms in telomere-related genes were extracted from genome-wide case-control association data (n = 823 DKD/903 controls; n = 247 end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)/1479 controls). Telomere length was established using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Quantitative methylation values for 1091 CpG sites in telomere-related genes were extracted from epigenome-wide case-control association data (n = 150 DKD/100 controls). Telomere length was significantly shorter in older age groups (p= 7.6 × 10-6). Telomere length was also significantly reduced (p= 6.6 × 10-5) in DKD versus control individuals, with significance remaining after covariate adjustment (p= 0.028). DKD and ESKD were nominally associated with telomere-related genetic variation, with Mendelian randomisation highlighting no significant association between genetically predicted telomere length and kidney disease. A total of 496 CpG sites in 212 genes reached epigenome-wide significance (p≤ 10-8) for DKD association, and 412 CpG sites in 193 genes for ESKD. Functional prediction revealed differentially methylated genes were enriched for Wnt signalling involvement. Harnessing previously published RNA-sequencing datasets, potential targets where epigenetic dysregulation may result in altered gene expression were revealed, useful as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets for intervention."
,,,,37233989,Dietary and supplemental intake of vitamins C and E is associated with altered DNA methylation in an epigenome-wide association study meta-analysis.,Epigenetics,"Dietary intake of antioxidants such as vitamins C and E protect against oxidative stress, and may also be associated with altered DNA methylation patterns.We meta-analysed epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results from 11,866 participants across eight population-based cohorts to evaluate the association between self-reported dietary and supplemental intake of vitamins C and E with DNA methylation. EWAS were adjusted for age, sex, BMI, caloric intake, blood cell type proportion, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and technical covariates. Significant results of the meta-analysis were subsequently evaluated in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and expression quantitative trait methylation (eQTM) analysis.In meta-analysis, methylation at 4,656 CpG sites was significantly associated with vitamin C intake at FDR ≤ 0.05. The most significant CpG sites associated with vitamin C (at FDR ≤ 0.01) were enriched for pathways associated with systems development and cell signalling in GSEA, and were associated with downstream expression of genes enriched in the immune response in eQTM analysis. Furthermore, methylation at 160 CpG sites was significantly associated with vitamin E intake at FDR ≤ 0.05, but GSEA and eQTM analysis of the top most significant CpG sites associated with vitamin E did not identify significant enrichment of any biological pathways investigated.We identified significant associations of many CpG sites with vitamin C and E intake, and our results suggest that vitamin C intake may be associated with systems development and the immune response."
,,,,37231515,Epigenomic profiling of isolated blood cell types reveals highly specific B cell smoking signatures and links to disease risk.,Clin Epigenetics,"Tobacco smoking alters the DNA methylation profiles of immune cells which may underpin some of the pathogenesis of smoking-associated diseases. To link smoking-driven epigenetic effects in specific immune cell types with disease risk, we isolated six leukocyte subtypes, CD14+ monocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD56+ natural killer cells, from whole blood of 67 healthy adult smokers and 74 nonsmokers for epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) using Illumina 450k and EPIC methylation arrays.Numbers of smoking-associated differentially methylated sites (smCpGs) at genome-wide significance (p < 1.2 × 10-7) varied widely across cell types, from 5 smCpGs in CD8+ T cells to 111 smCpGs in CD19+ B cells. We found unique smoking effects in each cell type, some of which were not apparent in whole blood. Methylation-based deconvolution to estimate B cell subtypes revealed that smokers had 7.2% (p = 0.033) less naïve B cells. Adjusting for naïve and memory B cell proportions in EWAS and RNA-seq allowed the identification of genes enriched for B cell activation-related cytokine signaling pathways, Th1/Th2 responses, and hematopoietic cancers. Integrating with large-scale public datasets, 62 smCpGs were among CpGs associated with health-relevant EWASs. Furthermore, 74 smCpGs had reproducible methylation quantitative trait loci single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were in complete linkage disequilibrium with genome-wide association study SNPs, associating with lung function, disease risks, and other traits.We observed blood cell-type-specific smCpGs, a naïve-to-memory shift among B cells, and by integrating genome-wide datasets, we identified their potential links to disease risks and health traits.© 2023.

,,,,37230663,Maternal Periconceptional Folic Acid Supplementation and DNA Methylation Patterns in Adolescent Offspring.,J Nutr,"Folate, including the folic acid form, is a key component of the one-carbon metabolic pathway used for DNA methylation. Changes in DNA methylation patterns during critical development periods are associated with disease outcomes and are associated with changes in nutritional status in pregnancy. The long-term impact of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on DNA methylation patterns is unknown.To determine the long-term impact of periconceptional folic acid supplementation on DNA methylation patterns, we examined the association of the recommended dosage (400 μg/d) and time period (periconceptional before pregnancy through first trimester) of folic acid supplementation with the DNA methylation patterns in the offspring at age 14-17 y compared with offspring with no supplementation.Two geographic sites in China from the 1993-1995 Community Intervention Program of folic acid supplementation were selected for the follow-up study. DNA methylation at 402,730 CpG sites was assessed using saliva samples from 89 mothers and 179 adolescents (89 male). The mean age at saliva collection was 40 y among mothers (range: 35-54 y) and 15 y among adolescents (range: 14-17 y). Epigenome-wide analyses were conducted to assess the interactions of periconceptional folic acid exposure, the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)-C677T genotype, and epigenome-wide DNA methylation controlling for offspring sex, geographic region, and background cell composition in the saliva.In the primary outcome, no significant differences were observed in epigenome-wide methylation patterns between adolescents exposed and those non-exposed to maternal periconceptional folic acid supplementation after adjustment for potential confounders [false discovery rate (FDR) P values < 0.05]. The MTHFR-C677T genotype did not modify this lack of association (FDR P values < 0.05).Overall, there were no differences in DNA methylation between adolescents who were exposed during the critical developmental window and those not exposed to the recommended periconceptional/first-trimester dosage of folic acid.Copyright © 2022 American Society for Nutrition."
,,,,37218167,Detecting aberrant DNA methylation in Illumina DNA methylation arrays: a toolbox and recommendations for its use.,Epigenetics,"In this study, our goal was to determine probe-specific thresholds for identifying aberrant, or outlying, DNA methylation and to provide guidance on the relative merits of using continuous or outlier methylation data. To construct a reference database, we downloaded Illumina Human 450K array data for more than 2,000 normal samples, characterized the distribution of DNA methylation and derived probe-specific thresholds for identifying aberrations. We made the decision to restrict our reference database to solid normal tissue and morphologically normal tissue found adjacent to solid tumours, excluding blood which has very distinctive patterns of DNA methylation. Next, we explored the utility of our outlier thresholds in several analyses that are commonly performed on DNA methylation data. Outliers are as effective as the full continuous dataset for simple tasks, like distinguishing tumour tissue from normal, but becomes less useful as the complexity of the problem increases. We developed an R package called OutlierMeth containing our thresholds, as well as functions for applying them to data."
,,,,37231098,"Gene expression in African Americans, Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans reveals ancestry-specific patterns of genetic architecture.",Nat Genet,"We explored ancestry-related differences in the genetic architecture of whole-blood gene expression using whole-genome and RNA sequencing data from 2,733 African Americans, Puerto Ricans and Mexican Americans. We found that heritability of gene expression significantly increased with greater proportions of African genetic ancestry and decreased with higher proportions of Indigenous American ancestry, reflecting the relationship between heterozygosity and genetic variance. Among heritable protein-coding genes, the prevalence of ancestry-specific expression quantitative trait loci (anc-eQTLs) was 30% in African ancestry and 8% for Indigenous American ancestry segments. Most anc-eQTLs (89%) were driven by population differences in allele frequency. Transcriptome-wide association analyses of multi-ancestry summary statistics for 28 traits identified 79% more gene-trait associations using transcriptome prediction models trained in our admixed population than models trained using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Our study highlights the importance of measuring gene expression across large and ancestrally diverse populations for enabling new discoveries and reducing disparities.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,,,,37225790,A longitudinal study of the association between attending cultural events and coronary heart disease.,Commun Med (Lond),"The experiences of art and music are an essential part of human life and this study aimed to examine the longitudinal association between cultural participation and coronary heart disease.This was a longitudinal study on a randomly selected representative adult cohort (n = 3296) of the Swedish population. The study period was over 36 years (1982-2017) with three separate eight-year interval measurements of cultural exposure (for example, visiting theatres and museums) starting in 1982/83. The outcome was coronary heart disease during the study period. Marginal structural Cox models with inverse probability weighting were used to account for time-varying weights of the exposure and potential confounders during the follow-up. The associations were also examined through a time-varying Cox proportional hazard regression model.Cultural participation shows a graded association, the higher the exposure the lower the risk of coronary heart disease; the hazard ratio was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.86) for coronary heart disease in participants with the highest level of cultural exposure compared with the lowest level.Although causality cannot be determined due to the remaining risk of residual confounding and bias, the use of marginal structural Cox models with inverse probability weighting strengthens the evidence for a potentially causal association with cardiovascular health, which warrants further studies.© 2023.

,,,,37209526,Integrated fragmentomic profile and 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine of capture-based low-pass sequencing data enables pan-cancer detection via cfDNA.,Transl Oncol,"Using epigenetic markers and fragmentomics of cell-free DNA for cancer detection has been proven applicable.We further investigated the diagnostic potential of combining two features (epigenetic markers and fragmentomic information) of cell-free DNA for detecting various types of cancers. To do this, we extracted cfDNA fragmentomic features from 191 whole-genome sequencing data and studied them in 396 low-pass 5hmC sequencing data, which included four common cancer types and control samples.In our analysis of 5hmC sequencing data from cancer samples, we observed aberrant ultra-long fragments (220-500 bp) that differed from normal samples in terms of both size and coverage profile. These fragments played a significant role in predicting cancer. Leveraging the ability to detect cfDNA hydroxymethylation and fragmentomic markers simultaneously in low-pass 5hmC sequencing data, we developed an integrated model that incorporated 63 features representing both fragmentomic features and hydroxymethylation signatures. This model achieved high sensitivity and specificity for pan-cancer detection (88.52% and 82.35%, respectively).We showed that fragmentomic information in 5hmC sequencing data is an ideal marker for cancer detection and that it shows high performance in low-pass sequencing data.Copyright © 2023.

,,,,37239934,Assessing the Differential Methylation Analysis Quality for Microarray and NGS Platforms.,Int J Mol Sci,"Differential methylation (DM) is actively recruited in different types of fundamental and translational studies. Currently, microarray- and NGS-based approaches for methylation analysis are the most widely used with multiple statistical models designed to extract differential methylation signatures. The benchmarking of DM models is challenging due to the absence of gold standard data. In this study, we analyze an extensive number of publicly available NGS and microarray datasets with divergent and widely utilized statistical models and apply the recently suggested and validated rank-statistic-based approach Hobotnica to evaluate the quality of their results. Overall, microarray-based methods demonstrate more robust and convergent results, while NGS-based models are highly dissimilar. Tests on the simulated NGS data tend to overestimate the quality of the DM methods and therefore are recommended for use with caution. Evaluation of the top 10 DMC and top 100 DMC in addition to the not-subset signature also shows more stable results for microarray data. Summing up, given the observed heterogeneity in NGS methylation data, the evaluation of newly generated methylation signatures is a crucial step in DM analysis. The Hobotnica metric is coordinated with previously developed quality metrics and provides a robust, sensitive, and informative estimation of methods' performance and DM signatures' quality in the absence of gold standard data solving a long-existing problem in DM analysis."
,,,,37196634,Molecular signatures of post-traumatic stress disorder in war-zone-exposed veteran and active-duty soldiers.,Cell Rep Med,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a multisystem syndrome. Integration of systems-level multi-modal datasets can provide a molecular understanding of PTSD. Proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenomic assays are conducted on blood samples of two cohorts of well-characterized PTSD cases and controls: 340 veterans and 180 active-duty soldiers. All participants had been deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan and exposed to military-service-related criterion A trauma. Molecular signatures are identified from a discovery cohort of 218 veterans (109/109 PTSD+/-). Identified molecular signatures are tested in 122 separate veterans (62/60 PTSD+/-) and in 180 active-duty soldiers (PTSD+/-). Molecular profiles are computationally integrated with upstream regulators (genetic/methylation/microRNAs) and functional units (mRNAs/proteins/metabolites). Reproducible molecular features of PTSD are identified, including activated inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic dysregulation, and impaired angiogenesis. These processes may play a role in psychiatric and physical comorbidities, including impaired repair/wound healing mechanisms and cardiovascular, metabolic, and psychiatric diseases.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

,,,,37137305,Massively parallel base editing to map variant effects in human hematopoiesis.,Cell,"Systematic evaluation of the impact of genetic variants is critical for the study and treatment of human physiology and disease. While specific mutations can be introduced by genome engineering, we still lack scalable approaches that are applicable to the important setting of primary cells, such as blood and immune cells. Here, we describe the development of massively parallel base-editing screens in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Such approaches enable functional screens for variant effects across any hematopoietic differentiation state. Moreover, they allow for rich phenotyping through single-cell RNA sequencing readouts and separately for characterization of editing outcomes through pooled single-cell genotyping. We efficiently design improved leukemia immunotherapy approaches, comprehensively identify non-coding variants modulating fetal hemoglobin expression, define mechanisms regulating hematopoietic differentiation, and probe the pathogenicity of uncharacterized disease-associated variants. These strategies will advance effective and high-throughput variant-to-function mapping in human hematopoiesis to identify the causes of diverse diseases.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

,,,,37253775,Deep learning model accurately classifies metastatic tumors from primary tumors based on mutational signatures.,Sci Rep,"Metastatic propagation is the leading cause of death for most cancers. Prediction and elucidation of metastatic process is crucial for the treatment of cancer. Even though somatic mutations have been linked to tumorigenesis and metastasis, it is less explored whether metastatic events can be identified through genomic mutational signatures, which are concise descriptions of the mutational processes. Here, we developed MetaWise, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, by applying mutational signatures as input features calculated from Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) data of TCGA and other metastatic cohorts. This model can accurately classify metastatic tumors from primary tumors and outperform traditional machine learning (ML) models and a deep learning (DL) model, DiaDeL. Signatures of non-coding mutations also have a major impact on the model's performance. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Surrogate (LIME) analyses identify several mutational signatures which are directly correlated to metastatic spread in cancers, including APOBEC-mutagenesis, UV-induced signatures, and DNA damage response deficiency signatures.© 2023.

,,,,36400018,Evaluation of cell-free DNA approaches for multi-cancer early detection,Cancer Cell,"In the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (NCT02889978) substudy 1, we evaluate several approaches for a circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA)-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test by defining clinical limit of detection (LOD) based on circulating tumor allele fraction (cTAF), enabling performance comparisons. Among 10 machine-learning classifiers trained on the same samples and independently validated, when evaluated at 98% specificity, those using whole-genome (WG) methylation, single nucleotide variants with paired white blood cell background removal, and combined scores from classifiers evaluated in this study show the highest cancer signal detection sensitivities. Compared with clinical stage and tumor type, cTAF is a more significant predictor of classifier performance and may more closely reflect tumor biology. Clinical LODs mirror relative sensitivities for all approaches. The WG methylation feature best predicts cancer signal origin. WG methylation is the most promising technology for MCED and informs development of a targeted methylation MCED test."

Recent developments have established liquid biopsies as promising non-invasive methods for detecting biomarkers in lung cancer patients. With concurrent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, new approaches for biomarker discovery have emerged. In this article, we survey established and emerging biomarker discovery methods using nucleic acid materials derived from bodily fluids in the context of lung cancer. We introduce nucleic acid biomarkers extracted from liquid biopsies and outline biological sources and methods of isolation. We discuss next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms commonly used to identify novel biomarkers and describe how these have been applied to liquid biopsy. We highlight emerging biomarker discovery methods, including applications of long-read sequencing, fragmentomics, whole-genome amplification methods for single-cell analysis, and whole-genome methylation assays. Finally, we discuss advanced bioinformatics tools, describing methods for processing NGS data, as well as recently developed software tailored for liquid biopsy biomarker detection, which holds promise for early diagnosis of lung cancer."
,,,,36945560,Potentially causal associations between placental DNA methylation and schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders,medRxiv,"Increasing evidence supports the role of placenta in neurodevelopment and potentially, in the later onset of neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) and interaction QTL (iQTL) maps have proven useful to understand SNP-genome wide association study (GWAS) relationships, otherwise missed by conventional expression QTLs. In this context, we propose that part of the genetic predisposition to complex neuropsychiatric disorders acts through placental DNA methylation (DNAm). We constructed the first public placental cis -mQTL database including nearly eight million mQTLs calculated in 368 fetal placenta DNA samples from the INMA project, ran cell type- and gestational age-imQTL models and combined those data with the summary statistics of the largest GWAS on 10 neuropsychiatric disorders using Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and colocalization. Finally, we evaluated the influence of the DNAm sites identified on placental gene expression in the RICHS cohort. We found that placental cis -mQTLs are highly enriched in placenta-specific active chromatin regions, and useful to map the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders at prenatal stages. Specifically, part of the genetic burden for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder confers risk through placental DNAm. The potential causality of several of the observed associations is reinforced by secondary association signals identified in conditional analyses, regional pleiotropic methylation signals associated to the same disorder, and cell type- imQTLs, additionally associated to the expression levels of relevant immune genes in placenta. In conclusion, the genetic risk of several neuropsychiatric disorders could operate, at least in part, through DNAm and associated gene expression in placenta."
,,,,37262156,The landscape of tolerated genetic variation in humans and primates,Science,"Personalized genome sequencing has revealed millions of genetic differences between individuals, but our understanding of their clinical relevance remains largely incomplete. To systematically decipher the effects of human genetic variants, we obtained whole-genome sequencing data for 809 individuals from 233 primate species and identified 4.3 million common protein-altering variants with orthologs in humans. We show that these variants can be inferred to have nondeleterious effects in humans based on their presence at high allele frequencies in other primate populations. We use this resource to classify 6% of all possible human protein-altering variants as likely benign and impute the pathogenicity of the remaining 94% of variants with deep learning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy for diagnosing pathogenic variants in patients with genetic diseases."
