,Yes,38418845,Epigenome-wide association study identifies neonatal DNA methylation associated with two-year attention problems in children born very preterm.,Transl Psychiatry,"Prior research has identified epigenetic predictors of attention problems in school-aged children but has not yet investigated these in young children, or children at elevated risk of attention problems due to preterm birth. The current study evaluated epigenome-wide associations between neonatal DNA methylation and attention problems at age 2 years in children born very preterm. Participants included 441 children from the Neonatal Neurobehavior and Outcomes in Very Preterm Infants (NOVI) Study, a multi-site study of infants born < 30 weeks gestational age. DNA methylation was measured from buccal swabs collected at NICU discharge using the Illumina MethylationEPIC Bead Array. Attention problems were assessed at 2 years of adjusted age using the attention problems subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). After adjustment for multiple testing, DNA methylation at 33 CpG sites was associated with child attention problems. Differentially methylated CpG sites were located in genes previously linked to physical and mental health, including several genes associated with ADHD in prior epigenome-wide and genome-wide association studies. Several CpG sites were located in genes previously linked to exposure to prenatal risk factors in the NOVI sample. Neonatal epigenetics measured at NICU discharge could be useful in identifying preterm children at risk for long-term attention problems and related psychiatric disorders, who could benefit from early prevention and intervention efforts.© 2024.

,Yes,38413986,Improvements in lung function following vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers are associated with buccal DNA methylation at 5 years of age.,Clin Epigenetics,"We previously reported in the ""Vitamin C to Decrease the Effects of Smoking in Pregnancy on Infant Lung Function"" randomized clinical trial (RCT) that vitamin C (500 mg/day) supplementation to pregnant smokers is associated with improved respiratory outcomes that persist through 5 years of age. The objective of this study was to assess whether buccal cell DNA methylation (DNAm), as a surrogate for airway epithelium, is associated with vitamin C supplementation, improved lung function, and decreased occurrence of wheeze.We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) using Infinium MethylationEPIC arrays and buccal DNAm from 158 subjects (80 placebo; 78 vitamin C) with pulmonary function testing (PFT) performed at the 5-year visit. EWAS were performed on (1) vitamin C treatment, (2) forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of expired volume (FEF25-75), and (3) offspring wheeze. Models were adjusted for sex, race, study site, gestational age at randomization (≤ OR > 18 weeks), proportion of epithelial cells, and latent covariates in addition to child length at PFT in EWAS for FEF25-75. We considered FDR p < 0.05 as genome-wide significant and nominal p < 0.001 as candidates for downstream analyses. Buccal DNAm measured in a subset of subjects at birth and near 1 year of age was used to determine whether DNAm signatures originated in utero, or emerged with age.Vitamin C treatment was associated with 457 FDR significant (q < 0.05) differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs; 236 hypermethylated; 221 hypomethylated) and 53 differentially methylated regions (DMRs; 26 hyper; 27 hypo) at 5 years of age. FEF25-75was associated with one FDR significant DMC (cg05814800), 1,468 candidate DMCs (p < 0.001), and 44 DMRs. Current wheeze was associated with 0 FDR-DMCs, 782 candidate DMCs, and 19 DMRs (p < 0.001). In 365/457 vitamin C FDR significant DMCs at 5 years of age, there was no significant interaction between time and treatment.Vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers is associated with buccal DNA methylation in offspring at 5 years of age, and most methylation signatures appear to be persistent from the prenatal period. Buccal methylation at 5 years was also associated with current lung function and occurrence of wheeze, and these functionally associated loci are enriched for vitamin C associated loci.

,Yes,38365790,Epigenome-wide association study of dietary fatty acid intake.,Clin Epigenetics,"Dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may have a protective effect on the development of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, depression and cancer, while a high intake of n-6 PUFA was often reported to be associated with inflammation-related traits. The effect of PUFAs on health outcomes might be mediated by DNA methylation (DNAm). The aim of our study is to identify the impact of PUFA intake on DNAm in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) FF4 cohort and the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS).DNA methylation levels were measured in whole blood from the population-based KORA FF4 study (N = 1354) and LLS (N = 448), using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip and Illumina HumanMethylation450 array, respectively. We assessed associations between DNAm and intake of eight and four PUFAs in KORA and LLS, respectively. Where possible, results were meta-analyzed. Below the Bonferroni correction threshold (p < 7.17 × 10-8), we identified two differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with PUFA intake in the KORA study. The DMP cg19937480, annotated to gene PRDX1, was positively associated with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in model 1 (beta: 2.00 × 10-5, 95%CI: 1.28 × 10-5-2.73 × 10-5, P value: 6.98 × 10-8), while cg05041783, annotated to gene MARK2, was positively associated with docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) in our fully adjusted model (beta: 9.80 × 10-5, 95%CI: 6.25 × 10-5-1.33 × 10-4, P value: 6.75 × 10-8). In the meta-analysis, we identified the CpG site (cg15951061), annotated to gene CDCA7L below Bonferroni correction (1.23 × 10-7) associated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) intake in model 1 (beta: 2.00 × 10-5, 95% CI: 1.27 × 10-5-2.73 × 10-5, P value = 5.99 × 10-8) and we confirmed the association of cg19937480 with DHA in both models 1 and 2 (beta: 2.07 × 10-5, 95% CI: 1.31 × 10-5-2.83 × 10-5, P value = 1.00 × 10-7and beta: 2.19 × 10-5, 95% CI: 1.41 × 10-5-2.97 × 10-5, P value = 5.91 × 10-8respectively).Our study identified three CpG sites associated with PUFA intake. The mechanisms of these sites remain largely unexplored, highlighting the novelty of our findings.

Exposure to psychosocial stressors may contribute to these health disparities. Racial discrimination, a major stressor for African American women, could affect health through epigenetic mechanisms.We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to examine the association of interpersonal racism (in daily life and in institutional settings) with DNA methylation in blood in 384 participants of the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS). We also evaluated whether a greater number of perceived experiences of racism was associated with epigenetic aging as measured using different methylation clocks. Models were adjusted for chronological age, body mass index, years of education, neighborhood SES, geographic region of residence, alcohol drinking, smoking, and technical covariates.Higher scores of racism in daily life were associated with higher methylation levels at the cg04494873 site in chromosome 5 (β = 0.64%; 95% CI = 0.41%, 0.87%; P = 6.35E-08). We also replicated one CpG site, cg03317714, which was inversely associated with racial discrimination in a previous EWAS among African American women. In the BWHS, higher scores of racism in daily life were associated with lower methylation levels at that CpG site (β = -0.94%; 95% CI = -1.37%, -0.51%; P = 2.2E-05). Higher racism scores were associated with accelerated epigenetic aging in more than one methylation clock.Exposure to discriminatory events may affect the epigenome and accelerate biological aging, which may explain in part the earlier onset of disease in African American women.© 2024.

Differential DNA methylation may represent an underlying mechanism.We analysed associations of infant animal and plant protein intakes with DNA methylation in early (2-6 years,N = 579) and late (7̄-12 years,N = 604) childhood in two studies. Study-specific robust linear regression models adjusted for relevant confounders were run, and then meta-analysed using a fixed-effects model. We also performed sex-stratified meta-analyses. Follow-up analyses included pathway analysis and eQTM look-up.Infant animal protein intake was not associated with DNA methylation in early childhood, but was associated with late-childhood DNA methylation at cg21300373 (P = 4.27 × 10¯8,MARCHF1) and cg10633363 (P = 1.09 × 10¯7,HOXB9) after FDR correction. Infant plant protein intake was associated with early-childhood DNA methylation at cg25973293 (P = 2.26 × 10-7,C1orf159) and cg15407373 (P = 2.13 × 10-7,MBP) after FDR correction. There was no overlap between the findings from the animal and plant protein analyses. We did not find enriched functional pathways at either time point using CpGs associated with animal and plant protein. These CpGs were not previously associated with childhood gene expression. Sex-stratified meta-analyses showed sex-specific DNA methylation associations for both animal and plant protein intake.Infant animal protein intake was associated with DNA methylation at two CpGs in late childhood. Infant plant protein intake was associated with DNA methylation in early childhood at two CpGs. A potential mediating role of DNA methylation at these CpGs between infant protein intake and health outcomes requires further investigation.",1
Sarah ,No,38176546,Prenatal and childhood lead exposure is prospectively associated with biological markers of aging in adolescence.,Sci Total Environ,"Few studies have related early life lead exposure to adolescent biological aging, a period characterized by marked increases in maturational tempo. We examined associations between prenatal and childhood lead exposure and adolescent biological age (mean 14.5 years) utilizing multiple epigenetic clocks including: intrinsic (IEAA), extrinsic (EEAA), Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge, Skin-Blood, Wu, PedBE, as well as DNA methylation derived telomere length (DNAmTL). Epigenetic clocks and DNAmTL were calculated via adolescent blood DNA methylation measured by Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips. We constructed general linear models (GLMs) with individual lead measures predicting biological age. We additionally examined sex-stratified models and lead by sex interactions, adjusting for adolescent age and lead levels, maternal smoking and education, and proportion of cell types. We also estimated effects of lead exposure on biological age using generalized estimating equations (GEE). First trimester blood lead was positively associated with a 0.14 increase in EEAA age in the GLMs though not the GEE models (95%CI 0.03, 0.25). First and 2nd trimester blood lead levels were associated with a 0.02 year increase in PedBE age in GLM and GEE models (1st trimester, 95%CI 0.004, 0.03; 2nd trimester, 95%CI 0.01, 0.03). Third trimester and 24 month blood lead levels were associated with a -0.06 and -0.05 decrease in Skin-Blood age, respectively, in GLM models. Additionally, 3rd trimester blood lead levels were associated with a 0.08 year decrease in Hannum age in GLM and GEE models (95%CI -0.15, -0.01). There were multiple significant results in sex-stratified models and significant lead by sex interactions, where males experienced accelerated biological age, compared to females who saw a decelerated biological age, with respect to IEAA, EEAA, Horvath, Hannum, and PedBE clocks. Further research is needed to understand sex-specific relationships between lead exposure and measures of biological aging in adolescence and the trajectory of biological aging into young adulthood.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

We aimed to test whether a DNA methylation risk score (MRS) for T2DM was associated with GDM across ancestry and GDM criteria.In two independent pregnancy cohorts, EPIPREG (n = 480) and EPIDG (n = 32), DNA methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes was measured at a gestational age of 28 ± 2. We constructed an MRS in EPIPREG and EPIDG based on CpG hits from a published epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of T2DM.With mixed models logistic regression of EPIPREG and EPIDG, MRS for T2DM was associated with GDM: odd ratio (OR)[95% CI]: 1.3 [1.1-1.8], P = 0.002 for the unadjusted model, and 1.4 [1.1-1.7], P = 0.00014 for a model adjusted by age, pre-pregnant BMI, family history of diabetes and smoking status. Also, we found 6 CpGs through a meta-analysis (cg14020176, cg22650271, cg14870271, cg27243685, cg06378491, cg25130381) associated with GDM, and some of their methylation quantitative loci (mQTLs) were related to T2DM and GDM.For the first time, we show that DNA methylation marks for T2DM are also associated with GDM, suggesting shared epigenetic mechanisms between GDM and T2DM.© 2024.

,Yes,38187766,"Within-subject changes in methylome profile identify individual signatures of early-life adversity, with a potential to predict neuropsychiatric outcome.",bioRxiv,"Adverse early-life experiences (ELA), including poverty, trauma and neglect, affect a majority of the world's children. Whereas the impact of ELA on cognitive and emotional health throughout the lifespan is well-established, it is not clear how distinct types of ELA influence child development, and there are no tools to predict for an individual child their vulnerability or resilience to the consequences of ELAs. Epigenetic markers including DNA-methylation profiles of peripheral cells may encode ELA and provide a predictive outcome marker. However, the rapid dynamic changes in DNA methylation in childhood and the inter-individual variance of the human genome pose barriers to identifying profiles predicting outcomes of ELA exposure. Here, we examined the relation of several dimensions of ELA to changes of DNA methylation, using a longitudinal within-subject design and a high threshold for methylation changes in the hope of mitigating the above challenges.We analyzed DNA methylation in buccal swab samples collected twice for each of 110 infants: neonatally and at 12 months. We identified CpGs differentially methylated across time, calculated methylation changes for each child, and determined whether several indicators of ELA associated with changes of DNA methylation for individual infants. We then correlated select dimensions of ELA with methylation changes as well as with measures of executive function at age 5 years. We examined for sex differences, and derived a sex-dependent 'impact score' based on sites that most contributed to the methylation changes.Setting a high threshold for methylation changes, we discovered that changes in methylation between two samples of an individual child reflected age-related trends towards augmented methylation, and also correlated with executive function years later. Among the tested factors and ELA dimensions, including income to needs ratios, maternal sensitivity, body mass index and sex, unpredictability of parental and household signals was the strongest predictor of executive function. In girls, an interaction was observed between a measure of high early-life unpredictability and methylation changes, in presaging executive function.These findings establish longitudinal, within-subject changes in methylation profiles as a signature of some types of ELA in an individual child. Notably, such changes are detectable beyond the age-associated DNA methylation dynamics. Future studies are required to determine if the methylation profile changes identified here provide a predictive marker of vulnerabilities to poorer cognitive and emotional outcomes.",1

Changes in placentation and exposures to in utero growth factors with successive pregnancies may impact later life disease risk via persistent DNA methylation alterations. We investigated birth order with Illumina DNA methylation array data in each of 16 birth cohorts (8164 newborns) with European, African, and Latino ancestries from the Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics Consortium. Meta-analyzed data demonstrated systematic DNA methylation variation in 341 CpGs (FDR adjusted P < 0.05) and 1107 regions. Forty CpGs were located within known quantitative trait loci for gene expression traits in blood, and trait enrichment analysis suggested a strong association with immune-related, transcriptional control, and blood pressure regulation phenotypes.

The placenta regulates fetal development and shows sex differences in DNA methylation. We therefore hypothesized that placental methylation QTL (mQTL) explain variation in genetic risk for childhood onset traits, and that effects differ by sex. We analyzed 411 term placentas from two studies and found 49,252 methylation (CpG) sites with mQTL and 2,489 CpG sites with sex-dependent mQTL. All mQTL were enriched in regions that typically affect gene expression in prenatal tissues. All mQTL were also enriched in GWAS results for growth- and immune-related traits, but male- and female-specific mQTL were more enriched than cross-sex mQTL. mQTL colocalized with trait loci at 777 CpG sites, with 216 (28%) specific to males or females.

However, underlying mechanism of epigenetic alteration and regulated pathways still remained unclear. The study on methylome effect of PM2.5exposure was quite limited in Chinese population, and cohort-based study was absent. The study included blood-derived DNA methylation for 3365 Chinese participants from the NSPT cohort. We estimated individual PM2.5exposure level of short-medium-, medium- and long-term, based on a validated prediction model. We preformed epigenome-wide association studies to estimate the links between PM2.5exposure and DNA methylation change, as well as stratification and sensitive analysis to examined the robustness of the association models. A systematic review was conducted to obtain the previously published CpGs and examined for replication. We also conducted comparison on the DNA methylation variation corresponding to different time windows. We further conducted gene function analysis and pathway enrichment analysis to reveal related biological response. We identified a total of 177 CpGs and 107 DMRs associated with short-medium-term PM2.5exposure, at a strict genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8). The effect sizes on most CpGs tended to cease with the exposure of extended time scale. Associated markers and aligned genes were related to aging, immunity, inflammation and carcinogenesis. Enriched pathways were mostly involved in cell cycle and cell division, signal transduction, inflammatory pathway.

We prioritized the significant genes with a machine learning-based method, netWAS, which borrows information from adipose tissue-specific interaction networks. We also used the brain-specific network in netWAS to investigate genes potentially involved in brain-adipose interaction.We identified 195 genes that were significantly associated with BMI through meta-analysis. The netWAS analysis narrowed down the list to 21 genes in adipose tissue. Among these 21 genes, six genes, including FUS, STX4, CCNT2, FUBP1, NDUFS3, and RAPSN, were not reported to be BMI-associated in PubMed or GWAS Catalog. We also identified 11 genes that were significantly associated with BMI in both adipose and whole brain tissues.This study integrated three types of omics data and identified a group of genes that have not previously been reported to be associated with BMI.

We conducted a genome-wide cytosine methylation analysis of 399 human kidney samples, along with single-nuclear open chromatin analysis on over 60,000 cells from 14 subjects, including controls, and diabetes and hypertension attributed chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We identified and validated differentially methylated positions associated with disease states, and discovered that nearly 30% of these alterations were influenced by underlying genetic variations, including variants known to be associated with kidney disease in genome-wide association studies. We also identified regions showing both methylation and open chromatin changes. These changes in methylation and open chromatin significantly associated gene expression changes, most notably those playing role in metabolism and expressed in proximal tubules. Our study further demonstrated that methylation risk scores (MRS) can improve disease state annotation and prediction of kidney disease development.

The remaining 732 referrals underwent targeted episignature analysis for assessment of sequence or copy number variants of uncertain significance, or for assessment of clinical diagnoses without confirmed molecular findings and 32.4% (237/732) were positive. Cases with detailed clinical information were highlighted to describe various utility scenarios for episignature testing.Clinical DNA methylation testing including episignatures, imprinting and promoter analysis provided by an integrated network of clinical laboratories enables test standardization and demonstrates significant diagnostic yield and clinical utility beyond DNA sequence analysis in rare diseases.Copyright © 2024.

Jasmine,No,38383592,"Blood and urine multi-omics analysis of the impact of e-vaping, smoking, and cessation: from exposome to molecular responses.",Sci Rep,"Cigarette smoking is a major preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. While quitting smoking is the best option, switching from cigarettes to non-combustible alternatives (NCAs) such as e-vapor products is a viable harm reduction approach for smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke. A key challenge for the clinical assessment of NCAs is that self-reported product use can be unreliable, compromising the proper evaluation of their risk reduction potential. In this cross-sectional study of 205 healthy volunteers, we combined comprehensive exposure characterization with in-depth multi-omics profiling to compare effects across four study groups: cigarette smokers (CS), e-vapor users (EV), former smokers (FS), and never smokers (NS). Multi-omics analyses included metabolomics, transcriptomics, DNA methylomics, proteomics, and lipidomics. Comparison of the molecular effects between CS and NS recapitulated several previous observations, such as increased inflammatory markers in CS. Generally, FS and EV demonstrated intermediate molecular effects between the NS and CS groups. Stratification of the FS and EV by combustion exposure markers suggested that this position on the spectrum between CS and NS was partially driven by non-compliance/dual use. Overall, this study highlights the importance of in-depth exposure characterization before biological effect characterization for any NCA assessment study.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.61E-16
x,No,38355791,Smoking changes adaptive immunity with persistent effects.,Nature,"Individuals differ widely in their immune responses, with age, sex and genetic factors having major roles in this inherent variability1-6. However, the variables that drive such differences in cytokine secretion-a crucial component of the host response to immune challenges-remain poorly defined. Here we investigated 136 variables and identified smoking, cytomegalovirus latent infection and body mass index as major contributors to variability in cytokine response, with effects of comparable magnitudes with age, sex and genetics. We find that smoking influences both innate and adaptive immune responses. Notably, its effect on innate responses is quickly lost after smoking cessation and is specifically associated with plasma levels of CEACAM6, whereas its effect on adaptive responses persists long after individuals quit smoking and is associated with epigenetic memory. This is supported by the association of the past smoking effect on cytokine responses with DNA methylation at specific signal trans-activators and regulators of metabolism. Our findings identify three novel variables associated with cytokine secretion variability and reveal roles for smoking in the short- and long-term regulation of immune responses. These results have potential clinical implications for the risk of developing infections, cancers or autoimmune diseases.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.40E-20
,No,38321112,Single-cell low-pass whole genome sequencing accurately detects circulating tumor cells for liquid biopsy-based multi-cancer diagnosis.,NPJ Precis Oncol,"Accurate detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in blood and non-blood body fluids enables generation of deterministic cancer diagnosis and represent a less invasive and safer liquid biopsy approach. Although genomic alternations have been widely used in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis, studies on cell-based genomic alternations profiling for CTC detection are rare due to major technical limitations in single-cell whole genome sequencing (WGS) including low throughput, low accuracy and high cost. We report a single-cell low-pass WGS-based protocol (scMet-Seq) for sensitive and accurate CTC detection by combining a metabolic function-associated marker Hexokinase 2 (HK2) and a Tn5 transposome-based WGS method with improved cell fixation strategy. To explore the clinical use, scMet-Seq has been investigated with blood and non-blood body fluids in diagnosing metastatic diseases, including ascites-based diagnosis of malignant ascites (MA) and blood-based diagnosis of metastatic small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). ScMet-Seq shows high diagnostic sensitivity (MA: 79% in >10 cancer types; metastatic SCLC: 90%) and ~100% of diagnostic specificity and positive predictive value, superior to clinical cytology that exhibits diagnostic sensitivity of 52% in MA diagnosis and could not generate blood-based diagnosis. ScMet-Seq represents a liquid biopsy approach for deterministic cancer diagnosis in different types of cancers and body fluids.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.13E-29
,No,38196638,A deep learning transformer model predicts high rates of undiagnosed rare disease in large electronic health systems.,medRxiv,"It is estimated that as many as 1 in 16 people worldwide suffer from rare diseases. Rare disease patients face difficulty finding diagnosis and treatment for their conditions, including long diagnostic odysseys, multiple incorrect diagnoses, and unavailable or prohibitively expensive treatments. As a result, it is likely that large electronic health record (EHR) systems include high numbers of participants suffering from undiagnosed rare disease. While this has been shown in detail for specific diseases, these studies are expensive and time consuming and have only been feasible to perform for a handful of the thousands of known rare diseases. The bulk of these undiagnosed cases are effectively hidden, with no straightforward way to differentiate them from healthy controls. The ability to access them at scale would enormously expand our capacity to study and develop drugs for rare diseases, adding to tools aimed at increasing availability of study cohorts for rare disease. In this study, we train a deep learning transformer algorithm, RarePT (Rare-Phenotype Prediction Transformer), to impute undiagnosed rare disease from EHR diagnosis codes in 436,407 participants in the UK Biobank and validated on an independent cohort from 3,333,560 individuals from the Mount Sinai Health System. We applied our model to 155 rare diagnosis codes with fewer than 250 cases each in the UK Biobank and predicted participants with elevated risk for each diagnosis, with the number of participants predicted to be at risk ranging from 85 to 22,000 for different diagnoses. These risk predictions are significantly associated with increased mortality for 65% of diagnoses, with disease burden expressed as disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for 73% of diagnoses, and with 72% of available disease-specific diagnostic tests. They are also highly enriched for known rare diagnoses in patients not included in the training set, with an odds ratio (OR) of 48.0 in cross-validation cohorts of the UK Biobank and an OR of 30.6 in the independent Mount Sinai Health System cohort. Most importantly, RarePT successfully screens for undiagnosed patients in 32 rare diseases with available diagnostic tests in the UK Biobank. Using the trained model to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed disease in the UK Biobank for these 32 rare phenotypes, we find that at least 50% of patients remain undiagnosed for 20 of 32 diseases. These estimates provide empirical evidence of a high prevalence of undiagnosed rare disease, as well as demonstrating the enormous potential benefit of using RarePT to screen for undiagnosed rare disease patients in large electronic health systems.",5.85E-33
,No,38327653,Oxford Nanopore Technology and its Application in Liquid Biopsies.,Curr Genomics,"Advanced medical technologies are transforming the future of healthcare, in particular, the screening and detection of molecular-genetic changes in patients suspected of having a neoplasm. They are based on the assumption that neoplasms release small amounts  of  various  neoplasm-specific molecules, such as tumor DNA, called circulating DNA (cirDNA), into the extracellular space and subsequently into the blood. The detection of tumor-specific molecules and specific molecular changes in body fluids in a noninvasive or minimally invasive approach is known as ""liquid biopsy."" The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of the application of ONT for analyzing circulating DNA in the field of liquid biopsies among cancer patients. Databases were searched using the keywords ""nanopore"" and ""liquid biopsy"" and by applying strict inclusion criteria. This technique can be used for the detection of neoplastic disease, including metastases, guiding precision therapy, and monitoring its effects. There are many challenges, however, for the successful implementation of this technology into the clinical practice. The first one is the low amount of tumor-specific molecules in the body fluids. Secondly, a tumor molecular signature should be discriminated from benign conditions like clonal hematopoiesis of unknown significance. Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) is a third-generation sequencing technology that seems particularly promising to complete these tasks. It offers rapid sequencing thanks to its ability to detect changes in the density of the electric current passing through nanopores. Even though ONT still needs validation technology, it is a promising approach for early diagnosis, therapy guidance, and monitoring of different neoplasms based on analyzing the cirDNA.© 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.",1.32E-42
x,No,38243142,Causality-enriched epigenetic age uncouples damage and adaptation.,Nat Aging,"Machine learning models based on DNA methylation data can predict biological age but often lack causal insights. By harnessing large-scale genetic data through epigenome-wide Mendelian randomization, we identified CpG sites potentially causal for aging-related traits. Neither the existing epigenetic clocks nor age-related differential DNA methylation are enriched in these sites. These CpGs include sites that contribute to aging and protect against it, yet their combined contribution negatively affects age-related traits. We established a new framework to introduce causal information into epigenetic clocks, resulting in DamAge and AdaptAge-clocks that track detrimental and adaptive methylation changes, respectively. DamAge correlates with adverse outcomes, including mortality, while AdaptAge is associated with beneficial adaptations. These causality-enriched clocks exhibit sensitivity to short-term interventions. Our findings provide a detailed landscape of CpG sites with putative causal links to lifespan and healthspan, facilitating the development of aging biomarkers, assessing interventions, and studying reversibility of age-associated changes.© 2024.
