38418845,"Epigenome-wide association study identifies neonatal DNA methylation associated with two-year attention problems in children born very preterm.","Transl Psychiatry","Prior research has identified epigenetic predictors of attention problems in school-aged children but has not yet investigated these in young children, or children at elevated risk of attention problems due to preterm birth. The current study evaluated epigenome-wide associations between neonatal DNA methylation and attention problems at age 2 years in children born very preterm. Participants included 441 children from the Neonatal Neurobehavior and Outcomes in Very Preterm Infants (NOVI) Study, a multi-site study of infants born < 30 weeks gestational age. DNA methylation was measured from buccal swabs collected at NICU discharge using the Illumina MethylationEPIC Bead Array. Attention problems were assessed at 2 years of adjusted age using the attention problems subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). After adjustment for multiple testing, DNA methylation at 33 CpG sites was associated with child attention problems. Differentially methylated CpG sites were located in genes previously linked to physical and mental health, including several genes associated with ADHD in prior epigenome-wide and genome-wide association studies. Several CpG sites were located in genes previously linked to exposure to prenatal risk factors in the NOVI sample. Neonatal epigenetics measured at NICU discharge could be useful in identifying preterm children at risk for long-term attention problems and related psychiatric disorders, who could benefit from early prevention and intervention efforts.© 2024.

38414347,"Epigenome-wide analysis of frailty: Results from two European twin cohorts.","Aging Cell","Epigenetics plays an important role in the aging process, but it is unclear whether epigenetic factors also influence frailty, an age-related state of physiological decline. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies in four samples drawn from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) and the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins (LSADT) to explore the association between DNA methylation and frailty. Frailty was defined using the frailty index (FI), and DNA methylation levels were measured in whole blood using Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450K and MethylationEPIC arrays. In the meta-analysis consisting of a total of 829 participants, we identified 589 CpG sites that were statistically significantly associated with either the continuous or categorical FI (false discovery rate <0.05). Many of these CpGs have previously been associated with age and age-related diseases. The identified sites were also largely directionally consistent in a longitudinal analysis using mixed-effects models in SATSA, where the participants were followed up to a maximum of 20 years. Moreover, we identified three differentially methylated regions within the MGRN1, MIR596, and TAPBP genes that have been linked to neuronal aging, tumor growth, and immune functions. Furthermore, our meta-analysis results replicated 34 of the 77 previously reported frailty-associated CpGs at p < 0.05. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate robust associations between frailty and DNA methylation levels in 589 novel CpGs, previously unidentified for frailty, and strengthen the role of neuronal/brain pathways in frailty.© 2024 The Authors.

38413986,"Improvements in lung function following vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers are associated with buccal DNA methylation at 5 years of age.","Clin Epigenetics","We previously reported in the ""Vitamin C to Decrease the Effects of Smoking in Pregnancy on Infant Lung Function"" randomized clinical trial (RCT) that vitamin C (500 mg/day) supplementation to pregnant smokers is associated with improved respiratory outcomes that persist through 5 years of age. The objective of this study was to assess whether buccal cell DNA methylation (DNAm), as a surrogate for airway epithelium, is associated with vitamin C supplementation, improved lung function, and decreased occurrence of wheeze.We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) using Infinium MethylationEPIC arrays and buccal DNAm from 158 subjects (80 placebo; 78 vitamin C) with pulmonary function testing (PFT) performed at the 5-year visit. EWAS were performed on (1) vitamin C treatment, (2) forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of expired volume (FEF25-75), and (3) offspring wheeze. Models were adjusted for sex, race, study site, gestational age at randomization (≤ OR > 18 weeks), proportion of epithelial cells, and latent covariates in addition to child length at PFT in EWAS for FEF25-75. We considered FDR p < 0.05 as genome-wide significant and nominal p < 0.001 as candidates for downstream analyses. Buccal DNAm measured in a subset of subjects at birth and near 1 year of age was used to determine whether DNAm signatures originated in utero, or emerged with age.Vitamin C treatment was associated with 457 FDR significant (q < 0.05) differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs; 236 hypermethylated; 221 hypomethylated) and 53 differentially methylated regions (DMRs; 26 hyper; 27 hypo) at 5 years of age. FEF25-75was associated with one FDR significant DMC (cg05814800), 1,468 candidate DMCs (p < 0.001), and 44 DMRs. Current wheeze was associated with 0 FDR-DMCs, 782 candidate DMCs, and 19 DMRs (p < 0.001). In 365/457 vitamin C FDR significant DMCs at 5 years of age, there was no significant interaction between time and treatment.Vitamin C supplementation to pregnant smokers is associated with buccal DNA methylation in offspring at 5 years of age, and most methylation signatures appear to be persistent from the prenatal period. Buccal methylation at 5 years was also associated with current lung function and occurrence of wheeze, and these functionally associated loci are enriched for vitamin C associated loci.

38367619,"Epigenome-wide association study of total nicotine equivalents in multiethnic current smokers from three prospective cohorts.","Am J Hum Genet","The impact of tobacco exposure on health varies by race and ethnicity and is closely tied to internal nicotine dose, a marker of carcinogen uptake. DNA methylation is strongly responsive to smoking status and may mediate health effects, but study of associations with internal dose is limited. We performed a blood leukocyte epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of urinary total nicotine equivalents (TNEs; a measure of nicotine uptake) and DNA methylation measured using the MethylationEPIC v1.0 BeadChip (EPIC) in six racial and ethnic groups across three cohort studies. In the Multiethnic Cohort Study (discovery, n = 1994), TNEs were associated with differential methylation at 408 CpG sites across >250 genomic regions (p < 9 × 10-8). The top significant sites were annotated to AHRR, F2RL3, RARA, GPR15, PRSS23, and 2q37.1, all of which had decreasing methylation with increasing TNEs. We identified 45 novel CpG sites, of which 42 were unique to the EPIC array and eight annotated to genes not previously linked with smoking-related DNA methylation. The most significant signal in a novel gene was cg03748458 in MIR383;SGCZ. Fifty-one of the 408 discovery sites were validated in the Singapore Chinese Health Study (n = 340) and the Southern Community Cohort Study (n = 394) (Bonferroni corrected p < 1.23 × 10-4). Significant heterogeneity by race and ethnicity was detected for CpG sites in MYO1G and CYTH1. Furthermore, TNEs significantly mediated the association between cigarettes per day and DNA methylation at 15 sites (average 22.5%-44.3% proportion mediated). Our multiethnic study highlights the transethnic and ethnic-specific methylation associations with internal nicotine dose, a strong predictor of smoking-related morbidities.Copyright © 2024 American Society of Human Genetics.

38365790,"Epigenome-wide association study of dietary fatty acid intake.","Clin Epigenetics","Dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may have a protective effect on the development of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, depression and cancer, while a high intake of n-6 PUFA was often reported to be associated with inflammation-related traits. The effect of PUFAs on health outcomes might be mediated by DNA methylation (DNAm). The aim of our study is to identify the impact of PUFA intake on DNAm in the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) FF4 cohort and the Leiden Longevity Study (LLS).DNA methylation levels were measured in whole blood from the population-based KORA FF4 study (N = 1354) and LLS (N = 448), using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip and Illumina HumanMethylation450 array, respectively. We assessed associations between DNAm and intake of eight and four PUFAs in KORA and LLS, respectively. Where possible, results were meta-analyzed. Below the Bonferroni correction threshold (p < 7.17 × 10-8), we identified two differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with PUFA intake in the KORA study. The DMP cg19937480, annotated to gene PRDX1, was positively associated with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in model 1 (beta: 2.00 × 10-5, 95%CI: 1.28 × 10-5-2.73 × 10-5, P value: 6.98 × 10-8), while cg05041783, annotated to gene MARK2, was positively associated with docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) in our fully adjusted model (beta: 9.80 × 10-5, 95%CI: 6.25 × 10-5-1.33 × 10-4, P value: 6.75 × 10-8). In the meta-analysis, we identified the CpG site (cg15951061), annotated to gene CDCA7L below Bonferroni correction (1.23 × 10-7) associated with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) intake in model 1 (beta: 2.00 × 10-5, 95% CI: 1.27 × 10-5-2.73 × 10-5, P value = 5.99 × 10-8) and we confirmed the association of cg19937480 with DHA in both models 1 and 2 (beta: 2.07 × 10-5, 95% CI: 1.31 × 10-5-2.83 × 10-5, P value = 1.00 × 10-7and beta: 2.19 × 10-5, 95% CI: 1.41 × 10-5-2.97 × 10-5, P value = 5.91 × 10-8respectively).Our study identified three CpG sites associated with PUFA intake. The mechanisms of these sites remain largely unexplored, highlighting the novelty of our findings.

38358663,"Contributions of prenatal risk factors and neonatal epigenetics to cognitive outcome in children born very preterm.","Dev Psychol","Children born less than 30 weeks gestational age (GA) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental delay compared to term peers. Prenatal risk factors and neonatal epigenetics could help identify preterm children at highest risk for poor cognitive outcomes. We aimed to understand the associations among cumulative prenatal risk, neonatal DNA methylation, and child cognitive ability at age 3 years, including whether DNA methylation mediates the association between prenatal risk and cognitive ability. We studied 379 neonates (54% male) born less than 30 weeks GA who had DNA methylation measured at neonatal intensive care unit discharge along with 3-year follow-up data. Cumulative prenatal risk was calculated from 24 risk factors obtained from maternal report and medical record and epigenome-wide neonatal DNA methylation was assayed from buccal swabs. At 3-year follow-up, child cognitive ability was assessed using theBayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development(third edition). Cumulative prenatal risk and DNA methylation at two cytosine-phosphate-guanines (CpGs) were uniquely associated with child cognitive ability. Using high-dimensional mediation analysis, we also identified differential methylation of 309 CpGs that mediated the association between cumulative prenatal risk and child cognitive ability. Many of the associated CpGs were located in genes (TNS3, TRAPPC4, MAD1L1, APBB2, DIP2C, TRAPPC9, DRD2) that have previously been associated with prenatal exposures and/or neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Our findings suggest a role for both prenatal risk factors and DNA methylation in explaining outcomes for children born preterm and suggest we should further study DNA methylation as a potential mechanism underlying the association between prenatal risk and child neurodevelopment.

38324238,"Perceived Experiences of racism in Relation to Genome-Wide DNA Methylation and Epigenetic Aging in the Black Women's Health Study.","J Racial Ethn Health Disparities","African American women have a disproportionate burden of disease compared to US non-Hispanic white women. Exposure to psychosocial stressors may contribute to these health disparities. Racial discrimination, a major stressor for African American women, could affect health through epigenetic mechanisms.We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to examine the association of interpersonal racism (in daily life and in institutional settings) with DNA methylation in blood in 384 participants of the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS). We also evaluated whether a greater number of perceived experiences of racism was associated with epigenetic aging as measured using different methylation clocks. Models were adjusted for chronological age, body mass index, years of education, neighborhood SES, geographic region of residence, alcohol drinking, smoking, and technical covariates.Higher scores of racism in daily life were associated with higher methylation levels at the cg04494873 site in chromosome 5 (β = 0.64%; 95% CI = 0.41%, 0.87%; P = 6.35E-08). We also replicated one CpG site, cg03317714, which was inversely associated with racial discrimination in a previous EWAS among African American women. In the BWHS, higher scores of racism in daily life were associated with lower methylation levels at that CpG site (β = -0.94%; 95% CI = -1.37%, -0.51%; P = 2.2E-05). Higher racism scores were associated with accelerated epigenetic aging in more than one methylation clock.Exposure to discriminatory events may affect the epigenome and accelerate biological aging, which may explain in part the earlier onset of disease in African American women.© 2024.

38309009,"Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of cannabis use disorder in a veteran cohort enriched for posttraumatic stress disorder.","Psychiatry Res","Cannabis use has been increasing over the past decade, not only in the general US population, but particularly among military veterans. With this rise in use has come a concomitant increase in cannabis use disorder (CUD) among veterans. Here, we performed an epigenome-wide association study for lifetime CUD in an Iraq/Afghanistan era veteran cohort enriched for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) comprising 2,310 total subjects (1,109 non-Hispanic black and 1,201 non-Hispanic white). We also investigated CUD interactions with current PTSD status and examined potential indirect effects of DNA methylation (DNAm) on the relationship between CUD and psychiatric diagnoses. Four CpGs were associated with lifetime CUD, even after controlling for the effects of current smoking (AHRR cg05575921, LINC00299 cg23079012, VWA7 cg22112841, and FAM70A cg08760398). Importantly, cg05575921, a CpG strongly linked to smoking, remained associated with lifetime CUD even when restricting the analysis to veterans who reported never smoking cigarettes. Moreover, CUD interacted with current PTSD to affect cg05575921 and cg23079012 such that those with both CUD and PTSD displayed significantly lower DNAm compared to the other groups. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that AHRR cg05575921 helps explain the association between CUD and any psychiatric diagnoses, specifically mood disorders.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

38296944,"Blood epigenome-wide association studies of suicide attempt in adults with bipolar disorder.","Transl Psychiatry","Suicide attempt (SA) risk is elevated in individuals with bipolar disorder (BD), and DNA methylation patterns may serve as possible biomarkers of SA. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of blood DNA methylation associated with BD and SA. DNA methylation was measured at >700,000 positions in a discovery cohort of n = 84 adults with BD with a history of SA (BD/SA), n = 79 adults with BD without history of SA (BD/non-SA), and n = 76 non-psychiatric controls (CON). EWAS revealed six differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and seven differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between BD/SA and BD/non-SA, with multiple immune-related genes implicated. There were no epigenome-wide significant differences when BD/SA and BD/non-SA were each compared to CON, and patterns suggested that epigenetics differentiating BD/SA from BD/non-SA do not differentiate BD/non-SA from CON. Weighted gene co-methylation network analysis and trait enrichment analysis of the BD/SA vs. BD/non-SA contrast further corroborated immune system involvement, while gene ontology analysis implicated calcium signalling. In an independent replication cohort of n = 48 BD/SA and n = 47 BD/non-SA, fold changes at the discovery cohort's significant sites showed moderate correlation across cohorts and agreement on direction. In both cohorts, classification accuracy for SA history among individuals with BD was highest when methylation at the significant CpG sites as well as information from clinical interviews were combined, with an AUC of 88.8% (CI = 83.8-93.8%) and 82.1% (CI = 73.6-90.5%) for the combined epigenetic-clinical classifier in the discovery and replication cohorts, respectively. Our results provide novel insight to the role of immune system functioning in SA and BD and also suggest that integrating information from multiple levels of analysis holds promise to improve risk assessment for SA in adults with BD.© 2024.

In women with European (n = 303) and South Asian (n = 164) ancestry, we performed an epigenome-wide association study of BMI in gestational week 28 and GWG between gestational weeks 15 and 28 using a meta-analysis approach. Replication was performed in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study, the Study of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (MoBa-START) (n = 877, mainly European/Norwegian).We identified one CpG site significantly associated with GWG (p 5.8 × 10-8) and five CpG sites associated with BMI at gestational week 28 (p from 4.0 × 10-8 to 2.1 × 10-10). Of these, we were able to replicate three in MoBa-START; cg02786370, cg19758958 and cg10472537. Two sites are located in genes previously associated with blood pressure and BMI. DNA methylation at the three replicated CpG sites were associated with levels of blood pressure, lipids and glucose in EPIPREG (p from 1.2 × 10-8to 0.04).We identified five CpG sites associated with BMI at gestational week 28, and one with GWG. Three of the sites were replicated in an independent cohort. Several genetic variants were associated with DNA methylation at cg02786379 and cg16733643 suggesting a genetic component influencing differential methylation.

Differential DNA methylation may represent an underlying mechanism.We analysed associations of infant animal and plant protein intakes with DNA methylation in early (2-6 years,N = 579) and late (7̄-12 years,N = 604) childhood in two studies. Study-specific robust linear regression models adjusted for relevant confounders were run, and then meta-analysed using a fixed-effects model. We also performed sex-stratified meta-analyses. Follow-up analyses included pathway analysis and eQTM look-up.Infant animal protein intake was not associated with DNA methylation in early childhood, but was associated with late-childhood DNA methylation at cg21300373 (P = 4.27 × 10¯8,MARCHF1) and cg10633363 (P = 1.09 × 10¯7,HOXB9) after FDR correction. Infant plant protein intake was associated with early-childhood DNA methylation at cg25973293 (P = 2.26 × 10-7,C1orf159) and cg15407373 (P = 2.13 × 10-7,MBP) after FDR correction. There was no overlap between the findings from the animal and plant protein analyses. We did not find enriched functional pathways at either time point using CpGs associated with animal and plant protein. These CpGs were not previously associated with childhood gene expression. Sex-stratified meta-analyses showed sex-specific DNA methylation associations for both animal and plant protein intake.Infant animal protein intake was associated with DNA methylation at two CpGs in late childhood. Infant plant protein intake was associated with DNA methylation in early childhood at two CpGs. A potential mediating role of DNA methylation at these CpGs between infant protein intake and health outcomes requires further investigation.",1
38331797,"Self-control is associated with health-relevant disparities in buccal DNA-methylation measures of biological aging in older adults.","Clin Epigenetics","Self-control is a personality dimension that is associated with better physical health and a longer lifespan. Here, we examined (1) whether self-control is associated with buccal and saliva DNA-methylation (DNAm) measures of biological aging quantified in children, adolescents, and adults, and (2) whether biological aging measured in buccal DNAm is associated with self-reported health. Following preregistered analyses, we computed two DNAm measures of advanced biological age (principal-component PhenoAge and GrimAge Acceleration) and a DNAm measure of pace of aging (DunedinPACE) in buccal samples from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (SOEP-G[ene], n = 1058, age range 0-72, Mage = 42.65) and saliva samples from the Texas Twin Project (TTP, n = 1327, age range 8-20, Mage = 13.50). We found that lower self-control was associated with advanced biological age in older adults (PhenoAge Acceleration β = - .34, [- .51, - .17], p < .001; GrimAge Acceleration β = - .34, [- .49, - .19], p < .001), but not young adults, adolescents or children. These associations remained statistically robust even after correcting for possible confounders such as socioeconomic contexts, BMI, or genetic correlates of low self-control. Moreover, a faster pace of aging and advanced biological age measured in buccal DNAm were associated with self-reported disease (PhenoAge Acceleration: β = .13 [.06, .19], p < .001; GrimAge Acceleration: β = .19 [.12, .26], p < .001; DunedinPACE: β = .09 [.02, .17], p = .01). However, effect sizes were weaker than observations in blood, suggesting that customization of DNAm aging measures to buccal and saliva tissues may be necessary. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that self-control is associated with health via pathways that accelerate biological aging in older adults.© 2024. The Author(s).",1
38273034,"Metabolic syndrome and epigenetic aging: a twin study.","Int J Obes (Lond)","Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with premature aging, but whether this association is driven by genetic or lifestyle factors remains unclear.Two independent discovery cohorts, consisting of twins and unrelated individuals, were examined (N = 268, aged 23-69 years). The findings were replicated in two cohorts from the same base population. One consisted of unrelated individuals (N = 1 564), and the other of twins (N = 293). Participants' epigenetic age, estimated using blood DNA methylation data, was determined using the epigenetic clocks GrimAge and DunedinPACE. The individual-level linear regression models for investigating the associations of MetS and its components with epigenetic aging were followed by within-twin-pair analyses using fixed-effects regression models to account for genetic factors.In individual-level analyses, GrimAge age acceleration was higher among participants with MetS (N = 56) compared to participants without MetS (N = 212) (mean 2.078 [95% CI = 0.996,3.160] years vs. -0.549 [-1.053,-0.045] years, between-group p = 3.5E-5). Likewise, the DunedinPACE estimate was higher among the participants with MetS compared to the participants without MetS (1.032 [1.002,1.063] years/calendar year vs. 0.911 [0.896,0.927] years/calendar year, p = 4.8E-11). An adverse profile in terms of specific MetS components was associated with accelerated aging. However, adjustments for lifestyle attenuated these associations; nevertheless, for DunedinPACE, they remained statistically significant. The within-twin-pair analyses suggested that genetics explains these associations fully for GrimAge and partly for DunedinPACE. The replication analyses provided additional evidence that the association between MetS components and accelerated aging is independent of the lifestyle factors considered in this study, however, suggesting that genetics is a significant confounder in this association.The results of this study suggests that MetS is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging, independent of physical activity, smoking or alcohol consumption, and that the association may be explained by genetics.© 2024.

38246968,"Association of biological aging with frailty and post-transplant outcomes among adults with cirrhosis.","Geroscience","Frailty is classically associated with advanced age but is also an important predictor of clinical outcomes in comparatively young adults with cirrhosis. We examined the association of biological aging with frailty and post-transplant outcomes in a pilot of adults with cirrhosis undergoing liver transplantation (LT). Frailty was measured via the Liver Frailty Index (LFI). The primary epigenetic clock DNA methylation (DNAm) PhenoAge was calculated from banked peripheral blood mononuclear cells; we secondarily explored two first-generation clocks (Hannum; Horvath) and two additional second-generation clocks (GrimAge; GrimAge2). Twelve adults were included: seven frail (LFI ≥ 4.4, mean age 55 years) and five robust (LFI < 3.2, mean age 55 years). Mean PhenoAge age acceleration (AgeAccel) was + 2.5 years (P = 0.23) for frail versus robust subjects. Mean PhenoAge AgeAccel was + 2.7 years (P = 0.19) for subjects who were readmitted or died within 30 days of discharge post-LT versus those without this outcome. When compared with first-generation clocks, the second-generation clocks demonstrated greater average AgeAccel for subjects with frailty or poor post-LT outcomes. Measuring biological age using DNAm-derived epigenetic clocks is feasible in adults undergoing LT. While frail and robust subjects had the same average chronological age, average biological age as measured by second-generation epigenetic clocks tended to be accelerated among those who were frail or experienced a poor post-LT outcome. These results suggest that frailty in these relatively young subjects with cirrhosis may involve similar aging mechanisms as frailty classically observed in chronologically older adults and warrant validation in a larger cohort.© 2024.

38176546,"Prenatal and childhood lead exposure is prospectively associated with biological markers of aging in adolescence.","Sci Total Environ","Few studies have related early life lead exposure to adolescent biological aging, a period characterized by marked increases in maturational tempo. We examined associations between prenatal and childhood lead exposure and adolescent biological age (mean 14.5 years) utilizing multiple epigenetic clocks including: intrinsic (IEAA), extrinsic (EEAA), Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge, Skin-Blood, Wu, PedBE, as well as DNA methylation derived telomere length (DNAmTL). Epigenetic clocks and DNAmTL were calculated via adolescent blood DNA methylation measured by Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips. We constructed general linear models (GLMs) with individual lead measures predicting biological age. We additionally examined sex-stratified models and lead by sex interactions, adjusting for adolescent age and lead levels, maternal smoking and education, and proportion of cell types. We also estimated effects of lead exposure on biological age using generalized estimating equations (GEE). First trimester blood lead was positively associated with a 0.14 increase in EEAA age in the GLMs though not the GEE models (95%CI 0.03, 0.25). First and 2nd trimester blood lead levels were associated with a 0.02 year increase in PedBE age in GLM and GEE models (1st trimester, 95%CI 0.004, 0.03; 2nd trimester, 95%CI 0.01, 0.03). Third trimester and 24 month blood lead levels were associated with a -0.06 and -0.05 decrease in Skin-Blood age, respectively, in GLM models. Additionally, 3rd trimester blood lead levels were associated with a 0.08 year decrease in Hannum age in GLM and GEE models (95%CI -0.15, -0.01). There were multiple significant results in sex-stratified models and significant lead by sex interactions, where males experienced accelerated biological age, compared to females who saw a decelerated biological age, with respect to IEAA, EEAA, Horvath, Hannum, and PedBE clocks. Further research is needed to understand sex-specific relationships between lead exposure and measures of biological aging in adolescence and the trajectory of biological aging into young adulthood.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

The intergenerational transmission of ACE-associated DNAm was also explored used paired maternal (N = 120) and neonatal cord blood (N = 69) samples. Replication in buccal samples was explored in the Children's Health Study (CHS) among adult parental (N = 31) and pediatric (N = 114) samples. We used a four-level categorical indicator variable for ACEs exposure: none (0 ACEs), low (1-3 ACEs), moderate (4-6 ACEs), and high (>6 ACEs). Effects of ACEs on maternal DNAm (N = 240) were estimated using linear models. To evaluate evidence for intergenerational transmission, mediation analysis (N = 60 mother-child pairs) was used. Analysis of maternal samples displayed some shared but mostly distinct effects of ACEs on DNAm across low, moderate, and high ACEs categories. CLCN7 and PTPRN2 was associated with maternal DNAm in the low ACE group and this association replicated in the CHS. CLCN7 was also nominally significant in the gene expression correlation analysis among maternal profiles (N = 35), along with 11 other genes. ACE-associated methylation was observed in maternal and neonatal profiles in the COMT promoter region, with some evidence of mediation by maternal COMT methylation. Specific genomic loci exhibited mutually exclusive maternal ACE effects on DNAm in either maternal or neonatal population. There is some evidence for an intergenerational effect of ACEs, supported by shared DNAm signatures in the COMT gene across maternal-neonatal paired samples.© 2024. The Author(s).",1
38316849,"Epigenetic age acceleration is associated with speed of pubertal growth but not age of pubertal onset.","Sci Rep","Using data from a longitudinal cohort of children, we examined whether epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) was associated with pubertal growth and whether these associations were mediated by adiposity. We examined associations between EAA at approximately 10 years of age with pubertal growth metrics, including age at peak height velocity (PHV), PHV, and sex steroid levels and whether these associations were mediated by measures of adiposity including body mass index (BMI) and MRI-assessed visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Children (n = 135) with accelerated EAA had higher PHV (β 0.018, p = 0.0008) although the effect size was small. The association between EAA and age at PHV was not significant (β  - 0.0022, p = 0.067). Although EAA was associated with higher BMI (β 0.16, p = 0.0041), VAT (β 0.50, p = 0.037), and SAT (β 3.47, p = 0.0076), BMI and VAT did not mediate associations between EAA and PHV, while SAT explained 8.4% of the association. Boys with higher EAA had lower total testosterone (β  - 12.03, p = 0.0014), but associations between EAA and other sex steroids were not significant, and EAA was not associated with sex steroid levels in girls. We conclude that EAA did not have strong associations with either age at onset of puberty or pubertal growth speed, although associations with growth speed were statistically significant. Studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm this pattern of associations.© 2024. The Author(s).",1

We also evaluated the interaction of current smoking with sex or diet (fibre, folate, and vitamin C).Using false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05), 65,857 CpGs were differentially methylated in relation to current smoking, 4025 with recent quitting, 594 with in utero exposure, and 6 with ETS. Most current smoking CpGs attenuated within a year of quitting. CpGs related to in utero exposure in adults were enriched for those previously observed in newborns. Differential methylation by current smoking at 4-71 CpGs may be modified by sex or dietary intake. Nearly half (35-50%) of differentially methylated CpGs on the 450 K array were associated with blood gene expression. Current smoking and in utero smoking CpGs implicated 3049 and 1067 druggable targets, including chemotherapy drugs.Many smoking-related methylation sites were identified with Illumina's EPIC array. Most signals revert to levels observed in never smokers within a year of cessation. Many in utero smoking CpGs persist into adulthood.

38172913,NA,NA,"Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) signaling is involved in neurodevelopment, mood regulation, energy metabolism, and other physiological processes. DNA methylation plays a significant role in modulating the expression of genes responsible for maintaining 5-HT balance, such as 5-HT transporter (SLC6A4), monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), and 5-HT receptor type 2A (HTR2A). Maternal metabolic health can influence long-term outcomes in offspring, with DNA methylation mediating these effects. We investigated associations between maternal metabolic parameters-pre-pregnancy body mass index (pBMI), gestational weight gain (GWG), and glucose tolerance status (GTS), i.e., gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) versus normal glucose tolerance (NGT)-and cord blood methylation of SLC6A4, MAOA, and HTR2A in participants from our PlaNS birth cohort. CpG sites (15, 9, and 2 in each gene, respectively) were selected based on literature and in silico data. Methylation levels were quantified by bisulfite pyrosequencing. We also examined the stability of methylation patterns in these genes in circulating blood cells from birth to adolescence using longitudinal DNA methylation data from the ARIES database.None of the 203 PlaNS mothers included in this study had preexisting diabetes, 99 were diagnosed with GDM, and 104 had NGT; all neonates were born at full term by planned Cesarean section. Methylation at most CpG sites differed between male and female newborns. SLC6A4 methylation correlated inversely with maternal pBMI and GWG, while methylation at HTR2A site -1665 correlated positively with GWG. None of the maternal metabolic parameters statistically associated with MAOA methylation. DNA methylation data in cord blood and peripheral blood at ages 7 and 15 years were available for 808 participants from the ARIES database; 4 CpG sites (2 in SLC6A4 and 2 in HTR2A) overlapped between the PlaNS and ARIES cohorts. A positive correlation between methylation levels in cord blood and peripheral blood at 7 and 15 years of age was observed for both SLC6A4 and HTR2A CpG sites.Methylation of 5-HT regulating genes in cord blood cells is influenced by neonatal sex, with maternal metabolism playing an additional role. Inter-individual variations present in circulating blood cells at birth are still pronounced in childhood and adolescence.© 2023. The Author(s).",1

38378488,"Prenatal phthalate exposure and neurodevelopmental differences in twins at 2 years of age.","BMC Public Health","Previous studies of singletons evaluating prenatal phthalate exposure and early neurodevelopment reported mixed results and the associations could be biased by parental, obstetrical, and genetic factors.A co-twin control design was employed to test whether prenatal phthalate exposure was associated with children's neurocognitive development. We collected information from 97 mother-twin pairs enrolled in the Wuhan Twin Birth Cohort between March 2016 and October 2018. Fourteen phthalate metabolites were measured in maternal urine collected at each trimester. Neurodevelopmental differences in twins at the age of two were examined as the outcome of interest. Multiple informant model was used to examine the covariate-adjusted associations of prenatal phthalate exposure with mental development index (MDI) and psychomotor development index (PDI) scores assessed at 2 years of age based on Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Second Edition). This model also helps to identify the exposure window of susceptibility.Maternal urinary levels of mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP) (β = 1.91, 95% CI: 0.43, 3.39), mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) (β = 1.56, 95% CI: 0.33, 2.79), and the sum of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (∑DEHP) (β = 1.85, 95% CI: 0.39, 3.31) during the first trimester showed the strongest and significant positive associations with intra-twin MDI difference. When stratified with twin chorionicity, the positive associations of monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), individual DEHP metabolites, and ∑DEHP exposure during pregnancy with intra-twin neurodevelopmental differences were more significant in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twins than those in dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twins.Neurodevelopmental differences in MCDA twins were strongly associated with prenatal phthalate exposure.

We aim to investigate the joint and individual effects of prenatal exposure to urine metals including lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), and selenium (Se) on child Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores.We used data from 2 cohorts enriched for likelihood of autism spectrum disorder (ASD): Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and the Markers of Autism Risk in Babies-Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) studies. Metal concentrations were measured in urine collected during pregnancy. We used Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression and linear regression models to investigate both joint and independent associations of metals with SRS Z-scores in each cohort. We adjusted for maternal age at delivery, interpregnancy interval, maternal education, child race/ethnicity, child sex, and/or study site.The final analytic sample consisted of 251 mother-child pairs. When Pb, Hg, Se, and Mn were at their 75th percentiles, there was a 0.03 increase (95% credible interval [CI]: -0.11, 0.17) in EARLI and 0.07 decrease (95% CI: -0.29, 0.15) in MARBLES in childhood SRS Z-scores, compared to when all 4 metals were at their 50th percentiles. In both cohorts, increasing concentrations of Pb were associated with increasing values of SRS Z-scores, fixing the other metals to their 50th percentiles. However, all the 95% credible intervals contained the null.There were no clear monotonic associations between the overall prenatal metal mixture in pregnancy and childhood SRS Z-scores at 36 months. There were also no clear associations between individual metals within this mixture and childhood SRS Z-scores at 36 months. The overall effects of the metal mixture and the individual effects of each metal within this mixture on offspring SRS Z-scores might be heterogeneous across child sex and cohort.

38184702,"Posttraumatic stress disorder, trauma, and accelerated biological aging among post-9/11 veterans.","Transl Psychiatry","People who experience trauma and develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are at increased risk for poor health. One mechanism that could explain this risk is accelerated biological aging, which is associated with the accumulation of chronic diseases, disability, and premature mortality. Using data from 2309 post-9/11 United States military veterans who participated in the VISN 6 MIRECC's Post-Deployment Mental Health Study, we tested whether PTSD and trauma exposure were associated with accelerated rate of biological aging, assessed using a validated DNA methylation (DNAm) measure of epigenetic aging-DunedinPACE. Veterans with current PTSD were aging faster than those who did not have current PTSD, β = 0.18, 95% CI [0.11, 0.27], p < .001. This effect represented an additional 0.4 months of biological aging each year. Veterans were also aging faster if they reported more PTSD symptoms, β = 0.13, 95% CI [0.09, 0.16], p < 0.001, or higher levels of trauma exposure, β = 0.09, 95% CI [0.05, 0.13], p < 0.001. Notably, veterans with past PTSD were aging more slowly than those with current PTSD, β = -0.21, 95% CI [-0.35, -0.07], p = .003. All reported results accounted for age, gender, self-reported race/ethnicity, and education, and remained when controlling for smoking. Our findings suggest that an accelerated rate of biological aging could help explain how PTSD contributes to poor health and highlights the potential benefits of providing efficacious treatment to populations at increased risk of trauma and PTSD.© 2023.

The discovery of new omics biomarkers could help to improve risk stratification algorithms and expand our understanding of molecular pathways contributing to the disease. Here, ASSIGN-a cardiovascular risk prediction tool recommended for use in Scotland-was examined in tandem with epigenetic and proteomic features in risk prediction models in ≥12 657 participants from the Generation Scotland cohort.Previously generated DNA methylation-derived epigenetic scores (EpiScores) for 109 protein levels were considered, in addition to both measured levels and an EpiScore for cTnI (cardiac troponin I). The associations between individual protein EpiScores and the CVD risk were examined using Cox regression (ncases≥1274; ncontrols≥11 383) and visualized in a tailored R application. Splitting the cohort into independent training (n=6880) and test (n=3659) subsets, a composite CVD EpiScore was then developed.Sixty-five protein EpiScores were associated with incident CVD independently of ASSIGN and the measured concentration of cTnI (P<0.05), over a follow-up of up to 16 years of electronic health record linkage. The most significant EpiScores were for proteins involved in metabolic, immune response, and tissue development/regeneration pathways. A composite CVD EpiScore (based on 45 protein EpiScores) was a significant predictor of CVD risk independent of ASSIGN and the concentration of cTnI (hazard ratio, 1.32;P=3.7×10-3; 0.3% increase in C-statistic).EpiScores for circulating protein levels are associated with CVD risk independent of traditional risk factors and may increase our understanding of the etiology of the disease.",1

We estimated 6 biomarkers of epigenetic aging-epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), extrinsic EAA, intrinsic EAA, GrimAge, PhenoAge, and DNA methylation-estimated telomere length-and evaluated associations of epigenetic aging measures with BMD and physical function. We also performed epigenome-wide association studies to examine associations of DNA methylation signatures with BMD and physical function.This study included 118 WWH (mean age, 49.7 years; 69% Black) and 72 without HIV (mean age, 48.9 years; 69% Black). WWH had higher EAA (mean ± SD, 1.44 ± 5.36 vs -1.88 ± 5.07; P < .001) and lower DNA methylation-estimated telomere length (7.13 ± 0.31 vs 7.34 ± 0.23, P < .001) than women without HIV. There were no significant associations between accelerated epigenetic aging and BMD.

38168247,"Stochastic Epigenetic Mutations: Reliable Detection and Associations with Cardiovascular Aging.","bioRxiv","Stochastic Epigenetic Mutations (SEMs) have been proposed as novel aging biomarkers that have the potential to capture heterogeneity in age-related DNA methylation (DNAme) changes. SEMs are defined as outlier methylation patterns at cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites, categorized as hypermethylated (hyperSEM) or hypomethylated (hypoSEM) relative to a reference. While individual SEMs are rarely consistent across subjects, the SEM load - the total number of SEMs - increases with age. However, given poor technical reliability of measurement for many DNA methylation sites, we posited that many outliers might represent technical noise. Our study of whole blood samples from 36 individuals, each measured twice, found that 23.3% of hypoSEM and 45.6% hyperSEM are not shared between replicates. This diminishes the reliability of SEM loads, where intraclass correlation coefficients are 0.96 for hypoSEM and 0.90 for hyperSEM. We linked SEM reliability to multiple factors, including blood cell type composition, probe beta-value statistics, and presence of SNPs. A machine learning approach, leveraging these factors, filtered unreliable SEMs, enhancing reliability in a separate dataset of technical replicates from 128 individuals. Analysis of the Framingham Heart Study confirmed previously reported SEM association with mortality and revealed novel connections to cardiovascular disease. We discover that associations with aging outcomes are primarily driven by hypoSEMs at baseline methylated probes and hyperSEMs at baseline unmethylated probes, which are the same subsets that demonstrate highest technical reliability. These aging associations are preserved after filtering out unreliable SEMs and are enhanced after adjusting for blood cell composition. Finally, we utilize these insights to formulate best practices for SEM detection and introduce a novel R package,SEMdetectR, which utilizes parallel programming for efficient SEM detection with comprehensive options for detection, filtering, and analysis.",0.999999999999999

Serum proteomic measurements were done using 4782 DNA aptamers (SOMAmers). Data from 1479 participants with spirometric data were used to assess the association of SOMAmer measurements with FEV1 using linear regression. Bi-directional two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses were done to assess causal relations of observationally associated SOMAmers with FEV1, using genotype and SOMAmer data from 5368 AGES-Reykjavik participants and genetic associations with FEV1 from a publicly available GWAS (n = 400,102).In observational analyses, 530 SOMAmers were associated with FEV1 after multiple testing adjustment (FDR < 0.05). The most significant were Retinoic Acid Receptor Responder 2 (RARRES2), R-Spondin 4 (RSPO4) and Alkaline Phosphatase, Placental Like 2 (ALPPL2). Of the 257 SOMAmers with genetic instruments available, eight were associated with FEV1 in MR analyses. Three were directionally consistent with the observational estimate, Thrombospondin 2 (THBS2), Endoplasmic Reticulum Oxidoreductase 1 Beta (ERO1B) and Apolipoprotein M (APOM). THBS2 was further supported by a colocalization analysis. Analyses in the reverse direction, testing whether changes in SOMAmer levels were caused by changes in FEV1, were performed but no significant associations were found after multiple testing adjustments.In summary, this large scale proteogenomic analyses of FEV1 reveals circulating protein markers of FEV1, as well as several proteins with potential causality to lung function.© 2024.

Victims are more likely to develop comorbid diseases such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Nonetheless, not everyone who suffers from MST develops PTSD and/or MDD. DNA methylation, which can regulate gene expression, might give us insight into the molecular mechanisms behind this discrepancy. Therefore, we sought to identify genomic loci and enriched biological pathways that differ between patients with and without MST, PTSD, and MDD.Saliva samples were collected from 113 female veterans. Following DNA extraction and processing, DNA methylation levels were measured through the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip array. We used limma and bump hunting methods to generate the differentially methylated positions and differentially methylated regions (DMRs), respectively. Concurrently, we used Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome to find enriched pathways.A DMR close to the transcription start site of ZFP57 was differentially methylated between subjects with and without PTSD, replicating previous findings and emphasizing the potential role of ZFP57 in PTSD susceptibility. In the pathway analyses, none survived multiple correction, although top GO terms included some potentially relevant to MST, PTSD, and MDD etiology.We conducted one of the first DNA methylation analyses investigating MST along with PTSD and MDD. In addition, we found one DMR near ZFP57 to be associated with PTSD. The replication of this finding indicates further investigation of ZFP57 in PTSD may be warranted.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

38424222,"Former smoking associated with epigenetic modifications in human granulosa cells among women undergoing assisted reproduction.","Sci Rep","Smoking exposure during adulthood can disrupt oocyte development in women, contributing to infertility and possibly adverse birth outcomes. Some of these effects may be reflected in epigenome profiles in granulosa cells (GCs) in human follicular fluid. We compared the epigenetic modifications throughout the genome in GCs from women who were former (N = 15) versus never smokers (N = 44) undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART). This study included 59 women undergoing ART. Smoking history including time since quitting was determined by questionnaire. GCs were collected during oocyte retrieval and DNA methylation (DNAm) levels were profiled using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We performed an epigenome-wide association study with robust linear models, regressing DNAm level at individual loci on smoking status, adjusting for age, ovarian stimulation protocol, and three surrogate variables. We performed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) analysis and over-representation analysis of the identified CpGs and corresponding gene set. 81 CpGs were differentially methylated among former smokers compared to never smokers (FDR < 0.05). We identified 2 significant DMRs (KCNQ1 and RHBDD2). The former smoking-associated genes were enriched in oxytocin signaling, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, platelet activation, axon guidance, and chemokine signaling pathway. These epigenetic variations have been associated with inflammatory responses, reproductive outcomes, cancer development, neurodevelopmental disorder, and cardiometabolic health. Secondarily, we examined the relationships between time since quitting and DNAm at significant CpGs. We observed three CpGs in negative associations with the length of quitting smoking (p < 0.05), which were cg04254052 (KCNIP1), cg22875371 (OGDHL), and cg27289628 (LOC148145), while one in positive association, which was cg13487862 (PLXNB1).

We assessed the prospective association between maternal adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) during pregnancy and risk of childhood overweight/obesity at 4 years. This prospective analysis involved 272 mother-child pairs from the ECLIPSES study. Maternal diet during pregnancy was assessed using a validated 45-item food-frequency questionnaire and a relative whole-pregnancy MedDiet score (rMedDiet) was calculated. The children's weight and height were measured at the age of 4. Primary outcome was childhood overweight/obesity based on age- and-sex-specific BMI z-score > 85th percentile using the WHO child growth standards. Mean maternal rMedDiet score in pregnancy was 9.8 (±standard deviation 2.3) and 25.7% of the children were overweight/obese. Significant differences in anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and BMI) were found according to sex, with higher scores for boys. After controlling for potential confounders, greater maternal adherence to rMedDiet during pregnancy was associated with a lower risk of childhood overweight/obesity, highest vs. lowest quartile (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.12-0.90;p-trend 0.037). Similar trends regarding this association (per 1-point increase rMedDiet score) were observed after stratification by advanced maternal age, maternal early pregnancy BMI, education, socioeconomic status, smoking, and gestational weight gain. Our findings suggest that closer adherence to the MedDiet during pregnancy may protect against the risk of offspring overweight/obesity at 4 years. Further research is needed to explore whether associations persist across the life course.",0.999999999999993

We aimed to explore relationship between prenatal exposures and adolescent's psycho-cardiometabolic intermediary traits mediated through epigenetic biomarkers, using structural equation modeling (SEM). We used data from mother-child dyads from pregnancy and adolescents at 16-17 years from two prospective cohorts: Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 (NFBC1986) and Raine Study from Australia. Factor analysis was applied to generate two different latent factor structures: (a) prenatal exposures and (b) adolescence psycho-cardiometabolic intermediary traits. Furthermore, three types of epigenetic biomarkers were included: (1) DNA methylation score for maternal smoking during pregnancy (DNAmMSS), (2) DNAm age estimate PhenoAge and (3) DNAm estimate for telomere length (DNAmTL). Similar factor structure was observed between both cohorts yielding three prenatal factors, namely BMI (Body Mass Index), SOP (Socio-Obstetric-Profile), and Lifestyle, and four adolescent factors: Anthropometric, Insulin-Triglycerides, Blood Pressure, and Mental health. In the SEM pathways, stronger direct effects of F1prenatal-BMI (NFBC1986 = β: 0.27; Raine = β: 0.39) and F2prenatal-SOP (β: -0.11) factors were observed on adolescent psycho-cardiometabolic multimorbidity. We observed an indirect effect of prenatal latent factors through epigenetic markers on a psycho-cardiometabolic multimorbidity factor in Raine study (P < 0.05).

38390895,"Sex-Specific Associations between Prenatal Exposure to Di(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate, Epigenetic Age Acceleration, and Susceptibility to Early Childhood Upper Respiratory Infections.","Epigenomes","Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a common plasticizer that can affect immune system development and susceptibility to infection. Aging processes (measured as epigenetic age acceleration (EAA)) may mediate the immune-related effects of prenatal exposure to DEHP. This study's objective was to examine associations between prenatal DEHP exposure, EAA at three months of age, and the number of upper respiratory infections (URIs) from 12 to 18 months of age using a sample of 69 maternal-child pairs from a Canadian pregnancy cohort. Blood DNA methylation data were generated using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip; EAA was estimated using Horvath's pan-tissue clock. Robust regressions examined overall and sex-specific associations. Higher prenatal DEHP exposure (B= 6.52,95% CI= 1.22, 11.81) and increased EAA (B= 2.98,95% CI= 1.64, 4.32) independently predicted more URIs. In sex-specific analyses, some similar effects were noted for boys, and EAA mediated the association between prenatal DEHP exposure and URIs. In girls, higher prenatal DEHP exposure was associated with decreased EAA, and no mediation was noted. Higher prenatal DEHP exposure may be associated with increased susceptibility to early childhood URIs, particularly in boys, and aging biomarkers such as EAA may be a biological mechanism. Larger cohort studies examining the potential developmental immunotoxicity of phthalates are needed.",0.999999999999991

We hypothesized differential DNA methylation (DNAm) in brain tissue as a potential mediator of this association.We assessed genome-wide DNAm (Illumina EPIC BeadChips) in prefrontal cortex tissue and three AD-related neuropathological markers (Braak stage, CERAD, ABC score) for 159 donors, and estimated donors' residential traffic-related PM2.5exposure 1, 3, and 5 years prior to death. We used a combination of the Meet-in-the-Middle approach, high-dimensional mediation analysis, and causal mediation analysis to identify potential mediating CpGs.PM2.5was significantly associated with differential DNAm at cg25433380 and cg10495669. Twenty-four CpG sites were identified as mediators of the association between PM2.5exposure and neuropathology markers, several located in genes related to neuroinflammation.Our findings suggest differential DNAm related to neuroinflammation mediates the association between traffic-related PM2.5and AD.First study to evaluate the potential mediation effect of DNA methylation for the association between PM2.5 exposure and neuropathological changes of Alzheimer's disease. Study was based on brain tissues rarely investigated in previous air pollution research. Cg10495669, assigned to RBCK1 gene playing a role in inflammation, was associated consistently with 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year traffic-related PM2.5 exposures prior to death. Meet-in-the-middle approach and high-dimensional mediation analysis were used simultaneously to increase the potential of identifying the differentially methylated CpGs. Differential DNAm related to neuroinflammation was found to mediate the association between traffic-related PM2.5 and Alzheimer's disease.© 2024 The Authors.

38380706,"Neurogenetic and multi-omic sources of overlap among sensation seeking, alcohol consumption, and alcohol use disorder.","Addict Biol","Sensation seeking is bidirectionally associated with levels of alcohol consumption in both adult and adolescent samples, and shared neurobiological and genetic influences may in part explain these associations. Links between sensation seeking and alcohol use disorder (AUD) may primarily manifest via increased alcohol consumption rather than through direct effects on increasing problems and consequences. Here the overlap among sensation seeking, alcohol consumption, and AUD was examined using multivariate modelling approaches for genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics in conjunction with neurobiologically informed analyses at multiple levels of investigation. Meta-analytic and genomic structural equation modelling (GenomicSEM) approaches were used to conduct GWAS of sensation seeking, alcohol consumption, and AUD. Resulting summary statistics were used in downstream analyses to examine shared brain tissue enrichment of heritability and genome-wide evidence of overlap (e.g., stratified GenomicSEM, RRHO, genetic correlations with neuroimaging phenotypes), and to identify genomic regions likely contributing to observed genetic overlap across traits (e.g., H-MAGMA and LAVA). Across approaches, results supported shared neurogenetic architecture between sensation seeking and alcohol consumption characterised by overlapping enrichment of genes expressed in midbrain and striatal tissues and variants associated with increased cortical surface area. Alcohol consumption and AUD evidenced overlap in relation to variants associated with decreased frontocortical thickness. Finally, genetic mediation models provided evidence of alcohol consumption mediating associations between sensation seeking and AUD. This study extends previous research by examining critical sources of neurogenetic and multi-omic overlap among sensation seeking, alcohol consumption, and AUD which may underlie observed phenotypic associations.© 2024 The Authors.

We studied the AD association of CpG-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (CGS), which act as the hub of both the genetic and epigenetic effects, in Hispanics decedents and generalized the findings to Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) decedents.First, we derived the dosage of the CpG site-creating allele of multiple CGSes in each 1 KB window across the genome and we conducted a sliding window association test with clinical diagnosis of AD in 7,155 Hispanics (3,194 cases and 3,961 controls) using generalized linear mixed models with the adjustment of age, sex, population structure, genomic relationship matrix, and genotyping batches. Next, using methylation and bulk RNA-sequencing data from the dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex in 150 Hispanics brains, we tested the cis- and trans-effects of AD associated CGS on brain DNA methylation to mRNA expression. For the genes with significant cis- and trans-effects, we checked their enriched pathways.We identified six genetic loci in Hispanics with CGS dosage associated with AD at genome-wide significance levels:ADAM20(Score=55.2,P=4.06×10-8), betweenVRTN(Score=-19.6,P=1.47×10-8) andSYNDIG1L(Score=-37.7,P=2.25×10-9),SPG7(16q24.3) (Score=40.5,P=2.23×10-8),PVRL2(Score=125.86,P=1.64×10-9),TOMM40(Score=-18.58,P=4.61×10-8), andAPOE(Score=75.12,P=7.26×10-26). CGSes inPVRL2andAPOEwere also genome-wide significant in NHW.

Except forSYNDIG1L(P=0.08), brain methylation levels in all the other five loci affected downstream RNA expression in the Hispanics (P<0.05), and methylation atVRTNandTOMM40were also associated with RNA expression in NHW. Gene expression in these six loci were also regulated by CpG sites in genes that were enriched in the neuron projection and synapse (FDR<0.05).We identified six CpG associated genetic loci associated with AD in Hispanics, harboring both genetic and epigenetic risks.

DNA methylome was assessed in 24 paired placenta and umbilical cord samples. The differentially methylated CpGs associated with maternal pregestational BMI were identified and the metabolic pathways and the potentially related diseases affected by their annotated genes were determined. Two top differentially methylated CpGs were studied in 90 additional samples and the relationship with the offspring's metabolic phenotype was determined. The results showed that maternal pregestational BMI is associated with the methylation of genes involved in endocrine and developmental pathways with potential effects on type 2 diabetes and obesity. The methylation and expression ofHADHAandSLC2A8genes in placenta and umbilical cord were related to several metabolic parameters in the offspring at 6 years (weight SDS, height SDS, BMI SDS, Δ BW-BMI SDS, FM SDS, waist, SBP, TG, HOMA-IR, perirenal fat; allp< 0.05).

Here, we interrogate AUD-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) changes within and across addiction-relevant brain regions: the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC array data from 119 decedents of European ancestry (61 cases, 58 controls) were analyzed using robust linear regression, with adjustment for technical and biological variables. Associations were characterized using integrative analyses of public gene regulatory data and published genetic and epigenetic studies. We additionally tested for brain region-shared and -specific associations using mixed effects modeling and assessed implications of these results using public gene expression data.At a false discovery rate ≤ 0.05, we identified 53 CpGs significantly associated with AUD status for NAc and 31 CpGs for DLPFC. In a meta-analysis across the regions, we identified an additional 21 CpGs associated with AUD, for a total of 105 unique AUD-associated CpGs (120 genes). AUD-associated CpGs were enriched in histone marks that tag active promoters and our strongest signals were specific to a single brain region. Of the 120 genes, 23 overlapped with previous genetic associations for substance use behaviors; all others represent novel associations.Our findings identify AUD-associated methylation signals, the majority of which are specific within NAc or DLPFC.

Genetic and epigenetic evidence suggests that PTSD is linked to forming stress-related memories. In the current study, we investigated post-deployment associations of PTSD symptoms with differential DNA methylation in a sample of Burundian soldiers returning from the African Union Mission in Somalia's war zone. We used a matched longitudinal study design to explore epigenetic changes associated with PTSD symptoms in N = 191 participants. PTSD symptoms and saliva samples were collected at 1-3 (t1) and 9-14 months (t2) after the return of the soldiers to their home base. Individuals with either worsening or improving PTSD symptoms were matched for age, stressful, traumatic and self-perpetrated events prior to the post-assessment, traumatic and violent experiences between the post- and the follow-up assessment, and violence experienced during childhood. A mixed model analysis was conducted to identify top nominally significantly differentially methylated genes, which were then used to perform a gene enrichment analysis. The linoleic acid metabolism pathway was significantly associated with post-deployment PTSD symptoms, after accounting for multiple comparisons. Linoleic acid has been linked to memory and immune related processes in previous research. Our findings suggest that differential methylation of linoleic acid pathway genes is associated with PTSD and thus may merit closer inspection as a possible mediator of resilience.© 2024.

38187766,"Within-subject changes in methylome profile identify individual signatures of early-life adversity, with a potential to predict neuropsychiatric outcome.","bioRxiv","Adverse early-life experiences (ELA), including poverty, trauma and neglect, affect a majority of the world's children. Whereas the impact of ELA on cognitive and emotional health throughout the lifespan is well-established, it is not clear how distinct types of ELA influence child development, and there are no tools to predict for an individual child their vulnerability or resilience to the consequences of ELAs. Epigenetic markers including DNA-methylation profiles of peripheral cells may encode ELA and provide a predictive outcome marker. However, the rapid dynamic changes in DNA methylation in childhood and the inter-individual variance of the human genome pose barriers to identifying profiles predicting outcomes of ELA exposure. Here, we examined the relation of several dimensions of ELA to changes of DNA methylation, using a longitudinal within-subject design and a high threshold for methylation changes in the hope of mitigating the above challenges.We analyzed DNA methylation in buccal swab samples collected twice for each of 110 infants: neonatally and at 12 months. We identified CpGs differentially methylated across time, calculated methylation changes for each child, and determined whether several indicators of ELA associated with changes of DNA methylation for individual infants. We then correlated select dimensions of ELA with methylation changes as well as with measures of executive function at age 5 years. We examined for sex differences, and derived a sex-dependent 'impact score' based on sites that most contributed to the methylation changes.Setting a high threshold for methylation changes, we discovered that changes in methylation between two samples of an individual child reflected age-related trends towards augmented methylation, and also correlated with executive function years later. Among the tested factors and ELA dimensions, including income to needs ratios, maternal sensitivity, body mass index and sex, unpredictability of parental and household signals was the strongest predictor of executive function. In girls, an interaction was observed between a measure of high early-life unpredictability and methylation changes, in presaging executive function.These findings establish longitudinal, within-subject changes in methylation profiles as a signature of some types of ELA in an individual child. Notably, such changes are detectable beyond the age-associated DNA methylation dynamics. Future studies are required to determine if the methylation profile changes identified here provide a predictive marker of vulnerabilities to poorer cognitive and emotional outcomes.",0.999999999998302

Although they are less susceptible to AIDS-related complications, they remain highly vulnerable to non-communicable diseases. In this exploratory study of older PLHIV (OPLHIV) in Eswatini, we investigated whether epigenetic aging (i.e., the residual between regressing epigenetic age on chronological age) was associated with HIV-related parameters, and whether lifestyle factors modified these relationships. We calculated epigenetic aging focusing on the Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge and GrimAge epigenetic clocks, and a pace of biological aging biomarker (DunedinPACE) among 44 OPLHIV in Eswatini.Age at HIV diagnosis was associated with Hannum epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) (β-coefficient [95% Confidence Interval]; 0.53 [0.05, 1.00], p = 0.03) and longer duration since HIV diagnosis was associated with slower Hannum EAA (- 0.53 [- 1.00, - 0.05], p = 0.03). The average daily dietary intake of fruits and vegetables was associated with DunedinPACE (0.12 [0.03, 0.22], p = 0.01). The associations of Hannum EAA with the age at HIV diagnosis and duration of time since HIV diagnosis were attenuated when the average daily intake of fruits and vegetables or physical activity were included in our models. Diet and self-perceived quality of life measures modified the relationship between CD4+T cell counts at participant enrollment and Hannum EAA.Epigenetic age is more advanced in OPLHIV in Eswatini in those diagnosed with HIV at an older age and slowed in those who have lived for a longer time with diagnosed HIV. Lifestyle and quality of life factors may differentially affect epigenetic aging in OPLHIV.

Reasons for this disparity are likely multifactorial, and include prenatal psychosocial stressors, and attendant increased lipid peroxidation; however, empirical data linking psychosocial stressors during pregnancy to oxidative status are limited.We used established scales to measure five psychosocial stressors. Maternal adverse childhood experiences, financial stress, social support, anxiety, and depression were measured among 50 African American and White pregnant women enrolled in the Stress and Health in Pregnancy cohort. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure biomarkers of oxidative stress (four urinary F2-isoprostane isomers), to estimate oxidative status. Linear regression models were used to evaluate associations between psychosocial stressors, prenatal oxidative status and preterm birth.After adjusting for maternal obesity, gestational diabetes, and cigarette smoking, African American women with higher oxidative status were more likely to report higher maternal adverse childhood experience scores (β = 0.16, se = 1.07, p-value = 0.024) and depression scores (β = 0.05, se = 0.02, p = 0.014). Higher oxidative status was also associated with lower gestational age at birth (β = -0.13, se = 0.06, p = 0.04) in this population. These associations were not apparent in Whites. However, none of the cross-product terms for race/ethnicity and social stressors reached statistical significance (p > 0.05).While the small sample size limits inference, our novel data suggest that psychosocial stressors may contribute significantly to oxidative stress during pregnancy, and preterm birth or delivery African Americans. If replicated in larger studies, these findings would support oxidative stress reduction using established dietary or pharmacological approaches present a potential avenue to mitigate adverse effects of psychosocial stressors on birth outcomes.© 2024 The Authors.

Whether it is associated with functional impairments and unhealthy ageing trajectories is unknown.Nationally representative population-based cohort with 3,126 community-dwelling individuals aged ≥60 years who contributed 8,291 biannual visits over a 10 year period. Unhealthy ageing was estimated with a deficit accumulation index (DAI) based on the number and severity of 52 health deficits, including 22 objectively-measured impairments in physical and cognitive functioning. Differences in DAI at each follow-up across quintiles of residential traffic density (RTD) at 50 and 100 meters, and closest distance to a petrol station, were estimated using flexible marginal structural models with inverse probability of censoring weights. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic and time-varying lifestyle factors, social deprivation index at the census tract and residential exposure to natural spaces.At baseline, the mean (SD) age and DAI score of the participants were 69.0 (6.6) years and 17.02 (11.0) %, and 54.0% were women. The median (IQR) RTD at 50 and 100 meters were 77 (31-467) and 509 (182-1802) vehicles/day, and the mean (SD) distance to the nearest petrol station of 962 (1317) meters. The average increase in DAI (95%CI) for participants in quintiles Q2-Q5 (vs Q1) of RTD at 50 meters was of 1.51 (0.50, 2.53), 0.98 (-0.05, 2.01), 2.20 (1.18, 3.21) and 1.98 (0.90, 3.05), respectively. Consistent findings were observed at 100 meters. By domains, most of the deficits accumulated with increased RTD were of a functional nature, although RTD at 50 meters was also associated with worse self-reported health, increased vitality problems and higher incidence of chronic morbidities. Living closer to a petrol station was associated with a higher incidence of functional impairments and chronic morbidities.Exposure to nearby residential traffic is associated with accelerated trajectories of unhealthy ageing. Diminishing traffic pollution should become a priority intervention for adding healthy years to life in the old age.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.999999997520634
38350911,"Living in poverty and accelerated biological aging: evidence from population-representative sample of U.S. adults.","BMC Public Health","Biological aging reflects a decline in the functions and integrity of the human body that is closely related to chronological aging. A variety of biomarkers have been found to predict biological age. Biological age higher than chronological age (biological age acceleration) indicates an accelerated state of biological aging and a higher risk of premature morbidity and mortality. This study investigated how socioeconomic disadvantages influence biological aging.The data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) IV, including 10 nationally representative cross-sectional surveys between 1999-2018, were utilized. The analytic sample consisted of N = 48,348 individuals (20-84 years). We used a total of 11 biomarkers for estimating the biological age. Our main outcome was biological age acceleration, indexed by PhenoAge acceleration (PAA) and Klemera-Doubal biological age acceleration (KDM-A). Poverty was measured as a ratio of family income to the poverty thresholds defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, adjusted annually for inflation and family size (5 categories). The PAA and KDM-A were regressed on poverty levels, age, their interaction, education, sex, race, and a data collection wave. Sample weights were used to make the estimates representative of the U.S. adult population.The results showed that higher poverty was associated with accelerated biological aging (PAA: unstandardized coefficient B = 1.38 p <.001, KDM: B = 0.96, p = .026 when comparing the highest and the lowest poverty level categories), above and beyond other covariates. The association between PAA and KDM-A and age was U-shaped. Importantly, there was an interaction between poverty levels and age (p <.001), as the effect of poverty was most pronounced in middle-aged categories while it was modest in younger and elderly groups.In a nationally representative US adult population, we found that higher poverty was positively associated with the acceleration of biological age, particularly among middle-aged persons.© 2024.

In this work, we extended the Iterative Sure Independence Screening (ISIS) algorithm by pairing ISIS with elastic-net (Enet) and two versions of adaptive Enet (AEnet and MSAEnet) to efficiently improve feature selection and effect estimation in omics research. We subsequently used genome-wide human blood DNA methylation data from American Indians of the Strong Heart Study (N=2,235 participants), measured in 1989-1991, to compare the performance (predictive accuracy, coefficient estimation and computational efficiency) of SIS-paired regularization methods to Bayesian shrinkage and traditional linear regression to identify epigenomic multi-marker of body mass index. ISIS-AEnet outperformed the other methods in prediction. In biological pathway enrichment analysis of genes annotated to BMI-related differentially methylated positions, ISIS-AEnet captured most of the enriched pathways in common for at least two of all the evaluated methods. ISIS-AEnet can favor biological discovery because it identifies the most robust biological pathways while achieving an optimal balance between bias and efficient feature selection. In the extended SIS R package, we also implemented ISIS paired with Cox and logistic regression for time-to-event and binary endpoints, respectively, and bootstrap confidence intervals for the estimated regression coefficients.© The Author(s) 2024.

38357671,"Sex-dependent placental methylation quantitative trait loci provide insight into the prenatal origins of childhood onset traits and conditions.","iScience","Molecular quantitative trait loci (QTLs) allow us to understand the biology captured in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The placenta regulates fetal development and shows sex differences in DNA methylation. We therefore hypothesized that placental methylation QTL (mQTL) explain variation in genetic risk for childhood onset traits, and that effects differ by sex. We analyzed 411 term placentas from two studies and found 49,252 methylation (CpG) sites with mQTL and 2,489 CpG sites with sex-dependent mQTL. All mQTL were enriched in regions that typically affect gene expression in prenatal tissues. All mQTL were also enriched in GWAS results for growth- and immune-related traits, but male- and female-specific mQTL were more enriched than cross-sex mQTL. mQTL colocalized with trait loci at 777 CpG sites, with 216 (28%) specific to males or females. Overall, mQTL specific to male and female placenta capture otherwise overlooked variation in childhood traits.© 2024 The Authors.",0.99999998324028
38343441,"Association of Epigenetic Age and Outcome in Critically Ill Patients.","Crit Care Explor","DNA methylation can be used to determine an individual's biological age, as opposed to chronological age, an indicator of underlying health status. This study aimed to assess epigenetic age in critically ill patients with and without sepsis to determine if higher epigenetic age is associated with admission diagnosis or mortality.Secondary analysis of whole blood DNA methylation data generated from a nested case-control study of critically ill septic and nonseptic patients.Four tertiary care hospitals in Canada.None.Critically ill patients with and without sepsis.Epigenetic age was derived from DNA methylation data using the Hannum and PhenoAge algorithms and deviation from the patient's chronological age in years was determined. Of the 66 patients with sepsis, 34 were male (51.5%), the mean age was 65.03 years and 25 patients (37.8%) died before discharge. Of the 68 nonseptic patients, 47 were male (69.1%), the mean age was 64.92 years and 25 (36.7%) died before discharge. Epigenetic age calculated using the PhenoAge algorithm showed a significant age acceleration of 4.97 years in septic patients (p= 0.045), but no significant acceleration in nonseptic patients. Epigenetic age calculated using the Hannum algorithm showed no significant acceleration in the septic or nonseptic patients. Similarly, in the combined septic and nonseptic cohorts, nonsurvivors showed an epigenetic age acceleration of 7.62 years (p= 0.004) using the PhenoAge algorithm while survivors showed no significant age acceleration. Survivor status was not associated with age acceleration using the Hannum algorithm.In critically ill patients, epigenetic age acceleration, as calculated by the PhenoAge algorithm, was associated with sepsis diagnosis and mortality.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

38282264,"Impact of air pollution from different sources on sperm DNA methylation.","Int J Environ Health Res","Environmental exposure is associated with increased incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and reduced fertility. Exposure to air pollution can influence gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. In this study, we analysed gene-specific CpG methylation in spermatozoa of city policemen occupationally exposed to air pollution in two Czech cities differing by sources and composition of the air pollution. In Prague, the pollution is mainly formed by NO2 from heavy traffic. Ostrava is a hotspot of industrial air pollution with high concentrations of particular matter (PM) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). We performed genome-wide methylation sequencing using the SureSelectXT Human Methyl-Seq system (Agilent Technologies) and next-generation sequencing to reveal differentially methylated CpG sites and regions. We identified differential methylation in the region chr5:662169 - 663376 annotated to genes CEP72 and TPPP. The region was then analysed in sperm DNA from 117 policemen using targeted methylation sequencing, which proved its hypermethylation in sperm of Ostrava policemen.",0.999999970153751
38260407,"Methylation profiles at birth linked to early childhood obesity.","medRxiv","Childhood obesity represents a significant global health concern and identifying risk factors is crucial for developing intervention programs. Many 'omics' factors associated with the risk of developing obesity have been identified, including genomic, microbiomic, and epigenomic factors. Here, using a sample of 48 infants, we investigated how the methylation profiles in cord blood and placenta at birth were associated with weight outcomes (specifically, conditional weight gain, body mass index, and weight-for-length ratio) at age six months. We characterized genome-wide DNA methylation profiles using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEpic chip, and incorporated information on child and maternal health, and various environmental factors into the analysis. We used regression analysis to identify genes with methylation profiles most predictive of infant weight outcomes, finding a total of 23 relevant genes in cord blood and 10 in placenta. Notably, in cord blood, the methylation profiles of three genes (PLIN4, UBE2F,andPPP1R16B) were associated with all three weight outcomes, which are also associated with weight outcomes in an independent cohort suggesting a strong relationship with weight trajectories in the first six months after birth. Additionally, we developed a Methylation Risk Score (MRS) that could be used to identify children most at risk for developing childhood obesity. While many of the genes identified by our analysis have been associated with weight-related traits (e.g., glucose metabolism, BMI, or hip-to-waist ratio) in previous genome-wide association and variant studies, our analysis implicated several others, whose involvement in the obesity phenotype should be evaluated in future functional investigations.",0.999999203021187
38253635,"Prenatal cocaine exposure and its influence on pediatric epigenetic clocks and epigenetic scores in humans.","Sci Rep","The investigation of the effects of prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) on offspring has been inconsistent, with few studies investigating biological outcomes in humans. We profiled genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) of umbilical cord blood (UCB) from newborns with (n = 35) and without (n = 47) PCE. We used DNAm data to (1) assess pediatric epigenetic clocks at birth and (2) to estimate epigenetic scores (ES) for lifetime disorders. We generated gestational epigenetic age estimates (DNAmGA) based on Knight and Bohlin epigenetic clocks. We also investigated the association between DNAmGA and UCB serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. Considering the large-scale DNAm data availability and existing evidence regarding PCE as a risk for health problems later in life, we generated ES for tobacco smoking, psychosis, autism, diabetes, and obesity. A gene ontology (GO) analysis on the CpGs included in the ES with group differences was performed. PCE was associated with lower DNAmGA in newborns, and this effect remained significant when controlling for potential confounders, such as blood cell type composition predicted by DNAm and obstetric data. DNAmGA was negatively correlated with BDNF levels in the serum of UCB. Higher tobacco smoking, psychosis, and diabetes ES were found in the PCE group. The GO analysis revealed GABAergic synapses as a potential pathway altered by PCE. Our findings of decelerated DNAmGA and ES for adverse phenotypes associated with PCE, suggest that the effects of gestational cocaine exposure on the epigenetic landscape of human newborns are detectable at birth.© 2024.

38195595,"Prenatal dietary exposure to mixtures of chemicals is associated with allergy or respiratory diseases in children in the ELFE nationwide cohort.","Environ Health","Prenatal exposure to environmental chemicals may be associated with allergies later in life. We aimed to examine the association between prenatal dietary exposure to mixtures of chemicals and allergic or respiratory diseases up to age 5.5 y.We included 11,638 mother-child pairs from the French ""Étude Longitudinale Française depuis l'Enfance"" (ELFE) cohort. Maternal dietary exposure during pregnancy to eight mixtures of chemicals was previously assessed. Allergic and respiratory diseases (eczema, food allergy, wheezing and asthma) were reported by parents between birth and age 5.5 years. Associations were evaluated with adjusted logistic regressions. Results are expressed as odds ratio (OR[95%CI]) for a variation of one SD increase in mixture pattern.Maternal dietary exposure to a mixture composed mainly of trace elements, furans and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was positively associated with the risk of eczema (1.10 [1.05; 1.15]), this association was consistent across sensitivity analyses. Dietary exposure to one mixture of pesticides was positively associated with the risk of food allergy (1.10 [1.02; 1.18]), whereas the exposure to another mixture of pesticides was positively but slightly related to the risk of wheezing (1.05 [1.01; 1.08]). This last association was not found in all sensitivity analyses. Dietary exposure to a mixture composed by perfluoroalkyl acids, PAHs and trace elements was negatively associated with the risk of asthma (0.89 [0.80; 0.99]), this association was consistent across sensitivity analyses, except the complete-case analysis.Whereas few individual chemicals were related to the risk of allergic and respiratory diseases, some consistent associations were found between prenatal dietary exposure to some mixtures of chemicals and the risk of allergic or respiratory diseases. The positive association between trace elements, furans and PAHs and the risk of eczema, and that between pesticides mixtures and food allergy need to be confirmed in other studies. Conversely, the negative association between perfluoroalkyl acids, PAHs and trace elements and the risk of asthma need to be further explored.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.999998478127967
38177108,"Parental and child genetic burden of glycaemic dysregulation and early-life cognitive development: an Asian and European prospective cohort study.","Transl Psychiatry","Insulin resistance and glucose metabolism have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, in the metabolically more susceptible Asian populations, it is not clear whether the genetic burden of glycaemic dysregulation influences early-life neurodevelopment. In a multi-ethnic Asian prospective cohort study in Singapore (Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO)), we constructed child and parental polygenic risk scores (PRS) for glycaemic dysregulation based on the largest genome-wide association studies of type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose among Asians. We found that child PRS for HOMA-IR was associated with a lower perceptual reasoning score at ~7 years (β = -0. 141, p-value = 0.024, 95% CI -0. 264 to -0. 018) and a lower WIAT-III mean score at ~9 years (β = -0.222, p-value = 0.001, 95% CI -0.357 to -0.087). This association were consistent in direction among boys and girls. These inverse associations were not influenced by parental PRS and were likely mediated via insulin resistance rather than mediators such as birth weight and childhood body mass index. Higher paternal PRS for HOMA-IR was suggestively associated with lower child perceptual reasoning at ~7 years (β = -0.172, p-value = 0.002, 95% CI -0.280 to -0.064). Replication analysis in a European cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort, showed that higher child PRS for fasting glucose was associated with lower verbal IQ score while higher maternal PRS for insulin resistance was associated with lower performance IQ score in their children at ~8.5 years. In summary, our findings suggest that higher child PRS for HOMA-IR was associated with lower cognitive scores in both Asian and European replication cohorts. Differential findings between cohorts may be attributed to genetic and environmental factors. Further investigation of the functions of the genetic structure and ancestry-specific PRS and a more comprehensive investigation of behavioural mediators may help to understand these findings better.© 2024.

38395991,"Abnormal DNA methylation within HPA-axis genes years after paediatric critical illness.","Clin Epigenetics","Critically ill children suffer from impaired physical/neurocognitive development 2 years later. Glucocorticoid treatment alters DNA methylation within the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which may impair normal brain development, cognition and behaviour. We tested the hypothesis that paediatric-intensive-care-unit (PICU) patients, sex- and age-dependently, show long-term abnormal DNA methylation within the HPA-axis layers, possibly aggravated by glucocorticoid treatment in the PICU, which may contribute to the long-term developmental impairments.In a pre-planned secondary analysis of the multicentre PEPaNIC-RCT and its 2-year follow-up, we identified differentially methylated positions and differentially methylated regions within HPA-axis genes in buccal mucosa DNA from 818 former PICU patients 2 years after PICU admission (n = 608 no glucocorticoid treatment; n = 210 glucocorticoid treatment) versus 392 healthy children and assessed interaction with sex and age, role of glucocorticoid treatment in the PICU and associations with long-term developmental impairments. Adjusting for technical variation and baseline risk factors and correcting for multiple testing (false discovery rate < 0.05), former PICU patients showed abnormal DNA methylation of 26 CpG sites (within CRHR1, POMC, MC2R, NR3C1, FKBP5, HSD11B1, SRD5A1, AKR1D1, DUSP1, TSC22D3 and TNF) and three DNA regions (within AVP, TSC22D3 and TNF) that were mostly hypomethylated. These abnormalities were sex-independent and only partially age-dependent. Abnormal methylation of three CpG sites within FKBP5 and one CpG site within SRD5A1 and AKR1D1 was partly attributable to glucocorticoid treatment during PICU stay. Finally, abnormal methylation within FKBP5 and AKR1D1 was most robustly associated with long-term impaired development.Two years after critical illness in children, abnormal methylation within HPA-axis genes was present, predominantly within FKBP5 and AKR1D1, partly attributable to glucocorticoid treatment in the PICU, and explaining part of the long-term developmental impairments. These data call for caution regarding liberal glucocorticoid use in the PICU.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.999997364686491

Exposures of interest included address-level ambientPM2.5andNO2in 2009 and their cumulative averages from 2009 to PD diagnosis with varying lag-years. The primary outcome was PD diagnosis between 2009 and 2018 (n=163). We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards and time-varying Cox models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).NO2exposure in 2009 was associated with PD risk in a dose-response manner. The HR and 95% CI were 1.22 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.46) for one interquartile [4.8 parts per billion (ppb)] increment inNO2, adjusting for age, race and ethnicity, education, smoking status, alcohol drinking, caffeine intake, body mass index, physical activity, census region, residential area type, area deprivation index (ADI), and self-reported health status. The association was confirmed in secondary analyses with time-varying averaged cumulative exposures. For example, the multivariable adjusted HR for PD per4.8 ppbincrement inNO2was 1.25 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.50) in the 2-year lag analysis using cumulative average exposure. Post hoc subgroup analyses overall confirmed the association. However, statistical interaction analyses found that the positive association ofNO2with PD risk was limited to women in urban, rural, and small town areas and women with≥50thpercentile ADI but not among women from suburban areas or areas with<50thpercentile ADI. In contrast,PM2.5exposure was not associated with PD risk with the possible exception for women from the Midwest region of the US (HRinterquartile-range=2.49, 95% CI: 1.20, 5.14) but not in other census regions.In this nationwide cohort of US women, higher level exposure to ambientNO2is associated with a greater risk of PD. This finding needs to be independently confirmed and the underlying mechanisms warrant further investigation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13009.",0.999996146461396
38384900,"A role for adverse childhood experiences and depression in preeclampsia.","J Clin Transl Sci","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are a measure of childhood adversity and are associated with life-long morbidity. The impacts of ACEs on peripartum health including preeclampsia, a common and dangerous hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, remain unclear, however. Therefore, we aimed to determine ACE association with peripartum psychiatric health and prevalence of preeclampsia using a case-control design.Clinical data were aggregated and validated using a large, intergenerational knowledgebase developed at our institution. Depression symptoms were measured by standard clinical screeners: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). ACEs were assessed via survey. Scores were compared between participants with (N= 32) and without (N= 46) prior preeclampsia.Participants with ACE scores ≥4 had significantly greater odds of preeclampsia than those with scores ≤ 3 (adjusted odds ratio = 6.71, 95% confidence interval:1.13-40.00;p= 0.037). Subsequent speculative analyses revealed that increased odds of preeclampsia may be driven by increased childhood abuse and neglect dimensions of the ACE score. PHQ-9 scores (3.73 vs. 1.86,p= 0.03), EPDS scores (6.38 vs. 3.71,p= 0.01), and the incidence of depression (37.5% vs. 23.9%,p= 0.05) were significantly higher in participants with a history of preeclampsia versus controls.Childhood sets the stage for life-long health. Our findings suggest that ACEs may be a risk factor for preeclampsia and depression, uniting the developmental origins of psychiatric and obstetric risk.© The Author(s) 2024.",0.999993032506157
38293193,"Creation and Validation of the First Infinium DNA Methylation Array for the Human Imprintome.","bioRxiv","Differentially methylated imprint control regions (ICRs) regulate the monoallelic expression of imprinted genes. Their epigenetic dysregulation by environmental exposures throughout life results in the formation of common chronic diseases. Unfortunately, existing Infinium methylation arrays lack the ability to profile these regions adequately. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is the unique method able to profile these regions, but it is very expensive and it requires not only a high coverage but it is also computationally intensive to assess those regions.To address this deficiency, we developed a custom methylation array containing 22,819 probes. Among them, 9,757 probes map to 1,088 out of the 1,488 candidate ICRs recently described. To assess the performance of the array, we created matched samples processed with the Human Imprintome array and WGBS, which is the current standard method for assessing the methylation of the Human Imprintome. We compared the methylation levels from the shared CpG sites and obtained a mean R2= 0.569. We also created matched samples processed with the Human Imprintome array and the Infinium Methylation EPIC v2 array and obtained a mean R2= 0.796. Furthermore, replication experiments demonstrated high reliability (ICC: 0.799-0.945).Our custom array will be useful for replicable and accurate assessment, mechanistic insight, and targeted investigation of ICRs. This tool should accelerate the discovery of ICRs associated with a wide range of diseases and exposures, and advance our understanding of genomic imprinting and its relevance in development and disease formation throughout the life course.",0.999818322092962
38419113,"DNA methylation may partly explain psychotropic drug-induced metabolic side effects: results from a prospective 1-month observational study.","Clin Epigenetics","Metabolic side effects of psychotropic medications are a major drawback to patients' successful treatment. Using an epigenome-wide approach, we aimed to investigate DNA methylation changes occurring secondary to psychotropic treatment and evaluate associations between 1-month metabolic changes and both baseline and 1-month changes in DNA methylation levels. Seventy-nine patients starting a weight gain inducing psychotropic treatment were selected from the PsyMetab study cohort. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was measured at baseline and after 1 month of treatment, using the Illumina Methylation EPIC BeadChip.A global methylation increase was noted after the first month of treatment, which was more pronounced (p < 2.2 × 10-16) in patients whose weight remained stable (< 2.5% weight increase). Epigenome-wide significant methylation changes (p < 9 × 10-8) were observed at 52 loci in the whole cohort. When restricting the analysis to patients who underwent important early weight gain (≥ 5% weight increase), one locus (cg12209987) showed a significant increase in methylation levels (p = 3.8 × 10-8), which was also associated with increased weight gain in the whole cohort (p = 0.004). Epigenome-wide association analyses failed to identify a significant link between metabolic changes and methylation data. Nevertheless, among the strongest associations, a potential causal effect of the baseline methylation level of cg11622362 on glycemia was revealed by a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis (n = 3841 for instrument-exposure association; n = 314,916 for instrument-outcome association).These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of psychotropic drug-induced weight gain, revealing important epigenetic alterations upon treatment, some of which may play a mediatory role.© 2024.

Two studies were conducted to (1) examine the psychometric properties of a four-item exerciser identity measure (4-EI) and an adapted healthy-eater identity measure (4-HEI) and (2) examine differences in identity strengths across categories of weight loss success.Data from 1,709 community dwelling adults in the International Weight Control Registry (IWCR) were used. A random half of the sample was used to assess the proposed unidimensional factor structure of the 4-EI and 4-HEI and examine convergent and discriminant validity using Spearman rank-order correlations. One-way ANOVA was used in the other random half of the sample to compare 4-EI and 4-HEI scores (-3 to + 3) across three self-defined weight loss categories ('Successful', 'Regain', and 'Unsuccessful') and those maintaining ≥ 5% weight loss for > 1 year vs. not.Results support the unidimensional factor structure with all four items (eigenvalue scores > 2.89) as well as convergent and discriminant validity for both measures. Exercise identity was strongly correlated with self-reported physical activity (r (735) = 0.52, p <.001) and measures of autonomous motivation. Healthy eating identity was moderately correlated with cognitive restraint in eating (r (744) = 0.42, p <.001) and other measures predictive of eating behavior. 4-EI and 4-HEI are stronger in Successful (4-EI: M = 0.90, SD = 1.77; 4-HEI: M = 1.56 SD = 1.37) vs. Regain (4-EI: M=-0.18, SD = 1.68; 4-HEI: M =.57, SD = 1.48) and Unsuccessful (4-EI:M=-0.28, SD = 1.62; 4-HEI: M = 0.51, SD = 1.33) and those maintaining ≥ 5% weight loss (4-EI:M = 0.47, SD = 1.78; 4-HEI: M = 1.13, SD = 1.49) vs. not (4-EI:M=-0.27, SD = 1.66; 4-HEI: M = 0.53, SD = 1.47), p's < 0.001.The 4-EI and 4-HEI have acceptable psychometric properties and can advance understanding of the role of identity in exercise and dietary behaviors and weight loss maintenance.The parent observational study, International Weight Control Registry (IWCR), for these sub-studies is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04907396).© 2024.

The causal nature of these relationships and, thus, the suitability of these markers as intervention targets for cancer prevention is unclear.We meta-analysed 6 genome-wide association studies of circulating inflammatory markers comprising 59,969 participants of European ancestry. We then used combined cis-Mendelian randomization and colocalisation analysis to evaluate the causal role of 66 circulating inflammatory markers in risk of 30 adult cancers in 338,294 cancer cases and up to 1,238,345 controls. Genetic instruments for inflammatory markers were constructed using genome-wide significant (P < 5.0 × 10-8) cis-acting SNPs (i.e., in or ±250 kb from the gene encoding the relevant protein) in weak linkage disequilibrium (LD, r2 < 0.10). Effect estimates were generated using inverse-variance weighted random-effects models and standard errors were inflated to account for weak LD between variants with reference to the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 CEU panel. A false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected P-value (""q-value"") <0.05 was used as a threshold to define ""strong evidence"" to support associations and 0.05 ≤ q-value < 0.20 to define ""suggestive evidence"". A colocalisation posterior probability (PPH4) >70% was employed to indicate support for shared causal variants across inflammatory markers and cancer outcomes. Findings were replicated in the FinnGen study and then pooled using meta-analysis.We found strong evidence to support an association of genetically-proxied circulating pro-adrenomedullin concentrations with increased breast cancer risk (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.10-1.29, q-value = 0.033, PPH4 = 84.3%) and suggestive evidence to support associations of interleukin-23 receptor concentrations with increased pancreatic cancer risk (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.20-1.69, q-value = 0.055, PPH4 = 73.9%), prothrombin concentrations with decreased basal cell carcinoma risk (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.53-0.81, q-value = 0.067, PPH4 = 81.8%), and interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 concentrations with decreased triple-negative breast cancer risk (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.88-0.97, q-value = 0.15, PPH4 = 85.6%).

For 22 of 30 cancer outcomes examined, there was little evidence (q-value ≥0.20) that any of the 66 circulating inflammatory markers examined were associated with cancer risk.Our comprehensive joint Mendelian randomization and colocalisation analysis of the role of circulating inflammatory markers in cancer risk identified potential roles for 4 circulating inflammatory markers in risk of 4 site-specific cancers.

Overall, 537 individuals without aMCI or dementia at baseline were included. Among them, 62 individuals developed aMCI/AD at follow up. Genetic propensity to WMH was estimated using a polygenic risk score for WMHs (PRS WMH). The association of PRS WMH with aMCI/AD incidence was examined using COX models. A higher PRS WMH was associated with a 47.2% higher aMCI/AD incidence (p= 0.015) in the fully adjusted model. Subgroup analyses showed significant results in the older age group, in which individuals with a higher genetic predisposition for WMHs had a 3.4-fold higher risk for developing aMCI/AD at follow up (p< 0.001), as well as in the lower cognitive reserve (CR, proxied by education years) group, in which individuals with a higher genetic predisposition for WMHs had an over 2-fold higher risk (p= 0.013). Genetic predisposition for WMHs was associated with aMCI/AD incidence, particularly in the group of participants with a low CR.

Machine learning analyses identified 14 markers that are significantly associated with early OPC, including one EPB41L3 CpG site (438) and oral HPV16 status. A final model was trained on all available samples using the discovered panel and was able to predict early OPC compared to controls with an AUC of 0.970 on the training set. In the bootstrap validation sets, the average AUC was 0.935, indicating adequate internal validity. Our data suggest that this panel can detect OPC early, however external validation of this panel is needed. Further refinement of a panel of biomarkers to diagnose OPC earlier is urgently needed to prevent complex treatment of OPC and associated co-morbidities, while reducing risk of recurrence.",0.998494720816052
38169387,"Interpregnancy interval and early infant neurodevelopment: the role of maternal-fetal glucose metabolism.","BMC Med","Interpregnancy interval (IPI) is associated with a variety of adverse maternal and infant outcomes. However, reports of its associations with early infant neurodevelopment are limited and the mechanisms of this association have not been elucidated. Maternal-fetal glucose metabolism has been shown to be associated with infant neurodevelopmental. The objective of this study was to determine whether this metabolism plays a role in the relationship between IPI and neurodevelopment.This prospective birth cohort study included 2599 mother-infant pairs. The IPI was calculated by subtracting the gestational age of the current pregnancy from the interval at the end of the previous pregnancy. Neurodevelopmental outcomes at 12 months in infants were assessed by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire Edition 3 (ASQ-3). Maternal fasting venous blood was collected at 24-28 weeks and cord blood was collected at delivery. The association between IPI and neurodevelopment was determined by logistic regression. Mediation and sensitivity analyses were also conducted.In our cohort, 14.0% had an IPI < 12 months. IPI < 12 months increased the failure of the communication domain, fine motor domain, and personal social domain of the ASQ (relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.73 [1.11,2.70]; 1.73 [1.10,2.72]; 1.51 [1.00,2.29]). Maternal homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and cord blood C-peptide was significantly associated with failure in the communication domain [RRs with 95% CI: 1.15 (1.02, 1.31); 2.15 (1.26, 3.67)]. The proportion of the association between IPI and failure of the communication domain risk mediated by maternal HOMA-IR and cord blood C-peptide was 14.4%.IPI < 12 months was associated with failing the communication domain in infants. Maternal-fetal glucose metabolism abnormality may partially explain the risk of neurodevelopmental delay caused by short IPI.© 2023. The Author(s).",0.997468219237455

The study on methylome effect of PM2.5exposure was quite limited in Chinese population, and cohort-based study was absent. The study included blood-derived DNA methylation for 3365 Chinese participants from the NSPT cohort. We estimated individual PM2.5exposure level of short-medium-, medium- and long-term, based on a validated prediction model. We preformed epigenome-wide association studies to estimate the links between PM2.5exposure and DNA methylation change, as well as stratification and sensitive analysis to examined the robustness of the association models. A systematic review was conducted to obtain the previously published CpGs and examined for replication. We also conducted comparison on the DNA methylation variation corresponding to different time windows. We further conducted gene function analysis and pathway enrichment analysis to reveal related biological response. We identified a total of 177 CpGs and 107 DMRs associated with short-medium-term PM2.5exposure, at a strict genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8). The effect sizes on most CpGs tended to cease with the exposure of extended time scale. Associated markers and aligned genes were related to aging, immunity, inflammation and carcinogenesis. Enriched pathways were mostly involved in cell cycle and cell division, signal transduction, inflammatory pathway.

Epigenetic processes are known to be related to depression and ELS, but there is no evidence of the effects of trauma-focused psychotherapy on methylation alterations.Objective: We performed the first epigenome-wide association study to investigate methylation changes related to trauma-focused psychotherapies effects in TRD patients.Method: Thirty TRD patients assessed for ELS underwent trauma-focused psychotherapy, of those, 12 received trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy, and 18 Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). DNA methylation was profiled with Illumina Infinium EPIC array at T0 (baseline), after 8 weeks (T8, end of psychotherapy) and after 12 weeks (T12 - follow-up). We examined differentially methylated CpG sites and regions, as well as pathways analysis in association with the treatment.Results: Main results obtained have shown 110 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with a significant adjustedp-value area associated with the effects of trauma-focused psychotherapies in the entire cohort. Several annotated genes are related to inflammatory processes and psychiatric disorders, such asLTA,GFI1,ARID5B,TNFSF13,andLST1.Gene enrichment analyses revealed statistically significant processes related to tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor and TNF signalling pathway.

We investigated whether overweight in childhood, independently of overweight in adulthood, influenced adult employment status and later risk of having disabilities. Using data from the Danish Female Nurse Cohort study, we examined associations between overweight in childhood/adolescence, and young adulthood and disabilities and early retirement in later adulthood (>44 years) and whether it was influenced by menopausal age (<or ≥52 years). We analysed data from 10,363 female nurses recruited in 1999, who reported whether they, as children, were larger or of similar weight size as their peers at any age below 13 years, between 13 and 19 years, their weights, and heights at 25 years, their current work situation and whether they had had disabilities for more than 6 months.Our results showed that overweight in childhood, adolescence and young adulthood was associated with an increased risk of disabilities and early retirement. Especially childhood overweight that did not persist into adulthood was associated with an increased risk of disabilities (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.26-2.63) and early retirement (OR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.38-3.03) in the postmenopausal group. A similar increased risk for disabilities (OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.26-2.47) was seen for adolescent overweight that did not persist into adulthood.The results show that in a well-educated population of women, overweight in childhood and/or adolescence had adverse socioeconomic consequences for later risk of disabilities and early retirement irrespective of weight status in adulthood.© 2024.

This study provides clinical evidence for the feasibility of inferring cfDNA methylation levels based on cfDNA fragmentation patterns. We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on both healthy individuals and cancer patients.

We obtained unique or shared potential biomarkers for each group and built models accordingly. The modeling results proved the feasibility to predict the methylation status of single CpG sites in cfDNA using cleavage profile model from WGS data.By combining cfDNA cleavage profile of CpG sites with machine learning algorithms, we have identified specific CpG cleavage profile as biomarkers to predict the methylation status of individual CpG sites.

To gain deeper insights into the contribution of epigenetics in the variability of phenotypes observed in MFS, we undertook the first analysis of integrating DNA methylation and gene expression profiles in whole blood from MFS and healthy controls (HCs).The Illumina 850K (EPIC) DNA methylation array was used to detect DNA methylation changes on peripheral blood samples of seven patients with MFS and five HCs. Associations between methylation levels and clinical features of MFS were analyzed. Subsequently, we conducted an integrated analysis of the outcomes of the transcriptome data to analyze the correlation between differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and explore the potential role of methylation-regulated DEGs (MeDEGs) in MFS scoliosis. The weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to find gene modules with the highest correlation coefficient with target MeDEGs to annotate their functions in MFS.Our study identified 1253 DMPs annotated to 236 genes that were primarily associated with scoliosis, cardiomyopathy, and vital capacity. These conditions are typically associated with reduced lifespan in untreated MFS. We calculated correlations between DMPs and clinical features, such as cobb angle to evaluate scoliosis and FEV1% to assess pulmonary function. Notably, cg20223687 (PTPRN2) exhibited a positive correlation with cobb angle of scoliosis, potentially playing a role in ERKs inactivation.Taken together, our systems-level approach sheds light on the contribution of epigenetics to MFS and offers a plausible explanation for the complex phenotypes that are linked to reduced lifespan in untreated MFS patients.© 2024 The Authors.

In the subsequent meta-analysis, we found a second significantly associated variant (rs71543507) in an intergenic enhancer region. Overall, our work confirms that social trust is heritable, and provides an initial look into the genetic factors that influence it.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.0488364712581607

However, physical activity (PA) may modify the changes in cardiovascular risk associated with weight loss.To examine the joint association of weight loss and PA with the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with T2D and overweight or obesity.This cohort study was a post hoc analysis of the Look AHEAD randomized clinical trial, which compared the cardiovascular effects of weight loss by intensive lifestyle intervention vs diabetes support and education among individuals with T2D and overweight or obesity. The study was conducted from June 2001 to September 2012, and participants were patients in the substudy of accelerometry-measured PA from 8 locations in the United States. Data were analyzed from June to August 2023.Body weight change and accelerometer-derived PA volume across the first 4 years.The primary outcome was a composite cardiovascular outcome including cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for angina.Among a total of 1229 participants (mean [SD] age, 60 [7] years; 533 male [43%]), 333 (27%) achieved and maintained weight loss for the first 4 years. Among the individuals who maintained weight loss, 105 (32%) maintained high PA volume. During a median of 9.5 years of follow-up, 198 participants (16.1%) experienced the primary outcome. Compared with those with low PA volume and no weight loss (105 [15.8%]), maintaining high PA volume and weight loss was associated with a 61% lower risk of the primary end point (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.19-0.81; P = .01). However, there was no significant difference in the risk of the primary end point among those with either weight loss only or high PA only. The multiplicative interaction between weight loss and PA for the risk of cardiovascular events was also significant (P for interaction = .01).In this cohort study, maintaining weight loss and higher PA volume was associated with a lower risk of the composite cardiovascular outcome. The findings suggest that the cardiovascular benefits of PA may vary and be enhanced by weight loss among individuals with T2D and overweight or obesity.",0.0415861704583774

Alcohol influences gene expression through epigenetic changes mainly through DNA methylation. In this sense, levels of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), namely Global DNA methylation (GMe), which can be influenced by environmental and hormonal effects, represent a putative biological mechanism underlying alcohol effects. Our aim was to investigate the influence of AUD diagnosis and alcohol patterns (i.e., years of addiction, use in the last 30 days, and alcohol severity) on GMe levels. The sample consisted of 256 men diagnosed with AUD and 361 men without AUD. DNA samples from peripheral blood were used to assess GMe levels, measured through the levels of 5-mC using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results from multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the presence of AUD was associated with lower GMe levels (beta=-0.155, p=0.011). Other alcohol-related outcomes were not associated with DNA methylation. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the impact of chronic and heavy alcohol use in GMe could be a potential mechanism mediating the multiple organ damages related to AUD.",0.0349216462887214

The association between GWG trajectories identified by the latent class model and offspring weight outcomes from birth to 40 months were evaluated, after adjustment for maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, maternal height, and blood glucose levels.Three GWG rate groups, including the non-excessive GWG group (1,994/2,732), excessive GWG group (598 /2,732), and excessive early GWG group (140/2,732), were identified in women with GDM, respectively. Compared to the non-excessive GWG group, the adjusted OR (aOR) and 95% CI were 1.83 (1.35-2.47) and 1.79 (1.06-3.01) for macrosomia, 1.33 (1.07-1.66) and 1.48 (1.01-2.17) for large for gestational age (LGA) in the excessive GWG group and excessive early GWG group. Excessive GWG was also associated with an increased risk of BMI-for-age at 40 months (aOR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.14-2.42).Both excessive GWG and excessive early GWG increased the risk of macrosomia and LGA in women with GDM, but only the excessive GWG was associated with childhood overweight/obesity. The results suggest the long-term impact of GWG on offspring weight status in women with GDM and the potential benefits of GWG restriction after GDM diagnosis.© 2024.

Among genetic risk groups stratified by combinations of Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) deciles for SZ, BD and SZ versus BD, genetic SZ risk groups had high SZ risk and prominent cognitive impairments. Furthermore, epigenetic alterations are implicated in these disorders. However, it was unclear whether DNA Methylation Risk Scores (MRSs) for SZ risk derived from blood and brain tissues were associated with SZ risk, particularly the PRS-stratified genetic SZ risk group.Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of SZ risk in whole blood were preliminarily conducted between 66 SZ patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs) and among genetic risk groups (individuals with low genetic risk for SZ and BD in HCs (n=30) and in SZ patients (n=11), genetic BD risk in SZ patients (n=25) and genetic SZ risk in SZ patients (n=30)) stratified by combinations of PRSs for SZ, BD and SZ versus BD. Next, differences in MRSs based on independent EWASs of SZ risk in whole blood, postmortem frontal cortex (FC) and superior temporal gyrus (STG) were investigated among our case‒control and PRS-stratified genetic risk status groups.Among case‒control and genetic risk status groups, 33 and 351 genome-wide significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with SZ were identified, respectively, many of which were hypermethylated. Compared with the low genetic risk in HCs group, the genetic SZ risk in SZ group had 39 genome-wide significant DMPs, while the genetic BD risk in SZ group had only six genome-wide significant DMPs. The MRSs for SZ risk derived from whole blood, FC and STG were higher in our SZ patients than in HCs in whole blood and were particularly higher in the genetic SZ risk in SZ group than in the low genetic risk in HCs and genetic BD risk in SZ groups. Conversely, the MRSs for SZ risk based on our whole-blood EWASs among genetic risk groups were also associated with SZ in the FC and STG. There were no correlations between the MRSs and PRSs.These findings suggest that the MRS is a potential genetic marker in understanding SZ, particularly in patients with a genetic SZ risk.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

We aimed to identify circulating proteins associated with altered ANM and AAM using an unbiased two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization approach. By testing causal effects of 1,271 proteins on AAM, we identified 22 proteins causally associated with AAM in MR, among which 13 proteins (GCKR, FOXO3, SEMA3G, PATE4, AZGP1, NEGR1, LHB, DLK1, ANXA2, YWHAB, DNAJB12, RMDN1 and HPGDS) colocalized. Among 1,349 proteins tested for causal association with ANM using MR, we identified 19 causal proteins among which 7 proteins (CPNE1, TYMP, DNER, ADAMTS13, LCT, ARL and PLXNA1) colocalized. Follow-up pathway and gene enrichment analyses demonstrated links between AAM-related proteins and obesity and diabetes, and between AAM and ANM-related proteins and various types of cancer.

By harnessing large-scale genetic data through epigenome-wide Mendelian randomization, we identified CpG sites potentially causal for aging-related traits. Neither the existing epigenetic clocks nor age-related differential DNA methylation are enriched in these sites. These CpGs include sites that contribute to aging and protect against it, yet their combined contribution negatively affects age-related traits. We established a new framework to introduce causal information into epigenetic clocks, resulting in DamAge and AdaptAge-clocks that track detrimental and adaptive methylation changes, respectively. DamAge correlates with adverse outcomes, including mortality, while AdaptAge is associated with beneficial adaptations. These causality-enriched clocks exhibit sensitivity to short-term interventions. Our findings provide a detailed landscape of CpG sites with putative causal links to lifespan and healthspan, facilitating the development of aging biomarkers, assessing interventions, and studying reversibility of age-associated changes.© 2024.

DNA methylation may be one of them, representing a major epigenetic mechanism involving direct chemical modification of the individual's DNA. This pilot study aims to examine whether a specific mode of delivery induces changes of DNA methylation by comparing the umbilical cord blood and peripheral blood of the newborns.Blood samples from infants born by vaginal delivery and caesarean section were analysed to prepare the Methylseq library according to NEBNext enzymatic Methyl-seq Methylation Library Preparation Kit with further generation of target-enriched DNA libraries using the Twist Human Methylome Panel. DNA methylation status was determined using Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS).We identified 168 differentially methylated regions in umbilical cord blood samples and 157 regions in peripheral blood samples. These were associated with 59 common biological, metabolic and signalling pathways for umbilical cord and peripheral blood samples.Caesarean section is likely to represent an important epigenetic factor with the potential to induce changes in the genome that could play an important role in development of a broad spectrum of disorders.

DNA methylation fluctuates dynamically throughout the day. To discover new CpG methylation in lymphocytes associated with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), we evaluated changes in global CpG methylation profiles from before to after an oral aspirin challenge in patients with AERD and aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA). Whole-genome CpG methylation levels of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were quantified with an Illumina 860K Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip array and then adjusted for inferred lymphocyte fraction (ILF) with GLINT and Tensor Composition Analysis. Among the 866,091 CpGs in the array, differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) were found in 6 CpGs in samples from all 12 patients with asthma included in the study (AERD,n = 6; ATA,n = 6). DMCs were found in 3 CpGs in the 6 ATA samples and in 615 CpGs in the 6 AERD samples. A total of 663 DMCs in 415 genes and 214 intergenic regions differed significantly in the AERD compared with the ATA. In promoters, 126 CpG loci were predicted to bind to 38 transcription factors (TFs), many of which were factors already known to be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma and immune responses. In conclusion, we identified 615 new CpGs methylated in peripheral blood lymphocytes by oral aspirin challenge in AERD but not in ATA. These findings indicate that oral aspirin challenge induces epigenetic changes in ILFs, specifically in AERD patients, possibly via changes in TF binding, which may have epigenetic effects on the development of AERD.",0.015887031044459

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to unravel underlying mechanisms of mtDNA-CN regulation. However, the identified gene regions explain only a small fraction of mtDNA-CN variability. Most of this data has been estimated from microarrays based on various pipelines. In the present study we aimed to (1) identify genetic loci for qPCR-measured mtDNA-CN from three studies (16,130 participants) using GWAS, (2) identify potential systematic differences between our qPCR derived mtDNA-CN measurements compared to the published microarray intensity-based estimates, and (3) disentangle the nuclear from mitochondrial regulation of the mtDNA-CN phenotype. We identified two genome-wide significant autosomal loci associated with qPCR-measured mtDNA-CN: at HBS1L (rs4895440, p = 3.39 × 10-13) and GSDMA (rs56030650, p = 4.85 × 10-08) genes. Moreover, 113/115 of the previously published SNPs identified by microarray-based analyses were significantly equivalent with our findings. In our study, the mitochondrial genome itself contributed only marginally to mtDNA-CN regulation as we only detected a single rare mitochondrial variant associated with mtDNA-CN. Furthermore, we incorporated mitochondrial haplogroups into our analyses to explore their potential impact on mtDNA-CN.

Our study delves into the influence of various factors on adolescents' quality of life (QOL) among the COVID-19 pandemic in Shandong Province, China.Employing a cross-sectional research approach combined with multivariable analysis, we scrutinize the association of demographic factors (age, gender, education level, ethnic groups, urban area, and family economic status) and health-related behaviors (sleep duration, and self-reported health status) with QOL in 9953 students.During the pandemic, the average QOL for adolescents in Shandong Province was 133. Our analysis revealed that sleep duration and age had statistically significant associations with total QOL, with the OR values of 1.43 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03 to 1.83) and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.19 to 0.70), respectively. Notably, we observed that adolescents from economically disadvantaged families, or those with poorer self-reported health status, were more likely to report lower QOL scores.Overall, our study highlights the potential association of sleep duration, age, family economic status, and self-reported health with the QOL of adolescents in Shandong Province during the pandemic. During similar public health crises, policymakers, educators, and healthcare providers can actively work through resource allocation and effective intervention measures towards alleviating financial burdens, improving health conditions, and ultimately enhancing the total QOL for adolescents.© 2024.

Donor fat and muscle were quantified using pre-KT abdominal computed tomography scans. Patients were categorised into donor FMR tertiles and followed up for graft outcomes. Additionally, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed on 28 kidney graft samples from KT patients in the low- and high-FMR groups.Mean recipient age was 42.9 ± 11.4 years and 60.9% were males.

However, research in these two areas has remained isolated. In this study, we proposed an integrative strategy that combined neuroimaging, brain-wide gene expression, and peripheral DNA methylation data to investigate the genetic basis of gray matter abnormalities in MDD. The MRI T1-weighted images and Illumina 850 K DNA methylation microarrays were obtained from 269 patients and 416 healthy controls, and brain-wide transcriptomic data were collected from Allen Human Brain Atlas. The between-group differences in gray matter volume (GMV) and differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs) were examined. The genes with their expression patterns spatially related to GMV changes and genes with DMPs were overlapped and selected. Using principal component regression, the associations between DMPs in overlapped genes and GMV across individual patients were investigated, and the region-specific correlations between methylation status and gene expression were examined. We found significant associations between the decreased GMV and DMPs methylation status in the anterior cingulate cortex, inferior frontal cortex, and fusiform face cortex regions. These DMPs genes were primarily enriched in the neurodevelopmental and synaptic transmission process. There was a significant negative correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression in genes associated with GMV changes of the frontal cortex in MDD. Our findings suggest that GMV abnormalities in MDD may have a transcriptomic and epigenetic basis.

However, only a fraction of those admitted will experience severe AWS. Previously, we and others have shown that epigenetic indices, such as the Alcohol T-Score (ATS), can quantify recent alcohol consumption. However, whether these or other alcohol biomarkers, such as carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), could identify those at risk for severe AWS is unknown. To determine this, we first conducted genome-wide DNA methylation analyses of subjects entering and exiting alcohol treatment to identify loci whose methylation quickly reverted as a function of abstinence. We then tested whether methylation at a rapidly reverting locus, cg07375256, or other existing metrics including PAWSS scores, CDT levels, or ATS, could predict outcome in 125 subjects admitted for consideration of AWS. We found that PAWSS did not significantly predict severe AWS nor seizures. However, methylation at cg07375256 (ZSCAN25) and CDT strongly predicted severe AWS with ATS (p < 0.007) and cg07375256 (p < 6 × 10-5) methylation also predicting AWS associated seizures.

38233469,"Association between alcohol consumption and sleep traits: observational and mendelian randomization studies in the UK biobank.","Mol Psychiatry","Previous studies have shown that excessive alcohol consumption is associated with poor sleep. However, the health risks of light-to-moderate alcohol consumption in relation to sleep traits (e.g., insomnia, snoring, sleep duration and chronotype) remain undefined, and their causality is still unclear in the general population. To identify the association between alcohol consumption and multiple sleep traits using an observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) design. Observational analyses and one-sample MR (linear and nonlinear) were performed using clinical and individual-level genetic data from the UK Biobank (UKB). Two-sample MR was assessed using summary data from genome-wide association studies from the UKB and other external consortia. Phenotype analyses were externally validated using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2017-2018). Data analysis was conducted from January 2022 to October 2022. The association between alcohol consumption and six self-reported sleep traits (short sleep duration, long sleep duration, chronotype, snoring, waking up in the morning, and insomnia) were analysed. This study included 383,357 UKB participants (mean [SD] age, 57.0 [8.0] years; 46% male) who consumed a mean (SD) of 9.0 (10.0) standard drinks (one standard drink equivalent to 14 g of alcohol) per week. In the observational analyses, alcohol consumption was significantly associated with all sleep traits. Light-moderate-heavy alcohol consumption was linearly linked to snoring and the evening chronotype but nonlinearly associated with insomnia, sleep duration, and napping. In linear MR analyses, a 1-SD (14 g) increase in genetically predicted alcohol consumption was associated with a 1.14-fold (95% CI, 1.07-1.22) higher risk of snoring (P < 0.001), a 1.28-fold (95% CI, 1.20-1.37) higher risk of evening chronotype (P < 0.001) and a 1.24-fold (95% CI, 1.13-1.36) higher risk of difficulty waking up in the morning (P < 0.001). Nonlinear MR analyses did not reveal significant results after Bonferroni adjustment. The results of the two-sample MR analyses were consistent with those of the one-sample MR analyses, but with a slightly attenuated overall estimate. Our findings suggest that even low levels of alcohol consumption may affect sleep health, particularly by increasing the risk of snoring and evening chronotypes.

38368359,"Causal relationship between hypothyroidism and temporomandibular disorders: evidence from complementary genetic methods.","BMC Oral Health","The role of thyroid health in temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) has been emphasized in observational studies. However, whether the causation exists is unclear, and controversy remains about which specific disorder, such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, is destructive in TMDs. This study aims to investigate the overall and specific causal effects of various thyroid conditions on TMDs.Mendelian randomization (MR) studies were performed using genetic instruments for thyrotropin (TSH, N = 119,715), free thyroxine (fT4, N = 49,269), hypothyroidism (N = 410,141), hyperthyroidism (N = 460,499), and TMDs (N = 211,023). We assessed the overall effect of each thyroid factor via inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger methods, and performed extensive sensitivity analyses. Additionally, multivariable MR was conducted to evaluate the direct or indirect effects of hypothyroidism on TMDs whilst accounting for TSH, fT4 and hyperthyroidism, and vice versa.Univariable MR analyses revealed a causal effect of hypothyroidism on an increased risk of TMDs (IVW OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05-1.20, p = 0.001). No significant association between genetically predicted hyperthyroidism, TSH, or fT4 and TMDs. In the multivariable MR analyses, the effects of hypothyroidism on TMDs occurrence remained significant even after adjSusting for TSH, fT4 and hyperthyroidism (multivariable IVW OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.17, p = 0.006). No pleiotropy and heterogeneity were detected in the analyses (p > 0.05).Hypothyroidism might causally increase the risk of TMDs through a direct pathway, highlighting the critical role of managing thyroid health in the prevention of TMDs. Clinicians should give heightened attention to patients with hypothyroidism when seeking medical advice for temporomandibular discomfort. However, caution is warranted due to the potential confounders, pleiotropy, and selection bias in the MR study.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.00234253065566765

However, the diagnostic predictive power of the existing algorithms has been limited by small sample sizes, lack of representativeness, data leakage, and/or overfitting. Here, we overcome these limitations with the largest multi-site sample size to date (N = 5365) to provide a generalizable ML classification benchmark of major depressive disorder (MDD) using shallow linear and non-linear models. Leveraging brain measures from standardized ENIGMA analysis pipelines in FreeSurfer, we were able to classify MDD versus healthy controls (HC) with a balanced accuracy of around 62%. But after harmonizing the data, e.g., using ComBat, the balanced accuracy dropped to approximately 52%. Accuracy results close to random chance levels were also observed in stratified groups according to age of onset, antidepressant use, number of episodes and sex. Future studies incorporating higher dimensional brain imaging/phenotype features, and/or using more advanced machine and deep learning methods may yield more encouraging prospects.© 2024.

38347603,"Kidney-specific methylation patterns correlate with kidney function and are lost upon kidney disease progression.","Clin Epigenetics","Chronological and biological age correlate with DNA methylation levels at specific sites in the genome. Linear combinations of multiple methylation sites, termed epigenetic clocks, can inform us the chronological age and predict multiple health-related outcomes. However, why some sites correlating with lifespan, healthspan, or specific medical conditions remain poorly understood. Kidney fibrosis is the common pathway for chronic kidney disease, which affects 10% of European and US populations.Here we identify epigenetic clocks and methylation sites that correlate with kidney function. Moreover, we identify methylation sites that have a unique methylation signature in the kidney. Methylation levels in majority of these sites correlate with kidney state and function. When kidney function deteriorates, all of these sites regress toward the common methylation pattern observed in other tissues. Interestingly, while the majority of sites are less methylated in the kidney and become more methylated with loss of function, a fraction of the sites are highly methylated in the kidney and become less methylated when kidney function declines. These methylation sites are enriched for specific transcription-factor binding sites. In a large subset of sites, changes in methylation patterns are accompanied by changes in gene expression in kidneys of chronic kidney disease patients.These results support the information theory of aging, and the hypothesis that the unique tissue identity, as captured by methylation patterns, is lost as tissue function declines. However, this information loss is not random, but guided toward a baseline that is dependent on the genomic loci.DNA methylation at specific sites accurately reflects chronological and biological age. We identify sites that have a unique methylation pattern in the kidney. Methylation levels in the majority of these sites correlate with kidney state and function. Moreover, when kidney function deteriorates, all of these sites regress toward the common methylation pattern observed in other tissues. Thus, the unique methylation signature of the kidney is degraded, and epigenetic information is lost, when kidney disease progresses. These methylation sites are enriched for specific and methylation-sensitive transcription-factor binding sites, and associated genes show disease-dependent changes in expression. These results support the information theory of aging, and the hypothesis that the unique tissue identity, as captured by methylation patterns, is lost as tissue function declines.© 2024.

In this study we validated the 3-CpG estimator for age prediction in mouse blood, developed a new predictive model for EA in mouse aorta, and assessed whether epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) measured with blood and aorta samples correlates with age-dependent endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial function was characterized in vivo by MRI in 8-96-week-old C57BL/6 mice. Arterial stiffness was measured by USG-doppler. EA-related changes within 41 CpG sites in Prima1, Kcns1 and Hsf4 loci, were analyzed in the aorta and blood using bisulfite amplicon high-throughput sequencing. Progressive age-dependent endothelial dysfunction and changes in arterial stiffness were observed in 36-96-week-old C57BL/6 mice. Methylation levels of the investigated loci correlated with chronological age in blood and the aorta. The new model for EA estimation in aorta included three cytosines located in the Kcns1 and Hsf4, explained R2 = 87.8% of the variation in age, and predicted age with an mean absolute error of 9.6 weeks in the independent test set. EAA in the aorta was associated with endothelial dysfunction in the abdominal aorta and femoral artery what was consistent with the EAA direction estimated in blood samples. The rate of vascular biological ageing in mice, reflected by the age-dependent systemic endothelial dysfunction, could be estimated using DNA methylation measurements at three loci in aorta and blood samples.© 2024.

We aimed to characterize the DNA methylation profiles associated with clinical heterogeneity in disease progression and survival among patients.We included a cohort of 41 patients with sporadic ALS, with a median follow-up of 86.9 months, and 27 rigorously matched healthy controls. Blood-based genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was conducted.A total of 948 progression rate-associated differentially methylated positions, 298 progression rate-associated differentially methylated regions (R-DMRs), 590 survival time-associated DMPs, and 197 survival time-associated DMRs (S-DMRs) were identified, using complementary grouping strategies. Enrichment analysis of differentially methylated genes highlighted the involvement of synapses and axons in ALS progression and survival. Clinical analysis revealed a positive correlation between the average methylation levels of the R-DMR in PRDM8 and disease progression rate (r = 0.479, p = 0.002). Conversely, there was an inverse correlation between the average methylation levels of the R-DMR in ANKRD33 and disease progression rate (r = - 0.476, p = 0.002). In addition, patients with higher methylation levels within the S-DMR of ZNF696 experienced longer survival (p = 0.016), while those with elevated methylation levels in the S-DMR of RAI1 had shorter survival (p = 0.006).DNA methylation holds promise as a potential biomarker for tracking disease progression and predicting survival outcome and also offers targets for precision medicine.© 2024.

Limited estimations of biological aging based on physical examination data in the Chinese population have been developed to quantify the rate of aging. We developed and validated a novel aging measure (Balanced-AGE) based on readily available physical health examination data. In this study, a repeated sub-sampling approach was applied to address the data imbalance issue, and this approach significantly improved the performance of biological age (Balanced-AGE) in predicting all-cause mortality with a 10-year time-dependent AUC of 0.908 for all-cause mortality. This mortality prediction tool was found to be effective across different subgroups by age, sex, smoking, and alcohol consumption status. Additionally, this study revealed that individuals who were underweight, smokers, or drinkers had a higher extent of age acceleration.

Newborns who experienced perinatal asphyxia have suffered reduced oxygen delivery to the brain around the time of birth, which increases the risk of later psychiatric diagnosis. This study aimed to investigate DNA methylation in blood cells for associations with a history of perinatal asphyxia, a neurologically harmful condition occurring within the biological environment of birth. We utilized prospective data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway to identify incidents of perinatal asphyxia in 643 individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and 676 healthy controls. We performed an epigenome wide association study to distinguish differentially methylated positions associated with perinatal asphyxia. We found an interaction between methylation and exposure to perinatal asphyxia on case-control status, wherein having a history of perinatal asphyxia was associated with an increase of methylation in healthy controls and a decrease of methylation in patients on 4 regions of DNA important for brain development and function. The differentially methylated regions were observed in genes involved in oligodendrocyte survival and axonal myelination and functional recovery (LINGO3); assembly, maturation and maintenance of the brain (BLCAP;NNAT and NANOS2) and axonal transport processes and neural plasticity (SLC2A14). These findings are consistent with the notion that an opposite epigenetic response to perinatal asphyxia, in patients compared with controls, may contribute to molecular mechanisms of risk for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.© 2024.

Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to identify major independent trait associations.Mutual correlations of dicarbonyls were highly significant, being stronger between MG and GO (ρ = 0.6) than between 3-DG and MG or GO (ρ = 0.4). Significant phenotypic results included associations of all dicarbonyls with sex, waist-to-hip ratio, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and hypertension, of MG and GO with age and C-reactive protein, of GO and 3-DG with glucose and antidiabetics, of MG with contraceptives, of GO with ferritin, and of 3-DG with smoking. RDA revealed GFR, GGT and, in case of 3-DG, glucose as major contributors to dicarbonyl variance. GWAS did not identify genome-wide significant loci. SNPs previously associated with glyoxalase activity did not reach nominal significance.

The stereotypical nature of these changes can be modeled to produce epigenetic clocks capable of predicting chronological age with unprecedented accuracy. Despite the predictive ability of epigenetic clocks and their utility as biomarkers in clinical applications, the underlying processes that produce clock signals are not fully resolved, which limits their interpretability. Here, we develop a computational approach to spatially resolve the within read variability or ""disorder"" in DNA methylation patterns and test if age-associated changes in DNA methylation disorder underlie signals comprising epigenetic clocks. We find that epigenetic clock loci are enriched in regions that both accumulate and lose disorder with age, suggesting a link between DNA methylation disorder and epigenetic clocks. We then develop epigenetic clocks that are based on regional disorder of DNA methylation patterns and compare their performance to other epigenetic clocks by investigating the influences of development, lifespan interventions, and cellular dedifferentiation. We identify common responses as well as critical differences between canonical epigenetic clocks and those based on regional disorder, demonstrating a fundamental decoupling of epigenetic aging processes. Collectively, we identify key linkages between epigenetic disorder and epigenetic clocks and demonstrate the multifaceted nature of epigenetic aging in which stochastic processes occurring at non-random loci produce predictable outcomes.",8.98927863930933e-05

Three independent cancer survivor populations (COG study, BMTSS [Blood or Marrow Transplant Survivor Study] and CCSS [Childhood Cancer Survivor Study]) were used to replicate gene-level associations and examine SNP-level associations from discovery genes using ordinal logistic, conditional logistic, and Cox regression models, respectively.Median age at cancer diagnosis for discovery cases and control subjects was 6 years and 8 years, respectively. Gene-level association forP2RX7(OR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.04-0.27;P = 2.19 × 10-6) was successfully replicated (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.47-0.90;P = 0.009) in the CCSS cohort. Additional signals were identified onTNIK,LRRK2,MEFV,NOBOX, andFBN3. Individual SNPs across all discovery genes, exceptFBN3, were replicated.In our study, SNP sets having 1 or no copies ofP2RX7variant alleles were associated with reduced risk of cardiomyopathy, presenting a potential therapeutic target to mitigate cardiac outcomes in cancer survivors.© 2023 The Authors.",3.8483615942913e-05
38168348,"Lifestyle differences between co-twins are associated with decreased similarity in their internal and external exposome profiles.","medRxiv","Whether differences in lifestyle between co-twins are reflected in differences in their internal or external exposome profiles remains largely underexplored. We therefore investigated whether within-pair differences in lifestyle were associated with within-pair differences in exposome profiles across four domains: the external exposome, proteome, metabolome and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA). For each domain, we assessed the similarity of co-twin profiles using Gaussian similarities in up to 257 young adult same-sex twin pairs (54% monozygotic). We additionally tested whether similarity in one domain translated into greater similarity in another. Results suggest that a lower degree of similarity in co-twins' exposome profiles was associated with greater differences in their behavior and substance use. The strongest association was identified between excessive drinking behavior and the external exposome. Overall, our study demonstrates how social behavior and especially substance use are connected to the internal and external exposomes, while controlling for familial confounders.",2.03158984384056e-05

Our lab demonstrated that SEA is positively associated with the time taken to achieve pregnancy; however, its relationship with semen parameters is unknown. A total of 379 men from the Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and Environment (LIFE) study, a non-clinical cohort, and 192 men seeking fertility treatment from the Sperm Environmental Epigenetics and Development Study (SEEDS) were included in the study. Semen analyses were conducted for both cohorts, and SEA was previously generated using a machine learning algorithm and DNA methylation array data. Association analyses were conducted via multivariable linear regression models adjusting for BMI and smoking status. We found that SEA was not associated with standard semen characteristics in SEEDS and LIFE cohorts. However, SEA was significantly associated with higher sperm head length and perimeter, the presence of pyriform and tapered sperm, and lower sperm elongation factor in the LIFE study (p< 0.05). Based on our results, SEA is mostly associated with defects in sperm head morphological factors that are less commonly evaluated during male infertility assessments. SEA shows promise to be an independent biomarker of sperm quality to assess male fecundity.",1.78575782937745e-05

Here we report a multi-ancestry GWAS of MD, adding data from 21 cohorts with 88,316 MD cases and 902,757 controls to previously reported data. This analysis used a range of measures to define MD and included samples of African (36% of effective sample size), East Asian (26%) and South Asian (6%) ancestry and Hispanic/Latin American participants (32%). The multi-ancestry GWAS identified 53 significantly associated novel loci. For loci from GWAS in European ancestry samples, fewer than expected were transferable to other ancestry groups. Fine mapping benefited from additional sample diversity. A transcriptome-wide association study identified 205 significantly associated novel genes. These findings suggest that, for MD, increasing ancestral and global diversity in genetic studies may be particularly important to ensure discovery of core genes and inform about transferability of findings.© 2024.

To investigate the role of epigenetics and transcriptomics change in asthma, we used publicly available DNAm (asthmatics, n = 96 and controls, n = 46) and gene expression (asthmatics, n = 79 and controls, n = 39) data derived from bronchial epithelial cells (BECs). We performed differential methylation/expression and weighted co-methylation/co-expression network analyses to identify co-methylated and co-expressed modules associated with asthma severity and lung function. For subjects with both DNAm and gene expression data (asthmatics, n = 79 and controls, n = 39), machine-learning technique was used to prioritize CpGs and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for asthma risk prediction, and mediation analysis was used to uncover DEGs that mediate the effect of DNAm on asthma severity and lung function in BECs. Finally, we validated CpGs and their associated DEGs and the asthma risk prediction model in airway epithelial cells (AECs) dataset. The asthma risk prediction model based on 18 CpGs and 28 DEGs showed high accuracy in both the discovery BEC dataset with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.99 and the validation AEC dataset (AUC = 0.82). Genes in the three co-methylated and six co-expressed modules were enriched in multiple pathways including WNT/beta-catenin signaling and notch signaling. Moreover, we identified 35 CpGs correlated with DEGs in BECs, of which 17 CpGs including cg01975495 (SERPINE1), cg10528482 (SLC9A3), cg25477769 (HNF1A) and cg26639146 (CD9), cg17945560 (TINAGL1) and cg10290200 (FLNC) were replicated in AECs. These DEGs mediate the association between DNAm and asthma severity and lung function. Overall, our study investigated the role of DNAm and gene expression change in asthma and provided an insight into the mechanisms underlying the effects of DNA methylation on asthma, asthma severity and lung function.© 2024.

In this regard, intranasal oxytocin (OT) and AVP antagonists present potential treatments for tobacco use disorder (TUD). Since transcription of both hormones is also regulated by gene methylation, we hypothesized sex-specific changes in methylation levels of the AVP, OT, and OT receptor (OXTR) gene during nicotine withdrawal.The study population consisted of 49 smokers (29 males, 20 females) and 51 healthy non-smokers (25 males, 26 females). Blood was drawn at day 1, day 7, and day 14 of smoking cessation. Craving was assessed with the questionnaire on smoking urges (QSU).Throughout cessation, mean methylation of the OT promoter gene increased in males and decreased in females. OXTR receptor methylation decreased in females, while in males it was significantly lower at day 7. Regarding the AVP promoter, mean methylation increased in males while there were no changes in females. Using mixed linear modeling, CpG position, time point, sex, and the interaction of time point and sex as well as time point, sex, and QSU had a significant fixed effect on OT and AVP gene methylation. The interaction effect suggests that sex, time point, and QSU are interrelated, meaning that, depending on the sex, methylation could be different at different time points and vice versa. There was no significant effect of QSU on mean OXTR methylation.We identified differences at specific CpGs between controls and smokers in OT and AVP and in overall methylation of the AVP gene. Furthermore, we found sex-specific changes in mean methylation levels of the mentioned genes throughout smoking cessation, underlining the relevance of sex in the OT and vasopressin system. This is the first study on epigenetic regulation of the OT promoter in TUD. Our results have implications for research on the utility of the AVP and OT system for treating substance craving. Future studies on both targets need to analyze their effect in the context of sex, social factors, and gene regulation.© 2024 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.",1.17727406561015e-05

The mechanisms by which these effects are transmitted across generations need to be further investigated. Here, we examined transgenerational alterations of brain and testis DNA methylation profiles paternally inherited from grandfathers developmentally exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration of linuron. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) revealed numerous differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in brain (3060 DMRs) and testis (2551 DMRs) of the adult male F2 generation. Key genes in the brain involved in somatotropic (igfbp4) and thyrotropic signaling (dio1 and tg) were differentially methylated and correlated with phenotypical alterations in body size, weight, hind limb length and plasma glucose levels, indicating that methylation levels could be potential mediators of the transgenerational effects of linuron. Testis DMRs were found in genes essential for spermatogenesis, meiosis and germ cell development (piwil1, spo11 and tdrd9) and their methylation levels were correlated with the number of germ cells nests per seminiferous tubule, an endpoint of disrupted spermatogenesis. DMRs were also identified in several genes central for the machinery that regulates the epigenetic landscape including DNA methylation (dnmt3a and mbd2) and histone acetylation (hdac8, ep300, elp3, kat5 and kat14), which may at least partly drive the linuron-induced transgenerational effects. The results from this genome-wide DNA methylation profiling contribute to better understanding potential mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in amphibians.Copyright © 2024.

Here, we modeled longitudinal height growth with Super-Imposition by Translation And Rotation (SITAR) growth curve analysis on ~ 56,000 trans-ancestry samples with repeated height measurements from age 5 years to adulthood. We performed genetic analysis on six phenotypes representing the magnitude, timing, and intensity of the pubertal growth spurt. To investigate the lifelong impact of genetic variants associated with pubertal growth trajectories, we performed genetic correlation analyses and phenome-wide association studies in the Penn Medicine BioBank and the UK Biobank.Large-scale growth modeling enables an unprecedented view of adolescent growth across contemporary and 20th-century pediatric cohorts. We identify 26 genome-wide significant loci and leverage trans-ancestry data to perform fine-mapping. Our data reveals genetic relationships between pediatric height growth and health across the life course, with different growth trajectories correlated with different outcomes. For instance, a faster tempo of pubertal growth correlates with higher bone mineral density, HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, type 2 diabetes, and lung cancer, whereas being taller at early puberty, taller across puberty, and having quicker pubertal growth were associated with higher risk for atrial fibrillation.We report novel genetic associations with the tempo of pubertal growth and find that genetic determinants of growth are correlated with reproductive, glycemic, respiratory, and cardiac traits in adulthood. These results aid in identifying specific growth trajectories impacting lifelong health and show that there may not be a single ""optimal"" pubertal growth pattern.© 2023.

Differences in genetic susceptibility mechanisms may contribute to this disparity.To gain insights into the regulatory mechanisms of PCa susceptibility variants, we tested the association between SNPs and DNA methylation (DNAm) at nearby CpG sites across the genome in benign and cancer prostate tissue from 75 AA and 75 EA men. Genome-wide SNP data (from benign tissue) and DNAm were generated using Illumina arrays.Among AA men, we identified 6,298 and 2,641 cis-meQTLs (FDR of 0.05) in benign and tumor tissue, respectively, with 6,960 and 1,700 detected in EA men. We leveraged GWAS summary statistics to identify previously reported PCa GWAS signals likely to share a common causal variant with a detected meQTL. We identified 9 GWAS-meQTL pairs with strong evidence of co-localization (4 in EA benign, 3 in EA tumor, 2 in AA benign, and 3 in AA tumor). Among these co-localized GWAS-meQTL pairs, we identified co-localizing eQTLs impacting four eGenes with known roles in tumorigenesis.These findings highlight epigenetic regulatory mechanisms by which PCa-risk SNPs can modify local DNAm and/or gene expression in prostate tissue.Overall, our findings showed general consistency in the meQTL landscape of AA and EA men, but meQTLs often differ by tissue type (normal vs. cancer). Ancestry-based LD differences and lack of AA representation in GWAS decrease statistical power to detect co-localization for some regions.",7.78631144955099e-06

We conducted genome-wide methylation analyses using 2,021 samples in blood (91 AD cases, 329 mild cognitive impairment, 1,391 controls) and 697 samples in brain (417 AD cases, 280 controls). We identified differentially methylated levels in AD compared to controls in an APOE genotype-specific manner at 25 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in brain and 36 CpG sites in blood. Additionally, we identified seven CpG sites in the APOE region containing TOMM40, APOE, and APOC1 genes with P < 5 × 10-8between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers in brain or blood. In brain, the most significant CpG site hypomethylated in ε4 carriers compared to non-carriers was from the TOMM40 in the total sample, while most of the evidence was derived from AD cases. However, the CpG site was not significantly modulating expression of these three genes in brain. Three CpG sites from the APOE were hypermethylated in APOE ε4 carriers in brain or blood compared in ε4 non-carriers and nominally significant with APOE expression in brain. Three CpG sites from the APOC1 were hypermethylated in blood, which one of the 3 CpG sites significantly lowered APOC1 expression in blood using all subjects or ε4 non-carriers. Co-methylation network analysis in blood and brain detected eight methylation networks associated with AD and APOE ε4 status. Five of the eight networks included genes containing network CpGs that were significantly enriched for estradiol perturbation, where four of the five networks were enriched for the estrogen response pathway. Our findings provide further evidence of the role of APOE genotype on methylation levels associated with AD, especially linked to estrogen response pathway.© 2024.

GWASs of these six SHSs identify 28 significant novel loci adjusting for multiple testing on six traits (p<8.3e-9), along with 341 previously reported loci (p<5e-08). The heritability of the first three SHS-PCs equals or exceeds that of SHS-ADD (SNP-h2=0.094), while revealing sleep-domain-specific genetic discoveries.

38212375,"Placental transcriptomic signatures of prenatal and preconceptional maternal stress.","Mol Psychiatry","Prenatal exposure to maternal psychological stress is associated with increased risk for adverse birth and child health outcomes. Accumulating evidence suggests that preconceptional maternal stress may also be transmitted intergenerationally to negatively impact offspring. However, understanding of mechanisms linking these exposures to offspring outcomes, particularly those related to placenta, is limited. Using RNA sequencing, we identified placental transcriptomic signatures associated with maternal prenatal stressful life events (SLEs) and childhood traumatic events (CTEs) in 1 029 mother-child pairs in two birth cohorts from Washington state and Memphis, Tennessee. We evaluated individual gene-SLE/CTE associations and performed an ensemble of gene set enrichment analyses combing across 11 popular enrichment methods. Higher number of prenatal SLEs was significantly (FDR < 0.05) associated with increased expression of ADGRG6, a placental tissue-specific gene critical in placental remodeling, and decreased expression of RAB11FIP3, an endocytosis and endocytic recycling gene, and SMYD5, a histone methyltransferase. Prenatal SLEs and maternal CTEs were associated with gene sets related to several biological pathways, including upregulation of protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, protein secretion, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, and down regulation of ribosome, epithelial mesenchymal transition, DNA repair, MYC targets, and amino acid-related pathways. The directional associations in these pathways corroborate prior non-transcriptomic mechanistic studies of psychological stress and mental health disorders, and have previously been implicated in pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes. Accordingly, our findings suggest that maternal exposure to psychosocial stressors during pregnancy as well as the mother's childhood may disrupt placental function, which may ultimately contribute to adverse pregnancy, birth, and child health outcomes.© 2024.

We aim to develop an explainable predictive model, using machine learning and population-based cohort data, for this purpose.Data were from 8858 participants in the Growing Up in Ireland cohort, a nationally representative study of infants and their primary caregivers (PCGs). Maternal, infant, and socioeconomic characteristics were collected at 9-months and cognitive ability measured at age 5 years. Data preprocessing, synthetic minority oversampling, and feature selection were performed prior to training a variety of machine learning models using ten-fold cross validated grid search to tune hyperparameters. Final models were tested on an unseen test set.A random forest (RF) model containing 15 participant-reported features in the first year of infant life, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.77 for predicting low cognitive ability at age 5. This model could detect 72% of infants with low cognitive ability, with a specificity of 66%.Model performance would need to be improved before consideration as a population-level screening tool. However, this is a first step towards early, individual, risk stratification to allow targeted childhood screening.This study is among the first to investigate whether machine learning methods can be used at a population-level to predict which infants are at high risk of low cognitive ability in childhood. A random forest model using 15 features which could be easily collected in the perinatal period achieved an AUROC of 0.77 for predicting low cognitive ability.

We examined whether a genome-wide polygenic score for BMI was associated with weight loss effectiveness and aimed to identify common genetic variants associated with weight loss.Participants in the ONTIME study (n = 1210) followed a uniform, multimodal behavioral weight-loss intervention. We first tested associations between a genome-wide polygenic score for higher BMI and weight loss effectiveness (total weight loss, rate of weight loss, and attrition). We then conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for weight loss in the ONTIME study and performed the largest weight loss meta-analysis with earlier studies (n = 3056). Lastly, we ran exploratory GWAS in the ONTIME study for other weight loss outcomes and related factors.We found that each standard deviation increment in the polygenic score was associated with a decrease in the rate of weight loss Beta (95% CI) = -0.04 (-0.06, -0.01; P = 3.7×10-03) and with higher attrition after adjusting by treatment duration.

By leveraging large-scale GWAS summary of ECG and IHD (downloaded from FinnGen database), we performed LD score regression (LDSC), Mendelian randomization (MR), and polygenic risk score (PRS) regression to explore genetic relationships between IHD and ECG. Finally, we constructed an XGBoost model to predict IHD by integrating PRS and ECG. The GWAS identified 114 independent SNPs significantly (P value < 5 × 10-8/800, where 800 denotes the number of ECG features) associated with ECG. LDSC analysis indicated significant (P value < 0.05) genetic correlations between 39 ECG features and IHD.

Using TIME-seq, we applied multi-tissue and tissue-specific epigenetic clocks in over 1,800 mouse DNA samples from eight tissue and cell types. We show that TIME-seq clocks are accurate and robust, enriched for polycomb repressive complex 2-regulated loci, and benchmark favorably against conventional methods despite being up to 100-fold less expensive. Using dietary treatments and gene therapy, we find that TIME-seq clocks reflect diverse interventions in multiple tissues. Finally, we develop an economical human blood clock (R > 0.96, median error = 3.39 years) in 1,056 demographically representative individuals. These methods will enable more efficient epigenetic clock measurement in larger-scale human and animal studies.© 2024.

We performed a sex-stratified cross-ancestry X-chromosome-wide association meta-analysis of seven kidney-related traits (n = 908,697), identifying 23 loci genome-wide significantly associated with two of the traits: 7 for uric acid and 16 for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), including four novel eGFR loci containing the functionally plausible prioritized genes ACSL4, CLDN2, TSPAN6 and the female-specific DRP2. Further, we identified five novel sex-interactions, comprising male-specific effects at FAM9B and AR/EDA2R, and three sex-differential findings with larger genetic effect sizes in males at DCAF12L1 and MST4 and larger effect sizes in females at HPRT1. All prioritized genes in loci showing significant sex-interactions were located next to androgen response elements (ARE). Five ARE genes showed sex-differential expressions. This study contributes new insights into sex-dimorphisms of kidney traits along with new prioritized gene targets for further molecular research.© 2024. The Author(s).",5.52571250637615e-07

Using a large proteomic cohort in the UK Biobank (UKB), we aimed to develop a proteomic aging clock for all-cause mortality risk as a proxy of biological age (BA).Participants in the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB PPP) were included with ages between 39 and 70 years (n=53,021). Data were split into a training (70%, n=37,115) and a test set (30%, n=15,906), including 2,923 plasma proteins assessed using the Olink Explore 3072 assay®. We developed a proteomic aging clock (PAC) for all-cause mortality risk as a surrogate of BA using a combination of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized Cox regression and Gompertz proportional hazards models. The validation for PAC included assessing its age-adjusted associations with, and predictions for all-cause mortality and 18 incident diseases, and head-to-head comparisons with two biological age measures (PhenoAge and BioAge) and leukocyte telomere length (LTL). Additionally, a functional analysis was performed to identify gene sets and tissues enriched with genes associated with BA deviation, based on different BA measures.The Spearman correlation between PAC proteomic age and chronological age was 0.76. 10.9% of the combined training and test samples died during a mean follow-up of 13.3 years (SD=2.2), with the mean age at death 70.1 years (SD=8.1). PAC proteomic age, after controlling for age and other covariates, showed stronger associations than PhenoAge, BioAge, and LTL, with mortality and multiple incident diseases in the test set sample and in disease-free participants, such as mortality, heart failure, pneumonia, delirium, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and dementia. Additionally, PAC proteomic age showed higher predictive power for the conditions above compared to chronological age, PhenoAge, and BioAge, based on Harrell's C-statistics. Proteins associated with PAC proteomic age deviation (from chronological age) are enriched in various hallmarks of biological aging, including immunoinflammatory responses, cellular senescence, extracellular matrix remodeling, cellular response to stressors, and vascular biology.PAC showed robust age-adjusted associations and predictions for all-cause mortality and the onset of various diseases. The diverse hallmark gene sets linked with PAC proteomic age deviation highlight the potential efficacy of geroscience-guided interventions. Further validation is essential to ascertain the use of PAC across different settings.",4.91819994212162e-07

However, due to the lack of large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies, most of the existing research focused on the cross-sectional changes of brain aging. In this investigation, we present a data-driven approach that incorporate both cross-sectional changes and longitudinal trajectories of structural brain aging and identified two brain aging patterns among 37,013 healthy participants from UK Biobank. Participants with accelerated brain aging also demonstrated accelerated biological aging, cognitive decline and increased genetic susceptibilities to major neuropsychiatric disorders. Further, by integrating longitudinal neuroimaging studies from a multi-center adolescent cohort, we validated the ""last in, first out"" mirroring hypothesis and identified brain regions with manifested mirroring patterns between brain aging and brain development.

38293167,"Uncovering the genetic architecture and evolutionary roots of androgenetic alopecia in African men.","bioRxiv","Androgenetic alopecia is a highly heritable trait. However, much of our understanding about the genetics of male pattern baldness comes from individuals of European descent. Here, we examined a novel dataset comprising 2,136 men from Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa that were genotyped using a custom array. We first tested how genetic predictions of baldness generalize from Europe to Africa, finding that polygenic scores from European GWAS yielded AUC statistics that ranged from 0.513 to 0.546, indicating that genetic predictions of baldness in African populations performed notably worse than in European populations. Subsequently, we conducted the first African GWAS of androgenetic alopecia, focusing on self-reported baldness patterns at age 45. After correcting for present age, population structure, and study site, we identified 266 moderately significant associations, 51 of which were independent (p-value < 10-5, r2< 0.2). Most baldness associations were autosomal, and the X chromosomes does not appear to have a large impact on baldness in African men. Finally, we examined the evolutionary causes of continental differences in genetic architecture. Although Neanderthal alleles have previously been associated with skin and hair phenotypes, we did not find evidence that European-ascertained baldness hits were enriched for signatures of ancient introgression. Most loci that are associated with androgenetic alopecia are evolving neutrally. However, multiple baldness-associated SNPs near theEDA2RandARgenes have large allele frequency differences between continents. Collectively, our findings illustrate how evolutionary history contributes to the limited portability of genetic predictions across ancestries.",4.31952335853576e-07

A two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) design was used. Comprehensive evaluation was further conducted, including sensitivity analysis, linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) regression, Steiger test, and metabolic pathway analysis.After multiple testing correction, arachidonate (20:4n6) has been implicated in VAT accumulation (β = 0.35, 95%CI:0.18-0.52, P < 0.001; FDR = 0.025). Additionally, several blood metabolites were identified as potentially having causal relationship (FDR < 0.10). Among them, lysine (β = 0.67, 95%CI: 0.28-1.06, P < 0.001; FDR = 0.074), proline (β = 0.30, 95%CI:0.13-0.48, P < 0.001; FDR = 0.082), valerate (β = 0.50, 95%CI:0.23-0.78, P < 0.001, FDR = 0.091) are associated with an increased risk of VAT accumulation. On the other hand, glycine (β=-0.21, 95%CI: -0.33-0.09), P < 0.001, FDR = 0.076) have a protective effect against VAT accumulation. Most blood metabolites showed consistent trends between different sexes. Multivariable MR analysis demonstrated the effect of genetically predicted arachidonate (20:4n6) and proline on VAT remained after accounting for BMI and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). There is no evidence of heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and reverse causality.Our MR findings suggest that these metabolites may serve as biomarkers, as well as for future mechanistic exploration and drug target selection of visceral obesity.© 2024.

Established DNA variants influence PAH risk, but susceptibility from epigenetic changes is unknown. We addressed this through epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), testing 865,848 CpG sites for association with PAH in 429 individuals with PAH and 1226 controls. Three loci, at Cathepsin Z (CTSZ, cg04917472), Conserved oligomeric Golgi complex 6 (COG6, cg27396197), and Zinc Finger Protein 678 (ZNF678, cg03144189), reached epigenome-wide significance (p < 10-7) and are hypermethylated in PAH, including in individuals with PAH at 1-year follow-up. Of 16 established PAH genes, only cg10976975 in BMP10 shows hypermethylation in PAH. Hypermethylation at CTSZ is associated with decreased blood cathepsin Z mRNA levels. Knockdown of CTSZ expression in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells increases caspase-3/7 activity (p < 10-4).

The plasma folic acid level of the selected patients was measured in the booking visit by automated chemiluminescence assay. The cutoff levels of folic acid were taken at 8.6 ng/mL. Based on these values, the study population was divided into two groups, one with folic acid values <8.6 ng/mL and the other with values ≥8.6 ng/mL. Plasma Vitamin B12 levels were measured to check for any concurrent deficiencies. Obstetric outcomes included first- and second-trimester miscarriages, development of anemia, gestational hypertension/preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, placental abruption, and intrauterine fetal growth restriction (FGR). Furthermore, the period of gestation at delivery, fetal weights, APGAR scores at 5 min were documented. The study also considered fetal neural tube defects, intrauterine fetal demise for data collection. Collected data were analyzed statistically to find the association of the above-mentioned outcomes with levels of folic acid.The rate of preterm deliveries was significantly higher in the folic acid group with levels <8.6 ng/mL (16.94%). The incidence of small for gestational age/FGR was higher in the folic acid group with levels <8.6 ng/mL (27.11%) compared to the high folic acid group with levels ≥8.6 ng/mL (13.38%). The differences in the incidence of anemia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia between the two groups were not statistically significant and no cases of intrauterine fetal demise or placental abruption were observed in either group. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the relative risk of low Apgar scores at 5 min between the two groups.The present study suggests that low folic acid levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as anemia, miscarriages, preterm delivery, and FGR. Therefore, adherence to nutritional recommendation of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy is essential to prevent these adverse outcomes.Copyright: © 2023 Tzu Chi Medical Journal.",1.16894664213257e-07

Epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation could functionally contribute to organismal aging, however the key functions and biological processes may govern ageing are still not understood. Although age predictors called epigenetic clocks can accurately estimate the biological age of an individual based on cellular DNA methylation, their models have limited ability to explain the prediction algorithm behind and underlying key biological processes controlling ageing. Here we present XAI-AGE, a biologically informed, explainable deep neural network model for accurate biological age prediction across multiple tissue types. We show that XAI-AGE outperforms the first-generation age predictors and achieves similar results to deep learning-based models, while opening up the possibility to infer biologically meaningful insights of the activity of pathways and other abstract biological processes directly from the model.© 2024.

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) can provide new evidence regarding the aetiology of AUD. We report a multi-ancestry GWASs across diverse ancestries focusing on a narrow AUD phenotype, using novel statistical tools in a total sample of 1,041,450 individuals [102,079 cases; European, 75,583; African, 20,689 (mostly African-American); Hispanic American, 3,449; East Asian, 2,254; South Asian, 104; descent]. Cross-ancestry functional analyses were performed with European and African samples. Thirty-seven genome-wide significant loci were identified, of which seven were novel for AUD and six for other alcohol phenotypes. Loci were mapped to genes enriched for brain regions relevant for AUD (striatum, hypothalamus, and prefrontal cortex) and potential drug targets (GABAergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons). African-specific analysis yielded a unique pattern of immune-related gene sets. Polygenic overlap and positive genetic correlations showed extensive shared genetic architecture between AUD and both mental and general medical phenotypes, suggesting they are not only complications of alcohol use but also share genetic liability with AUD. Leveraging a cross-ancestry approach allowed identification of novel genetic loci for AUD and underscores the value of multi-ancestry genetic studies.

Apart from the classic covariates of stunting, which include diet and illness, the relative contribution of household air pollution to chronic nutrition conditions is least studied. Hence, this study is conducted to investigate the impact of household air pollution on the linear growth of under-five children in Jimma town, Ethiopia.A prospective cohort study was employed to collect data from 280 under-five children who lived in households using solid fuel (exposed group, n = 140) and clean fuel (unexposed group, n = 140). Height-for-age Z scores were compared in both groups over a 12-month follow-up period. The difference in differences estimators were used for comparison of changes in the height-for-age Z scores from baseline to end line in exposed and non-exposed groups. The independent effect of the use of solid fuels on height-for-age Z scores was analyzed through a multivariable linear regression model. Statistical Significances were declared at P < 0.05 and 95% CI level.In an unadjusted model (Model 1), compared with the clean fuel type, the mean difference in the height-for-age Z score of children in households using solid fuel was lower by 0.54 (-0.54, 95% CI -0.97, -0.12, P = 0.011). The beta coefficient remained negative after adjusting for age and sex (Model 2 -0.543, 95% CI -1.373, -0.563) and sociodemographic variables (Model 3: -0.543, 95% CI -1.362, -0.575). In the final model (Model 4), which adjusted for wealth quantile, dietary practice, water, sanitation and hygiene status and household food insecurity access scale, the beta coefficient held the same and significant (beta: -0.543, 95% CI -1.357, -0.579, P < 0.001). Higher HAZ scores were observed among female child (β: = 0.48, 95%CI: 0.28, 0.69), Child with father attended higher education (β: = 0.304 95%CI: 0.304, 95% CI 0.19, 0.41) as compared to male gender and those who did not attend a formal education, respectively. In contrast, child living in households with poor hygiene practices had lower HAZ score (β: -0.226, 95% CI: -0.449, -0.003), P < 0.001.Exposure to indoor air pollution was inversely related to linear growth. Furthermore, sex, educational status and hygiene were found relevant predictors of linear growth. In such a setting, there is a need to step up efforts to design and implement public education campaigns regarding the health risks associated with exposure to household air pollution.

This research aims to examine the connection between genetic and environmental factors across sex, race and ethnicity.Data was obtained from the twin hub of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study at baseline (2016-2018). Variance component models were conducted to dissect the additive genetic (A), common (C) and unique environmental (E) effects on alcohol traits. The proportion of the total alcohol phenotypic variation attributable to additive genetic factors is reported as heritability (h2).The sample (n = 1,772) included an approximately equal male-female distribution. The 886 same-sex twin pairs were 60.4% dizygotic (DZ), 39.6% monozygotic (MZ), 65.4% non-Hispanic Whites, 13.9% non-Hispanic Blacks, 10.8% of Hispanics with a mean age of 121.2 months. Overall, genetic predisposition was moderate for alcohol intent (h2 = 28%, p = .006) and low for alcohol initiation (h2 = 4%, p = 0.83). Hispanics (h2 = 53%, p < .0001) and Blacks (h2 = 48%, p < .0001) demonstrated higher alcohol intent due to additive genetic factors than Whites (h2 = 34%, p < .0001). Common environmental factors explained more variation in alcohol sips in females (c2 = 63%, p = .001) than in males (c2 = 55%, p = .003). Unique environmental factors largely attributed to alcohol intent, while common environmental factors explained the substantial variation in alcohol initiation.Sex and racial/ethnic disparities in genetic and environmental risk factors for susceptibility to alcohol initiation can lead to significant health disparities. Certain populations may be at greater risk for alcohol use due to their genetic and ecological factors at an early age.Copyright: © 2024 Puga et al.

On the other hand, epigenetic status contributes to the inter-individual health status and is associated with COVID-19 severity. Nevertheless, current studies focus only on severe COVID-19. Considering that most of the worldwide population developed mild COVID-19 infection. In the present exploratory study, we aim to analyze the association of mild COVID-19 with epigenetic ages (HorvathAge, HannumAge, GrimAge, PhenoAge, SkinAge, and DNAmTL) and clinical variables obtained from a Mexican cohort of older adults. We found that all epigenetic ages significantly differ from the chronological age, but only GrimAge is elevated. Additionally, both the intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA) and the extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA) are accelerated in all patients. Moreover, we found that immunological estimators and DNA damage were associated with PhenoAge, SkinBloodHorvathAge, and HorvathAge, suggesting that the effects of mild COVID-19 on the epigenetic clocks are mainly associated with inflammation and immunology changes. In conclusion, our results show that the effects of mild COVID-19 on the epigenetic clock are mainly associated with the immune system and an increase in GrimAge, IEAA, and EEAA.© 2024.

The GWAS identified a genome-wide significant locus in TAF3 (p = 2.9 × 10-9) in people with type 2 diabetes. In skeletal muscle, loci located in TAF3 demonstrate an eQTL link to ATP5F1C, a gene that is involved in the formation of Mg2+-ATP. Serum Mg2+levels were associated with MUC1/TRIM46 (p = 2.9 × 10-7), SHROOM3 (p = 4.0 × 10-7), and SLC22A7 (p = 1.0 × 10-6) at nominal significance, which is in combination with the eQTL data suggesting that they are possible candidates for renal failure. Several genetic loci were in agreement with previous genomic studies which identified MUC1/TRIM46 (Pmeta = 6.9 × 10-29, PQ = 0.81) and SHROOM3 (Pmeta = 2.9 × 10-27, PQ = 0.04) to be associated with serum Mg2+in the general population. In conclusion, serum magnesium concentrations are associated with genetic variability around the regions of TAF3, MUC1/TRIM46, SHROOM3, and SLC22A7 in type 2 diabetes.© 2024.

Consequently, polygenic risk scores (PRS) more accurately predict complex traits in Europeans than African Ancestries groups. Very few studies have looked at the transferability of European-derived PRS for behavioural and mental health phenotypes to non-Europeans. We assessed the comparative accuracy of PRS for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) trained on European and African Ancestries GWAS studies to predict MDD and related traits in African Ancestries participants from the UK Biobank.UK Biobank participants were selected based on Principal component analysis (PCA) clustering with an African genetic similarity reference population and MDD was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) were computed using PRSice2 using either European or African Ancestries GWAS summary statistics.PRS trained on European ancestry samples (246,363 cases) predicted case control status in Africans of the UK Biobank with similar accuracies (190 cases, R2=2%) to PRS trained on far much smaller samples of African Ancestries participants from 23andMe, Inc. (5045 cases, R2=1.8%). This suggests that prediction of MDD status from Africans to Africans had greater efficiency per unit increase in the discovery sample size than prediction of MDD from Europeans to Africans. Prediction of MDD status in African UK Biobank participants using GWAS findings of causal risk factors from European ancestries was non-significant.GWAS studies of MDD in European ancestries are an inefficient means of improving polygenic prediction accuracy in African samples.",6.07114738950028e-09

Single-cell technologies enable the profiling of DNAm states at cytosines within the DNA sequence of individual cells, but they often suffer from limited coverage of CpG sites. In this study, we introduce scMeFormer, a transformer-based deep learning model designed to impute DNAm states for each CpG site in single cells. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the superior performance of scMeFormer compared to alternative models across four single-nucleus DNAm datasets generated by distinct technologies. Remarkably, scMeFormer exhibits high-fidelity imputation, even when dealing with significantly reduced coverage, as low as 10% of the original CpG sites. Furthermore, we applied scMeFormer to a single-nucleus DNAm dataset generated from the prefrontal cortex of four schizophrenia patients and four neurotypical controls. This enabled the identification of thousands of differentially methylated regions associated with schizophrenia that would have remained undetectable without imputation and added granularity to our understanding of epigenetic alterations in schizophrenia within specific cell types. Our study highlights the power of deep learning in imputing DNAm states in single cells, and we expect scMeFormer to be a valuable tool for single-cell DNAm studies.",5.58500244267537e-09

The ratio of triglycerides to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG:HDL-C) is a surrogate marker of IR. We conducted a genome-wide association study of the TG:HDL-C ratio in 402,398 Europeans within the UK Biobank. We identified 369 independent SNPs, of which 114 had a false discovery rate-adjusted P value < 0.05 in other genome-wide studies of IR making them high-confidence IR-associated loci. Seventy-two of these 114 loci have not been previously associated with IR. These 114 loci cluster into five groups upon phenome-wide analysis and are enriched for candidate genes important in insulin signaling, adipocyte physiology and protein metabolism. We created a polygenic-risk score from the high-confidence IR-associated loci using 51,550 European individuals in the Michigan Genomics Initiative. We identified associations with diabetes, hyperglyceridemia, hypertension, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and ischemic heart disease.

Inflammatory endotypes (e.g.T2-high (eosinophilic)) may play a key role in asthma exacerbations. We aimed to assess whether genetic susceptibility underlies asthma exacerbation risk and additionally tested for an interaction between genetic variants and eosinophilia on exacerbation risk.UK Biobank data were used to perform a genome-wide association study of individuals with asthma and at least one exacerbation compared to individuals with asthma and no history of exacerbations. Individuals with asthma were identified using self-reported data, hospitalisation data and general practitioner records. Exacerbations were identified as either asthma-related hospitalisation, general practitioner record of asthma exacerbation or an oral corticosteroid burst prescription. A logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, smoking status and genetic ancestryviaprincipal components was used to assess the association between genetic variants and asthma exacerbations. We sought replication for suggestive associations (p<5×10-6) in the GERA cohort.In the UK Biobank, we identified 11 604 cases and 37 890 controls. While no variants reached genome-wide significance (p<5×10-8) in the primary analysis, 116 signals were suggestively significant (p<5×10-6). In GERA, two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs34643691 and rs149721630) replicated (p<0.05), representing signals near the NTRK3 and ABCA13 genes.Our study has identified reproducible associations with asthma exacerbations in the UK Biobank and GERA cohorts.

Utilizing high-resolution metabolomic profiling, we can unveil distinctive age-related patterns that have the potential to predict early CRC development. Our study aims to unearth a panel of aging markers and delve into the metabolomic alterations associated with aging and CRC.Methods:We assembled a serum cohort comprising 5,649 individuals, consisting of 3,002 healthy volunteers, 715 patients diagnosed with colorectal advanced precancerous lesions (APL), and 1,932 CRC patients, to perform a comprehensive metabolomic analysis.Results:We successfully identified unique age-associated patterns across 42 metabolic pathways. Moreover, we established a metabolic aging clock, comprising 9 key metabolites, using an elastic net regularized regression model that accurately estimates chronological age. Notably, we observed significant chronological disparities among the healthy population, APL patients, and CRC patients. By combining the analysis of circulative carcinoembryonic antigen levels with the categorization of individuals into the ""hypo"" metabolic aging subgroup, our blood test demonstrates the ability to detect APL and CRC with positive predictive values of 68.4% (64.3%, 72.2%) and 21.4% (17.8%, 25.9%), respectively.Conclusions:This innovative approach utilizing our metabolic aging clock holds significant promise for accurately assessing biological age and enhancing our capacity to detect APL and CRC.© The author(s).",5.03210404762417e-09

A scoping review was performed using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keyword methods to search PubMed for studies published in English and before 1 August 2022, following our registered protocol. The keyword and MeSH methods identified 12 and 3 records separately, and the keyword-identified records included all from the MeSH. Only three case-control studies met the criteria for the full-text review, including one MeSH-identified record. Increased global levels of 5-hydroxymethylated cytosine (5hmC) in T2DM patients versus healthy controls in blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells were consistently reported (p< 0.05 for all). Among candidate DNA regions related to the humanSOCS3,SREBF1, andTXNIPgenes, only theSOCS3gene yielded higher 5hmC levels in T2DM patients with high poly-ADP-ribosylation than participants combined from those with low PARylation and healthy controls (p< 0.05).

We evaluated the impact that replacing current milk consumption with PBMA would have on iodine intake.We used data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2016-2019) for children (1.5-10 years), girls 11-18 years, and women of reproductive age (WRA). We used a dietary modelling approach with scenarios using brand-level iodine-fortification data (0, 13, 22.5, 27.4 and 45 µg/100 mL). Relative to usual diet, we calculated change in iodine intake, and the proportion with intake below the Lower Reference Nutrient Intake (LRNI) or above the upper limit.For all groups, replacement with PBMA, either unfortified or fortified at the lowest concentration, resulted in a meaningful decrease in iodine intake, and increased the proportion with intake < LRNI; compared to usual diet, iodine intake reduced by 58% in children 1.5-3 years (127 vs. 53 µg/day) and the proportion with intake < LRNI increased in girls (11-18 years; 20% to 48%) and WRA (13% to 33%) if an unfortified PBMA was used. Replacement of milk with PBMA fortified at 27.4 µg/100 mL had the lowest impact.Replacing milk with commercially available PBMAs has potential to reduce population iodine intake, depending on the fortification level. PBMAs fortified with ≥ 22.5 and < 45 µg iodine/100 mL would be required to minimize the impact on iodine intake. Research is needed on the impact of total dairy replacement.© 2024.

The demand for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing has been increasing, and Illumina and MGI are two commonly used sequencing platforms for capture-based mtDNA sequencing. However, there is currently no systematic comparison of mtDNA sequencing performance between these two platforms. To address this gap, we compared the performance of capture-based mtDNA sequencing between Illumina's NovaSeq 6000 and MGI's DNBSEQ-T7 using tissue, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, plasma, and urine samples.Our analysis indicated a high degree of consistency between the two platforms in terms of sequencing quality, GC content, and coverage. In terms of data output, DNBSEQ-T7 showed higher rates of clean data and duplication compared to NovaSeq 6000. Conversely, the amount of mtDNA data obtained by per gigabyte sequencing data was significantly lower in DNBSEQ-T7 compared to NovaSeq 6000. In terms of detection mtDNA copy number, both platforms exhibited good consistency in all sample types. When it comes to detection of mtDNA mutations in tissue, FFPE, and PBMC samples, the two platforms also showed good consistency. However, when detecting mtDNA mutations in plasma and urine samples, significant differenceof themutation number detected was observed between the two platforms. For mtDNA sequencing of plasma and urine samples, a wider range of DNA fragment size distribution was found in NovaSeq 6000 when compared to DNBSEQ-T7. Additionally, two platforms exhibited different characteristics of mtDNA fragment end preference.In summary, the two platforms generally showed good consistency in capture-based mtDNA sequencing. However, it is necessary to consider the data preferences generated by two sequencing platforms when plasma and urine samples were analyzed.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.32569037935791e-09

We aimed to investigate the causal effect of snoring on stroke.Based on 82,339 unrelated individuals with qualified genotyping data of Asian descent from the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB), we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of snoring and stroke. Genetic variants identified in the genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) of snoring in CKB and UK Biobank (UKB) were selected for constructing genetic risk scores (GRS). A two-stage method was applied to estimate the associations of the genetically predicted snoring with stroke and its subtypes. Besides, MR analysis among the non-obese group (body mass index, BMI <24.0 kg/m2), as well as multivariable MR (MVMR), were performed to control for potential pleiotropy from BMI. In addition, the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was applied to estimate the causal association with genetic variants identified in CKB GWAS.Positive associations were found between snoring and total stroke, hemorrhagic stroke (HS), and ischemic stroke (IS). With GRS of CKB, the corresponding HRs (95% CIs) were 1.56 (1.15, 2.12), 1.50 (0.84, 2.69), 2.02 (1.36, 3.01), and the corresponding HRs (95% CIs) using GRS of UKB were 1.78 (1.30, 2.43), 1.94 (1.07, 3.52), and 1.74 (1.16, 2.61).

We aimed to identify actionable druggable targets using Mendelian randomization (MR) and then validate the candidate drugs using population-based analyses.We identified genetic instruments for 1406 actionable targets of approved non-oncological drugs based on gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTL, and pQTL, respectively). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics were obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (122,977 cases, 105,974 controls). We further conducted a nested case-control study using data retrieved from Swedish registers to validate the candidate drugs that were identified from MR analyses.We identified six significant MR associations with gene expression levels (TUBB, MDM2, CSK, ULK3, MC1R and KCNN4) and two significant associations with gene methylation levels across 21 CpG islands (RPS23 and MAPT). Results from the nested case-control study showed that the use of raloxifene (targeting MAPT) was associated with 35% reduced breast cancer risk (odds ratio, OR, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.51-0.83). However, usage of estradiol, tolterodine, and nitrofurantoin (also targeting MAPT) was associated with increased breast cancer risk, with adjusted ORs and 95% CI of 1.10 (1.07-1.13), 1.16 (1.09-1.24), and 1.09 (1.05-1.13), respectively. The effect of raloxifene and nitrofurantoin lost significance in further validation analyses using active-comparator and new-user design.This large-scale MR analysis, combined with population-based validation, identified eight druggable target genes for breast cancer and suggested that raloxifene is an effective chemoprevention against breast cancer.Swedish Research Council, Cancerfonden, Crafoordska Stiftelsen, Allmänna Sjukhusets i Malmö Stiftelsen för bekämpande av cancer, 111 Project and MAS cancer.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Fetal growth peaks in mid-gestation. Here, we explore how genes associated with fetal growth relate to cortical growth. We find that both maternal and fetal genetic variants associated with higher birthweight predict larger cortical surface area. The relative dominance of the maternal vs. fetal variants in these associations show striking variations across birth years (1943 to 1966). The birth-year patterns vary as a function of the epigenetic status near genes differentially methylated in individuals exposed (or not) to famine during the Dutch Winter of 1944/1945. Thus, it appears that the two sets of molecular processes contribute to early cortical development to a different degree in times of food scarcity or its abundance.© 2024.

Integrated analysis uncovered 381 Gene-CpG pairs. GABAAreceptor genes and related pathways, the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway, ABCD1/2 gene activity, and cell signalling processes were overrepresented, providing insight into the underlying biological mechanisms facilitating these associations.

Genetic effects may vary with age (or other characteristics), and not allowing for this in a GWAS might lead to bias. Meta-regression models between study heterogeneity and allows effect modification of the genetic effects to be explored. The aim of this study was to explore the use of meta-analysis and meta-regression for estimating age-varying genetic effects on phenotypes. With simulations we compared the performance of meta-regression to fixed-effect and random -effects meta-analyses in estimating (i) main genetic effects and (ii) age-varying genetic effects (SNP by age interactions) from multiple GWAS studies under a range of scenarios. We applied meta-regression on publicly available summary data to estimate the main and age-varying genetic effects of the FTO SNP rs9939609 on Body Mass Index (BMI). Fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analyses accurately estimated genetic effects when these did not change with age. Meta-regression accurately estimated both main genetic effects and age-varying genetic effects. When the number of studies or the age-diversity between studies was low, meta-regression had limited power. In the applied example, each additional minor allele (A) of rs9939609 was inversely associated with BMI at ages 0 to 3, and positively associated at ages 5.5 to 13. Our findings challenge the assumption that genetic effects are consistent across all ages and provide a method for exploring this.

Empirical research, however, is often based on discrete-time models that assume that sporadic measurement occasions fully capture underlying long-term continuous processes of risk.We propose (i) the functional relevant life course model (fRLM), which treats repeated, discrete measures of risk as unobserved continuous processes, and (ii) a testing procedure to assign probabilities that the data correspond to conceptual models of life course epidemiology (critical period, sensitive period and accumulation models). The performance of the fRLM is evaluated with simulations, and the approach is illustrated with empirical applications relating body mass index (BMI) to mRNA-seq signatures of chronic kidney disease, inflammation and breast cancer.Simulations reveal that fRLM identifies the correct life course model with three to five repeated assessments of risk and 400 subjects. The empirical examples reveal that chronic kidney disease reflects a critical period process and inflammation and breast cancer likely reflect sensitive period mechanisms.The proposed fRLM treats repeated measures of risk as continuous processes and, under realistic data scenarios, the method provides accurate probabilities that the data correspond to commonly studied models of life course epidemiology. fRLM is implemented with publicly-available software.© The Author(s) 2024.

Blood samples were scanned using an Illumina HD 850K microarray, and methylation levels were analysed. Differential methylation sites among the sample groups were screened from the original data, and genes related to suicide were identified. Methylation of the ABI3BP and DPYSL2 genes was detected by pyrophosphate sequencing and statistically analysed. There was a significant difference in age between the low- and middle-risk groups. The results of GO analysis for the suicidal ideation and non-suicidal ideation groups showed that the differential methylation sites were mainly involved in the interferon-γ-mediated signalling pathway, with the main signalling pathways being the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) pathway and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) pathway. There were significant differences in the methylation of ABI3BP, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1, AUTS2, SP3, NINJ2, DPYSL2, and other genes between the suicidal and non-suicidal ideation groups. There was also a statistically significant difference in the gene methylation levels between the two groups. However, there was no significant difference in the degree of methylation of the ABI3BP and DPYSL2 genes between the low- and middle-to-high-risk groups. These results suggest that suicidal ideation is correlated with the methylation levels of differentially methylated genes in children with bipolar disorder. However, the severity of suicide risk in paediatric patients with bipolar disorder may not be correlated with the degree of methylation of the ABI3BP and DPYSL2 genes. Therefore, further validation was required.© 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2.64769675810998e-10

Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched from inception through October, 2023. The I2and Cochran's Q tests were used to assess heterogeneity between studies. Nineteen RCTs (n = 1357 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. Zinc supplementation significantly reduced TG (WMD = - 17.41 mg/dL; 95% CI: - 22.60, - 12.22; P < 0.001), TC (WMD: - 19.60 mg/dL; 95% CI: - 28.46, - 10.73, P < 0.001), LDL-C (WMD = - 8.80 mg/dL; 95% CI: - 14.80, - 2.81; P = 0.004), and BMI (WMD = - 0.53 kg/m2; 95% CI: - 1.05, - 0.01; P = 0.046) but not BW (WMD: - 0.51 kg, 95 % CI: - 1.99, 0.97, P = 0.498). Moreover, zinc supplementation increased HDL-C (WMD = 4.82 mg/dL; 95% CI: 0.88, 8.76; P = 0.016) in patients with T2DM. Our results propose that zinc supplementation may be an effective strategy for improving lipid profile and body composition in patients with T2DM.© 2024.

The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (ABCD), taken over 22 US sites, provides data to characterize the heritability of subcortical structures in adolescence. In ABCD, site-specific effects co-occur with genetic effects which can bias heritability estimates. Existing methods adjusting for site effects require additional steps to adjust for site effects and can lead to inconsistent estimation. We propose a random-effect model-based method of moments approach that is a single step estimator and is a theoretically consistent estimator even when sites are imbalanced and performs well under simulations. We compare methods on rSBVs from ABCD. The proposed approach yielded heritability estimates similar to previous results derived from single-site studies.

In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of BD and SZ genetic liabilities on SA, also considering the contribution of behavioral traits, socioeconomic factors, and substance use disorders. Leveraging large-scale genome-wide association data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) and the UK Biobank (UKB), we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the putative causal effect of BD (41,917 cases, 371,549 controls) and SZ (53,386 cases, 77,258 controls) on SA (26,590 cases, 492,022 controls). Then, we assessed the putative causal effect of BD and SZ on behavioral traits, socioeconomic factors, and substance use disorders. Considering the associations identified, we evaluated the direct causal effect of behavioral traits, socioeconomic factors, and substance use disorders on SA using a multivariable MR approach. The genetic liabilities to BD and SZ were associated with higher odds of SA (BD odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, p = 3.88 × 10-12; SZ OR = 1.09, p = 2.44 × 10-20). However, while the effect of mental distress (OR = 1.17, p = 1.02 × 10-4) and risk-taking (OR = 1.52, p = 0.028) on SA was independent of SZ genetic liability, the BD-SA relationship appeared to account for the effect of these risk factors. Similarly, the association with loneliness on SA was null after accounting for the effect of SZ genetic liability. These findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic risk of psychiatric disorders and behavioral traits in the context of SA, suggesting the need for a comprehensive mental health assessment for high-risk individuals.© 2024.

This study aims to identify the key proteins and gain insights into SA pathogenesis. We integrated data from the brain proteome (N = 376) and blood proteome (N = 35,559) and combined it with the largest SA GWAS summary statistics to date (N = 518,612). A comprehensive set of methods was employed, including Mendelian randomization (MR), Steiger filtering, Bayesian colocalization, proteome‑wide association studies (PWAS), transcript-levels, cell-type specificity, correlation, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Validation was performed using other protein datasets and the SA dataset from FinnGen study. We identified ten proteins (GLRX5, GMPPB, B3GALTL, FUCA2, TTLL12, ADCK1, MMAA, HIBADH, ACP1, DOC2A) associated with SA in brain proteomics. GLRX5, GMPPB, and FUCA2 showed strong colocalization evidence and were supported by PWAS and transcript-level analysis, and were predominantly expressed in glutamatergic neuronal cells. In blood proteomics, one significant protein (PEAR1) and three near-significant proteins (NDE1, EVA1C, B4GALT2) were identified, but lacked colocalization evidence. Moreover, despite the limited correlation between the same protein in brain and blood, the PPI network analysis provided new insights into the interaction between brain and blood in SA. Furthermore, GLRX5 was associated with the GSTP1, the target of Clozapine. The comprehensive analysis provides strong evidence supporting a causal association between three genetically determined brain proteins (GLRX5, GMPPB, and FUCA2) with SA. These findings offer valuable insights into SA's underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.66904253879779e-10

Although AD affects millions of infants worldwide, prenatal and postnatal risk factors, and their association with the development of food allergies later on, are not fully elucidated. This study seeks to investigate AD epidemiology in infancy and its risk factors, examining early-life factors (both prenatal and postnatal) that could contribute to the later development of food allergies.Between January 2019 and December 2019, 501 infants were included in this prospective cohort study. Longitudinal data collection was performed through maternal interviews, the first one conducted within three days after the delivery and the second within 24 to 36 months after the delivery, encompassing variables such as demographics, family history of atopy, maternal smoking, antibiotic use during pregnancy, the mode of delivery, breastfeeding history, food practices, and greenness exposure within 3 days from delivery, while they were still in the hospital.Maternal smoking during pregnancy (p= 0.001) and an older sibling atopy history (p= 0.03) was significantly linked to AD incidence. Cesarean section delivery (p= 0.04) was associated with a higher risk of food allergies in infants with AD. Having a garden at home correlated with a higher likelihood of AD (p= 0.01), and food elimination without medical guidance (p= 0.02) due to AD correlated with an elevated risk of food allergies.Encouraging timely allergenic food introduction while promoting dietary diversity, rich in plant-based foods, maternal smoking cessation, and professional dietary guidance may help minimize AD and food allergy risk. Future studies should address the role of greenness in the development of AD and food allergies.",1.63680797803421e-10
38279041,"Adjusting for genetic confounders in transcriptome-wide association studies improves discovery of risk genes of complex traits.","Nat Genet","Many methods have been developed to leverage expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to nominate candidate genes from genome-wide association studies. These methods, including colocalization, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and Mendelian randomization-based methods; however, all suffer from a key problem-when assessing the role of a gene in a trait using its eQTLs, nearby variants and genetic components of other genes' expression may be correlated with these eQTLs and have direct effects on the trait, acting as potential confounders. Our extensive simulations showed that existing methods fail to account for these 'genetic confounders', resulting in severe inflation of false positives. Our new method, causal-TWAS (cTWAS), borrows ideas from statistical fine-mapping and allows us to adjust all genetic confounders. cTWAS showed calibrated false discovery rates in simulations, and its application on several common traits discovered new candidate genes. In conclusion, cTWAS provides a robust statistical framework for gene discovery.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.46239136132582e-10

Since epigenetic mechanisms are suspected to contribute to the multifactorial pathogenesis of CD, we studied CpG methylation at the CDH1 locus. The methylation of the CpG island (CGI) and of the 1st enhancer, two critical regulatory positions, was quantified in surgical specimens of inflamed ileal mucosa and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 21 CD patients. Sixteen patients operated on for a non-inflammatory bowel disease, although not normal controls, provided a macroscopically normal ileal mucosa and PBMC for comparison.In ileal mucosa, 19/21 (90%) CD patients vs 8/16 control patients (50%) (p < 0.01) had a methylated CDH1 promoter CGI. In PBMC, CD patients with methylated CGI were 11/21 (52%) vs 7/16 controls (44%), respectively. Methylation in the 1st enhancer of CDH1 was also higher in the CD group for each of the studied CpGs and for their average value (45 ± 17% in CD patients vs 36 ± 17% in controls; p < 0.001). Again, methylation was comparable in PBMC. Methylation of CGI and 1st enhancer were not correlated in mucosa or PBMC.Methylation of several CpGs at the CDH1 locus was increased in the inflamed ileal mucosa, not in the PBMC, of CD patients, suggesting the association of CDH1 methylation with ileal inflammation. Longitudinal studies will explore if this increased methylation is a risk marker for colorectal cancer.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.28166865066047e-10

38184855,"Genetic and brain similarity independently predict childhood anthropometrics and neighborhood socioeconomic conditions.","Dev Cogn Neurosci","Linking the developing brain with individual differences in clinical and demographic traits is challenging due to the substantial interindividual heterogeneity of brain anatomy and organization. Here we employ an integrative approach that parses individual differences in both cortical thickness and common genetic variants, and assess their effects on a wide set of childhood traits. The approach uses a linear mixed model framework to obtain the unique effects of each type of similarity, as well as their covariance. We employ this approach in a sample of 7760 unrelated children in the ABCD cohort baseline sample (mean age 9.9, 46.8% female). In general, associations between cortical thickness similarity and traits were limited to anthropometrics such as height, weight, and birth weight, as well as a marker of neighborhood socioeconomic conditions. Common genetic variants explained significant proportions of variance across nearly all included outcomes, although estimates were somewhat lower than previous reports. No significant covariance of the effects of genetic and cortical thickness similarity was found. The present findings highlight the connection between anthropometrics as well as neighborhood socioeconomic conditions and the developing brain, which appear to be independent from individual differences in common genetic variants in this population-based sample.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

The placenta forms mainly from fetal tissue and therefore has the same biological sex as the fetus it supports. Extensive research has delved into the placenta's involvement in pregnancy complications and future offspring development, with a notable emphasis on exploring sex-specific disparities. However, despite these investigations, sex-based disparities in epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) and transcriptomic features of the late-gestation mouse placenta remain largely unknown.We collected male and female mouse placentas at late gestation (E18.5, n = 3/sex) and performed next-generation sequencing to identify genome-wide sex differences in transcription and DNA methylation.Our comparison between male and female revealed 358 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on autosomes, which were associated with signaling pathways involved in transmembrane transport and the responses to viruses and external stimuli. X chromosome DEGs (n = 39) were associated with different pathways, including those regulating chromatin modification and small GTPase-mediated signal transduction. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were more common on the X chromosomes (n = 3756) than on autosomes (n = 1705). Interestingly, while most X chromosome DMRs had higher DNA methylation levels in female placentas and tended to be included in CpG dinucleotide-rich regions, 73% of autosomal DMRs had higher methylation levels in male placentas and were distant from CpG-rich regions. Several DEGs were correlated with DMRs. A subset of the DMRs present in late-stage placentas were already established in mid-gestation (E10.5) placentas (n = 348 DMRs on X chromosome and 19 DMRs on autosomes), while others were acquired later in placental development.Our study provides comprehensive lists of DEGs and DMRs between male and female that collectively cause profound differences in the DNA methylation and gene expression profiles of late-gestation mouse placentas. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating sex-specific analyses into epigenetic and transcription studies to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of their conclusions and help address the significant knowledge gap regarding how sex differences influence placental function.© 2024.

However, the causal role of the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene, which play a key role in regulating omega-3 fatty acids biosynthesis, on cognitive function is unclear. Hence, we used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the gene-specific causal effect of omega-3 fatty acids (N = 114,999) on cognitive function (N = 300,486). Tissue- and cell type-specific effects of FADS1/FADS2 expression on cognitive function were estimated using brain tissue cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) datasets (GTEx, N ≤ 209; MetaBrain, N ≤ 8,613) and single cell cis-eQTL data (N = 373), respectively. These causal effects were further evaluated in whole blood cis-eQTL data (N ≤ 31,684). A series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to validate MR assumptions. Leave-one-out MR showed a FADS gene-specific effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cognitive function [β = -1.3 × 10-2, 95% confidence interval (CI) (-2.2 × 10-2, -5 × 10-3), P = 2 × 10-3]. Tissue-specific MR showed an effect of increased FADS1 expression in cerebellar hemisphere and FADS2 expression in nucleus accumbens basal ganglia on maintaining cognitive function, while decreased FADS1 expression in nine brain tissues on maintaining cognitive function [colocalization probability (PP.H4) ranged from 71.7% to 100.0%]. Cell type-specific MR showed decreased FADS1/FADS2 expression in oligodendrocyte was associated with maintaining cognitive function (PP.H4 = 82.3%, respectively). Increased FADS1/FADS2 expression in whole blood showed an effect on cognitive function maintenance (PP.H4 = 86.6% and 88.4%, respectively). This study revealed putative causal effect of FADS1/FADS2 expression in brain tissues and blood on cognitive function.

Although they are revealed to accumulate mutations after the zygote splits, discriminating between twin genomes remains a formidable challenge in the field of forensic genetics. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) are responsible for a substantial portion of genetic variation, thus potentially serving as promising biomarkers for the identification of MZ twins. In this study, we sequenced the whole genome of a pair of female MZ twins when they were 27 and 33 years old to approximately 30 × coverage using peripheral blood on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System. Potentially discordant SNVs supported by whole-genome sequencing were validated extensively by amplicon-based targeted deep sequencing and Sanger sequencing. In total, we found nine bona fide post-twinning SNVs, all of which were identified in the younger genomes and found in the older genomes. None of the SNVs occurred within coding exons, three of which were observed in introns, supported by whole-exome sequencing results. A double-blind test was employed, and the reliability of MZ twin discrimination by discordant SNVs was endorsed. All SNVs were successfully detected when input DNA amounts decreased to 0.25 ng, and reliable detection was limited to seven SNVs below 0.075 ng input. This comprehensive analysis confirms that SNVs could serve as cost-effective biomarkers for MZ twin discrimination.© 2024.

However, few studies have investigated plausible environmental risk factors for CHIP such as radon, despite the climate-related increases in and documented infrequency of testing for this common indoor air pollutant.The purpose of this study was to estimate the risk of CHIP related to radon, an established environmental mutagen.We linked geocoded addresses of 10,799 Women's Health Initiative Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (WHI TOPMed) participants to US Environmental Protection Agency-predicted, county-level, indoor average screening radon concentrations, categorized as follows: Zone 1 (>4 pCi/L), Zone 2 (2-4 pCi/L), and Zone 3 (<2 pCi/L). We defined CHIP as the presence of one or more leukemogenic driver mutations with variant allele frequency >0.02. We identified prevalent and incident ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes; subtyped ischemic stroke using Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria; and then estimated radon-related risk of CHIP as an odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI using multivariable-adjusted, design-weighted logistic regression stratified by age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, and stroke type/subtype.The percentages of participants with CHIP in Zones 1, 2, and 3 were 9.0%, 8.4%, and 7.7%, respectively (ptrend= 0.06). Among participants with ischemic stroke, Zones 2 and 1 were associated with higher estimated risks of CHIP relative to Zone 3: 1.39 (1.15-1.68) and 1.46 (1.15-1.87), but not among participants with hemorrhagic stroke: 0.98 (0.68-1.40) and 1.03 (0.70-1.52), or without stroke: 1.04 (0.74-1.46) and 0.95 (0.63-1.42), respectively (pinteraction= 0.03). Corresponding estimates were particularly high among TOAST-subtyped cardioembolism: 1.78 (1.30-2.47) and 1.88 (1.31-2.72), or other ischemic etiologies: 1.37 (1.06-1.78) and 1.50 (1.11-2.04), but not small vessel occlusion: 1.05 (0.74-1.49) and 1.00 (0.68-1.47), respectively (pinteraction= 0.10). Observed patterns of association among strata were insensitive to attrition weighting, ancestry adjustment, prevalent stroke exclusion, separate analysis ofDNMT3Adriver mutations, and substitution with 3 alternative estimates of radon exposure.The robust elevation of radon-related risk of CHIP among postmenopausal women who develop incident cardioembolic stroke is consistent with a potential role of somatic genomic mutation in this societally burdensome form of cerebrovascular disease, although the mechanism has yet to be confirmed.",1.6580569017237e-11

There is interest in understanding the extent to which these relationships are causal, and to what extent shared genetic factors play a role. We explored the relationships between schizophrenia (Scz), cannabis use disorder (CanUD), and ever-regular tobacco smoking (Smk) using the largest available genome-wide studies of these phenotypes in individuals of African and European ancestries. All three phenotypes were positively genetically correlated (rgs = 0.17 - 0.62). Causal inference analyses suggested the presence of horizontal pleiotropy, but evidence for bidirectional causal relationships was also found between all three phenotypes even after correcting for horizontal pleiotropy. We identified 439 pleiotropic loci in the European ancestry data, 150 of which were novel (i.e., not genome-wide significant in the original studies). Of these pleiotropic loci, 202 had lead variants which showed convergent effects (i.e., same direction of effect) on Scz, CanUD, and Smk. Genetic variants convergent across all three phenotypes showed strong genetic correlations with risk-taking, executive function, and several mental health conditions. Our results suggest that both horizontal pleiotropy and causal mechanisms may play a role in the relationship between CanUD, Smk, and Scz, but longitudinal, prospective studies are needed to confirm a causal relationship.",1.50154138468687e-11
38260403,"mixWAS: An efficient distributed algorithm for mixed-outcomes genome-wide association studies.","medRxiv","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been instrumental in identifying genetic associations for various diseases and traits. However, uncovering genetic underpinnings among traits beyond univariate phenotype associations remains a challenge. Multi-phenotype associations (MPA), or genetic pleiotropy, offer important insights into shared genes and pathways among traits, enhancing our understanding of genetic architectures of complex diseases. GWAS of biobank-linked electronic health record (EHR) data are increasingly being utilized to identify MPA among various traits and diseases. However, methodologies that can efficiently take advantage of distributed EHR to detect MPA are still lacking. Here, we introduce mixWAS, a novel algorithm that efficiently and losslessly integrates multiple EHRs via summary statistics, allowing the detection of MPA among mixed phenotypes while accounting for heterogeneities across EHRs. Simulations demonstrate that mixWAS outperforms the widely used MPA detection method, Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), across diverse scenarios. Applying mixWAS to data from seven EHRs in the US, we identified 4,534 MPA among blood lipids, BMI, and circulatory diseases. Validation in an independent EHR data from UK confirmed 97.7% of the associations. mixWAS fundamentally improves the detection of MPA and is available as a free, open-source software.",1.23208474617325e-11

Despite this, sex-differentiation analysis of the genetic architecture of inflammatory proteins is largely unexplored. We performed sex-stratified meta-analysis after protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) mapping using inflammatory biomarkers profiled using targeted proteomics (Olink inflammatory panel) of two population-based cohorts of Europeans.Even though, around 67% of the pQTLs demonstrated shared effect between sexes, colocalization analysis identified two loci in the males (LINC01135 and ITGAV) and three loci (CNOT10, SRD5A2, and LILRB5) in the females with evidence of sex-dependent modulation by pQTL variants. Furthermore, we identified pathways with relevant functions in the sex-biased pQTL variants. We also showed through cross-validation that the sex-specific pQTLs are linked with sex-specific phenotypic traits.Our study demonstrates the relevance of genetic sex-stratified analysis in the context of genetic dissection of protein abundances among individuals and reveals that, sex-specific pQTLs might mediate sex-linked phenotypes. Identification of sex-specific pQTLs associated with sex-biased diseases can help realize the promise of individualized treatment.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.04580329687273e-11

(2) Method: Structured questionnaires were utilized to gather data from 399 individuals in Hail, Saudi Arabia, for the cross-sectional analysis. The study assessed participants' knowledge regarding NSAIDs, patterns of use, reasons for use, and awareness of potential side effects. (3) Results: In the study, the gender distribution indicated that 170 participants (42.61%) were male, whereas 229 (57.39%) were female. Gender, occupation, and marital status showed non-significant associations except for menstrual cycle and joint pain, where marital status displayed significant associations (p> 0.001). Education and monthly income exhibited non-significant associations for all these reasons. The regression analysis demonstrated that gender played a significant role, with females having higher odds of knowledge (AOR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.88) than males. Meanwhile, >50% of the participants had knowledge of adverse events related to the use of NSAIDs, whereas 25% had no knowledge. Moreover, 59 (25.76%) participants reported discomfort with the use of NSAIDs.

However, oxidative stress-generated nucleoside damage has not been studied in young BD patients and their unaffected relatives (UR). Therefore, we compared oxidative stress-generated damage to DNA and RNA in young patients newly diagnosed with BD, UR, and healthy control individuals (HC). Systemic oxidative stress-generated DNA and RNA damage levels were compared by analyzing urinary levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine in participants aged 15-25 years, including 133 patients newly diagnosed with BD, 57 UR, and 83 HC. Compared with HC, damage to DNA was 21.8% higher in BD patients (B = 1.218, 95% CI = 1.111-1.335, p = <0.001) and 22.5% higher in UR (B = 1.225, 95% CI = 1.090-1.377, p = <0.002), while damage to RNA was 14.8% higher in BD patients (B = 1.148, 95% CI = 1.082-1.219, p = <0.001) and 14.0% higher in UR (B = 1.140, 95% CI = 1.055-1.230, p = < 0.001) in models adjusted for sex and age after correction for multiple comparison. Levels did not differ between patients with BD and UR. Our findings support higher oxidative stress-generated nucleoside damage being a trait phenomenon in BD associated with familial risk and highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment to prevent illness progression and development of premature CVD.© 2024.

Additionally, adaptive sampling, a software-controlled enrichment method for targeted sequencing, allows reduced representation methylation sequencing that can be applied to CpG islands or imprinted regions. Here we present DeepMod2, a comprehensive deep-learning framework for methylation detection using ionic current signal from Nanopore sequencing. DeepMod2 implements both a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model and a Transformer model and can analyze POD5 and FAST5 signal files generated on R9 and R10 flowcells. Additionally, DeepMod2 can run efficiently on central processing unit (CPU) through model pruning and can infer epihaplotypes or haplotype-specific methylation calls from phased reads. We use multiple publicly available and newly generated datasets to evaluate the performance of DeepMod2 under varying scenarios. DeepMod2 has comparable performance to Guppy and Dorado, which are the current state-of-the-art methods from Oxford Nanopore Technologies that remain closed-source. Moreover, we show a high correlation (r = 0.96) between reduced representation and whole-genome Nanopore sequencing. In summary, DeepMod2 is an open-source tool that enables fast and accurate DNA methylation detection from whole-genome or adaptive sequencing data on a diverse range of flowcell types.© 2024.

38336841,"Genome-wide association study implicates lipid pathway dysfunction in antipsychotic-induced weight gain: multi-ancestry validation.","Mol Psychiatry","Antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG) is a common side effect of antipsychotic medication and may contribute to diabetes and coronary heart disease. To expand the unclear genetic mechanism underlying AIWG, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study in Han Chinese patients with schizophrenia. The study included a discovery cohort of 1936 patients and a validation cohort of 534 patients, with an additional 630 multi-ancestry patients from the CATIE study for external validation. We applied Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the relationship between AIWG and antipsychotic-induced lipid changes. Our results identified two novel genome-wide significant loci associated with AIWG: rs10422861 in PEPD (P = 1.373 × 10-9) and rs3824417 in PTPRD (P = 3.348 × 10-9) in Chinese Han samples. The association of rs10422861 was validated in the European samples. Fine-mapping and functional annotation revealed that PEPD and PTPRD are potentially causal genes for AIWG, with their proteins being prospective therapeutic targets. Colocalization analysis suggested that AIWG and type 2 diabetes (T2D) shared a causal variant in PEPD. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for AIWG and T2D significantly predicted AIWG in multi-ancestry samples. Furthermore, MR revealed a risky causal effect of genetically predicted changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 7.58 × 10-4) and triglycerides (P = 2.06 × 10-3) caused by acute-phase of antipsychotic treatment on AIWG, which had not been previously reported. Our model, incorporating antipsychotic-induced lipid changes, PRSs, and clinical predictors, significantly predicted BMI percentage change after 6-month antipsychotic treatment (AUC = 0.79, R2 = 0.332). Our results highlight that the mechanism of AIWG involves lipid pathway dysfunction and may share a genetic basis with T2D through PEPD. Overall, this study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of AIWG and contributes to personalized treatment of schizophrenia.© 2024.

Consequently, refinement of exposures, covariates, outcomes, and population subsets may be helpful to establish often-elusive replication and evaluate potential clinical utility. Here, we used additional datasets, an expanded set of statistical models, and interrogation of lipoprotein metabolism via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based lipoprotein subfractions to refine a previously discovered GxE modifying the relationship between physical activity (PA) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C). This GxE was originally identified by Kilpeläinen et al., with the strongest cohort-specific signal coming from the Women's Genome Health Study (WGHS). We thus explored this GxE further in the WGHS (N = 23,294), with follow-up in the UK Biobank (UKB; N = 281,380), and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; N = 4,587). Self-reported PA (MET-hrs/wk), genotypes at rs295849 (nearest gene:LHX1), and NMR metabolomics data were available in all three cohorts. As originally reported, minor allele carriers of rs295849 in WGHS had a stronger positive association between PA and HDL-C (pint= 0.002). When testing a range of NMR metabolites (primarily lipoprotein and lipid subfractions) to refine the HDL-C outcome, we found a stronger interaction effect on medium-sized HDL particle concentrations (M-HDL-P;pint= 1.0×10-4) than HDL-C. Meta-regression revealed a systematically larger interaction effect in cohorts from the original meta-analysis with a greater fraction of women (p= 0.018). In the UKB, GxE effects were stronger both in women and using M-HDL-P as the outcome. In MESA, the primary interaction for HDL-C showed nominal significance (pint= 0.013), but without clear differences by sex and with a greater magnitude using large, rather than medium, HDL-P as an outcome. Towards reconciling these observations, further exploration leveraging NMR platform-specific HDL subfraction diameter annotations revealed modest agreement across all cohorts in the interaction affecting medium-to-large particles. Taken together, our work provides additional insights into a specific known gene-PA interaction while illustrating the importance of phenotype and model refinement towards understanding and replicating GxEs.",2.51510647506914e-12

38352402,"Using Alternative Definitions of Controls to Increase Statistical Power in GWAS.","Res Sq","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are underpowered due to small effect sizes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on phenotypes and extreme multiple testing thresholds. The most common approach for increasing statistical power is to increase sample size. We propose an alternative strategy of redefining case-control outcomes into ordinal case-subthreshold-asymptomatic variables. While maintaining the clinical case threshold, we subdivide controls into two groups: individuals who are symptomatic but do not meet the clinical criteria for diagnosis (subthreshold) and individuals who are effectively asymptomatic. We conducted a simulation study to examine the impact of effect size, minor allele frequency, population prevalence, and the prevalence of the subthreshold group on statistical power to detect genetic associations in three scenarios: a standard case-control, an ordinal, and a case-asymptomatic control analysis. Our results suggest the ordinal model consistently provides the most statistical power while the case-control model the least. Power in the case-asymptomatic control model reflects the case-control or ordinal model depending on the population prevalence and size of the subthreshold category. We then analyzed a major depression phenotype from the UK Biobank to corroborate our simulation results. Overall, the ordinal model improves statistical power in GWAS consistent with increasing the sample size by approximately 10%.",2.22092177418035e-12
38250567,"Towards quantifying atmospheric dispersion of pesticide spray drift in Yuma County Arizona.","Atmos Environ (1994)","While pesticide vapor and particles from agricultural spray drift have been reported to pose a risk to public health, limited baseline ambient measurements exist to warrant an accurate assessment of their impacts at community-to-county-wide scale. Here, we present an initial modeling investigation of the transport and deposition of applied pesticides in an agricultural county in Arizona (Yuma County), to provide initial estimates on the corresponding enhancements in ambient levels of these spray drifts downwind of application sites. With a 50 × 50 km domain, we use the dispersion model CALPUFF with meteorology from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of pesticide abundance due to spray drift from a representative sample of nine application sites. Data records for nine application days in September and October 2011, which are the peak months of pesticide application, were retroactively simulated for 48-h for all nine application sites using an active ingredient lambda-cyhalothrin, which is a commonly-used pesticide in the county. Twenty-one WRF/CALPUFF simulations were conducted with varying emissions, chemical lifetime, deposition rate, application height, and meteorology inputs, allowing for an ensemble-based analysis on the possible ranges in modeled abundance. Our results show that dispersion of vapors released at time of application heavily depends on prevailing meteorology, particularly wind speed and direction. Dispersion is limited to thin plumes that are easily transported out of the domain. The ensemble-mean vapor concentrations of the 48-h average (> 90 percentile domain-wide) range from 0.2 nanograms (ng)/m3to 200 ng/m3, and the peak can be as high as 1000 ng/m3near the application sites. Pesticide particles are mainly deposited within 1-2 km from the application sites at an average rate of 106ng/km2/h but vary with particle mean diameter and standard deviation. While these findings are generally consistent with reported ambient levels in the literature, the associated ensemble-spread on these estimates are in the same order of magnitude as their ensemble-mean. At the two nearby communities downwind of these sites, we find that peak vapor concentrations are less than 50 ng/m3with exposure times of less than an hour, as approximately 99.4% of the vapors are advected out and 99.5% of the particles deposit within the domain. Results of this study indicate pesticide spray drift from a sample of application sites and representative days in Fall may have a limited impact on neighboring communities. However, we strongly suggest that field measurements should be collected for model validation and more rigorous investigation of the actual scale of these impacts when the bulk of pesticide applications across the county, variation in active pesticide ingredients, and potential resuspension of deposited particles are considered.",1.25609228136016e-12

38351292,"Identification of the DNA methylation signature of Mowat-Wilson syndrome.","Eur J Hum Genet","Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MOWS) is a rare congenital disease caused by haploinsufficiency of ZEB2, encoding a transcription factor required for neurodevelopment. MOWS is characterized by intellectual disability, epilepsy, typical facial phenotype and other anomalies, such as short stature, Hirschsprung disease, brain and heart defects. Despite some recognizable features, MOWS rarity and phenotypic variability may complicate its diagnosis, particularly in the neonatal period. In order to define a novel diagnostic biomarker for MOWS, we determined the genome-wide DNA methylation profile of DNA samples from 29 individuals with confirmed clinical and molecular diagnosis. Through multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering analysis, we identified and validated a DNA methylation signature involving 296 differentially methylated probes as part of the broader MOWS DNA methylation profile. The prevalence of hypomethylated CpG sites agrees with the main role of ZEB2 as a transcriptional repressor, while differential methylation within the ZEB2 locus supports the previously proposed autoregulation ability. Correlation studies compared the MOWS cohort with 56 previously described DNA methylation profiles of other neurodevelopmental disorders, further validating the specificity of this biomarker. In conclusion, MOWS DNA methylation signature is highly sensitive and reproducible, providing a useful tool to facilitate diagnosis.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.047039230197e-12

To increase statistical power to identify OOD-associated genes, we leveraged human prefrontal cortex RNAseq data from four independent OOD studies and conducted a transcriptome-wide DGE meta-analysis (N = 285). Using a unified gene expression data processing and analysis framework across studies, we meta-analyzed 20 098 genes and found 335 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by OOD status (false discovery rate < 0.05). Of these, 66 DEGs were among the list of 303 genes reported as OOD-associated in prior prefrontal cortex molecular studies, including genes/gene families (e.g.,OPRK1, NPAS4,DUSP, EGR). The remaining 269 DEGs were not previously reported (e.g.,NR4A2, SYT1, HCRTR2, BDNF).

We identify 1,289 independent association signals at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8) that map to 611 loci, of which 145 loci are, to our knowledge, previously unreported. We define eight non-overlapping clusters of T2D signals that are characterized by distinct profiles of cardiometabolic trait associations. These clusters are differentially enriched for cell-type-specific regions of open chromatin, including pancreatic islets, adipocytes, endothelial cells and enteroendocrine cells. We build cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores5in a further 279,552 individuals of diverse ancestry, including 30,288 cases of T2D, and test their association with T2D-related vascular outcomes. Cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores are associated with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease and end-stage diabetic nephropathy across ancestry groups, highlighting the importance of obesity-related processes in the development of vascular outcomes. Our findings show the value of integrating multi-ancestry genome-wide association study data with single-cell epigenomics to disentangle the aetiological heterogeneity that drives the development and progression of T2D.

We also observed differences in breast milk lipid composition in those mothers whose offspring later developed autoimmune diseases. Our study suggests that breast milk lipid composition is modified by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, and, importantly, this impact was significantly more pronounced in those mothers whose offspring later developed autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. Our findings also suggest that merely assessing PFAS concentration may not capture the full extent of the impact of chemical exposures; thus, the more comprehensive exposome approach is essential for accurately assessing the impact of PFAS exposure on HBM and, consequently, on the health outcomes of the offspring.",3.3977572027998e-13
38168070,"STYXL1 regulates CCT complex assembly and flagellar tubulin folding in sperm formation.","Nat Commun","Tubulin-based microtubule is a core component of flagella axoneme and essential for sperm motility and male fertility. Structural components of the axoneme have been well explored. However, how tubulin folding is regulated in sperm flagella formation is still largely unknown. Here, we report a germ cell-specific co-factor of CCT complex, STYXL1. Deletion of Styxl1 results in male infertility and microtubule defects of sperm flagella. Proteomic analysis of Styxl1-/-sperm reveals abnormal downregulation of flagella-related proteins including tubulins. The N-terminal rhodanese-like domain of STYXL1 is important for its interactions with CCT complex subunits, CCT1, CCT6 and CCT7. Styxl1 deletion leads to defects in CCT complex assembly and tubulin polymerization. Collectively, our findings reveal the vital roles of germ cell-specific STYXL1 in CCT-facilitated tubulin folding and sperm flagella development.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.09931034200007e-13

Here, we investigated the histopathologic and molecular profiles of precancerous gastric cardia lesions (PGCLs) and biomarkers for risk stratification of gastric cardia IM.We conducted a hospital-based evaluation (n = 4578) for PGCL profiles in high-incidence and non-high-incidence regions for GCC in China. We next performed 850K methylation arrays (n = 42) and RNA-seq (n = 44) in tissues with PGCLs. We then examined the protein expression of candidate biomarker using immunohistochemistry.Of the 4578 participants, 791 were diagnosed with PGCLs (600 IM, 62 IM with IEN, and 129 IEN). We found that individuals from high-incidence regions (26.7%) were more likely to develop PGCLs than those from non-high-incidence areas (13.5%). DNA methylation and gene expression alterations, indicated by differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), exhibited a progressive increase from type I IM (DMP = 210, DEG = 24), type II IM (DMP = 3402, DEG = 129), to type III IM (DMP = 3735, DEG = 328), peaking in IEN (DMP = 47 373, DEG = 2278). Three DEGs with aberrant promoter methylation were identified, shared exclusively by type III IM and IEN. Of these DEGs, we found that OLFM4 expression appears in IMs and increases remarkably in IENs (P < .001).We highlight that type III IM and IEN share similar epigenetic and transcriptional features in gastric cardia and propose biomarkers with potential utility in risk prediction.© The Author(s) 2024.

The efficacy of the guideline-recommended surveillance methods for patients with LC remains unpromising.A total of 4367 LCs not previously known to have HCC and 510 HCCs from 16 hospitals across 11 provinces of China were recruited in this multi-center, large-scale, cross-sectional study. Participants were divided into Stage Ⅰ cohort (510 HCCs and 2074 LCs) and Stage Ⅱ cohort (2293 LCs) according to their enrollment time and underwent Tri-phasic CT/enhanced MRI, US, AFP, and cell-free DNA (cfDNA). A screening model called PreCar Score was established based on five features of cfDNA using Stage Ⅰ cohort. Surveillance performance of PreCar Score alone or in combination with US/AFP was evaluated in Stage Ⅱ cohort.PreCar Score showed a significantly higher sensitivity for the detection of early/very early HCC (Barcelona stage A/0) in contrast to US (sensitivity of 51.32% [95% CI: 39.66%-62.84%] at 95.53% [95% CI: 94.62%-96.38%] specificity for PreCar Score; sensitivity of 23.68% [95% CI: 14.99%-35.07%] at 99.37% [95% CI: 98.91%-99.64%] specificity for US) (P < 0.01, Fisher's exact test).

Most such methods, however, measure only a limited panel of transcripts, which need to be selected in advance to inform on the cell types or processes being studied. A limitation of existing gene selection methods is their reliance on scRNA-seq data, ignoring platform effects between technologies.

By modeling and adjusting for platform effects, gpsFISH outperforms other methods. Furthermore, gpsFISH can incorporate cell type hierarchies and custom gene preferences to accommodate diverse design requirements.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.45543590579242e-13
38352303,"Highly parameterized polygenic scores tend to overfit to population stratification via random effects.","bioRxiv","Polygenic scores (PGSs), increasingly used in clinical settings, frequently include many genetic variants, with performance typically peaking at thousands of variants. Such highly parameterized PGSs often include variants that do not pass a genome-wide significance threshold. We propose a mathematical perspective that renders the effects of many of these non-significant variants random rather than causal, with the randomness capturing population structure. We devise methods to assess variant effect randomness and population stratification bias. Applying these methods to 141 traits from the UK Biobank, we find that, for many PGSs, the effects of non-significant variants are considerably random, with the extent of randomness associated with the degree of overfitting to population structure of the discovery cohort. Our findings explain why highly parameterized PGSs simultaneously have superior cohort-specific performance and limited generalizability, suggesting the critical need for variant randomness tests in PGS evaluation.

It is exceptionally used as an insecticide for malaria control. Exposure occurs in regions where DDT is applied, as well as in the Arctic, where its endocrine disrupting metabolite,p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) accumulates in marine mammals and fish. DDT andp,p'-DDE exposures are linked to birth defects, infertility, cancer, and neurodevelopmental delays. Of particular concern is the potential of DDT use to impact the health of generations to come via the heritable sperm epigenome.The objective of this study was to assess the sperm epigenome in relation top,p'-DDE serum levels between geographically diverse populations.In the Limpopo Province of South Africa, we recruited 247 VhaVenda South African men and selected 50 paired blood serum and semen samples, and 47 Greenlandic Inuit blood and semen paired samples were selected from a total of 193 samples from the biobank of the INUENDO cohort, an EU Fifth Framework Programme Research and Development project. Sample selection was based on obtaining a range ofp,p'-DDE serum levels (mean=870.734±134.030 ng/mL). We assessed the sperm epigenome in relation to serump,p'-DDE levels using MethylC-Capture-sequencing (MCC-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq). We identified genomic regions with altered DNA methylation (DNAme) and differential enrichment of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in sperm.Differences in DNAme and H3K4me3 enrichment were identified at transposable elements and regulatory regions involved in fertility, disease, development, and neurofunction. A subset of regions with sperm DNAme and H3K4me3 that differed between exposure groups was predicted to persist in the preimplantation embryo and to be associated with embryonic gene expression.These findings suggest that DDT andp,p'-DDE exposure impacts the sperm epigenome in a dose-response-like manner and may negatively impact the health of future generations through epigenetic mechanisms. Confounding factors, such as other environmental exposures, genetic diversity, and selection bias, cannot be ruled out. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12013.",1.81222171824685e-13

Yet efforts to design software for deep-learning analyses in regulatory genomics that are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) have fallen short of fully meeting these criteria. Here we present elucidating the utility of genomic elements with neural nets (EUGENe), a FAIR toolkit for the analysis of genomic sequences with deep learning. EUGENe consists of a set of modules and subpackages for executing the key functionality of a genomics deep learning workflow: (1) extracting, transforming and loading sequence data from many common file formats; (2) instantiating, initializing and training diverse model architectures; and (3) evaluating and interpreting model behavior. We designed EUGENe as a simple, flexible and extensible interface for streamlining and customizing end-to-end deep-learning sequence analyses, and illustrate these principles through application of the toolkit to three predictive modeling tasks.

Although this methodology has been used to examine gene regulation in numerous human tissues, eQTL research in solid tissues is relatively lacking. We conducted eQTL analysis on placentas collected from an East Asian population in an effort to identify gene regulatory mechanisms in this tissue. Placentas (n = 102) were collected at the time of cesarean delivery. mRNA was extracted, sequenced with NGS, and compared with matched maternal and fetal DNA arrays performed using maternal and neonatal cord blood. Linear regression modeling was performed using tensorQTL. Fine-mapping along with epigenomic annotation was used to select putative functional variants. We identified 2,703 coding genes that contained at least one eQTL with statistical significance (false discovery rate <0.05). After fine-mapping, we found 108 previously unreported eQTL variants with posterior inclusion probability >0.1. Of these, 19% were located in genomic regions with evidence from public placental epigenome suggesting that they may be functionally relevant. For example, variant rs28379289 located in the placenta-specific regulatory region changes the binding affinity of transcription factor leading to higher expression of LGALS3, which is known to affect placental function. This study expands the knowledge base of regulatory elements within the human placenta and identifies 108 previously unreported placenta eQTL signals, which are listed in our publicly available GMI eQTL database. Further studies are needed to identify and characterize genetic regulatory mechanisms that affect placental function in normal pregnancy and placenta-related diseases.Copyright © 2024.

A number of genetic loci, including Wnt signaling members, have been previously identified. Our overall aim was to identify novel genetic loci, to prioritize genes within the loci for functional studies, and to assess genetic correlation with associated disorders. We performed a meta-analysis of six DD genome-wide association studies from three European countries and extensive bioinformatic follow-up analyses. Leveraging 11,320 cases and 47,023 controls, we identified 85 genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms in 56 loci, of which 11 were novel, explaining 13.3-38.1% of disease variance. Gene prioritization implicated the Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways. We also identified a significant genetic correlation with frozen shoulder. The pathways identified highlight the potential for new therapeutic targets and provide a basis for additional mechanistic studies for a common disorder that can severely impact hand function.© 2024.

However, translating such findings into bona fide clinical biomarkers remains challenging. To facilitate this process, we introduce Stabl, a general machine learning method that identifies a sparse, reliable set of biomarkers by integrating noise injection and a data-driven signal-to-noise threshold into multivariable predictive modeling. Evaluation of Stabl on synthetic datasets and five independent clinical studies demonstrates improved biomarker sparsity and reliability compared to commonly used sparsity-promoting regularization methods while maintaining predictive performance; it distills datasets containing 1,400-35,000 features down to 4-34 candidate biomarkers.

Understanding the shared genetic influences underlying the comorbidity between chronic pain and SUDs will lead to a greater understanding of their biology. Genome-wide association statistics were obtained from the UK Biobank for multisite chronic pain (MCP, Neffective = 387,649) and from the Million Veteran Program and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium meta-analyses for alcohol use disorder (AUD, Neffective = 296,974), cannabis use disorder (CanUD, Neffective = 161,053), opioid use disorder (OUD, Neffective = 57,120), and problematic tobacco use (PTU, Neffective = 270,120). SNP-based heritability was estimated for each of the traits and genetic correlation (rg) analyses were performed to assess MCP-SUD pleiotropy. Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization analyses evaluated possible causal relationships. Finally, to identify and characterize individual loci, we performed a genome-wide pleiotropy analysis and a brain-wide analysis using imaging phenotypes available from the UK Biobank. MCP was positively genetically correlated with AUD (rg = 0.26, p = 7.55 × 10-18), CanUD (rg = 0.37, p = 8.21 × 10-37), OUD (rg = 0.20, p = 1.50 × 10-3), and PTU (rg = 0.29, p = 8.53 × 10-12). Although the MR analyses supported bi-directional relationships, MCP had larger effects on AUD (pain-exposure: beta = 0.18, p = 8.21 × 10-4; pain-outcome: beta = 0.07, p = 0.018), CanUD (pain-exposure: beta = 0.58, p = 2.70 × 10-6; pain-outcome: beta = 0.05, p = 0.014) and PTU (pain-exposure: beta = 0.43, p = 4.16 × 10-8; pain-outcome: beta = 0.09, p = 3.05 × 10-6) than the reverse. The genome-wide analysis identified two SNPs pleiotropic between MCP and all SUD investigated: IHO1 rs7652746 (ppleiotropy = 2.69 × 10-8), and CADM2 rs1248857 (ppleiotropy = 1.98 × 10-5). In the brain-wide analysis, rs7652746 was associated with multiple cerebellum and amygdala imaging phenotypes. When analyzing MCP pleiotropy with each SUD separately, we found 25, 22, and 4 pleiotropic variants for AUD, CanUD, and OUD, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study to provide evidence of potential causal relationships and shared genetic mechanisms underlying MCP-SUD comorbidity.© 2024.

We aim to provide a comprehensive literature review of the association between air pollution, and ILD, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).We systematically searched from six online database. Two independent authors (DL and CF) selected studies and critically appraised the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Findings are presented through a narrative synthesis and meta-analysis. Meta-analyses were performed exclusively when there was a minimum of three studies examining identical pollutant-health outcome pairs, all evaluating equivalent increments in pollutant concentration, using a random effects model.24 observational studies conducted in 13 countries or regions were identified. Pollutants under investigation encompassed ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Particulate matter with diameters of 10 micrometers or less (PM10) and 2.5 micrometers or less (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). We conducted meta-analyses to assess the estimated Risk Ratios (RRs) for acute exacerbations (AE)-IPF in relation to exposure to every 10 μg/m3increment in air pollutant concentrations, including O3, NO2, PM10, and PM2.5.The meta-analysis revealed a significant association between the increased risk of AE-IPF in PM2.5, yielding RR 1.94 (95% CI 1.30-2.90;p = 0.001). Findings across all the included studies suggest that increased exposure to air pollutants may be linked to a range of health issues in individuals with ILDs.A scarcity of available studies on the air pollutants and ILD relationship underscores the imperative for further comprehensive research in this domain.

Our study explores mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants as contributors to birthweight differences by impacting mitochondrial function during prenatal development. We deep-sequenced the mtDNA of 451 ART and spontaneously conceived (SC) individuals, 157 mother-child pairs and 113 individual oocytes from either natural menstrual cycles or after ovarian stimulation (OS) and find that ART individuals carried a different mtDNA genotype than SC individuals, with more de novo non-synonymous variants. These variants, along with rRNA variants, correlate with lower birthweight percentiles, independent of conception mode. Their higher occurrence in ART individuals stems from de novo mutagenesis associated with maternal aging and OS-induced oocyte cohort size.

While several environmental risk factors for cSCC are well established, there is conflicting evidence on cigarette smoking (and its potential causal effect) and cSCC risk. Furthermore, it is unclear if these potential associations represent causal, modifiable risk factors for cSCC development. This study aims to assess the nature of the associations between cigarette smoking traits (smoking initiation, amount smoked, and lifetime smoking exposure) and cSCC risk using two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses.Genetic instruments, based on common genetic variants associated with cigarette smoking traits (P < 5 × 10-8), were derived from published genome-wide association studies (GWASs). For cSCC, we used GWAS summary statistics from the Kaiser Permanente GERA cohort (7701 cSCC cases and 60,167 controls; all non-Hispanic Whites).We found modest evidence that genetically determined lifetime smoking was associated with cSCC (inverse-variance weighted method: OR[95% CI] = 1.47[1.09-1.98];P = .012), suggesting it may be a causal risk factor for cSCC. We did not detect any evidence of association between genetically determined smoking initiation or amount smoked and cSCC risk.Study findings highlight the importance of smoking prevention and may support risk-stratified cSCC screening strategies based on carcinogen exposure and other genetic and clinical information.© 2023 by the American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

We compared this model withAPOEand polygenic risk score models across genetic ancestry groups, using electronic health records from UCLA Health for discovery and All of Us cohort for validation.Our model significantly outperforms other models across multiple ancestries, improving the area-under-precision-recall curve by 21-61% and the area-under-the-receiver-operating characteristic by 10-21% compared to theAPOEand the polygenic risk score models. We identified shared and ancestry-specific risk genes and biological pathways, reinforcing and adding to existing knowledge.Our study highlights benefits of integrating functional mapping, multiple neurodegenerative diseases, and machine learning for genetic risk models in diverse populations.

38241369,"Integrative analysis of noncoding mutations identifies the druggable genome in preterm birth.","Sci Adv","Preterm birth affects ~10% of pregnancies in the US. Despite familial associations, identifying at-risk genetic loci has been challenging. We built deep learning and graphical models to score mutational effects at base resolution via integrating the pregnant myometrial epigenome and large-scale patient genomes with spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) from European and African American cohorts. We uncovered previously unidentified sPTB genes that are involved in myometrial muscle relaxation and inflammatory responses and that are regulated by the progesterone receptor near labor onset. We studied genomic variants in these genes in our recruited pregnant women administered progestin prophylaxis. We observed that mutation burden in these genes was predictive of responses to progestin treatment for preterm birth. To advance therapeutic development, we screened ~4000 compounds, identified candidate molecules that affect our identified genes, and experimentally validated their therapeutic effects on regulating labor. Together, our integrative approach revealed the druggable genome in preterm birth and provided a generalizable framework for studying complex diseases.",1.2012595329046e-14
38272880,"Genetic evidence for causal effects of immune dysfunction in psychiatric disorders: where are we?","Transl Psychiatry","The question of whether immune dysfunction contributes to risk of psychiatric disorders has long been a subject of interest. To assert this hypothesis a plethora of correlative evidence has been accumulated from the past decades; however, a variety of technical and practical obstacles impeded on a cause-effect interpretation of these data. With the advent of large-scale omics technology and advanced statistical models, particularly Mendelian randomization, new studies testing this old hypothesis are accruing. Here we synthesize these new findings from genomics and genetic causal inference studies on the role of immune dysfunction in major psychiatric disorders and reconcile these new data with pre-omics findings. By reconciling these evidences, we aim to identify key gaps and propose directions for future studies in the field.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.11369646331767e-14
38190103,"Genome-wide classification of epigenetic activity reveals regions of enriched heritability in immune-related traits.","Cell Genom","Epigenetics underpins the regulation of genes known to play a key role in the adaptive and innate immune system (AIIS). We developed a method, EpiNN, that leverages epigenetic data to detect AIIS-relevant genomic regions and used it to detect 2,765 putative AIIS loci. Experimental validation of one of these loci, DNMT1, provided evidence for a novel AIIS-specific transcription start site. We built a genome-wide AIIS annotation and used linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression to test whether it predicts regional heritability using association statistics for 176 traits. We detected significant heritability effects (average |τ∗|=1.65) for 20 out of 26 immune-relevant traits. In a meta-analysis, immune-relevant traits and diseases were 4.45× more enriched for heritability than other traits. The EpiNN annotation was also depleted of trans-ancestry genetic correlation, indicating ancestry-specific effects. These results underscore the effectiveness of leveraging supervised learning algorithms and epigenetic data to detect loci implicated in specific classes of traits and diseases.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

38244574,"Conumee 2.0: enhanced copy-number variation analysis from DNA methylation arrays for humans and mice.","Bioinformatics","Copy-number variations (CNVs) are common genetic alterations in cancer and their detection may impact tumor classification and therapeutic decisions. However, detection of clinically relevant large and focal CNVs remains challenging when sample material or resources are limited. This has motivated us to create a software tool to infer CNVs from DNA methylation arrays which are often generated as part of clinical routines and in research settings.We present our R package, conumee 2.0, that combines tangent normalization, an adjustable genomic binning heuristic, and weighted circular binary segmentation to utilize DNA methylation arrays for CNV analysis and mitigate technical biases and batch effects. Segmentation results were validated in a lung squamous cell carcinoma dataset from TCGA (n = 367 samples) by comparison to segmentations derived from genotyping arrays (Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.91). We further introduce a segmented block bootstrapping approach to detect focal alternations that achieved 60.9% sensitivity and 98.6% specificity for deletions affecting CDKN2A/B (60.0% and 96.9% for RB1, respectively) in a low-grade glioma cohort from TCGA (n = 239 samples).

38200577,"Defining type 2 diabetes polygenic risk scores through colocalization and network-based clustering of metabolic trait genetic associations.","Genome Med","Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous and polygenic disease. Previous studies have leveraged the highly polygenic and pleiotropic nature of T2D variants to partition the heterogeneity of T2D, in order to stratify patient risk and gain mechanistic insight. We expanded on these approaches by performing colocalization across GWAS traits while assessing the causality and directionality of genetic associations.We applied colocalization between T2D and 20 related metabolic traits, across 243 loci, to obtain inferences of shared casual variants. Network-based unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed on variant-trait associations. Partitioned polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were generated for each cluster using T2D summary statistics and validated in 21,742 individuals with T2D from 3 cohorts. Inferences of directionality and causality were obtained by applying Mendelian randomization Steiger's Z-test and further validated in a pediatric cohort without diabetes (aged 9-12 years old, n = 3866).We identified 146 T2D loci that colocalized with at least one metabolic trait locus. T2D variants within these loci were grouped into 5 clusters. The clusters corresponded to the following pathways: obesity, lipodystrophic insulin resistance, liver and lipid metabolism, hepatic glucose metabolism, and beta-cell dysfunction. We observed heterogeneity in associations between PRSs and metabolic measures across clusters. For instance, the lipodystrophic insulin resistance (Beta - 0.08 SD, 95% CI [- 0.10-0.07], p = 6.50 × 10-32) and beta-cell dysfunction (Beta - 0.10 SD, 95% CI [- 0.12, - 0.08], p = 1.46 × 10-47) PRSs were associated to lower BMI. Mendelian randomization Steiger analysis indicated that increased T2D risk in these pathways was causally associated to lower BMI. However, the obesity PRS was conversely associated with increased BMI (Beta 0.08 SD, 95% CI 0.06-0.10, p = 8.0 × 10-33). Analyses within a pediatric cohort supported this finding. Additionally, the lipodystrophic insulin resistance PRS was associated with a higher odds of chronic kidney disease (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.02-1.62, p = 0.03).We successfully partitioned T2D genetic variants into phenotypic pathways using a colocalization first approach. Partitioned PRSs were associated to unique metabolic and clinical outcomes indicating successful partitioning of disease heterogeneity. Our work expands on previous approaches by providing stronger inferences of shared causal variants, causality, and directionality of GWAS variant-trait associations.© 2024.

38356009,"Global DNA Methylation Levels Viz-a-Viz Genetic and Biochemical Variations in One Carbon Metabolic Pathway: An Exploratory Study from North India.","Biochem Genet","Despite the importance of one carbon metabolic pathway (OCMP) in modulating the DNA methylation process, only a few population-based studies have explored their relationship among healthy individuals. This study aimed to understand the variations in global DNA methylation levels with respect to selected genetic (CBS 844ins68, MTRR A66G, MTR A2756G, and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms) and biochemical (folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine) markers associated with OCMP among healthy North Indian adults. The study has been conducted among 1095 individuals of either sex (69.5% females), aged 30-75 years. A sample of 5 mL of blood was collected from each participant. Homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B12 levels were determined using the chemiluminescence technique. Restriction digestion was performed for genotyping MTRR A66G, MTR A2756G, and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms and allele-specific PCR amplification for CBS 844ins68 polymorphism. Global DNA methylation levels were analyzed using ELISA-based colorimetric technique. Of the selected genetic and biochemical markers, the mutant MTRR A66G allele was positively associated with global DNA methylation levels. Further, advanced age was inversely associated with methylation levels. MTRR 66GG genotype group was hypermethylated than other genotypes in folate replete and vitamin B12 deficient group (a condition prevalent among vegetarians), suggesting that the G allele may be more efficient than the wild-type allele in such conditions. Global DNA methylation levels appeared to be more influenced by genetic than biochemical factors. MTRR 66G allele may have a selective advantage in vitamin B12 deficient conditions. Further research should be undertaken to understand how genetics affects epigenetic processes.© 2024.

Drawing on a bioinformatically-informed network approach, we situate these findings in a broader molecular framework by examining the upstream regulators of SES-associated transcriptional alterations. Data come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a nationally representative sample of 4543 adults in the United States. Results reveal a network-of differentially expressed genes, transcription factors, and protein neighbors of transcription factors-that shows widespread SES-related dysregulation of the immune system. Mediational models suggest that body mass index (BMI) plays a key role in accounting for many of these associations.

Based on a validated measure of biological age predictive of morbidity and mortality, 3 FMD cycles were associated with a decrease of 2.5 years in median biological age, independent of weight loss. Nearly identical findings resulted from  a second clinical study (NCT04150159).

38233073,"Spatiotemporal DNA methylation dynamics shape megabase-scale methylome landscapes.","Life Sci Alliance","DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mechanism that regulates cellular reprogramming and development. Studies using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing have revealed distinct DNA methylome landscapes in human and mouse cells and tissues. However, the factors responsible for the differences in megabase-scale methylome patterns between cell types remain poorly understood. By analyzing publicly available 258 human and 301 mouse whole-genome bisulfite sequencing datasets, we reveal that genomic regions rich in guanine and cytosine, when located near the nuclear center, are highly susceptible to both global DNA demethylation and methylation events during embryonic and germline reprogramming. Furthermore, we found that regions that generate partially methylated domains during global DNA methylation are more likely to resist global DNA demethylation, contain high levels of adenine and thymine, and are adjacent to the nuclear lamina. The spatial properties of genomic regions, influenced by their guanine-cytosine content, are likely to affect the accessibility of molecules involved in DNA (de)methylation. These properties shape megabase-scale DNA methylation patterns and change as cells differentiate, leading to the emergence of different megabase-scale methylome patterns across cell types.© 2024 Toh and Sasaki.",5.52772785507557e-15
38219485,"Quality assessment of enzymatic methyl-seq library constructed using crude cell lysate.","Biochem Biophys Res Commun","Enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq), an enzyme-based method, identifies genome-wide DNA methylation, which enables us to obtain reliable methylome data from purified genomic DNA by avoiding bisulfite-induced DNA damage. However, the loss of DNA during purification hinders the methylome analysis of limited samples. The crude DNA extraction method is the quickest and minimal sample loss approach for obtaining useable DNA without requiring additional dissolution and purification. However, it remains unclear whether crude DNA can be used directly for EM-seq library construction. In this study, we aimed to assess the quality of EM-seq libraries prepared directly using crude DNA. The crude DNA-derived libraries provided appropriate fragment sizes and concentrations for sequencing similar to those of the purified DNA-derived libraries. However, the sequencing results of crude samples exhibited lower reference sequence mapping efficiencies than those of the purified samples. Additionally, the lower-input crude DNA-derived sample exhibited a marginally lower cytosine-to-thymine conversion efficiency and hypermethylated pattern around gene regulatory elements than the higher-input crude DNA- or purified DNA-derived samples. In contrast, the methylation profiles of the crude and purified samples exhibited a significant correlation. Our findings indicate that crude DNA can be used as a raw material for EM-seq library construction.Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",5.04636286526046e-15
38374450,"An omics-based machine learning approach to predict diabetes progression: a RHAPSODY study.","Diabetologia","People with type 2 diabetes are heterogeneous in their disease trajectory, with some progressing more quickly to insulin initiation than others. Although classical biomarkers such as age, HbA1cand diabetes duration are associated with glycaemic progression, it is unclear how well such variables predict insulin initiation or requirement and whether newly identified markers have added predictive value.In two prospective cohort studies as part of IMI-RHAPSODY, we investigated whether clinical variables and three types of molecular markers (metabolites, lipids, proteins) can predict time to insulin requirement using different machine learning approaches (lasso, ridge, GRridge, random forest). Clinical variables included age, sex, HbA1c, HDL-cholesterol and C-peptide. Models were run with unpenalised clinical variables (i.e. always included in the model without weights) or penalised clinical variables, or without clinical variables. Model development was performed in one cohort and the model was applied in a second cohort. Model performance was evaluated using Harrel's C statistic.Of the 585 individuals from the Hoorn Diabetes Care System (DCS) cohort, 69 required insulin during follow-up (1.0-11.4 years); of the 571 individuals in the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (GoDARTS) cohort, 175 required insulin during follow-up (0.3-11.8 years). Overall, the clinical variables and proteins were selected in the different models most often, followed by the metabolites. The most frequently selected clinical variables were HbA1c(18 of the 36 models, 50%), age (15 models, 41.2%) and C-peptide (15 models, 41.2%). Base models (age, sex, BMI, HbA1c) including only clinical variables performed moderately in both the DCS discovery cohort (C statistic 0.71 [95% CI 0.64, 0.79]) and the GoDARTS replication cohort (C 0.71 [95% CI 0.69, 0.75]). A more extensive model including HDL-cholesterol and C-peptide performed better in both cohorts (DCS, C 0.74 [95% CI 0.67, 0.81]; GoDARTS, C 0.73 [95% CI 0.69, 0.77]). Two proteins, lactadherin and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor, were most consistently selected and slightly improved model performance.Using machine learning approaches, we show that insulin requirement risk can be modestly well predicted by predominantly clinical variables. Inclusion of molecular markers improves the prognostic performance beyond that of clinical variables by up to 5%. Such prognostic models could be useful for identifying people with diabetes at high risk of progressing quickly to treatment intensification.Summary statistics of lipidomic, proteomic and metabolomic data are available from a Shiny dashboard at https://rhapdata-app.vital-it.ch .© 2024.

Epigenetic modifications of gene REs, also in the context of gene x environment interactions, have not yet been explored in humanized mouse models. We applied high-accuracy measurement of DNA methylation (DNAm) via targeted bisulfite sequencing (HAM-TBS) to investigate DNAm in three tissues/brain regions (blood, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) of mice carrying the human FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene, an important candidate gene associated with stress-related psychiatric disorders. We explored DNAm in three functional intronic glucocorticoid-responsive elements (at introns 2, 5, and 7) of FKBP5 at baseline, in cases of differing genotype (rs1360780 single nucleotide polymorphism), and following application of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. We compared DNAm patterns in the humanized mouse (N = 58) to those in human peripheral blood (N = 447 and N = 89) and human postmortem brain prefrontal cortex (N = 86). Overall, DNAm patterns in the humanized mouse model seem to recapitulate DNAm patterns observed in human tissue. At baseline, this was to a higher extent in brain tissue. The animal model also recapitulated effects of dexamethasone on DNAm, especially in peripheral blood and to a lesser extent effects of genotype on DNAm. The humanized mouse model could thus assist in reverse translation of human findings in psychiatry that involve genetic and epigenetic regulation in non-coding elements.© 2024.

A family history of autoimmune diseases may be related to the risk of childhood cancer based on similar histocompatibility antigens. We utilized data from national registries in Denmark to examine associations between maternal autoimmune disease and cancer in their offspring.We linked data from several national registries in Denmark to identify childhood cancer cases in children <20 years diagnosed between 1977 to 2016. Controls were selected from the Central Population Register and matched to cases by birth year and sex (25:1). Mothers with autoimmune disease diagnosed in pregnancy or prior were identified from the National Patient Register. Multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses were used to estimate associations between maternal autoimmune diseases and childhood cancer in offspring.Autoimmune diseases (all types) were positively associated with all childhood cancers combined (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.25, 95% CI 1.06, 1.47), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (OR =1.52, 95% CI 1.09, 2.13), Burkitt lymphoma (OR = 2.69, 95% CI 1.04, 6.97), and central nervous system tumors (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.06, 1.99), especially astrocytoma (OR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.36, 3.77) and glioma (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.13, 2.73).

38332006,"Epigenetic role of LINE-1 methylation and key genes in pregnancy maintenance.","Sci Rep","Spontaneous abortion is a pregnancy complication characterized by complex and multifactorial etiology. About 5% of childbearing women are globally affected by early pregnancy loss (EPL) and most of them experience recurrence (RPL). Epigenetic mechanisms and controlled inflammation are crucial for pregnancy maintenance and genetic predispositions may increase the risk affecting the maternal-fetal crosstalk. Combined analyses of global methylation, inflammation and inherited predispositions may contribute to define pregnancy loss etiopathogenesis. LINE-1 epigenetic regulation plays crucial roles during embryo implantation, and its hypomethylation has been associated with senescence and several complex diseases. By analysing a group of 230 women who have gone through pregnancy interruption and comparing those experiencing spontaneous EPL (n = 123; RPL, 54.5%) with a group of normal pregnant who underwent to voluntary interruption (VPI, n = 107), the single statistical analysis revealed significant lower (P < 0.00001) LINE-1 methylation and higher (P < 0.0001) mean cytokine levels (CKs: IL6, IL10, IL17A, IL23) in EPL. Genotyping of the following SNPs accounted for different EPL/RPL risk odds ratio: F13A1 rs5985 (OR = 0.24; 0.06-0.90); F13B rs6003 (OR = 0.23; 0.047-1.1); FGA rs6050 (OR = 0.58; 0.33-1.0); CRP rs2808635/rs876538 (OR = 0.15; 0.014-0.81); ABO rs657152 (OR = 0.48; 0.22-1.08); TP53 rs1042522 (OR = 0.54; 0.32-0.92); MTHFR rs1801133/rs1801131 (OR = 2.03; 1.2-3.47) and FGB rs1800790 (OR = 1.97; 1.01-3.87), although Bonferroni correction did not reach significant outputs. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and logistic regression disclosed further SNPs positive/negative associations (e.g. APOE rs7412/rs429358; FGB rs1800790; CFH rs1061170) differently arranged and sorted in four significant PCs: PC1 (F13A, methylation, CKs); PC3 (CRP, MTHFR, age, methylation); PC4 (F13B, FGA, FGB, APOE, TP53, age, methylation); PC6 (F13A, CFH, ABO, MTHFR, TP53, age), yielding further statistical power to the association models. In detail, positive EPL risk association was with PC1 (OR = 1.81; 1.33-2.45; P < 0.0001) and negative associations with PC3 (OR = 0.489; 0.37-0.66; P < 0.0001); PC4 (OR = 0.72; 0.55-0.94; P = 0.018) and PC6 (OR = 0.61; 0.46-0.81; P = 0.001). Moreover, significant inverse associations were detected between methylation and CKs levels in the whole group (rIL10 = - 0.22; rIL17A = - 0.25; rIL23 = - 0.19; rIL6 = - 0.22), and methylation with age in the whole group, EPL and RPL subgroups (r2TOT = 0.147; r2EPL = 0.136; r2RPL = 0.248), while VPI controls lost significance (r2VPI = 0.011).

38352440,"Assessing the genetic contribution of cumulative behavioral factors associated with longitudinal type 2 diabetes risk highlights adiposity and the brain-metabolic axis.","medRxiv","While genetic factors, behavior, and environmental exposures form a complex web of interrelated associations in type 2 diabetes (T2D), their interaction is poorly understood. Here, using data from ~500K participants of the UK Biobank, we identify the genetic determinants of a ""polyexposure risk score"" (PXS) a new risk factor that consists of an accumulation of 25 associated individual-level behaviors and environmental risk factors that predict longitudinal T2D incidence. PXS-T2D had a non-zero heritability (h2= 0.18) extensive shared genetic architecture with established clinical and biological determinants of T2D, most prominently with body mass index (genetic correlation [rg] = 0.57) and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (rg= 0.51). Genetic loci associated with PXS-T2D were enriched for expression in the brain. Biobank scale data with genetic information illuminates how complex and cumulative exposures and behaviors as a whole impact T2D risk but whose biology have been elusive in genome-wide studies of T2D.",2.57252962061441e-15
38409452,"Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance of Cardiovascular Diseases: A Network Medicine Perspective.","Matern Child Health J","The ability to identify early epigenetic signatures underlying the inheritance of cardiovascular risk, including trans- and intergenerational effects, may help to stratify people before cardiac symptoms occur.Prospective and retrospective cohorts and case-control studies focusing on DNA methylation and maternal/paternal effects were searched in Pubmed from 1997 to 2023 by using the following keywords: DNA methylation, genomic imprinting, and network analysis in combination with transgenerational/intergenerational effects.Maternal and paternal exposures to traditional cardiovascular risk factors during critical temporal windows, including the preconceptional period or early pregnancy, may perturb the plasticity of the epigenome (mainly DNA methylation) of the developing fetus especially at imprinted loci, such as the insulin-like growth factor type 2 (IGF2) gene. Thus, the epigenome is akin to a ""molecular archive"" able to memorize parental environmental insults and predispose an individual to cardiovascular diseases onset in later life. Direct evidence for human transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (at least three generations) of cardiovascular risk is lacking but it is supported by epidemiological studies. Several blood-based association studies showed potential intergenerational epigenetic effects (single-generation studies) which may mediate the transmittance of cardiovascular risk from parents to offspring.In this narrative review, we discuss some relevant examples of trans- and intergenerational epigenetic associations with cardiovascular risk. In our perspective, we propose three network-oriented approaches which may help to clarify the unsolved issues regarding transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of cardiovascular risk and provide potential early biomarkers for primary prevention.© 2024.

38374065,"Genetic influences on circulating retinol and its relationship to human health.","Nat Commun","Retinol is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an essential role in many biological processes throughout the human lifespan. Here, we perform the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of retinol to date in up to 22,274 participants. We identify eight common variant loci associated with retinol, as well as a rare-variant signal. An integrative gene prioritisation pipeline supports novel retinol-associated genes outside of the main retinol transport complex (RBP4:TTR) related to lipid biology, energy homoeostasis, and endocrine signalling. Genetic proxies of circulating retinol were then used to estimate causal relationships with almost 20,000 clinical phenotypes via a phenome-wide Mendelian randomisation study (MR-pheWAS). The MR-pheWAS suggests that retinol may exert causal effects on inflammation, adiposity, ocular measures, the microbiome, and MRI-derived brain phenotypes, amongst several others. Conversely, circulating retinol may be causally influenced by factors including lipids and serum creatinine. Finally, we demonstrate how a retinol polygenic score could identify individuals more likely to fall outside of the normative range of circulating retinol for a given age. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the genetics of circulating retinol, as well as revealing traits which should be prioritised for further investigation with respect to retinol related therapies or nutritional intervention.© 2024.

Whether exposure to green space, blue space, and the natural environment (GBN) is associated with risk of psychiatric disorders in middle-aged and older adults has not been prospectively examined.Longitudinal data from the UK biobank was used. At the study baseline (2006-2010), 363,047 participants (women: 53.4%; mean age 56.7 ± 8.1 years) who had not been previously diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder were included. Follow-up was achieved by collecting records from hospitals and death registers. Measurements of green and blue space modeled from land use data and natural environment from Land Cover Map were assigned to the residential address for each participant. Cox proportional hazard models with adjustment for potential confounders were used to explore the longitudinal associations between GBN and any psychiatric disorder and then by specific psychiatric disorders (dementia, substance abuse, psychotic disorder, depression, and anxiety) in middle-aged and older adults.During an average follow-up of 11.5 ± 2.8 years, 49,865 individuals were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders. Compared with the first tertile (lowest) of exposure, blue space at 300 m buffer [hazard ratio (HR): 0.973, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.952-0.994] and natural environment at 300 m buffer (HR: 0.970, 95% CI: 0.948-0.992) and at 1000 m buffer (HR: 0.975, 95% CI: 0.952-0.999) in the third tertile (highest) were significantly associated with lower risk of incident psychiatric disorders, respectively. The risk of incident dementia was statistically decreased when exposed to the third tertile (highest) of green space and natural environment at 1000 m buffer. The third tertile (highest) of green space at 300 m and 1000 m buffer and natural environment at 300 m and 1000 m buffer was associated with a reduction of 30.0%, 31.8%, 21.7%, and 30.3% in the risk of developing a psychotic disorder, respectively. Subgroup analysis suggested that the elderly, men, and those living with some comorbid conditions may derive greater benefits associated with exposure to GBN.This study suggests that GBN has significant benefits for lowering the risk of psychiatric disorders in middle-aged and older adults. Future studies are warranted to validate these findings and to understand the potential mechanistic pathways underpinning these novel findings.© 2023. The Author(s).",1.55154677804504e-15

Macronutrient intake was assessed via a validated food-frequency questionnaire to create low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) scores. Multivariate logistic regression models and subgroup analysis were performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI).After multivariable adjustment, participants with a high total low-carbohydrate diet score have a high risk of T2D (extreme-quartile OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.04-1.41; P = 0.007), whereas plant-based LCD score is not related to T2D risk. Among individuals with a BMI < 24 (extreme-quartile OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01-1.47; P < 0.001) or high levels of physical activity (extreme-quartile OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.17-1.72; P < 0.001), the animal-based LCD score is positively correlated with the risk of T2D.Among Chinese rural populations, high-fat-low carbohydrate diet is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. High intake of animal protein and fat also increases T2D risk in those who are overweight or have high physical activity.© 2024.

It is worth noting that the differences among sample batches in such a study are a mixture of technical confounders caused by batch effect and biological variations caused by condition effect. However, current batch effect removal methods often eliminate both technical batch effect and meaningful condition effect, while perturbation prediction methods solely focus on condition effect, resulting in inaccurate gene expression predictions due to unaccounted batch effect. Here we introduce scDisInFact, a deep learning framework that models both batch effect and condition effect in scRNA-seq data. scDisInFact learns latent factors that disentangle condition effect from batch effect, enabling it to simultaneously perform three tasks: batch effect removal, condition-associated key gene detection, and perturbation prediction. We evaluate scDisInFact on both simulated and real datasets, and compare its performance with baseline methods for each task. Our results demonstrate that scDisInFact outperforms existing methods that focus on individual tasks, providing a more comprehensive and accurate approach for integrating and predicting multi-batch multi-condition single-cell RNA-sequencing data.© 2024.

Male Wistar rats, aged eight weeks and weighing 250-300 g, were randomly assigned into four groups: a control group (Healthy, n = 8), streptozocin-induced rats (STZ group, n = 8), HM + STZ group (n = 8), and the Tangshen Formula (TSF) treatment group (TSF group, n = 8). Blood glucose levels and other metabolic indicators were monitored before treatment and at four-week intervals until 12 weeks. Total DNA was extracted from the aforementioned groups, and DNA methylation landscapes were analyzed via reduced representative bisulfite sequencing.Both the STZ group and HM + STZ group exhibited increased blood glucose levels and urinary albumin/creatinine ratios in comparison with the control group. Notably, the HM + STZ group exhibited a markedly elevated urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (411.90 ± 88.86 mg/g) compared to the STZ group (238.41 ± 62.52 mg/g). TSF-treated rats demonstrated substantial reductions in both blood glucose levels and urinary albumin/creatinine ratios in comparison with the HM + STZ group. In-depth analysis of DNA methylation profiles revealed 797 genes with potential therapeutic effects related to TSF, among which approximately 2.3% had been previously reported as homologous genes.While HM exacerbates DN through altered methylation patterns at specific CpG sites, TSF holds promise as a viable treatment for DN by restoring abnormal methylation levels. The identification of specific genes provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of DN pathogenesis and offers potential therapeutic targets for further investigation.© 2023.

38343778,"A genomic predictor for age at sexual maturity for mammalian species.","Evol Appl","Age at sexual maturity is a key life history trait that can be used to predict population growth rates and develop life history models. In many wild animal species, the age at sexual maturity is not accurately quantified. This results in a reduced ability to accurately model demography of wild populations. Recent studies have indicated the potential for CpG density within gene promoters to be predictive of other life history traits, specifically maximum lifespan. Here, we have developed a machine learning model using gene promoter CpG density to predict the mean age at sexual maturity in mammalian species. In total, 91 genomes were used to identify 101 unique gene promoters predictive of age at sexual maturity across males and females. We found these gene promoters to be most predictive of age at sexual maturity in females (R2 = 0.881) compared to males (R2 = 0.758). The median absolute error rate was also found to be lower in females (0.427 years) compared to males (0.785 years). This model provides a novel method for species-level age at sexual maturity prediction without the need for long-term monitoring. This study also highlights a potential epigenetic mechanism for the onset of sexual maturity, indicating the possibility of using epigenetic biomarkers for this important life history trait.© 2024 The Authors.

Several methods have been proposed to deal with mediation in high-dimensional settings, including methods that incorporate dimensionality reduction techniques to the mediation algorithm.

However, those advances have been mostly limited to transcriptomic data. With recent developments in single-cell DNA methylation (scDNAm), there are emerging opportunities for deconvolving bulk DNAm data, particularly for solid tissues like brain that lack cell-type references. Due to technical limitations, current scDNAm sequences represent a small proportion of the whole genome for each single cell, and those detected regions differ across cells. This makes scDNAm data ultra-high dimensional and ultra-sparse. To deal with these challenges, we introduce scMD (single cell Methylation Deconvolution), a cellular deconvolution framework to reliably estimate cell type fractions from tissue-level DNAm data. To analyze large-scale complex scDNAm data, scMD employs a statistical approach to aggregate scDNAm data at the cell cluster level, identify cell-type marker DNAm sites, and create precise cell-type signature matrixes that surpass state-of-the-art sorted-cell or RNA-derived references. Through thorough benchmarking in several datasets, we demonstrate scMD's superior performance in estimating cellular fractions from bulk DNAm data. With scMD-estimated cellular fractions, we identify cell type fractions and cell type-specific differentially methylated cytosines associated with Alzheimer's disease.© 2024.

However, the mechanism of DNA methylation regulation regarding sex reversal in invertebrates is unclear. In this study, we used whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to map single-base resolution methylation profiles of the Pacific oyster, including female-to-male (FMa-to-FMb) and male-to-female (MFa-to-MFb) sex reversal, as well as sex non-reversed males and females (MMa-to-MMb and FFa-to-FFb). The results showed that global DNA methylation levels increase during female-to-male sex reversals, with a particular increase in the proportion of high methylation levels (mCGs >0.75) and a decrease in the proportion of intermediate methylation levels (0.25 < mCGs <0.75). This increase in DNA methylation was mainly associated with the elevated expression of DNA methylase genes. Genome-wide methylation patterns of females were accurately remodeled to those of males after sex reversal, while the opposite was true for the male-to-female reversal. Those findings directly indicate that alterations in DNA methylation play a significant role in sex reversal in Pacific oysters. Comparative analysis of the DNA methylomes of pre- and post- sex reversal gonadal tissues (FMb-vs-FMa or MFb-vs-MFa) revealed that differentially methylated genes were mainly involved in the biological processes of sex determination or gonadal development. However critical genes such as Dmrt1, Foxl2 and Sox-like, which are involved in the putative sex determination pathway in Pacific oysters, showed almost an absence of methylation modifications, varying greatly from vertebrates. Additionally, comparative analysis of the DNA methylomes of sexual reversal and sex non-reversal (FMa-vs-FFa or MFa-vs-MMa) revealed that heat shock protein genes, such as Hsp68-like and Hsp70B, were important for the occurrence of sex reversal.

Here a perspective on the past, recent process, and future of precise DNA methylation tools is provided. Specifically, genome-wide and site-specific manipulation of DNA methylation methods is discussed, with an emphasis on their principles, limitations, applications, and future developmental directions.© 2023 The Authors.

38383592,"Blood and urine multi-omics analysis of the impact of e-vaping, smoking, and cessation: from exposome to molecular responses.","Sci Rep","Cigarette smoking is a major preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. While quitting smoking is the best option, switching from cigarettes to non-combustible alternatives (NCAs) such as e-vapor products is a viable harm reduction approach for smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke. A key challenge for the clinical assessment of NCAs is that self-reported product use can be unreliable, compromising the proper evaluation of their risk reduction potential. In this cross-sectional study of 205 healthy volunteers, we combined comprehensive exposure characterization with in-depth multi-omics profiling to compare effects across four study groups: cigarette smokers (CS), e-vapor users (EV), former smokers (FS), and never smokers (NS). Multi-omics analyses included metabolomics, transcriptomics, DNA methylomics, proteomics, and lipidomics. Comparison of the molecular effects between CS and NS recapitulated several previous observations, such as increased inflammatory markers in CS. Generally, FS and EV demonstrated intermediate molecular effects between the NS and CS groups. Stratification of the FS and EV by combustion exposure markers suggested that this position on the spectrum between CS and NS was partially driven by non-compliance/dual use. Overall, this study highlights the importance of in-depth exposure characterization before biological effect characterization for any NCA assessment study.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.61439136909845e-16

We then leverage the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) longitudinal twin study to examine the properties and nomological network of different statistical representations of p. We find that p performed similarly regardless of how it was modelled, suggesting that if the sample and content are the same the resulting p factor will be similar. We suggest that the meaning of p is not to be found by dueling over statistical models but by conducting well-specified criterion-validation studies and developing new measurement approaches.

Herein, we describe five new IMT cases from four females and one male with three harboring an EWSR1::CREM fusion and two featuring an EWSR1::ATF1 fusion. Uniform manifold approximation and projection of DNA methylation array data placed two cases to the methylation class ""IMT, subclass B"", one to ""meningioma-benign"" and one to ""meningioma-intermediate"". A literature review identified 74 cases of IMTs (current five cases included) with a median age of 23 years (range 4-79 years) and a slight female predominance (female/male ratio = 1.55). Among the confirmed fusions, 25 (33.8%) featured an EWSR1::ATF1 fusion, 24 (32.4%) EWSR1::CREB1, 23 (31.1%) EWSR1::CREM, one (1.4%) FUS::CREM, and one (1.4%) EWSR1::CREB3L3. Among 66 patients with follow-up information available (median: 17 months; range: 1-158 months), 26 (39.4%) experienced progression/recurrences (median 10.5 months; range 0-120 months). Ultimately, three patients died of disease, all of whom underwent a subtotal resection for an EWSR1::ATF1 fusion-positive tumor. Outcome analysis revealed subtotal resection as an independent factor associated with a significantly shorter progression free survival (PFS; median: 12 months) compared with gross total resection (median: 60 months; p < 0.001). A younger age (< 14 years) was associated with a shorter PFS (median: 9 months) compared with an older age (median: 49 months; p < 0.05). Infratentorial location was associated with a shorter overall survival compared with supratentorial (p < 0.05). In addition, the EWSR1::ATF1 fusion appeared to be associated with a shorter overall survival compared with the other fusions (p < 0.05). In conclusion, IMT is a locally aggressive tumor with a high recurrence rate. Potential risk factors include subtotal resection, younger age, infratentorial location, and possibly EWSR1::ATF1 fusion. Larger case series are needed to better define prognostic determinants in these tumors.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.13864705284293e-16

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we analyzed single-cell transcriptional data of cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) from fetuses of healthy and GDM mothers, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from children and adolescents, and coronary plaques myeloid cells from atherosclerosis. Our results demonstrated that monocytes in cord blood were characterized with down-regulated proinflammatory-related pathways and up-regulated proliferation-related pathways. And monocytes in cord blood from GDM mothers were featured with expanded CXCL8+IL1B+ subclusters, enhanced crosstalk with neutrophil granulocytes and augmented adhesive and phagocytic abilities. Interestingly, CXCL8+IL1B+ monocytes influenced by GDM had transcriptome similarity with those of coronary plaques myeloid cells from individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Stunting results from early-life adversity and it is associated with significant physical and cognitive deficit, lifelong socioeconomic disadvantage and reduced life expectancy. There is a need to understand the causes of stunting and its effects in order to develop strategies to avoid it and to mitigate the consequences once stunting has occurred. Epigenetics is an important mechanism through which early-life factors are thought to influence biological function, with long-term consequences. We describe a series of epigenetic studies designed to understand how early-life adversity results in stunting and to inform the development of practical tools such as predictive markers and therapeutic targets. This work is part of the UKRI GCRF Action Against Stunting Hub.The project-in India, Indonesia and Senegal-comprises an observational study of mothers, fathers, and offspring (n=500) spanning the first 1000 days of life, and an intervention study in each country. Epigenetic status (DNA methylation) is determined in saliva from babies collected within 1 month of birth and again at 18 months of age, and from mothers and fathers around the time of birth. Epigenome-wide analysis is carried out using the Illumina EPIC array, augmented by high-definition sequencing approaches. Statistical analysis is carried out at the level of candidate genes/regions, higher dimensional epigenetic states and epigenome-wide association. Data analysis focuses on the determinants of stunting, the effectiveness of interventions, population comparisons and the link between epigenetics and other thematic areas, which include anthropometry, microbiome, gut health, parasitology, cognition, nutrition, food hygiene and water sanitation, food systems and the home environment.This study has been approved by the relevant Ethics Committees in Indonesia, India and Senegal, and the UK.

A recent study by Takahashi et al. provides evidence for this mode of inheritance in mice by using a CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenetic editing technique to modify DNA methylation levels at specific promoters and then demonstrating the inheritance of the gain in methylation in offspring. In this technical commentary, we argue that the method used in the original study inherently amplifies the likelihood of genetic changes that thereafter lead to the heritability of epigenetic changes. We provide evidence that genetic changes from multiple sources do indeed occur in these experiments and explore several avenues by which these changes could be causal to the apparent inheritance of epigenetic changes. We conclude a genetic basis of inheritance cannot be ruled out and thus transgenerational epigenetic inheritance has not been adequately established by the original study.",7.99645026358104e-17

As experimentally derived cell counts are often unavailable, computational solutions have been adopted to estimate the proportion of different cell types using DNA methylation data. Here, we validate and profile the use of an expanded reference DNA methylation dataset incorporating two neuronal and three glial cell subtypes for quantifying the cellular composition of the human cortex.We tested eight reference panels containing different combinations of neuronal- and glial cell types and characterised their performance in deconvoluting cell proportions from computationally reconstructed or empirically derived human cortex DNA methylation data. Our analyses demonstrate that while these novel brain deconvolution models produce accurate estimates of cellular proportions from profiles generated on postnatal human cortex samples, they are not appropriate for the use in prenatal cortex or cerebellum tissue samples. Applying our models to an extensive collection of empirical datasets, we show that glial cells are twice as abundant as neuronal cells in the human cortex and identify significant associations between increased Alzheimer's disease neuropathology and the proportion of specific cell types including a decrease in NeuNNeg/SOX10Neg nuclei and an increase of NeuNNeg/SOX10Pos nuclei.Our novel deconvolution models produce accurate estimates for cell proportions in the human cortex.

We recently reported that YY1 regulates nucleosome organization in early mouse embryos. However, despite the impaired nucleosome organization in the absence of YY1, the transcriptome was minimally affected in eight-cell embryos.

We found that a substantial number of genes are aberrantly expressed in the absence of YY1. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that YY1 is required for the transcription of LINE-1 retrotransposons.Copyright: © 2024 by the authors.",6.99229432365001e-17

The diseases are hypothesized to share a genetic predisposition1-7, but few studies have sought to uncover the genetic underpinnings of GDM. Most studies have evaluated the impact of T2D loci only8-10, and the three prior genome-wide association studies of GDM11-13have identified only five loci, limiting the power to assess to what extent variants or biological pathways are specific to GDM. We conducted the largest genome-wide association study of GDM to date in 12,332 cases and 131,109 parous female controls in the FinnGen study and identified 13 GDM-associated loci, including nine new loci. Genetic features distinct from T2D were identified both at the locus and genomic scale. Our results suggest that the genetics of GDM risk falls into the following two distinct categories: one part conventional T2D polygenic risk and one part predominantly influencing mechanisms disrupted in pregnancy.

Cystoscopy and/or contrast-enhanced imaging are the gold standard tools for UBC diagnosis, despite limited by being invasive, expensive and low yield in small flat tumors.To assess the diagnostic performance of urine-based DNA methylation of six genes (GATA4, P16, P14, APC, CDH1 and CD99) for UBC detection in patients with hematuria.Voided urine was collected from consecutive patients presented with hematuria for urine cytology and DNA methylation assay of the assigned genes using methylation-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Further assessment by office cystoscopy and imaging with subsequent inpatient cystoscopic biopsy for positive findings was done. The diagnostic characteristics of DNA methylation and urine cytology were assessed based on its capability to predict UBC.We included 246 patients in the study with identified macroscopic hematuria in 204 (82.9%) patients. Positive cytology was found in 78 (31.7%) patients. DNA methylation of GATA4, P16, P14, APC, CDH1 and CD99 genes was identified in 127 (51.6%), 52 (21.1%), 117 (47.6%), 106 (43.1%), 90 (36.6%) and 71 (28.9%) patients, respectively. The sensitivity of the assigned genes for UBC detection ranges from 35% (95%CI: 31-39) to 83% (95%CI: 79-87). Optimal specificity (SP) (100%) was noted for P16, APC and CDH1 genes.

We derived a novel, broadly applicable statistical method to quantify cancer-indicative methylation patterns within cfDNA to estimate ctDNA abundance, even at low levels. Our algorithm identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between a reference database of cancer tissue biopsy samples and cfDNA from individuals without cancer. Then, without utilizing matched tissue biopsy, counts of fragments matching the cancer-indicative hyper/hypo-methylated patterns within DMRs were used to determine a tumor methylated fraction (TMeF; a methylation-based quantification of the circulating tumor allele fraction and estimate of ctDNA abundance) for plasma samples. TMeF and small variant allele fraction (SVAF) estimates of the same cancer plasma samples were correlated (Spearman's correlation coefficient: 0.73), and synthetic dilutions to expected TMeF of 10-3and 10-4had estimated TMeF within two-fold for 95% and 77% of samples, respectively. TMeF increased with cancer stage and tumor size and inversely correlated with survival probability. Therefore, tumor-derived fragments in the cfDNA of patients with cancer can be leveraged to estimate ctDNA abundance without the need for a tumor biopsy, which may provide non-invasive clinical approximations of tumor burden.",6.2745342144915e-17

Data on AFB1 concentrations in peanuts, quantities of peanut consumption, and the weights of the children were obtained from the literature. Generally, MOE values were below the safe margin of 10,000, ranging between 3.68 and 0.14, 754.34 and 27.33, and 11,428.57 and 419.05 for the high (0.0466 ng/kg), median (0.00023 ng/kg), and low (0.000015 ng/kg) AFB1 concentration levels, respectively.

Participants in a single experimental session completed a questionnaire on sociodemographic, health, eyesight, and driving information. They also performed the ADEMd and UFOV tests randomly following standardized protocols. The ADEMd is a visual-verbal test that measures saccadic efficiency and visual attention. Brown-Forsythe (B-F) tests with Games-Howell post-hoc adjustments were conducted to assess differences between groups. Groups were formed according to sex, age (young adults, adults, and older adults), and driver/non-driver for further analysis. Additionally, associations between dependent variables were assessed through Spearman's correlations.Drivers obtained significantly better results in the ADEMd compared with non-drivers. Non-significant differences between drivers and non-drivers were encountered in the UFOV. Additionally, significant differences were observed between sexes and age groups. It is worth highlighting that non-driver's age significantly correlated with worse ADEMd performance (rho = .637 to .716). This correlation was non-significant in drivers. Similarly, reading hours significantly correlated with better ADEMd performance in non-drivers (rho = - .291 to - .363), but not in drivers. The only significant correlations between ADEMd and UFOV tests were found in drivers (rho = .307 to .410).Considering all the discussed results, it could be hypothesized that the driving task promotes abilities, such as oculomotor and cognitive function, which are relevant for the performance in the ADEMd.

This Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis applies genetic tools to represent the aggregated statistical results of exposure to circadian rhythm disorders and UC and its comorbidities, allowing for causal inferences.Summary statistics of protein, DNA methylation and gene expression quantitative trait loci in individuals of European ancestry (pQTL, mQTL, and eQTL, respectively) were used. Genetic variants located within or near 152 circadian clock-related genes and closely related to circadian rhythm disorders were selected as instrumental variables. Causal relationships with UC and its comorbidities were then estimated through employed Summary data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and Inverse-Variance-Weighted MR (IVW-MR).Through preliminary SMR analysis, we identified a potential causal relationship between circadian clock-related genes and UC along with its comorbidities, which was further confirmed by IVW-MR analysis.

38352518,"Early life adversity drives sex-dependent changes in 5-mC DNA methylation of parvalbumin cells in the prefrontal cortex in rats.","bioRxiv","Early life adversity (ELA) can result in increased risk for developing affective disorders, such as anxiety or depression, later in life, with women showing increased risk. Interactions between an individual's genes and their environment play key roles in producing, as well as mitigating, later life neuropathology. Our current understanding of the underlying epigenomic drivers of ELA associated anxiety and depression are limited, and this stems in part from the complexity of underlying biochemical processes associated with how early experiences shapes later life behavior. Epigenetic alterations, or experience-driven modifications to DNA, can be leveraged to understand the interplay between genes and the environment. The present study characterized DNA methylation patterning, assessed via evaluation of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), following ELA in a Sprague Dawley rat model of ELA induced by early caregiver deprivation. This study utilized maternal separation to investigate sex- and age-specific outcomes of ELA on epigenetic patterning in parvalbumin (PV)-containing interneurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a subpopulation of inhibitory neurons which are associated with ELA and affective dysfunction. While global analysis of 5-mC methylation and CpG site specific pyrosequencing of the PV promoter, Pvalb, showed no obvious effects of ELA, when analyses were restricted to assessing 5-mC intensity in colocalized PV cells, there were significant sex and age dependent effects. We found that ELA leads sex-specific changes in PV cell counts, and that cell counts can be predicted by 5-mC intensity, with males and females showing distinct patterns of methylation and PV outcomes. ELA also produced sex-specific effects in corticosterone reactivity, with juvenile females showing a blunted stress hormone response compared to controls. Overall, ELA led to a sex-specific developmental shift in PV profile, which is comparable to profiles that are seen at a later developmental timepoint, and this shift may be mediated in part by epigenomic alterations driven by altered DNA methylation.",2.09370653134953e-17
38168361,"Personalized Pangenome References.","bioRxiv","Pangenomes, by including genetic diversity, should reduce reference bias by better representing new samples compared to them. Yet when comparing a new sample to a pangenome, variants in the pangenome that are not part of the sample can be misleading, for example, causing false read mappings. These irrelevant variants are generally rarer in terms of allele frequency, and have previously been dealt with using allele frequency filters. However, this is a blunt heuristic that both fails to remove some irrelevant variants and removes many relevant variants. We propose a new approach, inspired by local ancestry inference methods, that imputes a personalized pangenome subgraph based on sampling local haplotypes according tok-mer counts in the reads. Our approach is tailored for the Giraffe short read aligner, as the indexes it needs for read mapping can be built quickly. We compare the accuracy of our approach to state-of-the-art methods using graphs from the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium. The resulting personalized pangenome pipelines provide faster pangenome read mapping than comparable pipelines that use a linear reference, reduce small variant genotyping errors by 4x relative to the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) best-practice pipeline, and for the first time make short-read structural variant genotyping competitive with long-read discovery methods.",1.93644951503943e-17

Previous studies have demonstrated the impact of epigenomic analyses in the diagnostics of sellar neoplasms and characterized the close relationship of epigenomic signatures and cellular origins of PitNET/adenomas. As of today, little is known about the pathogenesis of ectopic PitNET/adenomas, and epigenomic analyses have not been performed in these rare tumors. We report on the clinical course of an 81-year-old patient with sphenoid ectopic sparsely granulated corticotroph PitNET/adenoma and deploy genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to compare its methylation profile to a reference cohort of sellar neoplasms. Genome-wide methylation analysis revealed an epigenomic profile analogous to reference sellar corticotroph PitNET/adenomas, and the copy number variation profile showed loss of chromosomes 18 and 22. The methylation profile shows concordance with sellar corticotroph PitNET/adenomas suggesting a common cellular origin and confirming the reliability of methylation analyses as a diagnostic method in these rare tumors. This is the first data suggesting that epigenetic profiles of ectopic PitNET/adenoma do not differ from their sellar counterparts.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.92053252076085e-17

Although the past few years have witnessed significant scientific progress, the potential relationship between COPD and mental illness remains a subject of debate.We retrieved COPD data from the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) directory and data on mental illnesses, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, panic disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, multiple disabilities, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia, from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was applied to explore the association between COPD and mental illnesses, with subgroup analyses based on smoking history.Our two-sample MR analysis revealed no causal link between overall COPD and the development of common psychiatric disorders. Subgroup analyses based on smoking history showed no causal association between never-smokers with COPD and the occurrence of psychiatric disorders. However, ever-smokers with COPD were associated with a significantly increased risk of ADHD (OR: 2.303, 95% CI: 1.558-3.403, P = 0.001) and a modestly reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (OR: 0.994, 95% CI: 0.988-0.999, P = 0.034).COPD patients with a history of smoking face a higher risk of developing ADHD but may experience a slight reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, there was no observed causal association between COPD and psychiatric disorders among patients who never smoked.© 2024 Zhang et al.",1.76049946934564e-17

High-grade CRC tended to exhibit elevated methylation levels in gene promoter regions compared to those in low-grade CRC. Combined with RNA-seq gene expression data, we identified 14 methylation-regulated differentially expressed genes, of which onlyAGTR1andNECAB1methylation had prognostic significance.Our results suggest that genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation occur during the early stages of CRC and demonstrate the methylation signatures associated with colorectal ADEs and CRC, suggesting prognostic biomarkers for CRC.©The Author(s) 2024.

In the present report, we develop a method, GIFT (gene-based integrative fine-mapping through conditional TWAS), that performs conditional TWAS analysis by explicitly controlling for GReX of all other genes residing in a local region to fine-map putatively causal genes. GIFT is frequentist in nature, explicitly models both expression correlation and cis-single nucleotide polymorphism linkage disequilibrium across multiple genes and uses a likelihood framework to account for expression prediction uncertainty. As a result, GIFT produces calibrated P values and is effective for fine-mapping. We apply GIFT to analyze six traits in the UK Biobank, where GIFT narrows down the set size of putatively causal genes by 32.16-91.32% compared with existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches. The genes identified by GIFT highlight the importance of vessel regulation in determining blood pressures and lipid metabolism for regulating lipid levels.© 2024.

Popular methods such as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) are commonly used for visualizing cell clusters; however, it is well known that t-SNE and UMAP's 2D embeddings might not reliably inform the similarities among cell clusters. Motivated by this challenge, we present a statistical method, scDEED, for detecting dubious cell embeddings output by a 2D-embedding method. By calculating a reliability score for every cell embedding based on the similarity between the cell's 2D-embedding neighbors and pre-embedding neighbors, scDEED identifies the cell embeddings with low reliability scores as dubious and those with high reliability scores as trustworthy. Moreover, by minimizing the number of dubious cell embeddings, scDEED provides intuitive guidance for optimizing the hyperparameters of an embedding method. We show the effectiveness of scDEED on multiple datasets for detecting dubious cell embeddings and optimizing the hyperparameters of t-SNE and UMAP.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.04307888528608e-17

Studies have demonstrated the significance of genetic risk factors in the progression of CKD. Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) may be implicated in the development of CKD. This study aimed to investigate the correlation betweenTERTgene variants and susceptibility to CKD in the Chinese population. A total of 507 patients with CKD and 510 healthy controls were recruited for this case-control study. Four candidate loci were identified using the MassARRAY platform. Logistic regression analysis was employed to assess the association betweenTERTgene variants and the risk of CKD. The false positive reporting probability (FPRP) method was utilized to evaluate the validity of statistically significant associations. The multifactorial dimensionality reduction (MDR) method was used to evaluate the interaction between SNPs and the risk of CKD. Furthermore, discrepancies in the clinical features of subjects with diverse genotypes were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Our findings revealed a correlation between rs2735940 and rs4635969 and an increased risk of CKD. Stratification analysis indicated that rs4635969 was related to an increased risk of CKD in different subgroups (age ≤ 50 years and male).

These inconsistencies might stem not only from the heterogeneous nature of the disorder, but also from the unbalanced focus on particular cortical regions and protein-coding genes. Compared to protein-coding transcripts, long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) display substantially greater brain region and disease response specificity, positioning them as prospective indicators of SZ-associated alterations. Further, a growing understanding of the systemic character of the disorder calls for a more systematic screening involving multiple diverse brain regions.We aimed to identify and interpret alterations of the lincRNA expression profiles in SZ by examining the transcriptomes of 35 brain regions.We measured the transcriptome of 35 brain regions dissected from eight adult brain specimens, four SZ patients, and four healthy controls, using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Analysis of these data yielded 861 annotated human lincRNAs passing the detection threshold.Of the 861 detected lincRNA, 135 showed significant region-dependent expression alterations in SZ (two-way ANOVA, BH-adjustedp0.05) and 37 additionally showed significant differential expression between HC and SZ individuals in at least one region (post hocTukey test,p0.05). For these 37 differentially expressed lincRNAs (DELs), 88% of the differences occurred in a cluster of brain regions containing axon-rich brain regions and cerebellum. Functional annotation of the DEL targets further revealed stark enrichment in neurons and synaptic transmission terms and pathways.Our study highlights the utility of a systematic brain transcriptome analysis relying on the expression profiles measured across multiple brain regions and singles out white matter regions as a prospective target for further SZ research.Copyright © 2023, Nguyen T., Efimova O.I., Tokarchuk A.V., Morozova A.Y., Zorkina Y.A., Andreyuk D.S., Kostyuk G.P., Khaitovich P.E.",6.79729346018561e-18

Studying previously revealed and objective biomarkers of early life stress exposure, such as telomere length (TL), glucocorticoid receptor gene DNA methylation (DNAme), and the volume of brain structures involved in the regulation of HPA axis functioning (the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the medial prefrontal cortex), in relation to academic performance is crucial. This approach provides an objective measure that surpasses the limitations of self-reported early life adversity and reveals potential molecular and neurological targets for interventions to enhance academic outcomes.The participants were 52 children of Mexican or Central American origin aged 11.6-15.6 years. DNA methylation levels and TL were analyzed in three cell sources: saliva, whole blood, and T cells derived from whole blood.Overall, the concordance across three systems of stress-related biomarkers (TL, DNAme, and the brain) was observed to some extent, although it was less pronounced than we expected; no consistency in different cell sources was revealed. Each of the academic domains that we studied was characterized by a unique and distinct complex of associations with biomarkers, both in terms of the type of biomarker, the directionality of the observed effects, and the cell source of biomarkers. Furthermore, there were biomarker-by-sex interaction effects in predicting academic performance measures.Assessed in an understudied youth sample, these preliminary data present new essential evidence for a deepened understanding of the biological mechanisms behind associations between exposure to early life stress and academic performance.© 2024 The Authors.

To address PS, principal component regression (PCR) and linear mixed model (LMM) are the current standards for SNP associations, which are also commonly borrowed for haplotype studies. However, the underfitting and overfitting problems introduced by PCR and LMM, respectively, have yet to be addressed. Furthermore, there have been only a few theoretical approaches proposed to address PS specifically for haplotypes. In this paper, we propose a new method under the Bayesian LASSO framework, QBLstrat, to account for PS in identifying rare and common haplotypes associated with a continuous trait of interest. QBLstrat utilizes a large number of principal components (PCs) with appropriate priors to sufficiently correct for PS, while shrinking the estimates of unassociated haplotypes and PCs. We compare the performance of QBLstrat with the Bayesian counterparts of PCR and LMM and a current method, haplo.stats.

The deviation from that normative aging trajectory may provide some insights into neurological diseases. In neuroimaging, predicted brain age is widely used to analyze different diseases. However, using only the brain age gap information (i.e., the difference between the chronological age and the estimated age) can be not enough informative for disease classification problems. In this paper, we propose to extend the notion of global brain age by estimating brain structure ages using structural magnetic resonance imaging. To this end, an ensemble of deep learning models is first used to estimate a 3D aging map (i.e., voxel-wise age estimation). Then, a 3D segmentation mask is used to obtain the final brain structure ages. This biomarker can be used in several situations. First, it enables to accurately estimate the brain age for the purpose of anomaly detection at the population level. In this situation, our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. Second, brain structure ages can be used to compute the deviation from the normal aging process of each brain structure. This feature can be used in a multi-disease classification task for an accurate differential diagnosis at the subject level. Finally, the brain structure age deviations of individuals can be visualized, providing some insights about brain abnormality and helping clinicians in real medical contexts.© 2024 The Authors.

Using the UK Biobank, we address these questions separately for bisexual behavior (BSB) and exclusive SSB (eSSB) after confirming their genetic distinction. We discover that male BSB is genetically positively correlated with the number of offspring. This unexpected phenomenon is attributable to the horizontal pleiotropy of male risk-taking behavior-associated alleles because male risk-taking behavior is genetically positively correlated with both BSB and the number of offspring and because genetically controlling male risk-taking behavior abolishes the genetic correlation between male BSB and the number of offspring. By contrast, eSSB is genetically negatively correlated with the number of offspring.

The main aim of this study is to examine the association between rs2268498 and rs53576, two functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and verbal and non-verbal ToM in children and adolescents with ASD and a group of typically developing youth.The study involved 44 children and adolescents with high-functioning ASD aged 8 to 18 years old and 44 TD individuals who were matched on age and sex. In all participants, blood samples were collected and rs2268498 and rs53576 were genotyped. Happe's Strange Stories test and the moving shapes paradigm were used to measure verbal and non-verbal ToM in all participants.The results of permutation tests and logistic regression suggested that in TD group, rs2268498 AA carriers showed significant higher scores in variables representing verbal ToM (ToM stories and appropriateness score) whereas, in ASD group, rs53576 AA carriers exhibited significant better performance in parameters related to non-verbal ToM (ToM general rule and intentionality score). The results of hierarchical clustering in both groups support the findings by distinguishing between language-related and language-independent aspects of ToM.In the present study, we examined the association between rs2268498 and rs53576 and social functioning in individuals with ASD and TD group.

The level of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in tissue is independently associated with overall survival (OS) in lung cancer patients. We explored the prognostic value of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 5hmC through genome-wide analysis of 5hmC in plasma samples from 97 lung cancer patients. In both training and validation sets, we discovered a cfDNA 5hmC signature significantly associated with OS in lung cancer patients. We built a 5hmC prognostic model and calculated the weighted predictive scores (wp-score) for each sample. Low wp-scores were significantly associated with longer OS compared to high wp-scores in the training [median 22.9 versus 8.2 months;p= 1.30 × 10-10; hazard ratio (HR) 0.04; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.00-0.16] and validation (median 18.8 versus 5.2 months;p= 0.00059; HR 0.22; 95% CI: 0.09-0.57) sets. The 5hmC signature independently predicted prognosis and outperformed age, sex, smoking, and TNM stage for predicting lung cancer outcomes.

Here, we describe a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomic approach which distinguishes non-malignant, pre-malignant and malignant forms of NF1 PNST. Using plasma samples from a novel cohort of 101 NF1 patients and 21 healthy controls, we validated that our previous cfDNA copy number alteration (CNA)-based approach identifies malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) but cannot distinguish among benign and premalignant states. We therefore investigated the ability of fragment-based cfDNA features to differentiate NF1-associated tumors including binned genome-wide fragment length ratios, end motif analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization deconvolution of fragment lengths. Fragmentomic methods were able to differentiate pre-malignant states including atypical neurofibromas (AN).

38282013,"The role of mitochondrial DNA copy number in cardiometabolic disease: a bidirectional two-sample mendelian randomization study.","Cardiovasc Diabetol","This study used a bidirectional 2-sample Mendelian randomization study to investigate the potential causal links between mtDNA copy number and cardiometabolic disease (obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, type 2 diabetes [T2DM], coronary artery disease [CAD], stroke, ischemic stroke, and heart failure).Genetic associations with mtDNA copy number were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from the UK biobank (n = 395,718) and cardio-metabolic disease were from largest available GWAS summary statistics. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was conducted, with weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO as sensitivity analyses. We repeated this in the opposite direction using instruments for cardio-metabolic disease.Genetically predicted mtDNA copy number was not associated with risk of obesity (P = 0.148), hypertension (P = 0.515), dyslipidemia (P = 0.684), T2DM (P = 0.631), CAD (P = 0.199), stroke (P = 0.314), ischemic stroke (P = 0.633), and heart failure (P = 0.708). Regarding the reverse directions, we only found that genetically predicted dyslipidemia was associated with decreased levels of mtDNA copy number in the IVW analysis (β= - 0.060, 95% CI - 0.044 to - 0.076; P = 2.416e-14) and there was suggestive of evidence for a potential causal association between CAD and mtDNA copy number (β= - 0.021, 95% CI - 0.003 to - 0.039; P = 0.025). Sensitivity and replication analyses showed the stable findings.Findings of this Mendelian randomization study did not support a causal effect of mtDNA copy number in the development of cardiometabolic disease, but found dyslipidemia and CAD can lead to reduced mtDNA copy number. These findings have implications for mtDNA copy number as a biomarker of dyslipidemia and CAD in clinical practice.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.56523184097329e-18

38231285,NA,NA,"This study aimed to evaluate the epigenetic reprogramming of ICR1 (KvDMR1) and ICR2 (H19DMR) and expression of genes controlled by them as well as those involved in methylation, demethylation, and pluripotency.We collected germinal vesicle (GV) and metaphase II (MII) oocytes, and preimplantation embryos at five stages [zygote, 4-8 cells, 8-16 cells, morula, and expanded blastocysts (ExB)]. DNA methylation was assessed by BiSeq, and the gene expression was evaluated using qPCR.H19DMR showed an increased DNA methylation from GV to MII oocytes (68.04% and 98.05%, respectively), decreasing in zygotes (85.83%) until morula (61.65%), and ExB (63.63%). H19 and IGF2 showed increased expression in zygotes, which decreased in further stages. KvDMR1 was hypermethylated in both GV (71.82%) and MII (69.43%) and in zygotes (73.70%) up to morula (77.84%), with a loss of methylation at the ExB (36.64%). The zygote had higher expression of most genes, except for CDKN1C and PHLDA2, which were highly expressed in MII and GV oocytes, respectively. DNMTs showed increased expression in oocytes, followed by a reduction in the earliest stages of embryo development. TET1 was downregulated until 4-8-cell and upregulated in 8-16-cell embryos. TET2 and TET3 showed higher expression in oocytes, and a downregulation in MII oocytes and 4-8-cell embryo.We highlighted the heterogeneity in the DNA methylation of H19DMR and KvDMR1 and a dynamic expression pattern of genes controlled by them. The expression of DNMTs and TETs genes was also dynamic owing to epigenetic reprogramming.© 2024.

However, establishing a causal relationship between oxidative stress and glaucoma is challenging due to confounding and reverse causality. In this study, we performed bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses based on genetic instrumental variables as proxies for 11 biomarkers of oxidative stress injury to investigate the causal relationship between oxidative stress and glaucoma. Eight significant associations were identified. Increased circulating levels of catalase (OR = 0.915, 95 % CI: 0.848-0.987,P = 0.022), retinol (OR = 0.481, 95 % CI: 0.248-0.932,P = 0.044) and superoxide dismutase (OR = 0.779, 95 % CI: 0. 616-0.986,P = 0.038) are associated with a decreased risk of glaucoma, whereas an increased myeloperoxidase level (OR = 2.145, 95 % CI: 1.119-4.111,P = 0.029) is associated with an increased risk of glaucoma. Glaucoma was causally associated with lower levels of total bilirubin (OR = 0.961, 95 % CI: 0.927-0.997,P = 0.039), glutathione peroxidase (OR = 0. 934, 95 % CI: 0.890-0.981,P = 0.006), paraoxonase (OR = 0.883, 95 % CI: 0.810-0.963,P = 0.005) and albumin (OR = 0.988, 95 % CI: 0.978-0.998,P = 0.014).

38225407,"Beyond the factor indeterminacy problem using genome-wide association data.","Nat Hum Behav","Latent factors, such as general intelligence, depression and risk tolerance, are invoked in nearly all social science research where a construct is measured via aggregation of symptoms, question responses or other measurements. Because latent factors cannot be directly observed, they are inferred by fitting a specific model to empirical patterns of correlations among measured variables. A long-standing critique of latent factor theories is that the correlations used to infer latent factors can be produced by alternative data-generating mechanisms that do not include latent factors. This is referred to as the factor indeterminacy problem. Researchers have recently begun to overcome this problem by using information on the associations between individual genetic variants and measured variables. We review historical work on the factor indeterminacy problem and describe recent efforts in genomics to rigorously test the validity of latent factors, advancing the understanding of behavioural science constructs.© 2024.

Current models make accurate predictions of relative activity levels across the human reference genome, but their performance is more limited for predicting the effects of genetic variants, such as explaining gene expression variation across individuals. To better understand the causes of these shortcomings, we examine the uncertainty in predictions of genomic sequence-to-activity models using an ensemble of Basenji2 model replicates. We characterize prediction consistency on four types of sequences: reference genome sequences, reference genome sequences perturbed with TF motifs, eQTLs, and personal genome sequences. We observe that models tend to make high-confidence predictions on reference sequences, even when incorrect, and low-confidence predictions on sequences with variants. For eQTLs and personal genome sequences, we find that model replicates make inconsistent predictions in>50% of cases. Our findings suggest strategies to improve performance of these models.",1.11720300913339e-18

Individuals were classified into different genetic risk subgroups based on the relationship between their own PRS mean/PRS CI and the population level threshold.Considerable variances in PRS point estimates at the individual level were observed for both methods, with an average standard deviation (s.d.) of 0.12 for PRS-16-CV and a much larger s.d. of 0.88 for PRS-Bayes. Using PRS-16-CV, only 25.0% of individuals with PRS point estimates in the lowest decile of PRS and 16.8% in the highest decile have their entire 95% CI fully contained in the lowest and highest decile, respectively, while PRS-Bayes was unable to find any eligible individuals. Only 19% of the individuals were concordantly identified as having high genetic risk (> 90th percentile) using the two PRS estimators. An increased relative risk of lung cancer comparing the highest PRS percentile to the lowest was observed when taking the CI into account (OR = 2.73, 95% CI: 2.12-3.50, P-value = 4.13 × 10-15) compared to using PRS-16-CV mean (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.99-2.49, P-value = 5.70 × 10-46). Improved risk prediction performance with higher AUC was consistently observed in individuals identified by PRS-16-CV CI, and the best performance was achieved by incorporating age, gender, and detailed smoking pack-years (AUC: 0.73, 95% CI = 0.72-0.74).Lung cancer PRS estimates using different methods have modest correlations at the individual level, highlighting the importance of considering individual-level uncertainty when evaluating the practical utility of PRS.© 2024.

The presence of a chronic metabolic disease can accelerate aging and increase the risk of further chronic diseases. The aim of the study was to determine whether the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) affects levels of markers that are associated with, among other things, aging.A total of 169 subjects (58 with MetS, and 111 without metabolic syndrome, i.e., non-MetS) participated in the study. Levels of telomerase, GDF11/15, sirtuin 1, follistatin, NLRP3, AGEs, klotho, DNA/RNA damage, NAD+, vitamin D, and blood lipids were assessed from blood samples using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits.Telomerase (p< 0.01), DNA/RNA damage (p< 0.006) and GDF15 (p< 0.02) were higher in MetS group compared to non-MetS group. Only vitamin D levels were higher in the non-MetS group (p< 0.0002). Differences between MetS and non-MetS persons were also detected in groups divided according to age: in under 35-year-olds and those aged 35-50 years.Our results show that people with MetS compared to those without MetS have higher levels of some of the measured markers of biological aging. Thus, the presence of MetS may accelerate biological aging, which may be associated with an increased risk of chronic comorbidities that accompany MetS (cardiovascular, inflammatory, autoimmune, neurodegenerative, metabolic, or cancer diseases) and risk of premature death from all causes.",1.00100507888773e-18
38291072,"Assessing the feasibility of applying machine learning to diagnosing non-effusive feline infectious peritonitis.","Sci Rep","Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a severe feline coronavirus-associated syndrome in cats, which is invariably fatal without anti-viral treatment. In the majority of non-effusive FIP cases encountered in practice, confirmatory diagnostic testing is not undertaken and reliance is given to the interpretation of valuable, but essentially non-specific, clinical signs and laboratory markers. We hypothesised that it may be feasible to develop a machine learning (ML) approach which may be applied to the analysis of clinical data to aid in the diagnosis of disease. A dataset encompassing 1939 suspected FIP cases was scored for clinical suspicion of FIP on the basis of history, signalment, clinical signs and laboratory results, using published guidelines, comprising 683 FIP (35.2%), and 1256 non-FIP (64.8%) cases. This dataset was used to train, validate and evaluate two diagnostic machine learning ensemble models. These models, which analysed signalment and laboratory data alone, allowed the accurate discrimination of FIP and non-FIP cases in line with expert opinion. To evaluate whether these models may have value as a diagnostic tool, they were applied to a collection of 80 cases for which the FIP status had been confirmed (FIP: n = 58 (72.5%), non-FIP: n = 22 (27.5%)). Both ensemble models detected FIP with an accuracy of 97.5%, an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.969, sensitivity of 95.45% and specificity of 98.28%. This work demonstrates that, in principle, ML can be usefully applied to the diagnosis of non-effusive FIP. Further work is required before ML may be deployed in the laboratory as a diagnostic tool, such as training models on datasets of confirmed cases and accounting for inter-laboratory variation. Nevertheless, these results illustrate the potential benefit of applying ML to standardising and accelerating the interpretation of clinical pathology data, thereby improving the diagnostic utility of existing laboratory tests.© 2024.

However, the mechanistic connections between neuropsychiatric disorders and AD are not well understood. We conducted a Mendelian randomization analysis to appraise the potential influences of 18 neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders on AD. We found that four disorders are causally associated with increased risk for AD, including bipolar disorder (BD) (OR: 1.09), migraine (OR: 1.09), schizophrenia (OR: 1.05), and Parkinson's disease (PD) (OR: 1.07), while attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was associated with a decreased risk for AD (OR: 0.80). In case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (OR: 1.04) and Tourette's syndrome (OR: 1.05), there was suggestive evidence of their causal effects of on AD. Our study shows that genetic components predisposing to BD, migraine, schizophrenia, and PD may promote the development of AD, while ADHD may be associated with a reduced risk of AD. The treatments aimed at alleviating neuropsychiatric diseases with earlier onset may also influence the risk of AD-related cognitive decline, which is typically observed later in life.© 2024.

The capsular polysaccharide vaccine PPSV23 and conjugated alternative PCV13 can prevent these infections; yet, underlying immunological responses and baseline predictors remain unknown. We vaccinated 39 older adults (>60 years) with PPSV23 or PCV13 and observed comparable antibody responses (day 28) and plasmablast transcriptional responses (day 10); however, the baseline predictors were distinct. Analyses of baseline flow cytometry and bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data revealed a baseline phenotype specifically associated with weaker PCV13 responses, which was characterized by increased expression of cytotoxicity-associated genes, increased frequencies of CD16+natural killer cells and interleukin-17-producing helper T cells and a decreased frequency of type 1 helper T cells. Men displayed this phenotype more robustly and mounted weaker PCV13 responses than women. Baseline expression levels of a distinct gene set predicted PPSV23 responses.

DNA methylation levels of grape skins at the three stages were higher in transposable element regions than in the genic regions, and the CG and CHG DNA methylation levels of the genic region were higher than the CHH DNA methylation levels. We identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in S2_vs_S1 and S3_vs_S1. The results indicated that DMRs predominantly occurred within the CHH context during grape skin coloration.

38300850,"Using methylation data to improve transcription factor binding prediction.","Epigenetics","Modelling the regulatory mechanisms that determine cell fate, response to external perturbation, and disease state depends on measuring many factors, a task made more difficult by the plasticity of the epigenome. Scanning the genome for the sequence patterns defined by Position Weight Matrices (PWM) can be used to estimate transcription factor (TF) binding locations. However, this approach does not incorporate information regarding the epigenetic context necessary for TF binding. CpG methylation is an epigenetic mark influenced by environmental factors that is commonly assayed in human cohort studies. We developed a framework to score inferred TF binding locations using methylation data. We intersected motif locations identified using PWMs with methylation information captured in both whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and Illumina EPIC array data for six cell lines, scored motif locations based on these data, and compared with experimental data characterizing TF binding (ChIP-seq). We found that for most TFs, binding prediction improves using methylation-based scoring compared to standard PWM-scores. We also illustrate that our approach can be generalized to infer TF binding when methylation information is only proximally available,i.e. measured for nearby CpGs that do not directly overlap with a motif location. Overall, our approach provides a framework for inferring context-specific TF binding using methylation data. Importantly, the availability of DNA methylation data in existing patient populations provides an opportunity to use our approach to understand the impact of methylation on gene regulatory processes in the context of human disease.",4.94943600805789e-19

Here, we present the results of mapping interaction QTLs (iQTLs) for cell type, age, and other phenotypic variables in multi-omic, longitudinal data from the blood of individuals of diverse ancestries. By modeling the interaction between genotype and estimated cell-type proportions, we demonstrate that cell-type iQTLs could be considered as proxies for cell-type-specific QTL effects, particularly for the most abundant cell type in the tissue. The interpretation of age iQTLs, however, warrants caution because the moderation effect of age on the genotype and molecular phenotype association could be mediated by changes in cell-type composition. Finally, we show that cell-type iQTLs contribute to cell-type-specific enrichment of diseases that, in combination with additional functional data, could guide future functional studies.

Due to the high rates of complications from invasive diagnostic procedures in this population, detecting circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a non-invasive method might be useful. However, clinical characteristics that are predictive of ctDNA mutation detection remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to investigate factors associated with ctDNA detection in COPD patients with lung cancer.Herein, 177 patients with COPD and lung cancer were prospectively recruited. Plasma ctDNA was genotyped using targeted deep sequencing. Comprehensive clinical variables were collected, including the emphysema index (EI), using chest computed tomography. Machine learning models were constructed to predict ctDNA detection.At least one ctDNA mutation was detected in 54 (30.5%) patients. After adjustment for potential confounders, tumor stage, C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and milder emphysema were independently associated with ctDNA detection. An increase of 1% in the EI was associated with a 7% decrease in the odds of ctDNA detection (adjusted odds ratio =0.933; 95% confidence interval: 0.857-0.999; P=0.047). Machine learning models composed of multiple clinical factors predicted individuals with ctDNA mutations at high performance (AUC =0.774).ctDNA mutations were likely to be observed in COPD patients with lung cancer who had an advanced clinical stage, high CRP level, or milder emphysema.

The percentage of phenotypic variance on the liability-scale explained by these probabilities ranged from 10.0 to 17.4% (AUC: 69.4-76.4%) which is a multiple of the classification performance achieved using absolute expression levels or GWAS-based polygenic risk scores. Most patients display stoichiometric imbalance in three to ten genes, suggesting that dysregulation of only a small fraction of associated genes can trigger the disorder, with the identity of these genes varying between individuals.© 2024.

38221903,"scFed: federated learning for cell type classification with scRNA-seq.","Brief Bioinform","The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and complexity in biological tissues. However, the nature of large, sparse scRNA-seq datasets and privacy regulations present challenges for efficient cell identification. Federated learning provides a solution, allowing efficient and private data use. Here, we introduce scFed, a unified federated learning framework that allows for benchmarking of four classification algorithms without violating data privacy, including single-cell-specific and general-purpose classifiers. We evaluated scFed using eight publicly available scRNA-seq datasets with diverse sizes, species and technologies, assessing its performance via intra-dataset and inter-dataset experimental setups. We find that scFed performs well on a variety of datasets with competitive accuracy to centralized models. Though Transformer-based model excels in centralized training, its performance slightly lags behind single-cell-specific model within the scFed framework, coupled with a notable time complexity concern. Our study not only helps select suitable cell identification methods but also highlights federated learning's potential for privacy-preserving, collaborative biomedical research.© The Author(s) 2024.

Here we review population-based investigations of epigenetic loci associated with food allergy, focusing on established clinical food allergy. We first provide an overview of epigenetic mechanisms that have been studied in cohorts with food allergy, predominantly DNA methylation but also microRNA. We then discuss investigations that have implemented epigenome-wide approaches aimed at genome-wide profiling and discovery. Such epigenome-wide studies have collectively identified differentially methylated and differentially regulated loci associated with T cell development, antigen presentation, reaction severity, and causal mediation in food allergy. We then discuss candidate-gene investigations that have honed in on Th1, Th2, T regulatory, and innate genes of a priori interest in food allergy. These studies have highlighted methylation changes in specific candidate genes as associated with T regulatory cell activity as well as differential methylation of Type 1 and Type 2 cytokine genes associated with various food allergies. Intriguingly, epigenetic loci associated with food allergy have also been explored as potential biomarkers for the clinical management of food allergy. We conclude by highlighting several priority directions for advancing population-based epigenomic and epigenetic understandings of food allergy.© 2023 European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",1.62973985805862e-19
38370677,"Multi-class Modeling Identifies Shared Genetic Risk for Late-onset Epilepsy and Alzheimer's Disease.","medRxiv","Previous studies have established a strong link between late-onset epilepsy (LOE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, their shared genetic risk beyond theAPOEgene remains unclear. Our study sought to examine the shared genetic factors of AD and LOE, interpret the biological pathways involved, and evaluate how AD onset may be mediated by LOE and shared genetic risks.We defined phenotypes using phecodes mapped from diagnosis codes, with patients' records aged 60-90. A two-step Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) workflow was used to identify shared genetic variants based on prior AD GWAS integrated with functional genomic data. We calculated an AD-LOE shared risk score and used it as a proxy in a causal mediation analysis. We used electronic health records from an academic health center (UCLA Health) for discovery analyses and validated our findings in a multi-institutional EHR database (All of Us).The two-step LASSO method identified 34 shared genetic loci between AD and LOE, including theAPOEregion. These loci were mapped to 65 genes, which showed enrichment in molecular functions and pathways such as tau protein binding and lipoprotein metabolism. Individuals with high predicted shared risk scores have a higher risk of developing AD, LOE, or both in their later life compared to those with low-risk scores. LOE partially mediates the effect of AD-LOE shared genetic risk on AD (15% proportion mediated on average). Validation results from All of Us were consistent with findings from the UCLA sample.We employed a machine learning approach to identify shared genetic risks of AD and LOE. In addition to providing substantial evidence for the significant contribution of theAPOE-TOMM40-APOC1gene cluster to shared risk, we uncovered novel genes that may contribute. Our study is one of the first to utilize All of Us genetic data to investigate AD, and provides valuable insights into the potential common and disease-specific mechanisms underlying AD and LOE, which could have profound implications for the future of disease prevention and the development of targeted treatment strategies to combat the co-occurrence of these two diseases.",1.61779121135075e-19

We propose genomic principal and independent component analysis (PCA, ICA) to decompose a large set of univariate GWAS statistics of multimodal brain traits into more interpretable latent genomic components. Here we introduce and evaluate this novel methods various analytic parameters and reproducibility across independent samples. Two UK Biobank GWAS summary statistic releases of 2240 imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) were retrieved. Genome-wide beta-values and their corresponding standard-error scaled z-values were decomposed using genomic PCA/ICA. We evaluated variance explained at multiple dimensions up to 200. We tested the inter-sample reproducibility of output of dimensions 5, 10, 25 and 50. Reproducibility statistics of the respective univariate GWAS served as benchmarks. Reproducibility of 10-dimensional PCs and ICs showed the best trade-off between model complexity and robustness and variance explained (PCs: |rz - max| = 0.33, |rraw - max| = 0.30; ICs: |rz - max| = 0.23, |rraw - max| = 0.19). Genomic PC and IC reproducibility improved substantially relative to mean univariate GWAS reproducibility up to dimension 10. Genomic components clustered along neuroimaging modalities. Our results indicate that genomic PCA and ICA decompose genetic effects on IDPs from GWAS statistics with high reproducibility by taking advantage of the inherent pleiotropic patterns. These findings encourage further applications of genomic PCA and ICA as fully data-driven methods to effectively reduce the dimensionality, enhance the signal to noise ratio and improve interpretability of high-dimensional multitrait genome-wide analyses.© 2023 The Authors.

We used a dataset of over 415,000 single-cell DNA methylation and chromatin conformation profiles across the adult mouse brain to identify aneuploid cells comprehensively. Whole-chromosome loss or duplication occurred in <1% of cells, with rates up to 1.8% in non-neuronal cell types, including oligodendrocyte precursors and pericytes. Among all aneuploidies, we observed a strong enrichment of trisomy on chromosome 16, which is syntenic with human chromosome 21 and constitutively trisomic in Down syndrome.

Identifying the biological mechanisms underlying disease onset and progression based on quantifiable phenotypes will help understand disease etiology and devise therapies.Our objective was to identify molecular pathways associated with hallmark AD biomarkers and cognitive status, accounting for variables such as age, sex, education, and APOE genotype.We introduce a pathway-based statistical approach, extending the gene set likelihood ratio test to continuous phenotypes. We first analyzed independently each of the three phenotypes (amyloid-β, tau, cognition) using continuous gene set likelihood ratio tests to account for covariates, including age, sex, education, and APOE genotype. The analysis involved 634 subjects with data available for all three phenotypes, allowing for the identification of common pathways.We identified 14 pathways significantly associated with amyloid-β; 5 associated with tau; and 174 associated with cognition, which showed a larger number of pathways compared to biomarkers. A single pathway, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor binding (VEGF-RB), exhibited associations with all three phenotypes. Mediation analysis showed that among the VEGF-RB family genes, ITGA5 mediates the relationship between cognitive scores and pathological biomarkers.We presented a new statistical approach linking continuous phenotypes, gene expression across pathways, and covariates like sex, age, and education. Our results reinforced VEGF RB2's role in AD cognition and demonstrated ITGA5's significant role in mediating the AD pathology-cognition connection.",1.24244101459963e-19

A relationship has been found between BPD symptoms and altered neuropsychological processes. Studies of event-related potentials (ERP) measured with electroencephalogram (EEG) have found neural correlates related to BPD symptoms. Of note is the P300 component, considered a potential mental health biomarker for trauma-associated disorders. However, no meta-analysis has been found to demonstrate this relationship.Objectives:To evaluate the relationship between the P300 component and BPD symptoms. To evaluate the relationship of other ERP components with BPD symptoms.Methods:The method and procedure were adjusted to the PRISMA checklist. The search was performed in three databases: WOS, Scopus and PubMed. A Random Effects Model was used to perform the analysis of the studies. In addition, a meta-regression was performed with % women, Gini and GDP. Finally, a descriptive analysis of the main results found between P300, other ERP components (LPP, P100 and ERN/Ne) and BPD symptoms was performed.Results:From a review of 485 articles, a meta-analysis was performed with six articles that met the inclusion criteria. A moderate, positive relationship was found between the P300 component and BPD symptoms (REM = .489;p < .001). It was not possible to perform meta-analyses for other ERP components (LPP, P100 and ERN/Ne) due to the low number of articles found.Conclusion:The idea that P300 could be considered for use as a biomarker to identify altered neural correlates in BPD is reinforced.

However, less is known about the effect of the influenza vaccine on the epigenome. We utilized a targeted DNA methylation approach to study the longitudinal effects (day 0 pre-vaccination and day 28 post-vaccination) on influenza vaccination responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We found that baseline, pre-vaccination methylation profiles are associated with pre-existing, protective serological immunity. Additionally, we identified 481 sites that were differentially methylated between baseline and day 28 post-vaccination. These were enriched for genes involved in the regulation of the RIG-I signaling pathway, an important regulator of viral responses. Our results suggest that DNA methylation changes to components of the RIG-I pathway are associated with vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, immunization strategies that target this pathway may improve serological responses to influenza vaccination.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.11824460493705e-19

To understand how widespread such a relationship was and its epigenetic and biological correlates, we systematically looked for genes with similar transcription profiles and analyzed their DNA methylation and chromatin state and accessibility profiles in many different cell populations. Twenty genes were expressed preferentially in myoblasts and cerebellum (Myob/Cbl genes). Some shared DNA hypo- or hypermethylated regions in myoblasts and cerebellum. Particularly striking wasZNF556, whose promoter is hypomethylated in expressing cells but highly methylated in the many cell populations that do not express the gene. In reporter gene assays, we demonstrated that its promoter's activity is methylation sensitive. The atypical epigenetics ofZNF556may have originated from its promoter's hypomethylation and selective activation in sperm progenitors and oocytes. Five of the Myob/Cbl genes (KCNJ12,ST8SIA5,ZIC1,VAX2, andEN2) have much higher RNA levels in cerebellum than in myoblasts and displayed myoblast-specific hypermethylation upstream and/or downstream of their promoters that may downmodulate expression. Differential DNA methylation was associated with alternative promoter usage for Myob/Cbl genesMCF2L,DOK7,CNPY1, andANK1. Myob/Cbl genesPAX3,LBX1,ZNF556,ZIC1,EN2, andVAX2encode sequence-specific transcription factors, which likely help drive the myoblast and cerebellum specificity of other Myob/Cbl genes.

By combining findings from the comorbidity network and disease trajectory analyses, we identify five robust disease clusters to be associated with a prior diagnosis of anxiety/stress-related disorders, featured by predominance of psychiatric disorders, eye diseases, ear diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and skin and genitourinary diseases. These five clusters and their featured diseases are largely validated in the UK Biobank. GWAS analyses based on the UK Biobank identify 3, 33, 40, 4, and 16 significantly independent single nucleotide polymorphisms for the link to the five disease clusters, respectively, which are mapped to several distinct risk genes and biological pathways.

Univariable MR demonstrated a nominal association between CRP levels and an increased risk of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (inverse variance-weighted OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.30). However, this association disappeared when multivariable MR included cigarettes per day and/or body mass index. By using our recently developed constrained maximum likelihood-based MR method, we identified significant associations of CRP levels with the risk of overall LC (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09), SCC (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.09), and small cell lung cancer (SCLC, OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.03-1.15). Moreover, most univariable and multivariable MR analyses also revealed consistent CRP-SCLC associations.There may be a genetic and causal association between circulating CRP levels and the risk of SCLC, which is in line with previous population-based observational studies.© 2024.

To probe these mechanisms, we developed a nanopore sequencing method, Telomere Profiling, that is easy to implement, precise, and cost effective with broad applications in research and the clinic. We sequenced telomeres from individuals with short telomere syndromes and found similar telomere lengths to the clinical FlowFISH assay. We mapped telomere reads to specific chromosome end and identified both chromosome end-specific and haplotype-specific telomere length distributions. In the T2T HG002 genome, where the average telomere length is 5kb, we found a remarkable 6kb difference in lengths between some telomeres. Further, we found that specific chromosome ends were consistently shorter or longer than the average length across 147 individuals. The presence of conserved chromosome end-specific telomere lengths suggests there are new paradigms in telomere biology that are yet to be explored. Understanding the mechanisms regulating length will allow deeper insights into telomere biology that can lead to new approaches to disease.",6.9071385053188e-20

38274286,"Development of an epigenetic clock to predict visual age progression of human skin.","Front Aging","Aging is a complex process characterized by the gradual decline of physiological functions, leading to increased vulnerability to age-related diseases and reduced quality of life. Alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns have emerged as a fundamental characteristic of aged human skin, closely linked to the development of the well-known skin aging phenotype. These changes have been correlated with dysregulated gene expression and impaired tissue functionality. In particular, the skin, with its visible manifestations of aging, provides a unique model to study the aging process. Despite the importance of epigenetic age clocks in estimating biological age based on the correlation between methylation patterns and chronological age, a second-generation epigenetic age clock, which correlates DNAm patterns with a particular phenotype, specifically tailored to skin tissue is still lacking. In light of this gap, we aimed to develop a novel second-generation epigenetic age clock explicitly designed for skin tissue to facilitate a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to individual variations in age progression. To achieve this, we used methylation patterns from more than 370 female volunteers and developed the first skin-specific second-generation epigenetic age clock that accurately predicts the skin aging phenotype represented by wrinkle grade, visual facial age, and visual age progression, respectively. We then validated the performance of our clocks on independent datasets and demonstrated their broad applicability. In addition, we integrated gene expression and methylation data from independent studies to identify potential pathways contributing to skin age progression. Our results demonstrate that our epigenetic age clock, VisAgeX, specifically predicting visual age progression, not only captures known biological pathways associated with skin aging, but also adds novel pathways associated with skin aging.Copyright © 2024 Bienkowska, Raddatz, Söhle, Kristof, Völzke, Gallinat, Lyko, Kaderali, Winnefeld, Grönniger and Falckenhayn.",5.81916086184853e-20

As islet autoantibodies can be transient, screening with a genetic risk score has been proposed as an entry into autoantibody testing.Children were recruited from eight general pediatric and specialty clinics across Virginia with diverse community settings. Recruiters in each clinic obtained informed consent/assent, a medical history, and a saliva sample for DNA extraction in children with and without a history of T1D. A custom genotyping panel was used to define T1D genetic risk based upon associated SNPs in European- and African-genetic ancestry. Subjects at ""high genetic risk"" were offered a separate blood collection for screening four islet autoantibodies. A follow-up contact (email, mail, and telephone) in one half of the participants determined interest and occurrence of subsequent T1D.A total of 3818 children aged 2-16 years were recruited, with 14.2% (n = 542) having a ""high genetic risk."" Of children with ""high genetic risk"" and without pre-existing T1D (n = 494), 7.0% (34/494) consented for autoantibody screening; 82.4% (28/34) who consented also completed the blood collection, and 7.1% (2/28) of them tested positive for multiple autoantibodies.

In the sample of children with existing T1D, there was no relationship between genetic risk and age at T1D onset. A major factor in obtaining islet autoantibody testing was concern over SARS-CoV-2 exposure.Minimally invasive saliva sampling implemented using a genetic risk score can identify children at genetic risk of T1D.

The objective is to reduce systematic biases introduced by technical sources that can obscure underlying biological differences. This is typically accomplished by re-scaling the observed counts to reduce the differences in total counts between the cells and then transforming the scaled counts to stabilize the variances. In the standard scRNA-seq workflow, this is followed by feature selection to identify genes that capture most of the biologically meaningful variation across the cells. Here, we propose a simple feature selection method and show that we can perform feature selection before normalization.

We incorporated local ancestry and haplotypes to identify quantitative trait loci for expression (eQTLs) and splicing (sQTLs) in coronary arteries from 138 ancestrally diverse Americans. Of 2,132 eQTL-associated genes (eGenes), 47% were previously unreported in coronary artery; 19% exhibited cell-type-specific expression. Colocalization revealed subgroups of eGenes unique to CAD and blood pressure GWAS. Fine-mapping highlighted additional eGenes, including TBX20 and IL5. We also identified sQTLs for 1,690 genes, among which TOR1AIP1 and ULK3 sQTLs demonstrated the importance of evaluating splicing to accurately identify disease-relevant isoform expression. Our work provides a patient-derived coronary artery eQTL resource and exemplifies the need for diverse study populations and multifaceted approaches to characterize gene regulation in disease processes.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

It is crucial to identify novel therapeutic targets based on underlying causes. Here, we aimed to use proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to identify the associations between genetically predicted elevated levels of circulating proteins and distinct HF outcomes, along with specific HF etiologies.Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) data for circulating proteins were sourced from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, encompassing 7,213 individuals and profiling 4,657 circulating proteins. Genetic associations for outcomes were obtained from the HERMES Consortium and the FinnGen Consortium. Colocalization analysis was employed to assess the impact of linkage disequilibrium on discovered relationships. For replication, two-sample MR was conducted utilizing independent pQTL data from the deCODE study. Multivariable MR (MVMR) and two-step MR were further conducted to investigate potential mediators.Two proteins (PCSK9 and AIDA) exhibited associations with HF in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), and four proteins (PCSK9, SWAP70, NCF1, and RELT) were related with HF in patients receiving antihypertensive medication. Among these associations, strong evidence from subsequent analyses supported the positive relationship between genetically predicted PCSK9 levels and the risk of HF in the context of CHD. Notably, MVMR analysis revealed that CHD and LDL-C did not exert a complete mediating effect in this relationship. Moreover, two-step MR results yielded valuable insights into the potential mediating proportions of CHD or LDL-C in this relationship.Our findings provide robust evidence supporting the association between PCSK9 and concomitant HF and CHD. This association is partly elucidated by the influence of CHD or LDL-C, underscoring the imperative for additional validation of this connection and a thorough exploration of the mechanisms through which PCSK9 directly impacts ischemic HF.© 2024.

38389820,"Advances in DNA, histone, and RNA methylation mechanisms in the pathophysiology of alcohol use disorder.","Adv Drug Alcohol Res","Alcohol use disorder (AUD) has a complex, multifactorial etiology involving dysregulation across several brain regions and peripheral organs. Acute and chronic alcohol consumption cause epigenetic modifications in these systems, which underlie changes in gene expression and subsequently, the emergence of pathophysiological phenotypes associated with AUD. One such epigenetic mechanism is methylation, which can occur on DNA, histones, and RNA. Methylation relies on one carbon metabolism to generate methyl groups, which can then be transferred to acceptor substrates. While DNA methylation of particular genes generally represses transcription, methylation of histones and RNA can have bidirectional effects on gene expression. This review summarizes one carbon metabolism and the mechanisms behind methylation of DNA, histones, and RNA. We discuss the field's findings regarding alcohol's global and gene-specific effects on methylation in the brain and liver and the resulting phenotypes characteristic of AUD.Copyright © 2023 Cruise, Kotlo, Malovic and Pandey.",2.57929931170898e-20
38176413,"Epigenetic biomarkers for disease susceptibility and preventative medicine.","Cell Metab","The development of molecular biomarkers for disease makes it possible for preventative medicine approaches to be considered. Therefore, therapeutics, treatments, or clinical management can be used to delay or prevent disease development. The problem with genetic mutations as biomarkers is the low frequency with genome-wide association studies (GWASs), generally at best a 1% association of the patients with the disease. In contrast, epigenetic alterations have a high-frequency association of greater than 90%-95% of individuals with pathology in epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs). A wide variety of human diseases have been shown to have epigenetic biomarkers that are disease specific and that detect pathology susceptibility. This review is focused on the epigenetic biomarkers for disease susceptibility, and it distinct from the large literature on epigenetics of disease etiology or progression. The development of efficient epigenetic biomarkers for disease susceptibility will facilitate a paradigm shift from reactionary medicine to preventative medicine.Copyright © 2023.

However, the cohorts on which these methods are built are overwhelmingly of European Ancestry. This means that the unique regulatory variation that exist in non-European populations, specifically African Ancestry populations, may not be included in the current models. Moreover, African Americans are an admixed population, with a mix of European and African segments within their genome. No gene imputation model thus far has incorporated the effect of local ancestry (LA) on gene expression imputation. As such, we created LA-GEM which was trained and tested on a cohort of 60 African American hepatocyte primary cultures. Uniquely, LA-GEM include local ancestry inference in its prediction of gene expression. We compared the performance of LA-GEM to PrediXcan trained the same dataset (with no inclusion of local ancestry) We were able to reliably predict the expression of 2559 genes (1326 in LA-GEM and 1236 in PrediXcan). Of these, 546 genes were unique to LA-GEM, including the CYP3A5 gene which is critical to drug metabolism. We conducted TWAS analysis on two African American clinical cohorts with pharmacogenomics phenotypic information to identity novel gene associations. In our IWPC warfarin cohort, we identified 17 transcriptome-wide significant hits. No gene reached are prespecified significance level in the clopidogrel cohort. We did see suggestive association with RAS3A to P2RY12 Reactivity Units (PRU), a clinical measure of response to anti-platelet therapy.

Moreover, traditional case-control studies examining blood-based biomarkers are subject to potential confounds of treatment and other exposures common to patients with psychiatric illnesses. Our research addresses these challenges by leveraging large-scale, high-throughput proteomics data and Mendelian Randomization (MR) to examine the causal impact of circulating proteins on psychiatric phenotypes and cognitive task performance.We utilized plasma proteomics data from the UK Biobank (3,072 proteins assayed in 34,557 European-ancestry individuals) and deCODE Genetics (4,719 proteins measured across 35,559 Icelandic individuals). Significant proteomic quantitative trait loci (both cis-pQTLs and trans-pQTLs) served as MR instruments, with the most recent GWAS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and cognitive task performance (all excluding overlapping UK Biobank participants) as phenotypic outcomes.MR revealed 109 Bonferroni-corrected causal associations (44 novel) involving 88 proteins across the four phenotypes. Several immune-related proteins, including interleukins and complement factors, stood out as pleiotropic across multiple outcome phenotypes. Drug target enrichment analysis identified several novel potential pharmacologic repurposing opportunities, including anti-inflammatory agents for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and duloxetine for cognitive performance.Identification of causal effects for these circulating proteins suggests potential biomarkers for these conditions and offers insights for developing innovative therapeutic strategies.

In China, approximately 70% of hereditary deafness originates from four common deafness-causing genes: GJB2, SLC26A4, GJB3, and MT-RNR1. A single-tube rapid detection method based on 2D-PCR technology was established for nine mutation sites in the aforementioned genes, and Sanger sequencing was used to verify its reliability and accuracy. The frequency of hotspot mutations in deafness genes was analysed in 116 deaf students. 2D-PCR identified 27 genotypes of nine loci according to the melting curve of the FAM, HEX, and Alexa568 fluorescence channels. Of the 116 deaf patients, 12.9% (15/116) carried SLC26A4 mutations, including c.919-2A > G and c.2168A > G (allele frequencies, 7.3% and 2.2%, respectively). The positivity rate (29.3%; 34/116) was highest for GJB2 (allele frequency, 15.9% for c.235delC, 6.0% for c.299_300delAT, and 2.6% for c.176-191del16). Sanger sequencing confirmed the consistency of results between the detection methods based on 2D-PCR and DNA sequencing. Common pathogenic mutations in patients with non-syndromic deafness in Changzhou were concentrated in GJB2 (c.235delC, c.299_300delAT, and c.176-191del16) and SLC26A4 (c.919-2A > G and c.2168 A > G). 2D-PCR is an effective method for accurately and rapidly identifying deafness-related genotypes using a single-tube reaction, and is superior to DNA sequencing, which has a high cost and long cycle.© 2024.

38380944,"Aberrant PRDM2 methylation as an early event in serrated lesions destined to evolve into microsatellite-instable colorectal cancers.","J Pathol Clin Res","Up to 30% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) develop from sessile serrated lesions (SSLs). Within the serrated neoplasia pathway, at least two principally distinct oncogenetic routes exist generating microsatellite-stable and microsatellite-instable CRCs, respectively. Aberrant DNA methylation (DNAm) is found early in the serrated pathway and might play a role in both oncogenetic routes. We studied a cohort of 23 SSLs with a small focus (<10 mm) of dysplasia or cancer, 10 of which were MLH1 deficient and 13 MLH1 proficient. By comparing, for each SSL, the methylation status of (1) the region of dysplasia or cancer (SSL-D), (2) the nondysplastic SSL (SSL), and (3) adjacent normal mucosa, differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) were assessed both genome-wide as well as in a tumor-suppressor gene-focused approach. By comparing DNAm of MLH1-deficient SSL-Ds with their corresponding SSLs, we identified five DMRs, including those annotating for PRDM2 and, not unexpectedly, MLH1. PRDM2 gene promotor methylation was associated with MLH1 expression status, as it was largely hypermethylated in MLH1-deficient SSL-Ds and hypomethylated in MLH1-proficient SSL-Ds. Significantly increased DNAm levels of PRDM2 and MLH1, in particular at 'critical' MLH1 probe sites, were to some extent already visible in SSLs as compared to normal mucosa (p = 0.02, p = 0.01, p < 0.0001, respectively). No DMRs, nor DMPs, were identified for SSLs destined to evolve into MLH1-proficient SSL-Ds. Our data indicate that, within both arms of the serrated CRC pathway, the majority of the epigenetic alterations are introduced early during SSL formation. Promoter hypermethylation of PRDM2 and MLH1 on the other hand specifically initiates in SSLs destined to transform into MLH1-deficient CRCs suggesting that the fate of SSLs may not necessarily result from a stochastic process but possibly is already imprinted and predisposed.© 2024 The Authors.

38355791,"Smoking changes adaptive immunity with persistent effects.","Nature","Individuals differ widely in their immune responses, with age, sex and genetic factors having major roles in this inherent variability1-6. However, the variables that drive such differences in cytokine secretion-a crucial component of the host response to immune challenges-remain poorly defined. Here we investigated 136 variables and identified smoking, cytomegalovirus latent infection and body mass index as major contributors to variability in cytokine response, with effects of comparable magnitudes with age, sex and genetics. We find that smoking influences both innate and adaptive immune responses. Notably, its effect on innate responses is quickly lost after smoking cessation and is specifically associated with plasma levels of CEACAM6, whereas its effect on adaptive responses persists long after individuals quit smoking and is associated with epigenetic memory. This is supported by the association of the past smoking effect on cytokine responses with DNA methylation at specific signal trans-activators and regulators of metabolism. Our findings identify three novel variables associated with cytokine secretion variability and reveal roles for smoking in the short- and long-term regulation of immune responses. These results have potential clinical implications for the risk of developing infections, cancers or autoimmune diseases.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.39906103997932e-20

After estimating a latent cell ordering, statistical models are used to determine which genes exhibit changes in expression that are significantly associated with progression through the biological trajectory. While a few techniques for performing trajectory differential expression exist, most rely on the flexibility of generalized additive models in order to account for the inherent nonlinearity of changes in gene expression. As such, the results can be difficult to interpret, and biological conclusions often rest on subjective visual inspections of the most dynamic genes. To address this challenge, we propose scLANE testing, which is built around an interpretable generalized linear model and handles nonlinearity with basis splines chosen empirically for each gene. In addition, extensions to estimating equations and mixed models allow for reliable trajectory testing under complex experimental designs. After validating the accuracy of scLANE under several different simulation scenarios, we apply it to a set of diverse biological datasets and display its ability to provide novel biological information when used downstream of both pseudotime and RNA velocity estimation methods.",1.30271046089371e-20

To address these limitations, we developed an ensemble clustering method with hyperparameter randomization that outperforms other methods across a broad range of single-cell and synthetic datasets, without the need for manual hyperparameter selection. In addition to hard cluster labels, it also outputs soft cluster memberships to characterize continuum-like regions and per cell overlap scores to quantify the uncertainty in cluster assignment. We demonstrate the improved clustering interpretability from these features by tracing the intermediate stages between handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset, and between tanycyte subpopulations in the hypothalamus. This approach improves the quality of clustering and subsequent downstream analyses for single-cell datasets, and may also prove useful in other fields of data analysis.",1.26677246261826e-20

Besides age, sex and smoking history, blood-based biomarkers may be used to improve the assessment of LC risk and risk of mortality by competing causes.In the German randomized Lung Screening Intervention Trial (LUSI), we measured growth/differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic protein (NT-proBNP), in blood serum samples collected at start of the trial. Participants in the computed tomography (CT)-screening arm also had a pulmonary function test. Regression models were used to examine these markers as predictors for impaired lung function, LC risk and mortality due to LC or other causes, independently of age, sex and smoking history.Our models showed increases in LC risk among participants with elevated serum levels of GDF-15 [odds ratio (OR)Q4-Q1=2.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.49-4.26], IL-6 [ORQ4-Q1=2.36 (1.43-4.00)] and CRP [ORQ4-Q1=1.81 (1.08-2.75)]. Likewise, proportional hazards models showed increased risks for LC-related mortality, hazard ratio (HR)Q4-Q1of 4.63 (95% CI: 2.13-10.07) for GDF-15, 3.56 (1.72-7.37) for IL-6 and 2.34 (1.24-4.39) for CRP. All four markers were associated with increased risk of mortality by causes other than LC, with strongest associations for GDF-15 [HRQ4-Q1=3.04 (2.09-4.43)] and IL-6 [HRQ4-Q1=2.98 (2.08-4.28)]. Significant associations were also observed between IL-6, CRP, GDF-15 and impaired pulmonary function [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm)]. Multi-marker models identified GDF-15 and IL-6 as joint risk predictors for risk of LC diagnosis, without further discrimination by CRP or NT-proBNP. A model based on age, sex, smoking-related variables, GFD-15 and IL-6 provided moderately strong discrimination for prediction of LC diagnoses within 9 years after blood sampling [area under the curve (AUC) =74.3% (57.3-90.2%)], compared to 67.0% (49.3-84.8%) for a model without biomarkers. For mortality by competing causes, a model including biomarkers resulted in an AUC of 76.2% (66.6-85.3%)], compared to 70.0% (60.9-77.9%) a model including age, sex and smoking variables.Serum GDF-15 and IL-6 may be useful indicators for estimating risks for LC and competing mortality among long-term smokers participating in LC screening, to optimize LC screening strategies.2023 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

Throughout this tree, we systematically nominate genes encoding transcription factors and other proteins as candidate drivers of the in vivo differentiation of hundreds of cell types. Remarkably, the most marked temporal shifts in cell states are observed within one hour of birth and presumably underlie the massive physiological adaptations that must accompany the successful transition of a mammalian fetus to life outside the womb.© 2024.

In males the 46thchromosome is a Y; in females it is an ""inactive"" X (Xi). Through linear modeling of autosomal gene expression in cells from individuals with zero to three Xi and zero to four Y chromosomes, we found that Xi and Y impact autosomal expression broadly and with remarkably similar effects. Studying sex chromosome structural anomalies, promoters of Xi- and Y-responsive genes, and CRISPR inhibition, we traced part of this shared effect to homologous transcription factors-ZFX and ZFY-encoded by Chr X and Y. This demonstrates sex-shared mechanisms by which Xi and Y modulate autosomal expression. Combined with earlier analyses of sex-linked gene expression, our studies show that 21% of all genes expressed in lymphoblastoid cells or fibroblasts change expression significantly in response to Xi or Y chromosomes.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

However, studies integrating these numerous and potentially prognostically relevant DNA methylation changes are lacking. Therefore, we aimed for an overall evaluation of these epigenetic aberrations to provide a comprehensive NGS-based approach of DNA methylation assessment for AML prognostication.We designed a sequencing panel targeting 239 regions (approx. 573 kb of total size) described in the literature as having a prognostic impact or being associated with AML pathogenesis. Diagnostic whole-blood DNA samples of adult AML patients divided into a training (n = 128) and a testing cohort (n = 50) were examined. The libraries were prepared using SeqCap Epi Enrichments System (Roche) and sequenced on MiSeq instrument (Illumina). Altogether, 1935 CpGs affecting the survival (p < 0.05) were revealed in the training cohort. A summarizing value MethScore was then calculated from these significant CpGs. Patients with lower MethScore had markedly longer overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) than those with higher MethScore (p < 0.001). The predictive ability of MethScore was verified on the independent testing cohort for OS (p = 0.01). Moreover, the proof-of-principle validation was performed using the TCGA dataset.We showed that comprehensive NGS-based approach of DNA methylation assessment revealed a robust epigenetic signature relevant to AML outcome.

The lead SNP is in the FCGR/FCRL region, which shows a penetrating association in the Asian population, while a complete linkage disequilibrium SNP, rs10917688, is found in a cis-regulatory element for IRF8. IRF8 is also a significant locus in European GWAS for systemic sclerosis, but rs10917688 only shows an association in the presence of the risk allele of IRF8 in the Japanese population. Further analysis shows that rs10917688 is marked with H3K4me1 in primary B cells. A meta-analysis with a European GWAS detects 30 additional significant loci. Polygenic risk scores constructed with the effect sizes of the meta-analysis suggest the potential portability of genetic associations beyond populations.

38317187,"Novel functional insights into ischemic stroke biology provided by the first genome-wide association study of stroke in indigenous Africans.","Genome Med","African ancestry populations have the highest burden of stroke worldwide, yet the genetic basis of stroke in these populations is obscure. The Stroke Investigative Research and Educational Network (SIREN) is a multicenter study involving 16 sites in West Africa. We conducted the first-ever genome-wide association study (GWAS) of stroke in indigenous Africans.Cases were consecutively recruited consenting adults (aged > 18 years) with neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke. Stroke-free controls were ascertained using a locally validated Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-Free Status. DNA genotyping with the H3Africa array was performed, and following initial quality control, GWAS datasets were imputed into the NIH Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) release2 from BioData Catalyst. Furthermore, we performed fine-mapping, trans-ethnic meta-analysis, and in silico functional characterization to identify likely causal variants with a functional interpretation.We observed genome-wide significant (P-value < 5.0E-8) SNPs associations near AADACL2 and miRNA (MIR5186) genes in chromosome 3 after adjusting for hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and cardiac status in the base model as covariates. SNPs near the miRNA (MIR4458) gene in chromosome 5 were also associated with stroke (P-value < 1.0E-6). The putative genes near AADACL2, MIR5186, and MIR4458 genes were protective and novel. SNPs associations with stroke in chromosome 2 were more than 77 kb from the closest gene LINC01854 and SNPs in chromosome 7 were more than 116 kb to the closest gene LINC01446 (P-value < 1.0E-6). In addition, we observed SNPs in genes STXBP5-AS1 (chromosome 6), GALTN9 (chromosome 12), FANCA (chromosome 16), and DLGAP1 (chromosome 18) (P-value < 1.0E-6). Both genomic regions near genes AADACL2 and MIR4458 remained significant following fine mapping.Our findings identify potential roles of regulatory miRNA, intergenic non-coding DNA, and intronic non-coding RNA in the biology of ischemic stroke. These findings reveal new molecular targets that promise to help close the current gaps in accurate African ancestry-based genetic stroke's risk prediction and development of new targeted interventions to prevent or treat stroke.© 2024.

Growing proofs demonstrate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are of critical importance in CRC pathogenesis, but their mechanisms remain yet unknown. The current research was designed to recognize underlying biomarkers associated with TAMs in CRC. We screened macrophage-related gene modules through WGCNA, selected hub genes utilizing the LASSO algorithm and COX regression, and established a model. External validation was performed by expression analysis using datasets GSE14333, GSE74602, and GSE87211.

To approach this, we evaluated the impact of variants in 3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of genes in loci associated with substance use and neurological disorders using a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) in neuroblastoma and microglia cells. Functionally impactful variants explained a higher proportion of heritability of alcohol traits than non-functional variants. We identified genes whose 3'UTR activities are associated with AUD and alcohol consumption by combining variant effects from MPRA with GWAS results. We examined their effects by evaluating gene expression after CRISPR inhibition of neuronal cells and stratifying brain tissue samples by MPRA-derived 3'-UTR activity. A pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes identified inflammation response pathways. These analyses suggest that variation in response to inflammation contributes to the propensity to increase alcohol consumption.",5.95518247781059e-21
38359932,"Epigenetic profile of the immune system associated with symptom severity and treatment response in schizophrenia.","J Psychiatry Neurosci","Environmental modification of genetic information (epigenetics) is often invoked to explain interindividual differences in the phenotype of schizophrenia. In clinical practice, such variability is most prominent in the symptom profile and the treatment response. Epigenetic regulation of immune function is of particular interest, given the therapeutic relevance of this mechanism in schizophrenia.We analyzed the DNA methylation data of immune-relevant genes in patients with schizophrenia whose disease duration was less than 3 years, with previous lifetime antipsychotic treatment of no more than 2 weeks total.A total of 441 patients met the inclusion criteria. Core symptoms were consistently associated with 206 methylation positions, many of which had previously been implicated in inflammatory responses. Of these, 24 methylation positions were located either in regulatory regions or near the CpG islands of 20 genes, including theSRCgene, which is a key player in glutamatergic signalling. These symptom-associated immune genes were enriched in neuronal development functions, such as neuronal migration and glutamatergic synapse. Compared with using only clinical information (including scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale), integrating methylation data into the model significantly improved the predictive ability (as indicated by area under the curve) for response to 8 weeks of antipsychotic treatment.We focused on a small number of methylation probes (immune-centred search) and lacked nutritional data and direct brain-based measures.Epigenetic modifications of the immune system are associated with symptom severity at onset and subsequent treatment response in schizophrenia.© 2024 CMA Impact Inc. or its licensors.",5.65544986791856e-21

However, with the improvements in the resolution and scale of ST data, deciphering spatial domains precisely while ensuring efficiency and scalability is still challenging. Here, we develop SGCAST, an efficient auto-encoder framework to identify spatial domains. SGCAST adopts a symmetric graph convolutional auto-encoder to learn aggregated latent embeddings via integrating the gene expression similarity and the proximity of the spatial spots. This framework in SGCAST enables a mini-batch training strategy, which makes SGCAST memory-efficient and scalable to high-resolution spatial transcriptomic data with a large number of spots. SGCAST improves the overall accuracy of spatial domain identification on benchmarking data. We also validated the performance of SGCAST on ST datasets at various scales across multiple platforms. Our study illustrates the superior capacity of SGCAST on analyzing spatial transcriptomic data.© The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

38181737,"XIST directly regulates X-linked and autosomal genes in naive human pluripotent cells.","Cell","X chromosome inactivation (XCI) serves as a paradigm for RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression, wherein the long non-coding RNA XIST spreads across the X chromosome in cis to mediate gene silencing chromosome-wide. In female naive human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), XIST is in a dispersed configuration, and XCI does not occur, raising questions about XIST's function. We found that XIST spreads across the X chromosome and induces dampening of X-linked gene expression in naive hPSCs. Surprisingly, XIST also targets specific autosomal regions, where it induces repressive chromatin changes and gene expression dampening. Thereby, XIST equalizes X-linked gene dosage between male and female cells while inducing differences in autosomes. The dispersed Xist configuration and autosomal localization also occur transiently during XCI initiation in mouse PSCs. Together, our study identifies XIST as the regulator of X chromosome dampening, uncovers an evolutionarily conserved trans-acting role of XIST/Xist, and reveals a correlation between XIST/Xist dispersal and autosomal targeting.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

38298815,NA,NA,"Pregnancies resulting from assisted reproductive techniques (ART) are increasingly prevalent worldwide. While most pregnancies conceived throughin-vitrofertilization (IVF) progress without complications, mounting evidence suggests that these pregnancies are at a heightened risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Specifically, IVF pregnancies involving oocyte donation have garnered attention due to numerous reports indicating an elevated risk profile for pregnancy-related complications within this subgroup of patients. The precise mechanisms contributing to this increased risk of complications remain incompletely understood. Nonetheless, it is likely that they are mediated by an abnormal immune response at the fetal-maternal interface. Additionally, these outcomes may be influenced by baseline patient characteristics, such as the etiology of infertility, absence of corpus luteum, and variations in endometrial preparation protocols, among other factors. This review aims to succinctly summarize the most widely accepted mechanisms that potentially contribute to the onset of placental dysfunction in pregnancies conceived through oocyte donation.Copyright © 2024 Caradeux, Fernández, Ávila, Valenzuela, Mondión and Figueras.",4.32938787138832e-21

Circulating tumor DNA fraction (ctDNA%) is increasingly reported by commercial and laboratory tests but its utility for risk stratification is unclear. Here, we intersect ctDNA%, treatment outcomes, and clinical characteristics across 738 plasma samples from 491 male mCRPC patients from two randomized multicentre phase II trials and a prospective province-wide blood biobanking program. ctDNA% correlates with serum and radiographic metrics of disease burden and is highest in patients with liver metastases. ctDNA% strongly predicts overall survival, progression-free survival, and treatment response independent of therapeutic context and outperformed established prognostic clinical factors. Recognizing that ctDNA-based biomarker genotyping is limited by low ctDNA% in some patients, we leverage the relationship between clinical prognostic factors and ctDNA% to develop a clinically-interpretable machine-learning tool that predicts whether a patient has sufficient ctDNA% for informative ctDNA genotyping (available online: https://www.ctDNA.org ). Our results affirm ctDNA% as an actionable tool for patient risk stratification and provide a practical framework for optimized biomarker testing.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.28441747031531e-21

Both conditions, influenced by cardiometabolic risk factors such as insulin resistance, hypertension, and central adiposity, manifest earlier and with unique thresholds in SAs. Epidemiological, demographic, nutritional, environmental, sociocultural, and economic transitions in SA have exacerbated the twin epidemic. The coupling of premature CAD and T2DM arises from increased obesity due to limited adipose storage, early-life undernutrition, distinct fat thresholds, reduced muscle mass, and a predisposition for hepatic fat accumulation from certain dietary choices cumulatively precipitating a decline in insulin sensitivity. As T2DM ensues, the β-cell adaptive responses are suboptimal, precipitating a transition from compensatory hyperinsulinemia to β-cell decompensation, underscoring a reduced functional β-cell reserve in SAs. This review delves into the interplay of these mechanisms and highlights a prediabetes endotype tied to elevated vascular risk. Deciphering these mechanistic interconnections promises to refine stratification paradigms, surpassing extant risk-prediction strategies.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society 2023.",4.04767714055891e-21

However, the accuracy of PGS models, typically trained in European- or East Asian-ancestry populations, tend to perform poorly in other ethnic minority populations, and their accuracies have not been evaluated for Native Hawaiians. Using body mass index, height, and type-2 diabetes as examples of highly polygenic traits, we evaluated the prediction accuracies of PGS models in a large Native Hawaiian sample from the Multiethnic Cohort with up to 5,300 individuals. We evaluated both publicly available PGS models or genome-wide PGS models trained in this study using the largest available GWAS. We found evidence of lowered prediction accuracies for the PGS models in some cases, particularly for height. We also found that using the Native Hawaiian samples as an optimization cohort during training did not consistently improve PGS performance. Moreover, even the best performing PGS models among Native Hawaiians would have lowered prediction accuracy among the subset of individuals most enriched with Polynesian ancestry. Our findings indicate that factors such as admixture histories, sample size and diversity in GWAS can influence PGS performance for complex traits among Native Hawaiian samples. This study provides an initial survey of PGS performance among Native Hawaiians and exposes the current gaps and challenges associated with improving polygenic prediction models for underrepresented minority populations.",4.00859338858572e-21

Our objective was to investigate the potential link between DKK1 methylation patterns and transcript levels and AS susceptibility. DNA methylation level of DKK1 was measured in 82 AS and 82 healthy controls (HCs) using targeted bisulfite sequencing. In addition, the transcript level of DKK1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 35 AS patients and 35 HCs was detected using real-time quantitative transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Our study showed that the DKK1 was significantly hypomethylated in AS patients (P < 0.001). The Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) showed that DKK1 methylation may be a potential biomarker. The results showed that the difference in DKK1 transcript levels between AS and HCs was not statistically significant. Further analysis showed that DKK1 methylation levels were positively correlated with age and negatively correlated with C-reactive protein levels, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR). The methylation level of DKK1 in PBMC of AS patients was significantly lower than that of HCs, and DKK1 methylation may be associated with susceptibility to AS. In addition, DNA methylation levels of DKK1 were negatively correlated with the level of inflammation in AS patients.© 2024.

We used functional genomics tools to profile the epigenomic landscape to help infer the differential transcriptional potential of apple- and pear-shaped women's subcutaneous adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). We found that CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) expression and its chromatin binding were increased in ADSCs from pear donors compared to those from apple donors. Interestingly, the pear enriched CTCF binding sites were located predominantly at the active transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes with active histone marks and YY1 motifs and were also associated with pear enriched RNAPII binding. In contrast, apple enriched CTCF binding sites were mainly found at intergenic regions and when identified at TSS, they were enriched with the bivalent chromatin signatures. Altogether, we provide evidence that CTCF plays an important role in differential regulation of subcutaneous ADSCs gene expression and may influence the development of apple vs. pear body shape.",2.04801748947181e-21
38395959,"Coexpression network analysis of the adult brain sheds light on the pathogenic mechanism of DDR1 in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.","Transl Psychiatry","DDR1 has been linked to schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) in association studies. DDR1 encodes 58 distinct transcripts, which can be translated into five isoforms (DDR1a-e) and are expressed in the brain. However, the transcripts expressed in each brain cell type, their functions and their involvement in SCZ and BD remain unknown. Here, to infer the processes in which DDR1 transcripts are involved, we used transcriptomic data from the human brain dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of healthy controls (N = 936) and performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis followed by enrichment analyses. Then, to explore the involvement of DDR1 transcripts in SCZ (N = 563) and BD (N = 222), we studied the association of coexpression modules with disease and performed differential expression and transcript significance analyses. Some DDR1 transcripts were distributed across five coexpression modules identified in healthy controls (MHC). MHC1 and MHC2 were enriched in the cell cycle and proliferation of astrocytes and OPCs; MHC3 and MHC4 were enriched in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination; and MHC5 was enriched in neurons and synaptic transmission. Most of the DDR1 transcripts associated with SCZ and BD pertained to MHC1 and MHC2. Altogether, our results suggest that DDR1 expression might be altered in SCZ and BD via the proliferation of astrocytes and OPCs, suggesting that these processes are relevant in psychiatric disorders.© 2024.

38307952,"The complex interplay of modifiable risk factors affecting prostate cancer disparities in African American men.","Nat Rev Urol","Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed non-skin malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the USA. However, the mortality rate of African American men aged 40-60 years is almost 2.5-fold greater than that of European American men. Despite screening and diagnostic and therapeutic advances, disparities in prostate cancer incidence and outcomes remain prevalent. The reasons that lead to this disparity in outcomes are complex and multifactorial. Established non-modifiable risk factors such as age and genetic predisposition contribute to this disparity; however, evidence suggests that modifiable risk factors (including social determinants of health, diet, steroid hormones, environment and lack of diversity in enrolment in clinical trials) are prominent contributing factors to the racial disparities observed. Disparities involved in the diagnosis, treatment and survival of African American men with prostate cancer have also been correlated with low socioeconomic status, education and lack of access to health care. The effects and complex interactions of prostate cancer modifiable risk factors are important considerations for mitigating the incidence and outcomes of this disease in African American men.© 2024.

However, identifying DNM in whole genome sequencing (WGS) data is a process that often suffers from low specificity. We propose a deep learning framework for DNM and cDNM detection in WGS data based on Google's DeepTrio software for variant calling, which considers regions of 110 bp up- and downstream from possible variants to take information from the surrounding region into account. We trained a model each for the DNM and cDNM detection tasks and tested it on data generated on the HiSeq and NovaSeq platforms. In total, the model was trained on 82 WGS trios generated on the NovaSeq and 16 on the HiSeq. For the DNM detection task, our model achieves a sensitivity of 95.7% and a precision of 89.6%. The extended model adds confidence information for cDNMs, in addition to standard variant classes and DNMs. While this causes a slight drop in DNM sensitivity (91.96%) and precision (90.5%), on HG002 cDNMs can be isolated from other variant classes in all cases (5 out of 5) with a precision of 76.9%. Since the model emits confidence probabilities for each variant class, it is possible to fine-tune cutoff thresholds to allow users to select a desired trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. These results show that DeepTrio can be retrained to identify complex mutational signatures with only little modification effort.© The Author(s) 2024.

38409596,"Fear memory regulation by the cAMP signaling pathway as an index of reexperiencing symptoms in posttraumatic stress disorder.","Mol Psychiatry","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder associated with traumatic memory, yet its etiology remains unclear. Reexperiencing symptoms are specific to PTSD compared to other anxiety-related disorders. Importantly, reexperiencing can be mimicked by retrieval-related events of fear memory in animal models of traumatic memory. Recent studies revealed candidate PTSD-associated genes that were related to the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling pathway. Here, we demonstrate the tight linkage between facilitated cAMP signaling and PTSD by analyzing loss- and gain-of-cAMP signaling effects on fear memory in mice and the transcriptomes of fear memory-activated mice and female PTSD patients with reexperiencing symptoms. Pharmacological and optogenetic upregulation or downregulation of cAMP signaling transduction enhanced or impaired, respectively, the retrieval and subsequent maintenance of fear memory in mice. In line with these observations, integrative mouse and human transcriptome analysis revealed the reduced mRNA expression of phosphodiesterase 4B (PDE4B), an enzyme that degrades cAMP, in the peripheral blood of PTSD patients showing more severe reexperiencing symptoms and the mouse hippocampus after fear memory retrieval. Importantly, more severe reexperiencing symptoms and lower PDE4B mRNA levels were correlated with decreased DNA methylation of a locus within PDE4B, suggesting the involvement of methylation in the mechanism of PTSD. These findings raise the possibility that the facilitation of cAMP signaling mediating the downregulation of PDE4B expression enhances traumatic memory, thereby playing a key role in the reexperiencing symptoms of PTSD patients as a functional index of these symptoms.© 2024.

38177348,"Genetic factors associated with suicidal behaviors and alcohol use disorders in an American Indian population.","Mol Psychiatry","American Indians (AI) demonstrate the highest rates of both suicidal behaviors (SB) and alcohol use disorders (AUD) among all ethnic groups in the US. Rates of suicide and AUD vary substantially between tribal groups and across different geographical regions, underscoring a need to delineate more specific risk and resilience factors. Using data from over 740 AI living within eight contiguous reservations, we assessed genetic risk factors for SB by investigating: (1) possible genetic overlap with AUD, and (2) impacts of rare and low-frequency genomic variants. Suicidal behaviors included lifetime history of suicidal thoughts and acts, including verified suicide deaths, scored using a ranking variable for the SB phenotype (range 0-4). We identified five loci significantly associated with SB and AUD, two of which are intergenic and three intronic on genes AACSP1, ANK1, and FBXO11. Nonsynonymous rare and low-frequency mutations in four genes including SERPINF1 (PEDF), ZNF30, CD34, and SLC5A9, and non-intronic rare and low-frequency mutations in genes OPRD1, HSD17B3 and one lincRNA were significantly associated with SB. One identified pathway related to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) regulation, whose 83 nonsynonymous rare and low-frequency variants on 10 genes were significantly linked to SB as well. Four additional genes, and two pathways related to vasopressin-regulated water metabolism and cellular hexose transport, also were strongly associated with SB. This study represents the first investigation of genetic factors for SB in an American Indian population that has high risk for suicide. Our study suggests that bivariate association analysis between comorbid disorders can increase statistical power; and rare and low-frequency variant analysis in a high-risk population enabled by whole-genome sequencing has the potential to identify novel genetic factors. Although such findings may be population specific, rare functional mutations relating to PEDF and HIF regulation align with past reports and suggest a biological mechanism for suicide risk and a potential therapeutic target for intervention.© 2023.

38191573,"Gene-SGAN: discovering disease subtypes with imaging and genetic signatures via multi-view weakly-supervised deep clustering.","Nat Commun","Disease heterogeneity has been a critical challenge for precision diagnosis and treatment, especially in neurologic and neuropsychiatric diseases. Many diseases can display multiple distinct brain phenotypes across individuals, potentially reflecting disease subtypes that can be captured using MRI and machine learning methods. However, biological interpretability and treatment relevance are limited if the derived subtypes are not associated with genetic drivers or susceptibility factors. Herein, we describe Gene-SGAN - a multi-view, weakly-supervised deep clustering method - which dissects disease heterogeneity by jointly considering phenotypic and genetic data, thereby conferring genetic correlations to the disease subtypes and associated endophenotypic signatures. We first validate the generalizability, interpretability, and robustness of Gene-SGAN in semi-synthetic experiments. We then demonstrate its application to real multi-site datasets from 28,858 individuals, deriving subtypes of Alzheimer's disease and brain endophenotypes associated with hypertension, from MRI and single nucleotide polymorphism data. Derived brain phenotypes displayed significant differences in neuroanatomical patterns, genetic determinants, biological and clinical biomarkers, indicating potentially distinct underlying neuropathologic processes, genetic drivers, and susceptibility factors. Overall, Gene-SGAN is broadly applicable to disease subtyping and endophenotype discovery, and is herein tested on disease-related, genetically-associated neuroimaging phenotypes.© 2024.

38336958,"Predicting DNA structure using a deep learning method.","Nat Commun","Understanding the mechanisms of protein-DNA binding is critical in comprehending gene regulation. Three-dimensional DNA structure, also described as DNA shape, plays a key role in these mechanisms. In this study, we present a deep learning-based method, Deep DNAshape, that fundamentally changes the current k-mer based high-throughput prediction of DNA shape features by accurately accounting for the influence of extended flanking regions, without the need for extensive molecular simulations or structural biology experiments. By using the Deep DNAshape method, DNA structural features can be predicted for any length and number of DNA sequences in a high-throughput manner, providing an understanding of the effects of flanking regions on DNA structure in a target region of a sequence. The Deep DNAshape method provides access to the influence of distant flanking regions on a region of interest. Our findings reveal that DNA shape readout mechanisms of a core target are quantitatively affected by flanking regions, including extended flanking regions, providing valuable insights into the detailed structural readout mechanisms of protein-DNA binding. Furthermore, when incorporated in machine learning models, the features generated by Deep DNAshape improve the model prediction accuracy. Collectively, Deep DNAshape can serve as versatile and powerful tool for diverse DNA structure-related studies.© 2024. The Author(s).",9.63492225864901e-22

This study estimated the genetic correlation and causal effect of ASD and cortical SA.Summarized data of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were separately downloaded from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (18,381 cases of ASD, and 27,969 controls) and the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis Consortium (33,992 participants of Europeans). We used Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and Heritability Estimation from Summary Statistics (HESS) to calculate the heritability of each trait. As for the genetic correlation between ASD and SA, LDSC was used for global correlation and HESS was used to examine the local genetic covariance further. We used three Mendelian randomization (MR) methods, Inverse-variance weighted, MR-Egger, and weighted median to estimate the causal relationship.LDSC observed a nominal significant genetic correlation (rg = 0.1229, P-value = 0.0346) between ASD and SA of the rostral anterior cingulate gyrus whereas analysis through HESS did not reveal any significant loci having genetic covariance. Based on MR results, statistically meaningful estimations were found in the following areas, postcentral cortex (β (SE) = 21.82 (7.84) mm, 95% CI: 6.46 to 37.19 mm, PIVW= 5.38 × 10- 3, PFDR= 3.09 × 10- 2), posterior cingulate gyrus (β (SE) = 6.23 (2.69) mm, 95% CI: 0.96 to 11.49 mm, PIVW= 2.05 × 10- 2, PFDR= 4.26 × 10- 2), supramarginal gyrus (β (SE) = 19.25 (8.43) mm, 95% CI: 29.29 to 35.77 mm, PIVW= 2.24 × 10- 2, PFDR= 4.31 × 10- 2).Our results provided genetic evidence to support the opinion that individuals with ASD tend to develop differences in cortical SA of special areas.

However, without careful model selection, the uncovered latent factors may reflect noise in the data rather than true underlying features, rendering such representations unsuitable for scientific interpretation. Existing solutions to this problem involve introducing additional measured variables or data augmentations specific to a particular data type. We propose a VAE architecture that predicts the next point in time and show that it mitigates the learning of spurious features. In addition, we introduce a model selection metric based on smoothness over time in the latent space. We show that together these two constraints on VAEs to be smooth over time produce robust latent representations and faithfully recover latent factors on synthetic datasets.",8.46989616439575e-22
38288572,"Maternally derived avian corticosterone affects offspring genome-wide DNA methylation in a passerine species.","Mol Ecol","Avian embryos develop in an egg composition which reflects both maternal condition and the recent environment of their mother. In birds, yolk corticosterone (CORT) influences development by impacting pre- and postnatal growth, as well as nestling stress responses and development. One possible mechanism through which maternal CORT may affect offspring development is via changes to offspring DNA methylation. We sought to investigate this, for the first time in birds, by quantifying the impact of manipulations to maternal CORT on offspring DNA methylation. We non-invasively manipulated plasma CORT concentrations of egg-laying female zebra finches (Taeniopygia castanotis) with an acute dose of CORT administered around the time of ovulation and collected their eggs. We then assessed DNA methylation in the resulting embryonic tissue and in their associated vitelline membrane blood vessels, during early development (5 days after lay), using two established methods - liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and methylation-sensitive amplification fragment length polymorphism (MS-AFLP). LC-MS analysis showed that global DNA methylation was lower in embryos from CORT-treated mothers, compared to control embryos. In contrast, blood vessel DNA from eggs from CORT-treated mothers showed global methylation increases, compared to control samples. There was a higher proportion of global DNA methylation in the embryonic DNA of second clutches, compared to first clutches. Locus-specific analyses using MS-AFLP did not reveal a treatment effect. Our results indicate that an acute elevation of maternal CORT around ovulation impacts DNA methylation patterns in their offspring. This could provide a mechanistic understanding of how a mother's experience can affect her offspring's phenotype.© 2024 The Authors.

Our simulation studies demonstrate that MuSiCal outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for both signature discovery and assignment. By reanalyzing more than 2,700 cancer genomes, we provide an improved catalog of signatures and their assignments, discover nine indel signatures absent in the current catalog, resolve long-standing issues with the ambiguous 'flat' signatures and give insights into signatures with unknown etiologies.

38245873,"Resistance and aerobic training increases genome-wide DNA methylation in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.","Epigenetics","Physical activity is a first-line treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Resistance or aerobic exercise improves metabolic complications, reproductive outcomes, and quality of life in PCOS. DNA methylation reprogramming during exercise may be the major modifier behind these changes. We sought to evaluate genome-wide DNA methylation changes after supervised resistance and aerobic exercise in women with PCOS. Exercises were performed in 56 women with PCOS (resistance,n = 30; aerobic,n = 26), for 16 weeks (wks), three times per week, in 50-minute to one-hour sessions. Anthropometric indices and hormonal and metabolic parameters were measured before and after training. Genome-wide leukocyte DNA methylation was analysed by Infinium Human MethylationEPIC 850K BeadChip microarrays (Illumina). Both resistance and aerobic exercise improved anthropometric indices, metabolic dysfunction, and hyperandrogenism in PCOS after the training programme, but no differences were observed between the two exercises. Resistance and aerobic exercise increased genome-wide DNA methylation, although resistance changed every category in the CpG island context (islands, shores, shelve, and open sea), whereas aerobic exercise altered CpG shores and the open sea. Using a stringent FDR (>40), 6 significantly differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were observed in the resistance exercise cohort and 14 DRMs in the aerobic cohort, all of which were hypermethylated. The increase in genome-wide DNA methylation may be related to the metabolic and hormonal changes observed in PCOS after resistance and aerobic exercise. Since the mammalian genome is hypermethylated globally to prevent genomic instability and ageing, resistance and aerobic exercise may promote health and longevity through environmentally induced epigenetic changes.",6.18816535435421e-22

Etiologic factors associated with both prostate carcinogenesis and somatic alterations in tumors are incompletely understood. While genetic variants associated with PCa have been identified, epigenetic alterations in PCa are relatively understudied. To date, DNA methylation (DNAm) and gene expression (GE) in PCa have been investigated; however, these studies did not correct for cell-type proportions of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which could confound results.The data (GSE183040) consisted of DNAm and GE data from both tumor and adjacent non-tumor prostate tissue of 56 patients who underwent radical prostatectomies prior to any treatment. This study builds upon previous studies that examined methylation patterns and GE in PCa patients by using a novel tumor deconvolution approach to identify and correct for cell-type proportions of the TME in its epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and differential expression analysis (DEA).The inclusion of cell-type proportions in EWASs and DEAs reduced the scope of significant alterations associated with PCa. We identified 2,093 significantly differentially methylated CpGs (DMC), and 51 genes associated with PCa, including PCA3, SPINK1, and AMACR.This work illustrates the importance of correcting for cell types of the TME when performing EWASs and DEAs on PCa samples, and establishes a more confounding-adverse methodology.

Using previously collected sleep and activity data on a wild-derived population of flies, we calculate sleep latency, confirming significant, heritable genetic variation for this complex trait. We identify 520 polymorphisms in 248 genes contributing to variability in sleep latency. Tests of mutations in 23 candidate genes and additional putative pan-neuronal knockdown of 9 of them implicated CG44153, Piezo, Proc-R and Rbp6 in sleep latency. Two large-effect mutations in the genes Proc-R and Piezo were further confirmed via genetic rescue.

We developed a framework, the Rare variant heritability (RARity) estimator, to assess RV heritability (h2RV) without assuming a particular genetic architecture. We applied RARity to 31 complex traits in the UK Biobank (n = 167,348) and showed that gene-level RV aggregation suffers from 79% (95% CI: 68-93%) loss of h2RV. Using unaggregated variants, 27 traits had h2RV > 5%, with height having the highest h2RVat 21.9% (95% CI: 19.0-24.8%). The total heritability, including common and rare variants, recovered pedigree-based estimates for 11 traits. RARity can estimate gene-level h2RV, enabling the assessment of gene-level characteristics and revealing 11, previously unreported, gene-phenotype relationships. Finally, we demonstrated that in silico pathogenicity prediction (variant-level) and gene-level annotations do not generally enrich for RVs that over-contribute to complex trait variance, and thus, innovative methods are needed to predict RV functionality.© 2024.

Many aging-related changes have been observed and touted as drivers of aging, including molecular changes in the genome, telomeres, mitochondria, epigenome and proteins and cellular changes affecting stem cells, the immune system and senescent cell buildup. Determining which changes are drivers and not passengers of aging remains a challenge, however, and I discuss how animal models and human genetic studies have been used empirically to infer causality.

We apply this methodology to the COPDGene study, a large study of current and former smoking individuals with and without COPD. Our approach generates a set of vector embeddings, called Personalized Integrated Profiles (PIPs), that recapitulate the joint clinical and molecular state of the subjects in the study. Prediction experiments show that the PIPs have a predictive accuracy comparable to or better than other embedding approaches. Using trajectory learning approaches, we analyze the main trajectories of variation in the PIP space and identify five well-separated subtypes with distinct clinical phenotypes, expression signatures, and disease outcomes. Notably, these subtypes are more robust to data resampling compared to those identified using traditional clustering approaches. Overall, our findings provide new avenues to establish fine-grained associations between the clinical characteristics, molecular processes, and disease outcomes of COPD.",3.73440436405379e-22

We have previously shown that a missense variant in synaptonemal complex central element protein 2 (SYCE2), in a key residue for the assembly of the synaptonemal complex backbone, associates with recombination traits. Here we show that it also increases risk of pregnancy loss in a genome-wide association analysis on 114,761 women with reported pregnancy loss. We further show that the variant associates with more random placement of crossovers and lower recombination rate in longer chromosomes but higher in the shorter ones.

However, little is known about the early dynamics of gene expression in these disorders due to their relatively late manifestation. To address this, we conducted a secondary analysis of post-mortem prefrontal cortex datasets using bioinformatics and machine learning techniques to identify differentially expressed gene modules associated with aging and the diseases, determine their time-perturbation points, and assess enrichment with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) genes. Our findings revealed early, mid, and late deregulation of expression of functional gene modules involved in neurodevelopment, plasticity, homeostasis, and immune response. This supports the hypothesis that multiple hits throughout life contribute to disease manifestation rather than a single early-life event. Moreover, the time-perturbed functional gene modules were associated with genetic loci affecting gene expression, highlighting the role of genetic factors in gene expression dynamics and the development of disease phenotypes. Our findings emphasize the importance of investigating time-dependent perturbations in gene expression before the age of onset in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of psychiatric disorders.© 2024.

Here, we studied the effects of aging on the transcriptome, translatome, and multiple layers of the proteome in the brain of a short-lived killifish. We reveal that aging causes widespread reduction of proteins enriched in basic amino acids that is independent of mRNA regulation, and it is not due to impaired proteasome activity. Instead, we identify a cascade of events where aberrant translation pausing leads to reduced ribosome availability resulting in proteome remodeling independently of transcriptional regulation. Our research uncovers a vulnerable point in the aging brain's biology - the biogenesis of basic DNA/RNA binding proteins. This vulnerability may represent a unifying principle that connects various aging hallmarks, encompassing genome integrity and the biosynthesis of macromolecules.",2.47773416337942e-22
38267456,NA,NA,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the death of motor neurons, the aetiology of which is essentially unknown. Here, we present an integrative epigenomic study in blood samples from seven clinically characterised sporadic ALS patients to elucidate molecular factors associated with the disease. We used clinical exome sequencing (CES) to study DNA variants, DNA-RNA hybrid immunoprecipitation sequencing (DRIP-seq) to assess R-loop distribution, and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to examine DNA methylation changes. The above datasets were combined to create a comprehensive repository of genetic and epigenetic changes associated with the ALS cases studied. This repository is well-suited to unveil new correlations within individual patients and across the entire patient cohort. The molecular attributes described here are expected to guide further mechanistic studies on ALS, shedding light on the underlying genetic causes and facilitating the development of new epigenetic therapies to combat this life-threatening disease.© 2024.

VRJS is caused by deletions of chromosome 8q24.3 or pathogenic variants in the PUF60 gene. Recently, pathogenic PUF60 variants have been reported in some individuals with VRJS, contributing to the variability in the clinical presentation and severity of the condition. PUF60 encodes a protein involved in regulating gene expression and cellular growth. In this report, we describe a new case of VRJS with developmental delay, cardiac-, and renal abnormalities, caused by a heterozygous pathogenic PUF60 variant. Surprisingly, DNA methylation analysis revealed a pattern resembling the Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) episignature, suggesting a potential connection between PUF60 and CdLS-related genes. This case report further delineates the clinical and molecular spectrum of VRJS and supports further research to validate the interaction between VRJS and CdLS.© 2024.

38266094,"Identification of region-specific gene isoforms in the human brain using long-read transcriptome sequencing.","Sci Adv","In neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, different brain regions are affected, and differences in gene expression patterns could potentially explain this mechanism. However, limited studies have precisely explored gene expression in different regions of the human brain. In this study, we performed long-read RNA sequencing on three different brain regions of the same individuals: the cerebellum, hypothalamus, and temporal cortex. Despite stringent filtering criteria excluding isoforms predicted to be artifacts, over half of the isoforms expressed in multiple samples across multiple regions were found to be unregistered in the GENCODE reference. We then especially focused on genes with different major isoforms in each brain region, even with similar overall expression levels, and identified that many of such genes includingGAS7might have distinct roles in dendritic spine and neuronal formation in each region. We also found that DNA methylation might, in part, drive different isoform expressions in different regions. These findings highlight the significance of analyzing isoforms expressed in disease-relevant sites.",2.03459279954412e-22
38178910,"Genome-scale copy number variant analysis in schizophrenia patients and controls from South India.","Front Mol Neurosci","Copy number variants (CNVs) are among the main genetic factors identified in schizophrenia (SZ) through genome-scale studies conducted mostly in Caucasian populations. However, to date, there have been no genome-scale CNV reports on patients from India. To address this shortcoming, we generated, for the first time, genome-scale CNV data for 168 SZ patients and 168 controls from South India. In total, 63 different CNVs were identified in 56 patients and 46 controls with a significantly higher proportion of medium-sized deletions (100 kb-1 Mb) after multiple testing (FDR = 2.7E-4) in patients. Of these, 13 CNVs were previously reported; however, when searched against GWAS, transcriptome, exome, and DNA methylation studies, another 17 CNVs with candidate genes were identified. Of the total 30 CNVs, 28 were present in 38 patients and 12 in 27 controls, indicating a significantly higher representation in the former (p = 1.87E-5). Only 4q35.1-q35.2 duplications were significant (p = 0.020) and observed in 11 controls and 2 patients. Among the others that are not significant, a few examples of patient-specific and previously reported CNVs include deletions of 11q14.1 (DLG2), 22q11.21, and 14q21.1 (LRFN5). 16p13.3 deletion (RBFOX1), 3p14.2 duplication (CADPS), and 7p11.2 duplication (CCT6A) were some of the novel CNVs containing candidate genes. However, these observations need to be replicated in a larger sample size. In conclusion, this report constitutes an important foundation for future CNV studies in a relatively unexplored population. In addition, the data indicate that there are advantages in using an integrated approach for better identification of candidate CNVs for SZ and other mental health disorders.Copyright © 2023 Singh, Pradhan, Kkani, Prasad Rao, Dhagudu, Kumar, Ramasubramanian, Kumar, Sonttineni and Mohan.",1.70332730472367e-22
38242899,"Genetic architecture distinguishes tinnitus from hearing loss.","Nat Commun","Tinnitus is a heritable, highly prevalent auditory disorder treated by multiple medical specialties. Previous GWAS indicated high genetic correlations between tinnitus and hearing loss, with little indication of differentiating signals. We present a GWAS meta-analysis, triple previous sample sizes, and expand to non-European ancestries. GWAS in 596,905 Million Veteran Program subjects identified 39 tinnitus loci, and identified genes related to neuronal synapses and cochlear structural support. Applying state-of-the-art analytic tools, we confirm a large number of shared variants, but also a distinct genetic architecture of tinnitus, with higher polygenicity and large proportion of variants not shared with hearing difficulty. Tissue-expression analysis for tinnitus infers broad enrichment across most brain tissues, in contrast to hearing difficulty. Finally, tinnitus is not only correlated with hearing loss, but also with a spectrum of psychiatric disorders, providing potential new avenues for treatment. This study establishes tinnitus as a distinct disorder separate from hearing difficulties.© 2024.

Early detection is crucial to reduce lung cancer-related mortality. Aberrant DNA methylation occurs early during carcinogenesis and can be detected in blood. It is essential to investigate the dysregulated blood methylation markers for early diagnosis of NSCLC.NSCLC-associated methylation gene folate receptor gamma (FOLR3) was selected from an Illumina 850K array analysis of peripheral blood samples. Mass spectrometry was used for validation in two independent case-control studies (validation I: n = 2548; validation II: n = 3866). Patients with lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) or lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), normal controls (NCs) and benign pulmonary nodule (BPN) cases were included. FOLR3 methylations were compared among different populations. Their associations with NSCLC clinical features were investigated. Receiver operating characteristic analyses, Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon test, logistics regression analysis and nomogram analysis were performed.Two CpG sites (CpG_1 and CpG_2) of FOLR3 was significantly lower methylated in NSCLC patients than NCs in the discovery round. In the two validations, both LUSC and LUAD patients presented significant FOLR3 hypomethylations. LUSC patients were highlighted to have significantly lower methylation levels of CpG_1 and CpG_2 than BPN cases and LUAD patients. Both in the two validations, CpG_1 methylation and CpG_2 methylation could discriminate LUSC from NCs well, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.818 and 0.832 in validation I, and 0.789 and 0.780 in validation II. They could also differentiate LUAD from NCs, but with lower efficiency. CpG_1 and CpG_2 methylations could also discriminate LUSC from BPNs well individually in the two validations. With the combined dataset of two validations, the independent associations of age, gender, and FOLR3 methylation with LUSC and LUAD risk were shown and the age-gender-CpG_1 signature could discriminate LUSC and LUAD from NCs and BPNs, with higher efficiency for LUSC.Blood-based FOLR3 hypomethylation was shown in LUSC and LUAD. FOLR3 methylation heterogeneity between LUSC and LUAD highlighted its stronger associations with LUSC. FOLR3 methylation and the age-gender-CpG_1 signature might be novel diagnostic markers for the early detection of NSCLC, especially for LUSC.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.3699230777461e-22
38413574,"Nightmares share genetic risk factors with sleep and psychiatric traits.","Transl Psychiatry","Nightmares are vivid, extended, and emotionally negative or negative dreams that awaken the dreamer. While sporadic nightmares and bad dreams are common and generally harmless, frequent nightmares often reflect underlying pathologies of emotional regulation. Indeed, insomnia, depression, anxiety, or alcohol use have been associated with nightmares in epidemiological and clinical studies. However, the connection between nightmares and their comorbidities are poorly understood. Our goal was to examine the genetic risk factors for nightmares and estimate correlation or causality between nightmares and comorbidities. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 45,255 individuals using a questionnaire-based assessment on the frequency of nightmares during the past month and genome-wide genotyping data. While the GWAS did not reveal individual risk variants, heritability was estimated at 5%. In addition, the genetic correlation analysis showed a robust correlation (rg > 0.4) of nightmares with anxiety (rg = 0.671, p = 7.507e-06), depressive (rg = 0.562, p = 1.282e-07) and posttraumatic stress disorders (rg = 0.4083, p = 0.0152), and personality trait neuroticism (rg = 0.667, p = 4.516e-07). Furthermore, Mendelian randomization suggested causality from insomnia to nightmares (beta = 0.027, p = 0.0002). Our findings suggest that nightmares share genetic background with psychiatric traits and that insomnia may increase an individual's liability to experience frequent nightmares. Given the significant correlations with psychiatric and psychological traits, it is essential to grow awareness of how nightmares affect health and disease and systematically collect information about nightmares, especially from clinical samples and larger cohorts.© 2024.

To understand how these non-canonical brain regions respond to imbalances in energy homeostasis, we performed two experiments examining the effects of different diets in male C57BL6 mice. In our first study, groups of six pair-housed mice were given access to chow, high-fat diet or fasted for 16 hours. In our subsequent study, two groups of 10 mice were single-housed and given access to chow or fasted for 24 h. We recorded food intake for each cage, the change in body weight for each animal, and collected hypothalamus, hippocampus, superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, frontal cortex, and zona incerta-centric samples. We performed bulk RNA sequencing on 185 samples and validated them by a series of quality control assessments including alignment quality and gene expression profiling.

The genetic basis of youth-onset T2D and its relationship to other forms of diabetes are unclear3. Here we report a detailed genetic characterization of youth-onset T2D by analysing exome sequences and common variant associations for 3,005 individuals with youth-onset T2D and 9,777 adult control participants matched for ancestry, including both males and females. We identify monogenic diabetes variants in 2.4% of individuals and three exome-wide significant (P < 2.6 × 10-6) gene-level associations (HNF1A, MC4R, ATXN2L). Furthermore, we report rare variant association enrichments within 25 gene sets related to obesity, monogenic diabetes and β-cell function. Many youth-onset T2D associations are shared with adult-onset T2D, but genetic risk factors of all frequencies-and rare variants in particular-are enriched within youth-onset T2D cases (5.0-fold increase in the rare variant and 3.4-fold increase in common variant genetic liability relative to adult-onset cases). The clinical presentation of participants with youth-onset T2D is influenced in part by the frequency of genetic risk factors within each individual.

Utilizing high-throughput proteomic measurements in serum from a prospective population-based cohort of older adults (n = 5,294), we identified 303 unique proteins associated with incident LOAD (median follow-up 12.8 years). Over 40% of these proteins were associated with LOADindependentlyofAPOE-ε4carrier status. These proteins were implicated in neuronal processes and overlapped with protein signatures of LOAD in brain and cerebrospinal fluid. We found 17 proteins which LOAD-association was stronglydependentonAPOE-ε4carrier status. Most of them showed consistent associations with LOAD in cerebrospinal fluid and a third had brain-specific gene expression. Remarkably, four proteins in this group (TBCA, ARL2, S100A13 and IRF6) were downregulated byAPOE-ε4yet upregulated as a consequence of LOAD as determined in a bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis, reflecting a potential response to the disease onset. Accordingly, the direct association of these proteins to LOAD was reversed uponAPOE-ε4genotype adjustment, a finding which we replicate in an external cohort (n = 719). Our findings provide an insight into the dysregulated pathways that may lead to the development and early detection of LOAD, including those both independent and dependent onAPOE-ε4. Importantly, many of the LOAD-associated proteins we find in the circulation have been found to be expressed - and have a direct link with AD - in brain tissue. Thus, the proteins identified here, and their upstream modulating pathways, provide a new source of circulating biomarker and therapeutic target candidates for LOAD.",7.03611247372518e-23

Benchmarking studies have compared many of the computational methods used to reconstruct cellular dynamics, however researchers still encounter challenges in their analysis due to uncertainties in selecting the most appropriate methods and parameters. Even among universal data processing steps used by trajectory inference methods such as feature selection and dimension reduction, trajectory methods' performances are highly dataset-specific. To address these challenges, we developed Escort, a framework for evaluating a dataset's suitability for trajectory inference and quantifying trajectory properties influenced by analysis decisions. Escort navigates single-cell trajectory analysis through data-driven assessments, reducing uncertainty and much of the decision burden associated with trajectory inference.

38168353,"Polygenic prediction of human longevity on the supposition of pervasive pleiotropy.","medRxiv","The highly polygenic nature of human longevity renders cross-trait pleiotropy an indispensable feature of its genetic architecture. Leveraging the genetic correlation between the aging-related traits (ARTs), we sought to model the additive variance in lifespan as a function of cumulative liability from pleiotropic segregating variants. We tracked allele frequency changes as a function of viability across different age bins and prioritized 34 variants with an immediate implication on lipid metabolism, body mass index (BMI), and cognitive performance, among other traits, revealed by PheWAS analysis in the UK Biobank. Given the highly complex and non-linear interactions between the genetic determinants of longevity, we reasoned that a composite polygenic score would approximate a substantial portion of the variance in lifespan and developed the integrated longevity genetic scores (iLGSs) for distinguishing exceptional survival. We showed that coefficients derived from our ensemble model could potentially reveal an interesting pattern of genomic pleiotropy specific to lifespan. We assessed the predictive performance of our model for distinguishing the enrichment of exceptional longevity among long-lived individuals in two replication cohorts and showed that the median lifespan in the highest decile of our composite prognostic index is up to 4.8 years longer. Finally, using the proteomic correlates ofiLGS, we identified protein markers associated with exceptional longevity irrespective of chronological age and prioritized drugs with repurposing potentials for gerotherapeutics. Together, our approach demonstrates a promising framework for polygenic modeling of additive liability conferred by ARTs in defining exceptional longevity and assisting the identification of individuals at higher risk of mortality for targeted lifestyle modifications earlier in life. Furthermore, the proteomic signature associated withiLGShighlights the functional pathway upstream of the PI3K-Akt that can be effectively targeted to slow down aging and extend lifespan.",5.40275257953607e-23

This study aimed to investigate the genetic and molecular risk factors contributing to GDM and glycaemic traits.We collected non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) sequencing data along with four glycaemic and 55 biochemical measurements from 30,699 pregnant women during a 2 year period at Shenzhen Baoan Women's and Children's Hospital in China. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were conducted between genotypes derived from NIPTs and GDM diagnosis, baseline glycaemic levels and glycaemic levels after glucose challenges. In total, 3317 women were diagnosed with GDM, while 19,565 served as control participants. The results were replicated using two independent cohorts. Additionally, we performed one-sample Mendelian randomisation to explore potential causal associations between the 55 biochemical measurements and risk of GDM and glycaemic levels.We identified four genetic loci significantly associated with GDM susceptibility. Among these, MTNR1B exhibited the highest significance (rs10830963-G, OR [95% CI] 1.57 [1.45, 1.70], p=4.42×10-29), although its effect on type 2 diabetes was modest. Furthermore, we found 31 genetic loci, including 14 novel loci, that were significantly associated with the four glycaemic traits. The replication rates of these associations with GDM, fasting plasma glucose levels and 0 h, 1 h and 2 h OGTT glucose levels were 4 out of 4, 6 out of 9, 10 out of 11, 5 out of 7 and 4 out of 4, respectively.

However, developing bivalent inhibitors with the desired activity is challenging due to the dual motif architecture of these molecules and the variability that can be introduced through differing linker structures and geometries. We report a set of alternatively linked bivalent EGFR inhibitors that simultaneously occupy the ATP substrate and allosteric pockets. Crystal structures show that initial and redesigned linkers bridging a trisubstituted imidazole ATP-site inhibitor and dibenzodiazepinone allosteric-site inhibitor proved successful in spanning these sites. The re-engineered linker yielded a compound that exhibited significantly higher potency (~60 pM) against the drug-resistant EGFR L858R/T790M and L858R/T790M/C797S, which was superadditive as compared with the parent molecules.

We retrospectively analyzed 105 patients with NSCLC, from three institutions, treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and categorized them into training and independent testing set. Subsequently, we processed CT scans with a series of image-preprocessing techniques, and 6008 radiomic features capturing intra- and peritumoral texture patterns were extracted. We used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression model to select radiomic features and construct machine learning models. To further differentiate between progressive disease (PD) and hyperprogressive disease (HPD), we developed a new radiomics model. The logistic regression (LR) model showed optimal performance in distinguishing PP from HPD, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91-0.99) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.66-1) in the training and testing sets, respectively. Additionally, the support vector machine model showed optimal performance in distinguishing PD from HPD, with AUC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.93-1) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.72-1) in the training and testing sets, respectively. Kaplan‒Meier survival curves showed clear stratification between PP predicted by the radiomics model and true progression (HPD and PD) (hazard ratio = 0.337, 95% CI: 0.200-0.568,p < 0.01) in overall survival.

Existing prognostic scores provide moderate predictive performance, leading to challenges in establishing follow-up recommendations after surgery and in selecting patients who could benefit from adjuvant therapy. In this study, we developed a model for individual postoperative disease-free survival (DFS) prediction using machine learning (ML) on real-world prospective data. Using the French kidney cancer research network database, UroCCR, we analyzed a cohort of surgically treated RCC patients. Participating sites were randomly assigned to either the training or testing cohort, and several ML models were trained on the training dataset. The predictive performance of the best ML model was then evaluated on the test dataset and compared with the usual risk scores. In total, 3372 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 30 months. The best results in predicting DFS were achieved using Cox PH models that included 24 variables, resulting in an iAUC of 0.81 [IC95% 0.77-0.85]. The ML model surpassed the predictive performance of the most commonly used risk scores while handling incomplete data in predictors. Lastly, patients were stratified into four prognostic groups with good discrimination (iAUC = 0.79 [IC95% 0.74-0.83]). Our study suggests that applying ML to real-world prospective data from patients undergoing surgery for localized or locally advanced RCC can provide accurate individual DFS prediction, outperforming traditional prognostic scores.© 2024.

For example, in EBVaGC, all CpG sites within 1,44,189-1,45,136 bp of the EBV genome sequence on gene RPMS1 were hyper-methylated compared to the others. Differently, significant differences of EBV CpG sites, particularly those located on gene BILF2, were observed between NPC and nasal NKTCL patients in nasopharyngeal brushing samples. Further, the methylated level of BILF2 was further detected using qMSP, and a diagnostic model distinguishing NPC and nasal NKTCL was established. The AUC of the model was 0.9801 (95% CI 0.9524-1.0000), with the sensitivity and specificity of 98.81% (95% CI 93.63-99.94%) and 76.92% (95% CI 49.74-91.82%), respectively.Our study reveals more clues for further understanding the pathogenesis of EBV, and provides a possibility for distinguishing EBV-related tumor by detecting specific EBV CpG sites.© 2024.

The increasing and high incidence of cases in urban areas reveals the importance of studies to determine the epidemiological profile and the spatial distribution of these accidents. This is a retrospective study that describes and analyzes the cases of scorpion stings in the city of Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Northeast Brazil, from 2007 to 2018. Data from the Information System database of Notifiable Diseases (SINAN) were obtained from the Secretary of Health of Rio Grande do Norte. 31,368 accidents due to scorpion stings were reported, more frequently in urban areas of Natal, whose Human Development Index is low. The cases occurred predominantly in hot and humid regions, mainly affecting women aged between 30 and 60 years. Most individuals sought medical attention within 3 h of the incident. The severity and mortality of the injured individuals varied according to the area of occurrence, age of the patient, and the local and systemic symptoms presented. Pain, numbness, and edema were the most frequent local symptoms, and systemic symptoms were frequently described as headache, hyperthermia and sweating. Therefore, scorpionism in the city of Natal is an environmental and public health problem, with a significant growth trend (p < 0.05). Through the data collected on the spatial distribution and risks, this approach allows the creation of effective control strategies to prevent accidents.© 2024 The Authors.",2.45993059933679e-23
38370664,"Tradeoffs in Modeling Context Dependency in Complex Trait Genetics.","bioRxiv","Genetic effects on complex traits may depend on context, such as age, sex, environmental exposures or social settings. However, it is often unclear if the extent of context dependency, or Gene-by-Environment interaction (GxE), merits more involved models than the additive model typically used to analyze data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we suggest considering the utility of GxE models in GWAS as a tradeoff between bias and variance parameters. In particular, We derive a decision rule for choosing between competing models for the estimation of allelic effects. The rule weighs the increased estimation noise when context is considered against the potential bias when context dependency is ignored. In the empirical example of GxSex in human physiology, the increased noise of context-specific estimation often outweighs the bias reduction, rendering GxE models less useful when variants are considered independently. However, we argue that for complex traits, considering patterns of context dependency across many variants jointly can improve both estimation and trait prediction. Finally, we exemplify (using GxDiet effects on longevity in fruit flies) how considering polygenic trends of GxE may also be important for interpretation, as analyses based on independently ascertained ""top hits"" alone can be misleading.",2.36805220545306e-23

We present Building Aggregates with a Neighborhood Kernel and Spatial Yardstick (BANKSY), an algorithm that unifies these two spatial clustering problems by embedding cells in a product space of their own and the local neighborhood transcriptome, representing cell state and microenvironment, respectively. BANKSY's spatial feature augmentation strategy improved performance on both tasks when tested on diverse RNA (imaging, sequencing) and protein (imaging) datasets. BANKSY revealed unexpected niche-dependent cell states in the mouse brain and outperformed competing methods on domain segmentation and cell typing benchmarks. BANKSY can also be used for quality control of spatial transcriptomics data and for spatially aware batch effect correction. Importantly, it is substantially faster and more scalable than existing methods, enabling the processing of millions of cell datasets. In summary, BANKSY provides an accurate, biologically motivated, scalable and versatile framework for analyzing spatially resolved omics data.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.33413771092321e-23

Rapid genome sequencing (RGS), ultra-rapid genome sequencing (URGS), and rapid exome sequencing (RES) are diagnostic tests for genetic diseases for ICU patients. In 44 studies of children in ICUs with diseases of unknown etiology, 37% received a genetic diagnosis, 26% had consequent changes in management, and net healthcare costs were reduced by $14,265 per child tested by URGS, RGS, or RES. URGS outperformed RGS and RES with faster time to diagnosis, and higher rate of diagnosis and clinical utility. Diagnostic and clinical outcomes will improve as methods evolve, costs decrease, and testing is implemented within precision medicine delivery systems attuned to ICU needs. URGS, RGS, and RES are currently performed in <5% of the ~200,000 children likely to benefit annually due to lack of payor coverage, inadequate reimbursement, hospital policies, hospitalist unfamiliarity, under-recognition of possible genetic diseases, and current formatting as tests rather than as a rapid precision medicine delivery system. The gap between actual and optimal outcomes in children in ICUs is currently increasing since expanded use of URGS, RGS, and RES lags growth in those likely to benefit through new therapies. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that URGS, RGS, or RES should be considered in all children with diseases of uncertain etiology at ICU admission. Minimally, diagnostic URGS, RGS, or RES should be ordered early during admissions of critically ill infants and children with suspected genetic diseases.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.87918417711392e-23

Mosaic integration, in which different datasets share only some of the measured modalities, poses major challenges, particularly regarding modality alignment and batch effect removal. Here, we present a deep probabilistic framework for the mosaic integration and knowledge transfer (MIDAS) of single-cell multimodal data. MIDAS simultaneously achieves dimensionality reduction, imputation and batch correction of mosaic data by using self-supervised modality alignment and information-theoretic latent disentanglement. We demonstrate its superiority to 19 other methods and reliability by evaluating its performance in trimodal and mosaic integration tasks. We also constructed a single-cell trimodal atlas of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tailored transfer learning and reciprocal reference mapping schemes to enable flexible and accurate knowledge transfer from the atlas to new data.

We assessed the relationship between single-variant associations and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in 44 tissues and methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) in the hippocampus. We determined the relationship between gene associations and transcript levels in 53 tissues, annotation as immune genes, and regulation by transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs. To identify significant pathways, gene set enrichment was tested in each cohort and meta-analyzed across cohorts. Analyses of differential expression in brain tissues were conducted for pathway component genes.The single-variant associations of VDM showed significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) with eQTLs across all tissues and meQTLs within the hippocampus. Stronger WL-dr gene associations correlated with reduced expression in four brain tissues, including the hippocampus. More robust PAR-dr and/or WL-dr gene associations were intricately linked with immunity and were influenced by 31 TFs and 2 microRNAs. Six pathways, including type I diabetes, exhibited significant associations with both PAR-dr and WL-dr. These pathways included fifteen MHC genes intricately linked to VDM performance, showing diverse expression patterns based on cognitive status in brain tissues.VDM genetic associations influence expression regulation via eQTLs and meQTLs.

However, most diagnostic models rely on the absolute expression levels of miRNAs, which are susceptible to batch effects and challenging for clinical transformation. Furthermore, current studies on liquid biopsy diagnostic biomarkers for BrC mainly focus on distinguishing BrC patients from healthy controls, needing more specificity assessment.We collected a large number of miRNA expression data involving 8465 samples from GEO, including 13 different cancer types and non-cancer controls. Based on the relative expression orderings (REOs) of miRNAs within each sample, we applied the greedy, LASSO multiple linear regression, and random forest algorithms to identify a qualitative biomarker specific to BrC by comparing BrC samples to samples of other cancers as controls.We developed a BrC-specific biomarker called 7-miRPairs, consisting of seven miRNA pairs. It demonstrated comparable classification performance in our analyzed machine learning algorithms while requiring fewer miRNA pairs, accurately distinguishing BrC from 12 other cancer types. The diagnostic performance of 7-miRPairs was favorable in the training set (accuracy = 98.47%, specificity = 98.14%, sensitivity = 99.25%), and similar results were obtained in the test set (accuracy = 97.22%, specificity = 96.87%, sensitivity = 98.02%). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the 11 miRNAs within the 7-miRPairs revealed significant enrichment of target mRNAs in pathways associated with BrC.Our study provides evidence that utilizing serum miRNA pairs can offer significant advantages for BrC-specific diagnosis in clinical practice by directly comparing serum samples with BrC to other cancer types.© 2024.

Here we introduce a multi-variant generalization of allelic Fold Change (aFC), aFC-n, to enable quantification of the cis-regulatory effects in multi-eQTL genes under the assumption that all eQTLs are known and conditionally independent. Applying aFC-n to 458,465 eQTLs in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project data, we demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy over the original model in estimating the eQTL effect sizes and in predicting genetically regulated gene expression over the current tools. We characterize some of the empirical properties of the eQTL data and use this framework to assess the current state of eQTL data in terms of characterizing cis-regulatory landscape in individual genomes. Notably, we show that 77.4% of the genes with an allelic imbalance in a sample show 0.5 log2fold or more of residual imbalance after accounting for the eQTL data underlining the remaining gap in characterizing regulatory landscape in individual genomes.

SCA37 patients carry a pathogenic intronic (ATTTC)n repeat insertion flanked by two polymorphic (ATTTT)n repeats in the Disabled-1 (DAB1) gene leading to cerebellar dysregulation. Herein, we determine the precise configuration of the pathogenic 5'(ATTTT)n-(ATTTC)n-3'(ATTTT)n SCA37 alleles by CRISPR-Cas9 and long-read nanopore sequencing, reveal their epigenomic signatures in SCA37 lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and cerebellar samples, and establish new molecular and clinical correlations. The 5'(ATTTT)n-(ATTTC)n-3'(ATTTT)n pathogenic allele configurations revealed repeat instability and differential methylation signatures. Disease age of onset negatively correlated with the (ATTTC)n, and positively correlated with the 3'(ATTTT)n. Geographic origin and gender significantly correlated with age of onset. Furthermore, significant predictive regression models were obtained by machine learning for age of onset and disease evolution by considering gender, the (ATTTC)n, the 3'(ATTTT)n, and seven CpG positions differentially methylated in SCA37 cerebellum. A common 964-kb genomic region spanning the (ATTTC)n insertion was identified in all SCA37 patients analysed from Portugal and Spain, evidencing a common origin of the SCA37 mutation in the Iberian Peninsula originating 859 years ago (95% CI 647-1378). In conclusion, we demonstrate an accurate determination of the size and configuration of the regulatory 5'(ATTTT)n-(ATTTC)n-3'(ATTTT)n repeat tract, avoiding PCR bias amplification using CRISPR/Cas9-enrichment and nanopore long-read sequencing, resulting relevant for accurate genetic diagnosis of SCA37.

Profiting from the extremely high detection limit of the speckle sensor, variations in the specklegrams of antibody concentrations from 1 to 1000 ng/mL are measured in the experiment. The surface sensitivity of the biosensor is 0.0012 (ng/mL)-1within a range of 1 to 50 ng/mL. Moreover, a 2D-CNN was introduced to solve the problem of nonlinear detection surface sensitivity variation in a large dynamic range, and in the search for image features to improve evaluation accuracy, achieving more accurate CEACAM5 monitoring, with a maximum detection error of 0.358%.

Here we analyse 997 mouse mutant lines, revealing 145 genes whose loss significantly increases (n = 71) or decreases (n = 74) MN formation, including many genes whose orthologues are linked to human disease. We found that mice null for Dscc1, which showed the most significant increase in MN, also displayed a range of phenotypes characteristic of patients with cohesinopathy disorders. After validating the DSCC1-associated MN instability phenotype in human cells, we used genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening to define synthetic lethal and synthetic rescue interactors.

38181732,"A Bayesian approach to Mendelian randomization using summary statistics in the univariable and multivariable settings with correlated pleiotropy.","Am J Hum Genet","Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to make causal inferences on the effect of an exposure on an outcome. Due to the recent abundance of high-powered genome-wide association studies, many putative causal exposures of interest have large numbers of independent genetic variants with which they associate, each representing a potential instrument for use in a Mendelian randomization analysis. Such polygenic analyses increase the power of the study design to detect causal effects; however, they also increase the potential for bias due to instrument invalidity. Recent attention has been given to dealing with bias caused by correlated pleiotropy, which results from violation of the ""instrument strength independent of direct effect"" assumption. Although methods have been proposed that can account for this bias, a number of restrictive conditions remain in many commonly used techniques. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian framework for Mendelian randomization that provides valid causal inference under very general settings. We propose the methods MR-Horse and MVMR-Horse, which can be performed without access to individual-level data, using only summary statistics of the type commonly published by genome-wide association studies, and can account for both correlated and uncorrelated pleiotropy. In simulation studies, we show that the approach retains type I error rates below nominal levels even in high-pleiotropy scenarios. We demonstrate the proposed approaches in applied examples in both univariable and multivariable settings, some with very weak instruments.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

Given its pleiotropic function, studies of DNAme dynamics are crucial, but currently available tools to interfere with DNAme have limitations and major cytotoxic side effects. Here, we present cell models that allow inducible and reversible DNAme modulation through DNMT1 depletion. By dynamically assessing whole genome and locus-specific effects of induced passive demethylation through cell divisions, we reveal a cooperative activity between DNMT1 and DNMT3B, but not of DNMT3A, to maintain and control DNAme. We show that gradual loss of DNAme is accompanied by progressive and reversible changes in heterochromatin, compartmentalization, and peripheral localization. DNA methylation loss coincides with a gradual reduction of cell fitness due to G1 arrest, with minor levels of mitotic failure. Altogether, this system allows DNMTs and DNA methylation studies with fine temporal resolution, which may help to reveal the etiologic link between DNAme dysfunction and human disease.© 2024 Scelfo et al.",3.46699541472308e-24

Here, we perform longitudinal profiling of 6385 plasma proteins in 318 hospitalised patients to investigate the biological processes involved in critical COVID-19, and assess the effects of imatinib treatment. Nine proteins measured at hospital admission accurately predict critical illness development. Next to dysregulation of inflammation, critical illness is characterised by pathways involving cellular adhesion, extracellular matrix turnover and tissue remodelling. Imatinib treatment attenuates protein perturbations associated with inflammation and extracellular matrix turnover. These proteomic alterations are contextualised using external pulmonary RNA-sequencing data of deceased COVID-19 patients and imatinib-treated Syrian hamsters. Together, we show that alveolar capillary barrier disruption in critical COVID-19 is reflected in the plasma proteome, and is attenuated with imatinib treatment. This study comprises a secondary analysis of both clinical data and plasma samples derived from a clinical trial that was registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2020-001236-10, https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-001236-10/NL ) and Netherlands Trial Register (NL8491, https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/8491 ).© 2024.

Existing approaches either require information on SNP level, do not infer clusters of traits sharing genetic characteristic, or do not have any immediate predictive properties.Here, we present geneJAM, which is a novel clustering and estimation method using PGSs for inferring a genetic relationship among multiple, simultaneously measured and potentially correlated traits in a multivariate GWAS.Using graphical lasso, we estimate a sparse covariance matrix of the PGSs and obtain clusters of traits sharing genetic characteristics. We use the clusters to specify the structure of the error covariance matrix of a generalized least squares (GLS) model and use the feasible GLS estimator for estimating a linear regression model with a certain unknown degree of correlation between the residuals.The method suits many biology studies well with traits embedded in some genetic functioning groups and facilitates development of the PGS research. We compare the method with fully parametric techniques on simulated data and illustrate the utility of the methods by examining a heterogeneous stock mouse data set from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics. We demonstrate that the method successfully identifies clusters of traits and increases precision, power, and computational efficiency.GeneJAM is implemented in R and available at: https://github.com/abuchardt/geneJAM.© The Author(s) 2024.

In response to this need, global scientific research is focusing on developing predictive models based on non-invasive screening tests. A tentative solution to the problem may be a cancer screening blood-based test able to discover those cell requirements triggering subclinical and clinical onset latency, at the stage when the cell disorder, i.e. atypical epithelial hyperplasia, is still in a subclinical stage of proliferative dysregulation.a well-established procedure to identify proliferating circulating tumor cells was deployed to measure the cell proliferation of circulating non-haematological cells which may suggest tumor pathology. Moreover, the data collected were processed by a supervised machine learning model to make the prediction.the developed test combining circulating non-haematological cell proliferation data and artificial intelligence shows 98.8% of accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 95% specificity.this proof of concept study demonstrates that integration of innovative non invasive methods and predictive-models can be decisive in assessing the health status of an individual, and achieve cutting-edge results in cancer prevention and management.© 2024.

However, the extent that STRs contribute to disease is likely under-estimated because of the challenges calling these variants in short read next generation sequencing data. Several computational tools have been developed for STR variant calling, but none fully address all of the complexities associated with this variant class.Here we introduce LUSTR which is designed to address some of the challenges associated with STR variant calling by enabling more flexibility in defining STR loci, allowing for customizable modules to tailor analyses, and expanding the capability to call somatic and multiallelic STR variants. LUSTR is a user-friendly and easily customizable tool for targeted or unbiased genome-wide STR variant screening that can use either predefined or novel genome builds. Using both simulated and real data sets, we demonstrated that LUSTR accurately infers germline and somatic STR expansions in individuals with and without diseases.LUSTR offers a powerful and user-friendly approach that allows for the identification of STR variants and can facilitate more comprehensive studies evaluating the role of pathogenic STR variants across human diseases.© 2024.

In mammals, following the passage of the replisome, nucleosomes lose their defined positioning and transcription contributes to their re-organisation. However, whether transcription plays a greater role in the organization of chromatin following DNA replication remains unclear. Here we analysed protein re-association with newly replicated DNA upon inhibition of transcription using iPOND coupled to quantitative mass spectrometry. We show that nucleosome assembly and the re-establishment of most histone modifications are uncoupled from transcription. However, RNAPII acts to promote the re-association of hundreds of proteins with newly replicated chromatin via pathways that are not observed in steady-state chromatin. These include ATP-dependent remodellers, transcription factors and histone methyltransferases. We also identify a set of DNA repair factors that may handle transcription-replication conflicts during normal transcription in human non-transformed cells. Our study reveals that transcription plays a greater role in the organization of chromatin post-replication than previously anticipated.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.33736560972559e-24

Transcription factor profile-based clustering analysis defines 80 cell types distinct from conventional phenotypic cell types and identifies three general phenotypic modalities related to these classifications. First, transcription factors are broadly downregulated in quiescent stage Hermaphrodite Specific Neurons, suggesting stage- and cell type-specific variation in transcriptome size. Second, transcription factor expression is more closely associated with morphology than other phenotypic modalities in different pre- and post-differentiation developmental stages. Finally, embryonic cell lineages can be associated with specific transcription factor expression patterns and functions that persist throughout postembryonic life.

Worldwide, the past several decades have witnessed changes in the incidence and mortality of breast cancer. Additionally, epidemiological data reveal distinct geographic and demographic disparities globally. A range of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors are established as being associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. This review discusses genetic, hormonal, behavioral, environmental, and breast-related risk factors. Screening plays a critical role in the effective management of breast cancer. Various screening modalities, including mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and physical examination, have different applications, and a combination of these modalities is applied in practice. Current screening recommendations are based on factors including age and risk, with a significant emphasis on minimizing potential harms to achieve an optimal benefits-to-harms ratio. This review provides a comprehensive insight into the epidemiology, risk factors, and screening of breast cancer. Understanding these elements is crucial for improving breast cancer management and reducing its burden on affected individuals and healthcare systems.Copyright ©2023 Chinese Journal of Cancer Research.

However, it is unclear whether this spatial variation, called zonation, is governed by a well-defined gene regulatory code. Here, using a combination of single-cell multiomics, spatial omics, massively parallel reporter assays and deep learning, we mapped enhancer-gene regulatory networks across mouse liver cell types. We found that zonation affects gene expression and chromatin accessibility in hepatocytes, among other cell types. These states are driven by the repressors TCF7L1 and TBX3, alongside other core hepatocyte transcription factors, such as HNF4A, CEBPA, FOXA1 and ONECUT1. To examine the architecture of the enhancers driving these cell states, we trained a hierarchical deep learning model called DeepLiver. Our study provides a multimodal understanding of the regulatory code underlying hepatocyte identity and their zonation state that can be used to engineer enhancers with specific activity levels and zonation patterns.© 2024.

The Tiwi population has been isolated from mainland Australia for millennia and exhibits unique genetic characteristics that distinguish them from other Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. Notably, the rate of end-stage renal disease is up to 20 times greater in this population compared to non-Indigenous populations. Despite the identification of numerous genetic loci associated with kidney disease through GWAS, the Indigenous population such as Tiwi remains severely underrepresented and the increased prevalence of CKD in this population may be due to unique disease-causing alleles/genes.We used albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to estimate the prevalence of kidney disease in the Tiwi population (N = 492) in comparison to the UK Biobank (UKBB) (N = 134,724) database. We then performed an exploratory factor analysis to identify correlations among 10 CKD-related phenotypes and identify new multi-phenotype factors. We subsequently conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on all single and multiple phenotype factors using mixed linear regression models, adjusted for age, sex, population stratification, and genetic relatedness between individuals.Based on ACR, 20.3% of the population was at severely increased risk of CKD progression and showed elevated levels of ACR compared to the UKBB population independent of HbA1c. A GWAS of ACR revealed novel association loci in the genes MEG3 (chr14:100812018:T:A), RAB36 (rs11704318), and TIAM2 (rs9689640). Additionally, multiple phenotypes GWAS of ACR, eGFR, urine albumin, and serum creatinine identified a novel variant that mapped to the gene MEIS2 (chr15:37218869:A:G). Most of the identified variants were found to be either absent or rare in the UKBB population.Our study highlights the Tiwi population's predisposition towards elevated ACR, and the collection of novel genetic variants associated with kidney function. These associations may prove valuable in the early diagnosis and treatment of renal disease in this underrepresented population. Additionally, further research is needed to comprehensively validate the functions of the identified variants/genes.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.3100964880158e-24

Hundreds to thousands of copies of mtDNA exist in each cell, yet because mitochondria lack histones or other machinery important for nuclear genome compaction, it remains unresolved how mtDNA is packaged into individual nucleoids. In this study, we used long-read single-molecule accessibility mapping to measure the compaction of individual full-length mtDNA molecules at near single-nucleotide resolution. We found that, unlike the nuclear genome, human mtDNA largely undergoes all-or-none global compaction, with most nucleoids existing in an inaccessible, inactive state. Highly accessible mitochondrial nucleoids are co-occupied by transcription and replication components and selectively form a triple-stranded displacement loop structure. In addition, we showed that the primary nucleoid-associated protein TFAM directly modulates the fraction of inaccessible nucleoids both in vivo and in vitro, acting consistently with a nucleation-and-spreading mechanism to coat and compact mitochondrial nucleoids. Together, these findings reveal the primary architecture of mtDNA packaging and regulation in human cells.© 2024.

However, the multi-omics landscape of synovium required for functional inference is absent from large-scale resources. Here we integrate genomics with transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility features of human synovium in up to 245 arthritic patients, to characterize the landscape of genetic regulation on gene expression and the regulatory mechanisms mediating arthritic diseases predisposition. We identify 4765 independent primary and 616 secondary cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) in the synovium and find that the eQTLs with multiple independent signals have stronger effects and heritability than single independent eQTLs. Integration of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and eQTLs identifies 84 arthritis related genes, revealing 38 novel genes which have not been reported by previous studies using eQTL data from the GTEx project or immune cells. We further develop a method called eQTac to identify variants that could affect gene expression by affecting chromatin accessibility and identify 1517 regions with potential regulatory function of chromatin accessibility.

However, the associated molecular underpinnings remain unclear. Herein, we estimated the association between rare genetic variations in 410 vitamin A (VA)-related genes (VARGs) and ASD aetiology using publicly availablede novomutations (DNMs), rare inherited variants, and copy number variations (CNVs) from about 50,000 ASD probands and 20,000 normal controls (discovery and validation cohorts). Additionally, given the functional relevance of VA and oxytocin, we systematically compared the similarities and differences between VA and oxytocin with respect to ASD aetiology and evaluated their potential for clinical applications. Functional DNMs and pathogenic CNVs in VARGs contributed to ASD pathogenesis in the discovery and validation cohorts. Additionally, 324 potential VA-related biomarkers were identified, 243 of which were shared with previously identified oxytocin-related biomarkers, while 81 were unique VA biomarkers. Moreover, multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that both VA- and oxytocin-related biomarkers were able to predict ASD aetiology for individuals carrying functional DNM in corresponding biomarkers with an average precision of 0.94. As well as, convergent and divergent functions were also identified between VA- and oxytocin-related biomarkers.

38348493,"A role for DNA methylation in bumblebee morphogenesis hints at female-specific developmental erasure.","Insect Mol Biol","Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, are crucial factors in animal development. In some mammals, almost all DNA methylation is erased during embryo development and re-established in a sex- and cell-specific manner. This erasure and re-establishment is thought to primarily be a vertebrate-specific trait. Insects are particularly interesting in terms of development as many species often undergo remarkable morphological changes en route to maturity, that is, morphogenesis. However, little is known about the role of epigenetic mechanisms in this process across species. We have used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to track genome-wide DNA methylation changes through the development of an economically and environmentally important pollinator species, the bumblebee Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera:Apidae Linnaeus). We find overall levels of DNA methylation vary throughout development, and we find developmentally relevant differentially methylated genes throughout. Intriguingly, we have identified a depletion of DNA methylation in ovaries/eggs and an enrichment of highly methylated genes in sperm. We suggest this could represent a sex-specific DNA methylation erasure event. To our knowledge, this is the first suggestion of possible developmental DNA methylation erasure in an insect species. This study lays the required groundwork for functional experimental work to determine if there is a causal nature to the DNA methylation differences identified. Additionally, the application of single-cell methylation sequencing to this system will enable more accurate identification of if or when DNA methylation is erased during development.© 2024 The Authors.

Here, the impact of long-term modulation of dietary intake of copper, iron, selenium, and zinc was investigated in murine cerebellum. Four- and 40-wk-old mice of both sexes were supplied with different amounts of those TEs for 26 wk. In an adequate supply group, TE concentrations were in accordance with recommendations for laboratory mice while suboptimally supplied animals received only limited amounts of copper, iron, selenium, and zinc. An additional age-adjusted group was fed selenium and zinc in amounts exceeding recommendations. Cerebellar TE concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma-tandem mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the expression of genes involved in TE transport, DNA damage response, and DNA repair as well as selected markers of genomic stability [8-oxoguanine, incision efficiency toward 8-oxoguanine, 5-hydroxyuracil, and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites and global DNA (hydroxy)methylation] were analysed. Ageing resulted in a mild increase of iron and copper concentrations in the cerebellum, which was most pronounced in the suboptimally supplied groups. Thus, TE changes in the cerebellum were predominantly driven by age and less by nutritional intervention. Interestingly, deviation from adequate TE supply resulted in higher manganese concentrations of female mice even though the manganese supply itself was not modulated. Parameters of genomic stability were neither affected by age, sex, nor diet. Overall, this study revealed that suboptimal dietary TE supply does not substantially affect TE homeostasis in the murine cerebellum.© The Author(s) 2024.

Aphids are a model for studies of the genetics and physiology of stress. Aphids are characterized by parthenogenetic reproduction, which limits the effects of recombination on evolutionary processes, and have shown resistance to various biotic and abiotic stresses. This study was based on the hypothesis that aphids have optimized, over time, genetic mechanisms capable to give them plasticity through genome modifications mediated by transposition. To understand and evaluate the effects of heat stress, the expression levels of transposases and methylases were analyzed in mothers and daughters.

We corroborated our findings by literature text-mining, expert validation, and recapitulation in mouse corresponding tissues. Based on these findings, we explored characteristics of disease-affected cell types, showed that diseases manifesting in multiple tissues tend to affect similar cell types, and highlighted cases where gene functions could be used to refine inference.

Under cellular stress conditions, the transcription machinery fails to identify the termination site and continues transcribing beyond gene boundaries, a phenomenon designated as transcription readthrough. However, the prevalence and impact of this phenomenon in healthy human tissues remain unexplored. Here, we assessed transcription readthrough in almost 3000 transcriptome profiles representing 23 human tissues and found that 34% of the expressed protein-coding genes produced readthrough transcripts. The production of readthrough transcripts was restricted in genomic regions with high transcriptional activity and was associated with inefficient splicing and increased chromatin accessibility in terminal regions. In addition, we showed that these transcripts contained several binding sites for the same miRNA, unravelling a potential role as miRNA sponges. Overall, this work provides evidence that transcription readthrough is pervasive and non-stochastic, not only in abnormal conditions but also in healthy tissues.

Expanding knowledge of causes, management, and awareness of hypertension and its co-morbidities worldwide is an effective strategy to mitigate its harms, decrease morbidities and mortality, and improve individual quality of life. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) are a particularly important subset of hypertension, as pregnancy is a major stress test of the cardiovascular system and can be the first instance in which cardiovascular disease is clinically apparent. In SSA, women experience a higher incidence of HDP compared with other African regions. However, the region has yet to adopt treatment and preventative strategies for HDP. This delay stems from insufficient awareness, lack of clinical screening for hypertension, and lack of prevention programs. In this brief literature review, we will address the long-term consequences of hypertension and HDP in women. We evaluate the effects of uncontrolled hypertension in SSA by including research on heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, peripheral arterial disease, and HDP. Limitations exist in the number of studies from SSA; therefore, we will use data from countries across the globe, comparing and contrasting approaches in similar and dissimilar populations. Our review highlights an urgent need to prioritize public health, clinical, and bench research to discover cost-effective preventative and treatment strategies that will improve the lives of women living with hypertension in SSA.",2.05297254314511e-25
38182651,"Antagonistic interactions safeguard mitotic propagation of genetic and epigenetic information in zebrafish.","Commun Biol","The stability of cellular phenotypes in developing organisms depends on error-free transmission of epigenetic and genetic information during mitosis. Methylation of cytosine residues in genomic DNA is a key epigenetic mark that modulates gene expression and prevents genome instability. Here, we report on a genetic test of the relationship between DNA replication and methylation in the context of the developing vertebrate organism instead of cell lines. Our analysis is based on the identification of hypomorphic alleles of dnmt1, encoding the DNA maintenance methylase Dnmt1, and pole1, encoding the catalytic subunit of leading-strand DNA polymerase epsilon holoenzyme (Pole). Homozygous dnmt1 mutants exhibit genome-wide DNA hypomethylation, whereas the pole1 mutation is associated with increased DNA methylation levels. In dnmt1/pole1 double-mutant zebrafish larvae, DNA methylation levels are restored to near normal values, associated with partial rescue of mutant-associated transcriptional changes and phenotypes. Hence, a balancing antagonism between DNA replication and maintenance methylation buffers against replicative errors contributing to the robustness of vertebrate development.© 2024.

38293137,"A genome-wide investigation into the underlying genetic architecture of personality traits and overlap with psychopathology.","medRxiv","Personality is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors and is associated with other psychiatric traits such as anxiety and depression. The ""Big Five"" personality traits, which include neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness, are a widely accepted and influential framework for understanding and describing human personality. Of the big five personality traits, neuroticism has most often been the focus of genetic studies and is linked to various mental illnesses including depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia. Our knowledge of the genetic architecture of the other four personality traits is more limited. Utilizing the Million Veteran Program (MVP) cohort we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in individuals of European and African ancestry. Adding other published data, we performed GWAS meta-analysis for each of the five personality traits with sample sizes ranging from 237,390 to 682,688. We identified 158, 14, 3, 2, and 7 independent genome-wide significant (GWS) loci associated with neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness, respectively. These findings represent 55 novel loci for neuroticism, as well as the first GWS loci discovered for extraversion and agreeableness. Gene-based association testing revealed 254 genes showing significant association with at least one of the five personality traits. Transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide analysis identified altered expression of genes and proteins such asCRHR1, SLC12A5, MAPT, andSTX4. Pathway enrichment and drug perturbation analyses identified complex biology underlying human personality traits. We also studied the inter-relationship of personality traits with 1,437 other traits in a phenome-wide genetic correlation analysis, identifying new associations. Mendelian randomization showed positive bidirectional effects between neuroticism and depression and anxiety while a negative bidirectional effect was observed for agreeableness and these psychiatric traits. This study improves our comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture underlying personality traits and their relationship to other complex human traits.",1.5724878782299e-25

This contribution will give a historical overview of these two research eras, taking advantage of the archives conserved at Institut Pasteur. The first era mainly focused on the production, characterisation, surveillance and improvement of veterinary anthrax vaccines; the concepts and technologies with which to reach a deep understanding of this research field were not yet available. The second period saw a new era ofB. anthracisresearch at Institut Pasteur, with the anthrax laboratory developing a multi-disciplinary approach, ranging from structural analysis, biochemistry, genetic expression, and regulation to bacterial-host cell interactions,in vivopathogenicity, and therapy development; this led to the comprehensive unravelling of many facets of this toxi-infection.B. anthracismay exemplify some general points on how science is performed in a given society at a given time and how a scientific research domain evolves. A striking illustration can be seen in the additive layers of regulations that were implemented from the beginning of the 21st century and their impact onB. anthracisresearch.B. anthracisand anthrax are complex systems that raise many valuable questions regarding basic research.

However, the immune effects of vitamin D in people with MS are not well understood. We analyzed transcriptomic datasets generated by RNA sequencing of immune cell subsets (CD4+, CD8+T cells, B cells, monocytes) from 33 healthy controls and 33 untreated MS cases. We utilized a traditional bioinformatic pipeline and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to determine genes and pathways correlated with endogenous vitamin D. In controls, CD4+and CD8+T cells had 1079 and 1188 genes, respectively, whose expressions were correlated with plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (P < 0.05). Functional enrichment analysis identified association with TNF-alpha and MAPK signaling. In CD4+T cells of controls, vitamin D level was associated with expression levels of several genes proximal to multiple sclerosis risk loci (P = 0.01). Genes differentially associated with endogenous vitamin D by case-control status were enriched in TNF-alpha signaling via NF-κB. WGCNA suggested a blunted response to vitamin D in cases relative to controls. Collectively, our findings provide further evidence for the immune effects of vitamin D, and demonstrate a differential immune response to vitamin D in cases relative to controls, highlighting a possible mechanism contributing to MS pathophysiology.© 2024.

However, whether there is a clear causal connection between the two is unknown.Our primary analytical method was the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) approach, complemented by the Mendelian randomisation-Egger (MR-Egger) and weighted median methods. We also used MR-Egger to examine the presence of pleiotropy and the Mendelian randomisation pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) approach to analyse for heterogeneity in the data.We did not observe a direct causal relationship between COVID-19 susceptibility (odds ratio (OR) = 1.023; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.828-1.264, standard error (SE) = 0.108, P = 0.833), hospitalisation (OR = 1.030; 95% CI = 0.943-1.125, SE = 0.374, P = 0.720), severity (OR = 0.994; 95% CI = 0.923-1.071, SE = 0.038, P = 0.877), and DVT. The results of the reverse Mendelian randomisation (MR) for DVT and COVID-19 susceptibility exhibited heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. Even after removing outliers, we detected no direct causal relationship between the two (OR = 1.015; 95% CI = 0.954-1.080, SE = 0.032, P = 0.630). Similarly, we found no direct causal relationship between DVT and COVID-19 hospitalisation (OR = 0.999; 95% CI = 0.907-1.102, SE = 0.050, P = 0.999) or severity (OR = 1.014; 95% CI = 0.893-1.153, SE = 0.065, P = 0.826).In this MR study, we identified no direct causal impact in a European population between DVT and the COVID-19 susceptibility, severity, or hospitalisation.Copyright © 2024 by the Journal of Global Health.

Epigenetic changes with their dynamic nature can either be inherited or accumulated throughout a lifetime and be reversible, prompting investigation of their use across various fields. In forensic sciences, multiple applications have been proposed, such as the discrimination of monozygotic twins, identifying the source of a biological trace left at a crime scene, age prediction, determination of body fluids and tissues, human behavior association, wound healing progression, and determination of the post-mortem interval (PMI). Despite all these applications, not all the studies considered the impact of PMI and post-sampling effects on the epigenetic modifications and the tissue-specificity of the epigenetic marks.This review aims to highlight the substantial forensic significance that epigenetics could support in various forensic investigations. First, basic concepts in epigenetics, describing the main epigenetic modifications and their functions, in particular, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA, with a particular focus on forensic applications, were covered. For each epigenetic marker, post-mortem stability and tissue-specificity, factors that should be carefully considered in the study of epigenetic biomarkers in the forensic context, have been discussed. The advantages and limitations of using post-mortem tissues have been also addressed, proposing directions for these innovative strategies to analyze forensic specimens.© 2024.

Over 1 million variable STR loci are known, some of which regulate gene expression and influence complex traits, such as height. Moreover, variants in at least 60 STR loci cause genetic disorders, including Huntington disease and fragile X syndrome. Accurately identifying and genotyping STR variants is challenging, in particular mapping short reads to repetitive regions and inferring expanded repeat lengths. Recent advances in sequencing technology and computational tools for STR genotyping from sequencing data promise to help overcome this challenge and solve genetically unresolved cases and the 'missing heritability' of polygenic traits. Here, we compare STR genotyping methods, analytical tools and their applications to understand the effect of STR variation on health and disease. We identify emergent opportunities to refine genotyping and quality-control approaches as well as to integrate STRs into variant-calling workflows and large cohort analyses.© 2024.

Cellular glycans play a variety of roles in the processes of metastasis and may be unique to the cells that metastasize to different organs. We analyzed the glycosylation profiles of the primary tumor and tumors metastasized to lymph node, liver, lung, brain, bone, thyroid, kidney, adrenal, small intestine and pancreas in an autopsy case of breast cancer employing a lectin microarray with 45 lectins. Clustering analysis of the data revealed that metastatic breast cancer cells were categorized into several clusters according to their glycosylation profiles. Our results provide a biological basis to understand differential phenotypes of metastatic breast cancer cells potentially reflecting clonal origin, which does not directly reflect genomic or genetic changes or microenvironmental effects but connects to glycosylation profiles.© 2023.

Accurate risk assessment of CH is critical for disease prevention and clinical decision-making. The size of CH has been showed to associate with higher disease risk, yet, factors influencing the size of CH are unknown. In addition, the characteristics of CH in long-lived individuals are not well documented. Here, we report an in-depth analysis of CH in longevous (≥90 y old) and common (60~89 y old) elderly groups. Utilizing targeted deep sequencing, we found that the development of CH is closely related to age and the expression of aging biomarkers. The longevous elderly group exhibited a significantly higher incidence of CH and significantly higher frequency ofTET2andASXL1mutations, suggesting that certain CH could be beneficial to prolong life. Intriguingly, the size of CH neither correlates significantly to age, in the range of 60 to 110 y old, nor to the expression of aging biomarkers. Instead, we identified a strong correlation between large CH size and the number of mutations per individual. These findings provide a risk assessment biomarker for CH and also suggest that the evolution of the CH is influenced by factor(s) in addition to age.",9.41560287210364e-26

38306997,"Cell-type deconvolution of bulk-blood RNA-seq reveals biological insights into neuropsychiatric disorders.","Am J Hum Genet","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have uncovered susceptibility loci associated with psychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder (BP) and schizophrenia (SCZ). However, most of these loci are in non-coding regions of the genome, and the causal mechanisms of the link between genetic variation and disease risk is unknown. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis of bulk tissue is a common approach used for deciphering underlying mechanisms, although this can obscure cell-type-specific signals and thus mask trait-relevant mechanisms. Although single-cell sequencing can be prohibitively expensive in large cohorts, computationally inferred cell-type proportions and cell-type gene expression estimates have the potential to overcome these problems and advance mechanistic studies. Using bulk RNA-seq from 1,730 samples derived from whole blood in a cohort ascertained from individuals with BP and SCZ, this study estimated cell-type proportions and their relation with disease status and medication. For each cell type, we found between 2,875 and 4,629 eGenes (genes with an associated eQTL), including 1,211 that are not found on the basis of bulk expression alone. We performed a colocalization test between cell-type eQTLs and various traits and identified hundreds of associations that occur between cell-type eQTLs and GWASs but that are not detected in bulk eQTLs. Finally, we investigated the effects of lithium use on the regulation of cell-type expression loci and found examples of genes that are differentially regulated according to lithium use. Our study suggests that applying computational methods to large bulk RNA-seq datasets of non-brain tissue can identify disease-relevant, cell-type-specific biology of psychiatric disorders and psychiatric medication.Published by Elsevier Inc.",6.82087661757852e-26
38218905,"DiffDomain enables identification of structurally reorganized topologically associating domains.","Nat Commun","Topologically associating domains (TADs) are critical structural units in three-dimensional genome organization of mammalian genome. Dynamic reorganizations of TADs between health and disease states are associated with essential genome functions. However, computational methods for identifying reorganized TADs are still in the early stages of development. Here, we present DiffDomain, an algorithm leveraging high-dimensional random matrix theory to identify structurally reorganized TADs using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) contact maps. Method comparison using multiple real Hi-C datasets reveals that DiffDomain outperforms alternative methods for false positive rates, true positive rates, and identifying a new subtype of reorganized TADs. Applying DiffDomain to Hi-C data from different cell types and disease states demonstrates its biological relevance. Identified reorganized TADs are associated with structural variations and epigenomic changes such as changes in CTCF binding sites. By applying to a single-cell Hi-C data from mouse neuronal development, DiffDomain can identify reorganized TADs between cell types with reasonable reproducibility using pseudo-bulk Hi-C data from as few as 100 cells per condition. Moreover, DiffDomain reveals differential cell-to-population variability and heterogeneous cell-to-cell variability in TADs. Therefore, DiffDomain is a statistically sound method for better comparative analysis of TADs using both Hi-C and single-cell Hi-C data.© 2024. The Author(s).",6.48734407185971e-26

To achieve a robust diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, a genotype-phenotype integrated diagnostic approach was introduced in recent versions of the World Health Organization classification, followed by the incorporation of a genome-wide DNA methylome-based classification. Microarray-based platforms are widely used to obtain DNA methylome data, and the German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum [DKFZ]) has a webtool for a DNA methylation-based classifier (DKFZ classifier). Integration of DNA methylome will further enhance the precision of CNS tumor classification, especially in diagnostically challenging cases. However, in the clinical application of DNA methylome-based classification, challenges related to data interpretation persist, in addition to technical caveats, regulations, and limited accessibility. Dimensionality reduction (DMR) can complement integrated diagnosis by visualizing a profile and comparing it with other known samples. Therefore, DNA methylome-based classification is a highly useful research tool for auxiliary analysis in challenging diagnostic and rare disease cases, and for establishing novel tumor concepts. Decoding the DNA methylome, especially by DMR in addition to DKFZ classifier, emphasizes the capability of grasping the fundamental biological principles that provide new perspectives on CNS tumors.© 2024 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",6.33073464831e-26

However, as assemblies are updated and improved, researchers are faced with either realigning raw sequence data using the updated coordinate system or converting legacy datasets to the updated coordinate system to be able to combine results with newer datasets. Currently available tools to perform the conversion of genetic variants have numerous shortcomings, including poor support for indels and multi-allelic variants, that lead to a higher rate of variants being dropped or incorrectly converted. As a result, many researchers continue to work with and publish using legacy genomic coordinates.Here we present BCFtools/liftover, a tool to convert genomic coordinates across genome assemblies for variants encoded in the variant call format with improved support for indels represented by different reference alleles across genome assemblies and full support for multi-allelic variants. It further supports variant annotation fields updates whenever the reference allele changes across genome assemblies. The tool has the lowest rate of variants being dropped with an order of magnitude less indels dropped or incorrectly converted and is an order of magnitude faster than other tools typically used for the same task. It is particularly suited for converting variant callsets from large cohorts to novel telomere-to-telomere assemblies as well as summary statistics from genome-wide association studies tied to legacy genome assemblies.The tool is written in C and freely available under the MIT open source license as a BCFtools plugin available at http://github.com/freeseek/score.© The Author(s) 2024.

The protein-protein interaction network ('interactome') plays a crucial role in PD and SZ and can incorporate their spatiotemporal specificities. Therefore, to study the linked biology of PD and SZ, we compiled PD- and SZ-associated genes from the DisGeNET database, and constructed their interactomes using BioGRID and HPRD. We examined the interactomes using clustering and enrichment analyses, in conjunction with the transcriptomic data of 26 brain regions spanning foetal stages to adulthood available in the BrainSpan Atlas. PD and SZ interactomes formed four gene clusters with distinct temporal identities (Disease Gene Networks or 'DGNs'1-4). DGN1 had unique SZ interactome genes highly expressed across developmental stages, corresponding to a neurodevelopmental SZ subtype. DGN2, containing unique SZ interactome genes expressed from early infancy to adulthood, correlated with an inflammation-driven SZ subtype and adult SZ risk. DGN3 contained unique PD interactome genes expressed in late infancy, early and late childhood, and adulthood, and involved in mitochondrial pathways. DGN4, containing prenatally-expressed genes common to both the interactomes, involved in stem cell pluripotency and overlapping with the interactome of 22q11 deletion syndrome (comorbid psychosis and Parkinsonism), potentially regulates neurodevelopmental mechanisms in PD-SZ comorbidity. Our findings suggest that disrupted neurodevelopment (regulated by DGN4) could expose risk windows in PD and SZ, later elevating disease risk through inflammation (DGN2). Alternatively, variant clustering in DGNs may produce disease subtypes, e.g., PD-SZ comorbidity with DGN4, and early/late-onset SZ with DGN1/DGN2.© 2024. The Author(s).",5.20895507208569e-26

Metabolic dysfunction often represents a cluster of conditions, including dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and diabetes, that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the causal relationship between lipid profiles and blood pressure (BP) remains unclear. We performed a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study to disentangle and prioritize the potential causal effects of major lipids, lipoprotein particles, and circulating metabolites on BP and pulse pressure (PP).We employed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with major lipids, lipoprotein particles, and other metabolites from the UK Biobank as instrumental variables. Summary-level data for BP and PP were obtained from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. Two-sample MR and MR Bayesian model averaging approaches (MR-BMA) were conducted to analyse and rank causal associations.Genetically predicted TG was the most likely causal exposure among the major lipids to increase systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), with marginal inclusion probabilities (MIPs) of 0.993 and 0.847, respectively. Among the majority of lipoproteins and their containing lipids, including major lipids, genetically elevated TG in small high-density lipoproteins (S_HDL_TG) had the strongest association with the increase of SBP and DBP, with MIPs of 0.416 and 0.397, respectively. HDL cholesterol (HDL_C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL_C) were potential causal factors for PP elevation among the major lipids (MIP = 0.927 for HDL_C and MIP = 0.718 for LDL_C). Within the sub-lipoproteins, genetically predicted atherogenic lipoprotein particles (i.e., sub-very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and LDL particles) had the most likely causal impact on increasing PP.This study provides genetic evidence for the causality of lipids on BP indicators. However, the effect size on SBP, DBP, and PP varies depending on the lipids' components and sizes.

Next, we validated our results using gene expression data of mice irradiated with simulated GCR and JAXA astronauts. We showed that primarily56Fe induces a persistent DNA methylation increase whereas28Si and X-ray induce a decrease DNA methylation which is not persistent with time. Moreover, we highlighted the role of nuclear chromatin architecture in cell response to external radiation.

All data pertaining to exposure and outcome factors were acquired from publicly accessible genome-wide association studies. The methods used encompassed inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode residual sum and outlier techniques. The MR-Egger intercept test was utilized to assess pleiotropy, while Cochran's Q statistic was employed to measure heterogeneity.We employed inverse variance weighting MR as the primary statistical method to assess the causal relationship between exposure factors and ED.Genetically predicted PCa demonstrated a causal association with an elevated risk of ED (odds ratio, 1.125; 95% confidence interval, 1.066-1.186;P <.0001). However, no compelling evidence was found to support associations between genetically determined benign prostatic hyperplasia, CKD, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, nephrotic syndrome, kidney ureter calculi, and the renal function parameters investigated, and the risk of ED.The risk of ED is considerably amplified in patients diagnosed with PCa, thereby highlighting the importance of addressing ED as a significant concern for clinicians treating individuals with PCa.This study's strength lies in validating the PCa-ED association using genetic analysis, while its limitation is the heterogeneity in study results.The results of this study suggest a potential link between PCa and a higher risk of ED.© International Society for Sexual Medicine 2024.",3.37631126032987e-26

Detecting selection acting on these elements is critical to understanding evolution but remains challenging because we do not know which mutations will affect gene regulation.To address this, we devise an approach to search for lineage-specific selection on three critical steps in transcriptional regulation: chromatin activity, transcription factor binding, and chromosomal looping. Applying this approach to lymphoblastoid cells from 831 individuals of either European or African descent, we find strong signals of differential chromatin activity linked to gene expression differences between ancestries in numerous contexts, but no evidence of functional differences in chromosomal looping. Moreover, we show that enhancers rather than promoters display the strongest signs of selection associated with sites of differential transcription factor binding.Overall, our study indicates that some cis-regulatory adaptation may be more easily detected at the level of chromatin than DNA sequence. This work provides a vast resource of genomic interaction data from diverse human populations and establishes a novel selection test that will benefit future study of regulatory evolution in humans and other species.© 2024.

However, the impact of rare coding variants on depression remains poorly understood. Here, we present whole-exome sequencing analyses of depression with seven different definitions based on survey, questionnaire, and electronic health records in 320,356 UK Biobank participants. We showed that the burden of rare damaging coding variants in loss-of-function intolerant genes is significantly associated with risk of depression with various definitions. We compared the rare and common genetic architecture across depression definitions by genetic correlation and showed different genetic relationships between definitions across common and rare variants. In addition, we demonstrated that the effects of rare damaging coding variant burden and polygenic risk score on depression risk are additive. The gene set burden analyses revealed overlapping rare genetic variant components with developmental disorder, autism, and schizophrenia. Our study provides insights into the contribution of rare coding variants, separately and in conjunction with common variants, on depression with various definitions and their genetic relationships with neurodevelopmental disorders.© 2024.

Using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) and H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing data, we identified 73 regulatory elements in microglia that overlap PD risk SNPs. To determine the target genes of a ""risk enhancer"" within intron two ofSNCA, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to delete the open chromatin region where two PD risk SNPs reside. The loss of the enhancer led to reduced expression of multiple genes includingSNCAand the adjacent geneMMRN1. It also led to expression changes of genes involved in glucose metabolism, a process that is known to be altered in PD patients. Our work expands the role ofSNCAin PD and provides a connection between PD-associated genetic variants and underlying biology that points to a risk mechanism in microglia.© 2024 The Authors.",2.85538289998167e-26

Here we describe a striking relationship between people's cortical neurons and cortical astrocytes. We used single-nucleus RNA-seq to analyze the prefrontal cortex of 191 human donors ages 22-97 years, including healthy individuals and persons with schizophrenia. Latent-factor analysis of these data revealed that in persons whose cortical neurons more strongly expressed genes for synaptic components, cortical astrocytes more strongly expressed distinct genes with synaptic functions and genes for synthesizing cholesterol, an astrocyte-supplied component of synaptic membranes. We call this relationship the Synaptic Neuron-and-Astrocyte Program (SNAP). In schizophrenia and aging - two conditions that involve declines in cognitive flexibility and plasticity1,2- cells had divested from SNAP: astrocytes, glutamatergic (excitatory) neurons, and GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons all reduced SNAP expression to corresponding degrees. The distinct astrocytic and neuronal components of SNAP both involved genes in which genetic risk factors for schizophrenia were strongly concentrated. SNAP, which varies quantitatively even among healthy persons of similar age, may underlie many aspects of normal human interindividual differences and be an important point of convergence for multiple kinds of pathophysiology.",2.57956389334792e-26
38307968,"Early Life Stress and Major Depressive Disorder-An Update on Molecular Mechanisms and Synaptic Impairments.","Mol Neurobiol","Early life stress (ELS), characterized as abuse, neglect, and abandonment, can cause several adverse consequences in the lives of affected individuals. ELS experiences can affect an individual's development in variable ways, persisting in the long term and promoting lasting impacts, considering that early exposure to stressors can be biologically incorporated, as prolonged stimulation of stress response systems affects the development of the brain structure and other body systems, increasing the risk of diseases associated with stress and cognitive impairment. This type of stress increases the risk of developing major depressive disorder (MDD) in a severe form that does not respond adequately to traditional antidepressant treatments. Several alterations are studied as mechanisms that relate ELS with MDD, such as epigenetic alterations, neurotransmitters, and neuronal signaling. This review discusses research that brings evidence about the ELS mechanisms involved in synaptic impairments and MDD. The processes involved in epigenetic changes and the HPA axis are highlighted, as well as changes in neurotransmitters and neuronal signaling mechanisms.© 2024.

In addition to the high mortality rate, people suffering from CVD often endure difficulties with physical activities and productivity that significantly affect their quality of life. The high prevalence of debilitating risk factors such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia only predicts a bleak future. Current traditional CVD interventions offer temporary respite; however, they compound the severe economic strain of health-related expenditures. Furthermore, these therapeutics can be prescribed indefinitely. Recent advances in the field of epigenetics have generated new treatment options by confronting CVD at an epigenetic level. This involves modulating gene expression by altering the organization of our genome rather than altering the DNA sequence itself. Epigenetic changes are heritable, reversible, and influenced by environmental factors such as medications. As CVD is physiologically and pathologically diverse in nature, epigenetic interventions can offer a ray of hope to replace or be combined with traditional therapeutics to provide the prospect of addressing more than just the symptoms of CVD. This review discusses various risk factors contributing to CVD, perspectives of current traditional medications in practice, and a focus on potential epigenetic therapeutics to be used as alternatives.",2.15110417705297e-26

However, how cis- and trans-effects act across continuous trajectories of cellular differentiation in vivo is poorly understood. Here, we quantify allele-specific expression during spermatogenic differentiation at single-cell resolution in an F1 hybrid mouse system, allowing for the comprehensive characterisation of cis- and trans-genetic effects, including their dynamics across cellular differentiation. Collectively, almost half of the genes subject to genetic regulation show evidence for dynamic cis-effects that vary during differentiation. Our system also allows us to robustly identify dynamic trans-effects, which are less pervasive than cis-effects. In aggregate, genetic effects were strongest in round spermatids, which parallels their increased transcriptional divergence we identified between species. Our approach provides a comprehensive quantification of the variability of genetic effects in vivo, and demonstrates a widely applicable strategy to dissect the impact of regulatory variants on gene regulation in dynamic systems.© 2024.

Among 9578 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in the SCOURGE study, we found 133 cases (1.42%) with detectable clonal mosaicism for chromosome alterations (mCA) and 226 males (5.08%) with acquired loss of chromosome Y (LOY). Individuals with clonal mosaic events (mCA and/or LOY) showed a 54% increase in the risk of COVID-19 lethality. LOY is associated with transcriptomic biomarkers of immune dysfunction, pro-coagulation activity and cardiovascular risk. Interferon-induced genes involved in the initial immune response to SARS-CoV-2 are also down-regulated in LOY. Thus, mCA and LOY underlie at least part of the sex-biased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in aging patients. Given its potential therapeutic and prognostic relevance, evaluation of clonal mosaicism should be implemented as biomarker of COVID-19 severity in elderly people.© 2024.

However, interspecies genomic differences limit the joint analysis of cross-species datasets to homologous genes. Here we present SATURN, a deep learning method for learning universal cell embeddings that encodes genes' biological properties using protein language models. By coupling protein embeddings from language models with RNA expression, SATURN integrates datasets profiled from different species regardless of their genomic similarity. SATURN can detect functionally related genes coexpressed across species, redefining differential expression for cross-species analysis. Applying SATURN to three species whole-organism atlases and frog and zebrafish embryogenesis datasets, we show that SATURN can effectively transfer annotations across species, even when they are evolutionarily remote. We also demonstrate that SATURN can be used to find potentially divergent gene functions between glaucoma-associated genes in humans and four other species.© 2024.

Here we conducted multivariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using hypothalamic imaging data from 32,956 individuals to uncover the genetic underpinnings of the hypothalamus and its involvement in neuropsychiatric traits. There were 23 significant loci associated with the whole hypothalamus and its subunits, with functional enrichment for genes involved in intracellular trafficking systems and metabolic processes of steroid-related compounds. The hypothalamus exhibited substantial genetic associations with limbic system structures and neuropsychiatric traits including chronotype, risky behaviour, cognition, satiety and sympathetic-parasympathetic activity. The strongest signal in the primary GWAS, the ADAMTS8 locus, was replicated in three independent datasets (N = 1,685-4,321) and was strengthened after meta-analysis. Exome-wide association analyses added evidence to the association for ADAMTS8, and Mendelian randomization showed lower ADAMTS8 expression with larger hypothalamic volumes. The current study advances our understanding of complex structure-function relationships of the hypothalamus and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie hypothalamic formation.© 2024.

DNA from 21 HNSCC and 10 healthy oral tissue samples was hybridized to a genome-wide tiling array to identify DMRs in a discovery cohort. Downstream analyses identified differences in promoter DNA methylation patterns in oral, laryngeal and oropharyngeal anatomical regions associated with tumor differentiation, nodal involvement and survival. Genome-wide DMR analysis showed 2,565 DMRs common to the three subsites. A total of 738 DMRs were unique to laryngeal cancer (n=7), 889 DMRs were unique to oral cavity cancer (n=10) and 363 DMRs were unique to pharyngeal cancer (n=6). Based on the genome-wide analysis and a Gene Ontology analysis, 10 candidate genes were selected to test for prognostic value and association with clinicopathological features.TIMP3was associated with tumor differentiation in oral cavity cancer (P=0.039),DAPK1was associated with nodal involvement in pharyngeal cancer (P=0.017) andPAX1was associated with tumor differentiation in laryngeal cancer (P=0.040).

Although DNA methylation-based classification usually shows high accuracy, certain samples cannot be classified and remain clinically challenging. We aimed to gain insight into these cases from a clinical perspective. To address, central nervous system (CNS) tumors were subjected to DNA methylation profiling and classified according to their calibrated score using the DKFZ brain tumor classifier (V11.4) as ""≥ 0.84"" (score ≥ 0.84), ""0.3-0.84"" (score 0.3-0.84), or ""< 0.3"" (score < 0.3). Histopathology, patient characteristics, DNA input amount, and tumor purity were correlated. Clinical outcome parameters were time to treatment decision, progression-free, and overall survival. In 1481 patients, the classifier identified 69 (4.6%) tumors with an unreliable score as ""< 0.3"". Younger age (P < 0.01) and lower tumor purity (P < 0.01) compromised accurate classification. A clinical impact was demonstrated as unclassifiable cases (""< 0.3"") had a longer time to treatment decision (P < 0.0001). In a subset of glioblastomas, these cases experienced an increased time to adjuvant treatment start (P < 0.001) and unfavorable survival (P < 0.025). Although DNA methylation profiling adds an important contribution to CNS tumor diagnostics, clinicians should be aware of a potentially longer time to treatment initiation, especially in malignant brain tumors.© 2024.

With thousands of omics benchmarking studies published over the past 25 years, the field has matured to the point where the foundations of benchmarking have been established and well described. However, generating meaningful benchmarking data and properly evaluating performance in this complex domain remains challenging.

High-throughput proteomic technologies offer new opportunities to improve HF risk stratification, but their contribution remains to be clearly defined. We aimed to systematically review prognostic studies using high-throughput proteomics to identify protein signatures associated with HF mortality.We searched four databases and two clinical trial registries for articles published from 2012 to 2023. HF proteomics studies measuring high numbers of proteins using aptamer or antibody-based affinity platforms on human plasma or serum with outcomes of all-cause or cardiovascular death were included. Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A third reviewer resolved conflicts. We assessed the risk of bias using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Exposure tool.Out of 5131 unique articles identified, nine articles were included in the review. The nine studies were observational; three used the aptamer platform, and six used the antibody platform. We found considerable heterogeneity across studies in measurement panels, HF definitions, ejection fraction categorization, follow-up duration, and outcome definitions, and a lack of risk estimates for most protein associations. Hence, we proceeded with a systematic review rather than a meta-analysis. In two comparable aptamer studies in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, 21 proteins were identified in common for the association with all-cause death. Among these, one protein, WAP four-disulfide core domain protein 2 was also reported in an antibody study on HFrEF and for the association with CV death. We proposed standardized reporting criteria to facilitate the interpretation of future studies.In this systematic review of nine studies evaluating the association of proteomics with mortality in HF, we identified a limited number of proteins common across several studies. Heterogeneity across studies compromised drawing broad inferences, underscoring the importance of standardized approaches to reporting.© 2024.

Despite numerous new targeted immunomodulatory therapies, comprehensive approaches to apply and evaluate the effects of these treatments longitudinally are lacking. Here, we leverage advances in programmable-phage immunoprecipitation (PhIP-Seq) methodology to explore the modulation, or lack thereof, of proteome-wide autoantibody profiles in both health and disease. We demonstrate that each individual, regardless of disease state, possesses a distinct set of autoreactivities constituting a unique immunological fingerprint, or ""autoreactome"", that is remarkably stable over years. In addition to uncovering important new biology, the autoreactome can be used to better evaluate the relative effectiveness of various therapies in altering autoantibody repertoires. We find that therapies targeting B-Cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) profoundly alter an individual's autoreactome, while anti-CD19 and CD-20 therapies have minimal effects, strongly suggesting a rationale for BCMA or other plasma cell targeted therapies in autoantibody mediated diseases.",6.14494449823084e-27

However, integrative analyses of diverse single-cell data face serious challenges, including technological noise, sample heterogeneity, and different modalities and species. To address these problems, we propose scCorrector, a variational autoencoder-based model that can integrate single-cell data from different studies and map them into a common space. Specifically, we designed a Study Specific Adaptive Normalization for each study in decoder to implement these features. scCorrector substantially achieves competitive and robust performance compared with state-of-the-art methods and brings novel insights under various circumstances (e.g. various batches, multi-omics, cross-species, and development stages). In addition, the integration of single-cell data and spatial data makes it possible to transfer information between different studies, which greatly expand the narrow range of genes covered by MERFISH technology. In summary, scCorrector can efficiently integrate multi-study single-cell datasets, thereby providing broad opportunities to tackle challenges emerging from noisy resources.© The Author(s) 2024.

This raises the question about the adequacy of relying on human reference genomes to accurately analyze sequencing data derived from experimental cell lines. Here, we generated the complete diploid genome assembly for the human retinal epithelial cells (RPE-1), a widely used non-cancer laboratory cell line with a stable karyotype, to use as matched reference for multi-omics sequencing data analysis. Our RPE1v1.0 assembly presents completely phased haplotypes and chromosome-level scaffolds that span centromeres with ultra-high base accuracy (>QV60). We mapped the haplotype-specific genomic variation specific to this cell line including t(Xq;10q), a stable 73.18 Mb duplication of chromosome 10 translocated onto the microdeleted chromosome X telomere t(Xq;10q). Polymorphisms between haplotypes of the same genome reveals genetic and epigenetic variation for all chromosomes, especially at centromeres. The RPE-1 assembly as matched reference genome improves mapping quality of multi-omics reads originating from RPE-1 cells with drastic reduction in alignments mismatches compared to using the most complete human reference to date (CHM13). Leveraging the accuracy achieved using a matched reference, we were able to identify the kinetochore sites at base pair resolution and show unprecedented variation between haplotypes.

Hypotheses about molecular mechanisms enabling cross-TAD interactions remain to be assessed. To test these hypotheses, we used optical reconstruction of chromatin architecture to characterize the conformations of the Pitx1 locus on single chromosomes in developing mouse limbs. Our data support a model in which neighboring boundaries are stacked as a result of loop extrusion, bringing boundary-proximal cis-elements into contact. This stacking interaction also contributes to the appearance of architectural stripes in the population average maps. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we found that increasing boundary strengths facilitates the formation of the stacked boundary conformation, counter-intuitively facilitating border bypass. This work provides a revised view of the TAD borders' function, both facilitating and preventing cis-regulatory interactions, and introduces a framework to distinguish border-crossing from border-respecting enhancer-promoter pairs.© 2024.

Although heritable genetics is a significant risk factor, specific genetic variations and gene targets causally associated with UF are poorly understood. Here, we performed a meta-analysis on existing fibroid genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and integrated the identified risk loci and potentially causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with epigenomics, transcriptomics, 3D chromatin organization from diverse cell types as well as primary UF patient's samples. This integrative analysis identifies 24 UF-associated risk loci that potentially target 394 genes, of which 168 are differentially expressed in UF tumors. Critically, integrating this data with single-cell gene expression data from UF patients reveales the causal cell types with aberrant expression of these target genes.

Mental health and metabolic diseases have a well-established epidemiological association. In this study, we investigate the genetic intersection between type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia. We use Mendelian randomization to examine potential causal relationships between the two conditions and related endophenotypes. We report no compelling evidence that type 2 diabetes genetic liability potentially causally influences schizophrenia risk and vice versa. Our findings show that increased body mass index (BMI) has a protective effect against schizophrenia, in contrast to the well-known risk-increasing effect of BMI on type 2 diabetes risk. We identify evidence of colocalization of association signals for these two conditions at 11 genomic loci, six of which have opposing directions of effect for type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia. To elucidate these colocalizing signals, we integrate multi-omics data from bulk and single-cell gene expression studies, along with functional information. We identify putative effector genes and find that they are enriched for homeostasis and lipid-related pathways. We also highlight drug repurposing opportunities including N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists.

The majority of patients presenting with SVT at diagnosis were classified as myeloproliferative neoplasm with heterozygous JAK2 mutation (87% of cases vs. 69% in PV/ET control group, p < 0.05), characterized by low JAK2 allele burden and no high-risk mutations. Despite this lower molecular complexity, patients presenting with SVT showed a higher risk of death (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.5-6.0, p = 0.003) and lower event-free survival (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.9-4.8, p < 0.001) than age- and sex-matched PV/ET controls. In patients presenting with SVT, molecular high-risk was associated with increased risk of venous re-thrombosis (HR 5.8, 95% CI 1.4-24.0, p = 0.01). Patients developing SVT during follow-up were more frequently allocated in molecular high-risk than those with SVT at diagnosis (52% versus 13%, p < 0.05). In the whole cohort of patients, molecular classification identified PV/ET patients at higher risk of disease progression whereas DNMT3A/TET2/ASXL1 mutations were associated with higher risk of arterial thrombosis. In conclusion, clinical and molecular characteristics are different in PV/ET patients with SVT, depending on whether it occurs at diagnosis or at follow-up.

The effect of malnutrition on fitness components linked to healthspan, the period of life spent in good health conditions, was evaluated by quantifying the flies' lifespan, locomotor activity, heat stress tolerance, lipid content, and dry weight. The results showed that malnutrition had severe negative impact, such as reduced lifespan, locomotor activity, heat stress tolerance, fat content, and dry weight. The negative phenotypic effects were highly sex-dependent, with males being more negatively impacted by malnutrition compared to females. These findings highlight important detrimental and sex-specific effects of malnutrition not only on lifespan but also on traits related to healthspan.",4.53255743315006e-27

Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of infection in the pathogenesis of IPF, and a prior association of theHLA-DQB1gene with idiopathic fibrotic interstitial pneumonia (including IPF) has been reported. Owing to the important role that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region plays in the immune response, here we evaluated if HLA genetic variation was associated specifically with IPF risk.We performed a meta-analysis of associations of the HLA region with IPF risk in individuals of European ancestry from seven independent case-control studies of IPF (comprising 5159 cases and 27 459 controls, including a prior study of fibrotic interstitial pneumonia). Single nucleotide polymorphisms, classical HLA alleles and amino acids were analysed and signals meeting a region-wide association threshold of p<4.5×10-4and a posterior probability of replication >90% were considered significant. We sought to replicate the previously reportedHLA-DQB1association in the subset of studies independent of the original report.The meta-analysis of all seven studies identified four significant independent single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with IPF risk. However, none met the posterior probability for replication criterion. TheHLA-DQB1association was not replicated in the independent IPF studies.Variation in the HLA region was not consistently associated with risk in studies of IPF. However, this does not preclude the possibility that other genomic regions linked to the immune response may be involved in the aetiology of IPF.Copyright ©The authors 2024.",4.41323954772604e-27

However, the strict significance threshold commonly used makes it likely that many true risk loci are missed. Functional annotation of GWAS polymorphisms is a proven strategy to identify additional risk loci. We aimed to investigate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in regulatory regions [transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and enhancers] that could change the expression profile of multiple genes they act upon and thereby modify PDAC risk. We analyzed a total of 12,636 PDAC cases and 43,443 controls from PanScan/PanC4 and the East Asian GWAS (discovery populations), and the PANDoRA consortium (replication population). We identified four associations that reached study-wide statistical significance in the overall meta-analysis: rs2472632(A) (enhancer variant, OR 1.10, 95%CI 1.06,1.13, p = 5.5 × 10-8), rs17358295(G) (enhancer variant, OR 1.16, 95%CI 1.10,1.22, p = 6.1 × 10-7), rs2232079(T) (TFBS variant, OR 0.88, 95%CI 0.83,0.93, p = 6.4 × 10-6) and rs10025845(A) (TFBS variant, OR 1.88, 95%CI 1.50,1.12, p = 1.32 × 10-5). The SNP with the most significant association, rs2472632, is located in an enhancer predicted to target the coiled-coil domain containing 34 oncogene. Our results provide new insights into genetic risk factors for PDAC by a focused analysis of polymorphisms in regulatory regions and demonstrating the usefulness of functional prioritization to identify loci associated with PDAC risk.© 2024.

38299096,NA,NA,"Environmental pollution nowadays has not only a direct correlation with human health changes but a direct social impact. Epidemiological studies have evidenced the increased damage to human health on a daily basis because of damage to the ecological niche. Rapid urban growth and industrialized societies importantly compromise air quality, which can be assessed by a notable accumulation of air pollutants in both the gas and the particle phases. Of them, particulate matter (PM) represents a highly complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds of the most variable size, composition, and origin. PM being one of the most complex environmental pollutants, its accumulation also varies in a temporal and spatial manner, which challenges current analytical techniques used to investigate PM interactions. Nevertheless, the characterization of the chemical composition of PM is a reliable indicator of the composition of the atmosphere, the quality of breathed air in urbanized societies, industrial zones and consequently gives support for pertinent measures to avoid serious health damage. Epigenomic damage is one of the most promising biological mechanisms of air pollution-derived carcinogenesis. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the implication of PM exposure in diverse molecular mechanisms driving human diseases by altered epigenetic regulation. The presented findings in the context of pan-organic cancer, fibrosis, neurodegeneration and metabolic diseases may provide valuable insights into the toxicity effects of PM components at the epigenomic level and may serve as biomarkers of early detection for novel targeted therapies.Copyright © 2024 Gavito-Covarrubias, Ramírez-Díaz, Guzmán-Linares, Limón, Manuel-Sánchez, Molina-Herrera, Coral-García, Anastasio, Anaya-Hernández, López-Salazar, Juárez-Díaz, Martínez-Juárez, Torres-Jácome, Albarado-Ibáñez, Martínez-Laguna, Morán and Rubio.",3.94333726904302e-27

However, its profile in human skin of individuals with vitiligo remains unknown. Here, we aimed to study the DNA methylation profile of vitiligo using pairwise comparisons of lesions, peri-lesions, and healthy skin. We investigated DNA methylation levels in six lesional skin, six peri-lesional skin, and eight healthy skin samples using an Illumina 850 K methylation chip. We then integrated DNA methylation data with transcriptome data to identify differentially methylated and expressed genes (DMEGs) and analyzed their functional enrichment. Subsequently, we compared the methylation and transcriptome characteristics of all skin samples, and the related genes were further studied using scRNA-seq data. Finally, validation was performed using an external dataset. We observed more DNA hypomethylated sites in patients with vitiligo. Further integrated analysis identified 264 DMEGs that were mainly functionally enriched in cell division, pigmentation, circadian rhythm, fatty acid metabolism, peroxidase activity, synapse regulation, and extracellular matrix. In addition, in the peri-lesional skin, we found that methylation levels of 102 DMEGs differed prior to changes in their transcription levels and identified 16 key pre-DMEGs (ANLN, CDCA3, CENPA, DEPDC1, ECT2, DEPDC1B, HMMR, KIF18A, KIF18B, TTK, KIF23, DCT, EDNRB, MITF, OCA2, and TYRP1). Single-cell RNA analysis showed that these genes were associated with cycling keratinocytes and melanocytes. Further analysis of cellular communication indicated the involvement of the extracellular matrix. The expression of related genes was verified using an external dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report a comprehensive DNA methylation profile of clinical vitiligo and peri-lesional skin. These findings would contribute to future research on the pathogenesis of vitiligo and potential therapeutic strategies.© 2024.

Genomic alterations in regions of the genome that are rich in repetitive sequences, often termed ""dark loci,"" are difficult to resolve using traditional sequencing approaches. New long-read technologies offer promising avenues for exploration of previously inaccessible regions of the genome. Using nanopore-based long-read whole-genome sequencing of DNA extracted from aged 18 human brains, we identify previously unreported structural variants and methylation patterns within repetitive DNA, focusing on transposable elements (""jumping genes"") as crucial sources of variation, particularly in dark loci. Our analyses reveal potential somatic insertion variants and provides DNA methylation frequencies for many retrotransposon families. We further demonstrate the utility of this technology for the study of these challenging genomic regions in brains affected by Alzheimer's disease and identify significant differences in DNA methylation in pathologically normal brains versus those affected by Alzheimer's disease. Highlighting the power of this approach, we discover specific polymorphic retrotransposons with altered DNA methylation patterns. These retrotransposon loci have the potential to contribute to pathology, warranting further investigation in Alzheimer's disease research. Taken together, our study provides the first long-read DNA sequencing-based analysis of retrotransposon sequences, structural variants, and DNA methylation in the aging brain affected with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology.",3.07390305790226e-27

A major computational challenge in analyzing these datasets is to project the large-scale and high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space while retaining the relative relationships between cells. This low dimension embedding is necessary to decompose cellular heterogeneity and reconstruct cell-type-specific gene regulatory programs. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, however, face challenges in computational efficiency and in comprehensively addressing cellular diversity across varied molecular modalities. Here we introduce a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm, embodied in the Python package SnapATAC2, which not only achieves a more precise capture of single-cell omics data heterogeneities but also ensures efficient runtime and memory usage, scaling linearly with the number of cells. Our algorithm demonstrates exceptional performance, scalability and versatility across diverse single-cell omics datasets, including single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing, single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell Hi-C and single-cell multi-omics datasets, underscoring its utility in advancing single-cell analysis.© 2024.

Differences in gene expression, DNA methylation, and chromatin conformation, which could affect differentiation capacity, have been identified between iPSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Less is known about whether DNA replication timing, a process linked to both genome regulation and genome stability, is efficiently reprogrammed to the embryonic state. To answer this, we compare genome-wide replication timing between ESCs, iPSCs, and cells reprogrammed by somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT-ESCs). While NT-ESCs replicate their DNA in a manner indistinguishable from ESCs, a subset of iPSCs exhibits delayed replication at heterochromatic regions containing genes downregulated in iPSCs with incompletely reprogrammed DNA methylation. DNA replication delays are not the result of gene expression or DNA methylation aberrations and persist after cells differentiate to neuronal precursors. Thus, DNA replication timing can be resistant to reprogramming and influence the quality of iPSCs.Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2.97400454810913e-27

A high pain threshold was also observed. Conventional and molecular cytogenetic defined the size of the deletion, and exome analysis on the trio completed the molecular work.Cytogenetic analysis showed a de novo chromosomal alteration: 46,XY,ishdel(5)(p14.3)(D5S28-) and arr[GRCh37] 5p15.33p14.3(1498180_19955760)x1.

Exome analysis in the trio (patient and parents) failed to identify variants to be interpreted as a likely risk factor for EAC.We conclude that the presence of well-known risk factors (maleness, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux, and Barrett's metaplasia) in a patient with very limited capability of expressing discomfort or referring clinical symptoms have been the main risk factors for developing EAC.

We obtained a single oblique cervical radiograph from each patient. We cut each oblique cervical radiograph image into a square shape, including the foramen that was targeted for TFESI, the intervertebral disc, the facet joint of the corresponding level with the targeted foramen, and the pedicles of the vertebral bodies just above and below the targeted foramen. Therefore, images including the targeted foramen and structures around the targeted foramen were used as input data. A favorable outcome was defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in the numeric rating scale (NRS) score at 2 months post TFESI compared to the pretreatment NRS score. A poor outcome was defined as a < 50% reduction in the NRS score at 2 months post TFESI vs. the pretreatment score.The area under the curve of our developed model for predicting the treatment outcome of cervical TFESI in patients with cervical foraminal stenosis was 0.823.A CNN model trained using oblique cervical radiographs can be helpful in predicting treatment outcomes after cervical TFESI in patients with cervical foraminal stenosis. If the predictive accuracy is increased, we believe that the deep learning model using cervical radiographs as input data can be easily and widely used in clinics or hospitals.© 2024.

We aimed to characterize DNA methylation subclass heterogeneity during progression and assess its clinical impact. Matched tissues from 47 glioblastoma patients were subjected to DNA methylation profiling, including CpG-site alterations, tissue and serum deconvolution, mass spectrometry, and immunoassay. Effects of clinical characteristics on temporal changes and outcomes were studied. Among 47 patients, 8 (17.0%) had non-matching classifications at recurrence. In the remaining 39 cases, 28.2% showed dominant DNA methylation subclass transitions, with 72.7% being a mesenchymal subclass. In general, glioblastomas with a subclass transition showed upregulated metabolic processes. Newly diagnosed glioblastomas with mesenchymal transition displayed increased stem cell-like states and decreased immune components at diagnosis and exhibited elevated immune signatures and cytokine levels in serum. In contrast, tissue of recurrent glioblastomas with mesenchymal transition showed increased immune components but decreased stem cell-like states. Survival analyses revealed comparable outcomes for patients with and without subclass transitions. This study demonstrates a temporal heterogeneity of DNA methylation subclasses in 28.2% of glioblastomas, not impacting patient survival. Changes in cell state composition associated with subclass transition may be crucial for recurrent glioblastoma targeted therapies.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.38793112970587e-27
38175854,"Quantifying the distribution of feature values over data represented in arbitrary dimensional spaces.","PLoS Comput Biol","Identifying the structured distribution (or lack thereof) of a given feature over a point cloud is a general research question. In the neuroscience field, this problem arises while investigating representations over neural manifolds (e.g., spatial coding), in the analysis of neurophysiological signals (e.g., sensory coding) or in anatomical image segmentation. We introduce the Structure Index (SI) as a directed graph-based metric to quantify the distribution of feature values projected over data in arbitrary D-dimensional spaces (defined from neurons, time stamps, pixels, genes, etc). The SI is defined from the overlapping distribution of data points sharing similar feature values in a given neighborhood of the cloud. Using arbitrary data clouds, we show how the SI provides quantification of the degree and directionality of the local versus global organization of feature distribution. SI can be applied to both scalar and vectorial features permitting quantification of the relative contribution of related variables. When applied to experimental studies of head-direction cells, it is able to retrieve consistent feature structure from both the high- and low-dimensional representations, and to disclose the local and global structure of the angle and speed represented in different brain regions. Finally, we provide two general-purpose examples (sound and image categorization), to illustrate the potential application to arbitrary dimensional spaces.

We present ultrafast BS-seq (UBS-seq), which uses highly concentrated bisulfite reagents and high reaction temperatures to accelerate the bisulfite reaction by ~13-fold, resulting in reduced DNA damage and lower background noise. UBS-seq allows library construction from small amounts of purified genomic DNA, such as from cell-free DNA or directly from 1 to 100 mouse embryonic stem cells, with less overestimation of 5mC level and higher genome coverage than conventional BS-seq. Additionally, UBS-seq quantitatively maps RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) from low inputs of mRNA and allows the detection of m5C stoichiometry in highly structured RNA sequences. Our UBS-seq results identify NSUN2 as the major 'writer' protein responsible for the deposition of ~90% of m5C sites in HeLa mRNA and reveal enriched m5C sites in 5'-regions of mammalian mRNA, which may have functional roles in mRNA translation regulation.© 2024.

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) was used to reveal the spatial difference of gene expression in the control, resilient (RES) and susceptible (SUS) mouse brains, and annotated eight anatomical brain regions and six cell types. The gene expression profiles uncovered that CSDS leads to gene synchrony changes in different brain regions. Then it was identified that inhibitory neurons and synaptic functions in multiple regions were primarily affected by CSDS. The brain regions Hippocampus (HIP), Isocortex, and Amygdala (AMY) present more pronounced transcriptional changes in genes associated with depressive psychiatric disorders than other regions. Signalling communication between these three brain regions may play a critical role in susceptibility to CSDS.

Humans are currently living longer than ever before, accompanied with aging-related alterations such as diminished autophagy, decreased immunological function, mitochondrial malfunction, stem cell failure, accumulation of somatic and mitochondrial DNA mutations, loss of telomere, and altered nutrient metabolism. Aging leads to a decline in body functions and age-related diseases, for example, Alzheimer's disease, which adversely affects human health and longevity. The quality of life of the elderly is greatly diminished by the increase in their life expectancy rather than healthy life expectancy.

However, methylation of RNA cytosine residues, which would drive another level of biological influence as an epitranscriptomic mechanism of gene and protein regulation has not been studied in the context of addiction. Here, we probed whether chronic morphine exposure could alter tRNA cytosine methylation (m5C) and resulting expression levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain region crucial for reward processing and executive function that exhibits opioid-induced molecular restructuring. We identified dynamic changes in glycine tRNA (tRNAGlyGCC) cytosine methylation, corresponding to altered expression levels of this tRNA at multiple timepoints following 15 days of daily morphine. Additionally, a robust increase in methylation, coupled with decreased expression, was present after 30 days of withdrawal, suggesting that repeated opioid administration produces changes to the tRNA regulome long after discontinuation. Furthermore, forebrain-wide knockout of neuronal Nsun2, a tRNA methyltransferase, was associated with disruption of opioid conditioned place preference, and this effect was recapitulated by regional mPFC Nsun2 knockout. Taken together, these studies provide a foundational link between the regulation of tRNA cytosine methylation and opioid reward and highlight the tRNA machinery as a potential therapeutic target in addiction.© 2024.

The DNA methylation rate of theNPTX2gene was significantly higher in TC than in the normal thymus and thymomas, except B3. The mRNA expression level ofNPTX2was lower in TC than in the normal thymus. An inverse relationship was observed between mRNA expression levels and methylation levels. Relapse-free survival was shorter in patients with highNPTX2DNA methylation levels than in those with low DNA methylation levels.

The formation of iMs is sensitive to pH conditions and DNA methylation, although the extent of which is still unknown in both humans and plants. To investigate this, we here conducted iMab antibody-based immunoprecipitation and sequencing (iM-IP-seq) along with bisulfite sequencing using CK (original genomic DNA without methylation-related treatments) and hypermethylated or demethylated DNA at both pH 5.5 and 7.0 in rice, establishing a link between pH, DNA methylation and iM formation on a genome-wide scale. We found that iMs folded at pH 7.0 displayed higher methylation levels than those formed at pH 5.5. DNA demethylation and hypermethylation differently influenced iM formation at pH 7.0 and 5.5. Importantly, CG hypo-DMRs (differentially methylated regions) and CHH (H = A, C and T) hyper-DMRs alone or coordinated with CG/CHG hyper-DMRs may play determinant roles in the regulation of pH dependent iM formation. Thus, our study shows that the nature of DNA sequences alone or combined with their methylation status plays critical roles in determining pH-dependent formation of iMs. It therefore deepens the understanding of the pH and methylation dependent modulation of iM formation, which has important biological implications and practical applications.© The Author(s) 2024.

Healthful lifestyle practices and interventions, including dietary regimens and consistent aerobic exercise, exert favorable modulation on these processes, thereby diminishing the risk of cardiovascular disease with advancing age. The principal objective of this review was to conduct a comprehensive evaluation and synthesis of the available literature regarding the effectiveness of different diets on vascular health, such as arterial stiffness and endothelial function. To conduct this review, a thorough search of electronic databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection was carried out. Based on the existing evidence, the Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, and low-calorie diets may have a beneficial effect on vascular health. However, more randomized controlled trials with sufficient sample sizes, longer follow-ups, rigorous methodologies, and, possibly, head-to-head comparisons between the different diets are needed to shed light on this topic.",9.11477498033412e-28
38328112,"scaDA: A Novel Statistical Method for Differential Analysis of Single-Cell Chromatin Accessibility Sequencing Data.","bioRxiv","Single-cell ATAC-seq sequencing data (scATAC-seq) has been widely used to investigate chromatin accessibility on the single-cell level. One important application of scATAC-seq data analysis is differential chromatin accessibility analysis. However, the data characteristics of scATAC-seq such as excessive zeros and large variability of chromatin accessibility across cells impose a unique challenge for DA analysis. Existing statistical methods focus on detecting the mean difference of the chromatin accessible regions while overlooking the distribution difference. Motivated by real data exploration that distribution difference exists among cell types, we introduce a novel composite statistical test named ""scaDA"", which is based on zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB), for performing differential distribution analysis of chromatin accessibility by jointly testing the abundance, prevalence and dispersion simultaneously. Benefiting from both dispersion shrinkage and iterative refinement of mean and prevalence parameter estimates, scaDA demonstrates its superiority to both ZINB-based likelihood ratio tests and published methods by achieving the highest power and best FDR control in a comprehensive simulation study. In addition to demonstrating the highest power in three real sc-multiome data analyses, scaDA successfully identifies differentially accessible regions in microglia from sc-multiome data for an Alzheimer's disease (AD) study, regions which are most enriched in GO terms related to neurogenesis, the clinical phenotype of AD, and SNPs identified in AD-associated GWAS.",8.68415297958087e-28

Genetic and epigenetic factors have been associated with EPF, but its etiology is still not fully understood. To evaluate the genetic association of histone (de)acetylation-related genes with EPF susceptibility, we evaluated 785 polymorphisms from 144 genes, for 227 EPF patients and 194 controls. Carriers ofHDAC4_rs4852054*Awere more susceptible (OR = 1.79,p= 0.0038), whereas those withGSE1_rs13339618*A(OR = 0.57,p= 0.0011) and homozygotes forPHF21A_rs4756055*A(OR = 0.39,p= 0.0006) were less susceptible to EPF. These variants were not associated with sporadic PF (SPF) in German samples of 75 SPF patients and 150 controls, possibly reflecting differences in SPF and EPF pathophysiology. We further evaluated the expression of histone (de)acetylation-related genes in CD4+T lymphocytes, using RNAseq. In these cells, we found a higher expression ofKAT2B,PHF20,andZEB2and lower expression ofKAT14andJAD1in patients with active EPF without treatment compared to controls from endemic regions.

Monitoring stress keratins is widely used to identify keratinocytes in an activated state. Here, we analyze single-cell transcriptomic data from healthy and diseased human skin to explore the properties of stress keratins. Relative to keratins occurring in healthy skin, stress-induced keratins are expressed at lower levels and show lesser type I-type II pairwise regulation. Stress keratins do not ""replace"" the keratins expressed during normal differentiation nor reflect cellular proliferation. Instead, stress keratins are consistently co-regulated with genes with roles in differentiation, inflammation, and/or activation of innate immunity at the single-cell level. These findings provide a roadmap toward explaining the broad diversity and contextual regulation of keratins.© 2024 The Author(s).",6.72192157082989e-28
38193100,"Outpatient Pharmacogenomic Screenings to Prevent Addiction, Overdose, and Suicide.","Innov Clin Neurosci","Point-of-care genetic testing for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to improve psychiatric treatment in outpatient settings remains a challenge. The presence or absence of certain genomic alleles determines the activity of the encoded enzymes, which ultimately defines the individual's drug metabolism rate. Classification of poor metabolizers (PMs) and rapid/ultrarapid metabolizers (RMs/UMs) would facilitate personalization and precision of treatment. However, current pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing of multiple genes is comprehensive and requires quantitative analyses for interpretations. We recommend qualitative, fast-track, point-of-care screenings, which are one- or-two gene-based analyses, as a quick initial screening tool to potentially eliminate the need for an expensive quantitative send-out test, which is a costly and lengthy process. We speculate that these tests will be relevant in two major scenarios: 1) clinical psychiatry for treating disease states such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), where trial and error is still the mainstay of drug selection and symptom management, a process that is associated with significant delay in optimizing individualized treatment and dose, and thus response; and 2) pain management, where quickly determining an effective level of analgesia while avoiding a toxic level can cause a drastic improvement in mental health.Copyright © 2023.

However, identifying functional 3' UTR variants has proven difficult. We use allele frequencies from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) to identify classes of 3' UTR variants under strong negative selection in humans. We develop intergenic mutability-adjusted proportion singleton (iMAPS), a generalized measure related to MAPS, to quantify negative selection in non-coding regions. This approach, in conjunction with in vitro and in vivo binding data, identifies precise RBP binding sites, miRNA target sites, and polyadenylation signals (PASs) under strong selection. For each class of sites, we identify thousands of gnomAD variants under selection comparable to missense coding variants, and find that sites in core 3' UTR regions upstream of the most-used PAS are under strongest selection. Together, this work improves our understanding of selection on human genes and validates approaches for interpreting genetic variants in human 3' UTRs.© 2024. The Author(s).",6.33313778959262e-28
38332448,"Development of a rapid and comprehensive genomic profiling test supporting diagnosis and research for gliomas.","Brain Tumor Pathol","A prompt and reliable molecular diagnosis for brain tumors has become crucial in precision medicine. While Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP) has become feasible, there remains room for enhancement in brain tumor diagnosis due to the partial lack of essential genes and limitations in broad copy number analysis. In addition, the long turnaround time of commercially available CGPs poses an additional obstacle to the timely implementation of results in clinics. To address these challenges, we developed a CGP encompassing 113 genes, genome-wide copy number changes, and MGMT promoter methylation. Our CGP incorporates not only diagnostic genes but also supplementary genes valuable for research. Our CGP enables us to simultaneous identification of mutations, gene fusions, focal and broad copy number alterations, and MGMT promoter methylation status, with results delivered within a minimum of 4 days. Validation of our CGP, through comparisons with whole-genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and pyrosequencing, has certified its accuracy and reliability. We applied our CGP for 23 consecutive cases of intracranial mass lesions, which demonstrated its efficacy in aiding diagnosis and prognostication. Our CGP offers a comprehensive and rapid molecular profiling for gliomas, which could potentially apply to clinical practices and research primarily in the field of brain tumors.© 2024.

38379073,"A statistical method for quantifying progenitor cells reveals incipient cell fate commitments.","Nat Methods","Quantifying the number of progenitor cells that found an organ, tissue or cell population is of fundamental importance for understanding the development and homeostasis of a multicellular organism. Previous efforts rely on marker genes that are specifically expressed in progenitors. This strategy is, however, often hindered by the lack of ideal markers. Here we propose a general statistical method to quantify the progenitors of any tissues or cell populations in an organism, even in the absence of progenitor-specific markers, by exploring the cell phylogenetic tree that records the cell division history during development. The method, termed targeting coalescent analysis (TarCA), computes the probability that two randomly sampled cells of a tissue coalesce within the tissue-specific monophyletic clades. The inverse of this probability then serves as a measure of the progenitor number of the tissue. Both mathematic modeling and computer simulations demonstrated the high accuracy of TarCA, which was then validated using real data from nematode, fruit fly and mouse, all with related cell phylogenetic trees. We further showed that TarCA can be used to identify lineage-specific upregulated genes during embryogenesis, revealing incipient cell fate commitments in mouse embryos.© 2024.

Single-cell chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and gene expression (scRNA-seq) have characterized cell types at high resolution, and studies integrating GWAS with scRNA-seq have shown promise, but studies integrating GWAS with scATAC-seq have been limited. Here, we identify disease-critical fetal and adult brain cell types by integrating GWAS summary statistics from 28 brain-related diseases/traits (average N = 298 K) with 3.2 million scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq profiles from 83 cell types. We identified disease-critical fetal (respectively adult) brain cell types for 22 (respectively 23) of 28 traits using scATAC-seq, and for 8 (respectively 17) of 28 traits using scRNA-seq. Significant scATAC-seq enrichments included fetal photoreceptor cells for major depressive disorder, fetal ganglion cells for BMI, fetal astrocytes for ADHD, and adult VGLUT2 excitatory neurons for schizophrenia.

38279113,"Co-linear chaining on pangenome graphs.","Algorithms Mol Biol","Pangenome reference graphs are useful in genomics because they compactly represent the genetic diversity within a species, a capability that linear references lack. However, efficiently aligning sequences to these graphs with complex topology and cycles can be challenging. The seed-chain-extend based alignment algorithms use co-linear chaining as a standard technique to identify a good cluster of exact seed matches that can be combined to form an alignment. Recent works show how the co-linear chaining problem can be efficiently solved for acyclic pangenome graphs by exploiting their small width and how incorporating gap cost in the scoring function improves alignment accuracy. However, it remains open on how to effectively generalize these techniques for general pangenome graphs which contain cycles. Here we present the first practical formulation and an exact algorithm for co-linear chaining on cyclic pangenome graphs. We rigorously prove the correctness and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. We evaluate the empirical performance of our algorithm by aligning simulated long reads from the human genome to a cyclic pangenome graph constructed from 95 publicly available haplotype-resolved human genome assemblies. While the existing heuristic-based algorithms are faster, the proposed algorithm provides a significant advantage in terms of accuracy. Implementation ( https://github.com/at-cg/PanAligner ).© 2024.

The Lombardy poplar offers an ideal opportunity to investigate the impact of the individual environmental history of trees on the methylome.We present the results of three interconnected experiments on Lombardy poplar. In the first experiment, we investigated methylome variability during a growing season and across vegetatively reproduced generations. We found that ramets collected over Europe and raised in common conditions have stable methylomes in symmetrical CG-contexts. In contrast, seasonal dynamics occurred in methylation patterns in CHH context. In the second experiment, we investigated whether methylome patterns of plants grown in a non-parental environment correlate with the parental climate. We did not observe a biological relevant pattern that significantly correlates with the parental climate. Finally, we investigated whether the parental environment has persistent carry-over effects on the vegetative offspring's phenotype. We combined new bud set observations of three consecutive growing seasons with former published bud set data. Using a linear mixed effects analysis, we found a statistically significant but weak short-term, parental carry-over effect on the timing of bud set. However, this effect was negligible compared to the direct effects of the offspring environment.Genome-wide cytosine methylation patterns in symmetrical CG-context are stable in Lombardy poplar and appear to be mainly the result of random processes. In this widespread poplar clone, methylation patterns in CG-context can be used as biomarkers to infer a common ancestor and thus to investigate the recent environmental history of a specific Lombardy poplar. The Lombardy poplar shows high phenotypic plasticity in a novel environment which enabled this clonal tree to adapt and survive all over the temperate regions of the world.© 2024.

Obviously, without data obtained on women, it is impossible to apply the results of research appropriately to women. This issue also applies to medical devices (MDs), and numerous problems linked to scarce pre-market research and clinical trials on MDs were evidenced after their introduction to the market. Globally, some MDs are less efficient in women than in men and sometimes MDs are less safe for women than men, although recently there has been a small but significant decrease in the sex and gender gap. As an example, cardiac resynchronization defibrillators seem to produce more beneficial effects in women than in men. It is also important to remember that MDs can impact the health of healthcare providers and this could occur in a sex- and gender-dependent manner. Recently, MDs' complexity is rising, and to ensure their appropriate use they must have a sex-gender-sensitive approach. Unfortunately, the majority of physicians, healthcare providers, and developers of MDs still believe that the human population is only constituted by men. Therefore, to overcome the gender gap, a real collaboration between the inventors of MDs, health researchers, and health providers should be established to test MDs in female and male tissues, animals, and women.",4.00179376007755e-28

Circulating caffeine levels are influenced by the interplay between consumption behaviour and metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the effects of circulating caffeine levels by considering genetically predicted variation in caffeine metabolism.Leveraging genetic variants related to caffeine metabolism that affect its circulating levels, we investigated the clinical effects of plasma caffeine in a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS). We validated novel findings using a two-sample Mendelian randomization framework and explored the potential mechanisms underlying these effects in proteome-wide and metabolome-wide Mendelian randomization.Higher levels of genetically predicted circulating caffeine among caffeine consumers were associated with a lower risk of obesity (odds ratio (OR) per standard deviation increase in caffeine = 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) CI: 0.95-0.98, p = 2.47 × 10-4), osteoarthrosis (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96-0.98, P=1.10 × 10-8) and osteoarthritis (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.96 to 0.98, P = 1.09 × 10-6). Approximately one third of the protective effect of plasma caffeine on osteoarthritis risk was estimated to be mediated through lower bodyweight. Proteomic and metabolomic perturbations indicated lower chronic inflammation, improved lipid profiles, and altered protein and glycogen metabolism as potential biological mechanisms underlying these effects.We report novel evidence suggesting that long-term increases in circulating caffeine may reduce bodyweight and the risk of osteoarthrosis and osteoarthritis. We confirm prior genetic evidence of a protective effect of plasma caffeine on risk of overweight and obesity. Further clinical study is warranted to understand the translational relevance of these findings before clinical practice or lifestyle interventions related to caffeine consumption are introduced.© 2024.

A substitution in the ace-1 locus has been rapidly selected for, allowing resistance to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. Since then, two types of duplication of the ace-1 locus have been found in An. gambiae s.l. populations: homogeneous duplications that are composed of several resistance copies, or heterogeneous duplications that contain both resistance and susceptible copies. The substitution induces a trade-off between resistance in the presence of insecticides and disadvantages in their absence: the heterogeneous duplications allow the fixation of the intermediate heterozygote phenotype. So far, a single heterogeneous duplication has been described in An. gambiae s.l. populations (in contrast with the multiple duplicated alleles found in Culex pipiens mosquitoes). We used a new approach, combining long and short-read sequencing with Sanger sequencing to precisely identify and describe at least nine different heterogeneous duplications, in two populations of An. gambiae s.l. We show that these alleles share the same structure as the previously identified heterogeneous and homogeneous duplications, namely 203-kb tandem amplifications with conserved breakpoints. Our study sheds new light on the origin and maintenance of these alleles in An. gambiae s.l. populations, and their role in mosquito adaptation.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.37677809543056e-28

Previous studies have mainly focused on individual brain regions or a certain developmental stage. Our motivation is to address this gap by incorporating spatio-temporal information to gain a more complete understanding of brain development or abnormal brain development, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to identify potential determinants of response. In this study, we propose a novel two-step framework based on spatial-temporal information weighting and multi-step decision trees. This framework can effectively exploit the spatial similarity and temporal dependence between different stages and different brain regions, and facilitate differential gene analysis in brain regions with high heterogeneity. We focus on two datasets: the AD dataset, which includes gene expression data from early, middle and late stages, and the brain development dataset, spanning fetal development to adulthood. Our findings highlight the advantages of the proposed framework in discovering gene classes and elucidating their impact on brain development and AD progression across diverse brain regions and stages.

This study tackles this issue through a comprehensive analysis combining transcriptomics and untargeted metabolomics, revealing age-dependent alterations in theGpxgene family and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolic networks, resulting in enhanced ferroptosis. Selenomethionine (Se-Met) could enhance GPX4 expression, thereby assisting EpiSCs in countering AA-induced mitochondrial damage and ferroptosis. Additionally, Se-Met demonstrates antioxidative characteristics and extensive ultraviolet absorption. For the sustained and controllable release of Se-Met, it was covalently grafted to UV-responsive GelMA hydrogels via AC-PEG-NHS tethers. The Se-Met@GelMA hydrogel effectively accelerated wound healing in a chronological aging mice model, by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis with augmented GPX4 expression. Moreover, in a photoaging model, this hydrogel significantly mitigated inflammatory responses, extracellular matrix remodeling, and ferroptosis in UV-exposed mice.

However, the brain is a complex system, and extracting topological semantics from different brain networks is necessary yet challenging to identify pathogenic genes for brain diseases.In this study, we present a multi-network representation learning framework called M-GBBD for the identification of gene biomarker in brain diseases. Specifically, we collected multi-omics data to construct eleven networks from different perspectives. M-GBBD extracts the spatial distributions of features from these networks and iteratively optimizes them using Kullback-Leibler divergence to fuse the networks into a common semantic space that represents the gene network for the brain. Subsequently, a graph consisting of both gene and large-scale disease proximity networks learns representations through graph convolution techniques and predicts whether a gene is associated which brain diseases while providing associated scores. Experimental results demonstrate that M-GBBD outperforms several baseline methods. Furthermore, our analysis supported by bioinformatics revealed CAMP as a significantly associated gene with Alzheimer's disease identified by M-GBBD.Collectively, M-GBBD provides valuable insights into identifying gene biomarkers for brain diseases and serves as a promising framework for brain networks representation learning.© 2024.

Thermoeffectors include brown adipose tissue, cutaneous blood flow and skeletal muscle, and metabolic energy sources include white adipose tissue. Neural and metabolic pathways modulating the activity and functional plasticity of these mechanisms contribute not only to the optimization of function during acute challenges, such as ambient temperature changes, infection and stress, but also to longitudinal adaptations to environmental and internal changes. Exposure of humans to repeated and seasonal cold ambient conditions leads to adaptations in thermoeffectors such as habituation of cutaneous vasoconstriction and shivering. In animals that undergo hibernation and torpor, neurally regulated metabolic and thermoregulatory adaptations enable survival during periods of significant reduction in metabolic rate.

DNA methylation is a form of epigenetic regulation linking environmental stimuli to gene expression changes and inflammation. Here, we investigated how DNA methylation of theTNFpromoter differs between inflamed and uninflamed mucosa of IBD patients, including anti-TNF responders and non-responders.We obtained mucosal biopsies from 200 participants (133 IBD and 67 controls) and analyzedTNFpromoter methylation using bisulfite sequencing, comparing inflamed with uninflamed segments, in addition to paired inflamed/uninflamed samples from individual patients. We conducted similar analyses on purified intestinal epithelial cells from bowel resections. We also comparedTNFmethylation levels of inflamed and uninflamed mucosa from a separate cohort of 15 anti-TNF responders and 17 non-responders. Finally, we sequenced DNA methyltransferase genes to identify rare variants in IBD patients and functionally tested them using rescue experiments in a zebrafish genetic model of DNA methylation deficiency.TNFpromoter methylation levels were decreased in inflamed mucosa of IBD patients and correlated with disease severity. Isolated IECs from inflamed tissue showed proportional decreases inTNFmethylation. Anti-TNF non-responders showed lower levels ofTNFmethylation than responders in uninflamed mucosa. Our sequencing analysis revealed two missense variants inDNMT1, one of which had reduced functionin vivo.Our study reveals an association ofTNFpromoter hypomethylation with mucosal inflammation, suggesting that IBD patients may be particularly sensitive to inflammatory environmental insults affecting DNA methylation.

Here, we show that CDCA7 is critical for maintaining global DNA methylation levels across multiple tissues in vivo. A pathogenicCdca7missense variant leads to the formation of large, aberrantly hypomethylated domains overlapping with the B genomic compartment but without affecting the deposition of H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3). CDCA7-associated aberrant DNA hypomethylation translated to localized, tissue-specific transcriptional dysregulation that affected large gene clusters. In the brain, we identify CDCA7 as a transcriptional repressor and epigenetic regulator of clusteredprotocadherinisoform choice. Increasedprotocadherinisoform expression frequency is accompanied by DNA methylation loss, gain of H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), and increased binding of the transcriptional regulator CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF).

We identified 12,128 (CR vs. CE), 59,165 (CR vs. TM), and 39,751 (CE vs. TM) differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the three macaques. Furthermore, we obtained the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among the three macaque species. The differences between CR and CE were smaller at both the methylome and transcriptome levels than compared with TM (CR vs. TM and CE vs. TM). We also found a change in the density of single nucleotide mutations in DMRs relative to their flanking regions, indicating a potential mechanism through which genomic alterations may modulate methylation landscapes, thereby influencing the transcriptome. Functional enrichment analyses showed the DMR-related genes were enriched in developmental processes and neurological functions, such as the growth hormone-related pathway, insulin secretion pathway, thyroid hormone synthesis pathway, morphine addiction, and GABAergic synapses. These differences may be associated with variations in physiology and habitat among the macaques. Our study provides one of the first genome-wide comparisons of genetic, gene expression, and epigenetic variations across different macaques. Our results should facilitate further research on comparative genomic and genetic differences in macaque species.© 2023 The Authors.

A variety of conditions, both benign and malignant, including pleural mesothelioma, can affect this tissue. A lack of knowledge concerning the mesothelial and stromal cells comprising the pleura has hampered the development of targeted therapies. Here, we present the first comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human parietal pleura and demonstrate its utility in elucidating pleural biology. We confirm the presence of known universal fibroblasts and describe novel, potentially pleural-specific, fibroblast subtypes. We also present transcriptomic characterisation of multiplein vitromodels of benign and malignant mesothelial cells, and characterise these through comparison within vivotranscriptomic data. While bulk pleural transcriptomes have been reported previously, this is the first study to provide resolution at the single-cell level. We expect our pleural cell atlas will prove invaluable to those studying pleural biology and disease. It has already enabled us to shed light on the transdifferentiation of mesothelial cells, allowing us to develop a simple method for prolonging mesothelial cell differentiationin vitro.Copyright ©The authors 2024.",1.6143483566863e-28
38180712,"Chromatinopathies: insight in clinical aspects and underlying epigenetic changes.","J Appl Genet","Chromatinopathies (CPs), a group of rare inborn defects characterized by chromatin state imbalance, have evolved from initially resembling Cornelia de Lange syndrome to encompass a wide array of genetic diseases with diverse clinical presentations. The CPs classification now includes human developmental disorders caused by germline mutations in epigenes, genes that regulate the epigenome. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have enabled the association of 154 epigenes with CPs, revealing distinctive DNA methylation patterns known as episignatures.It has been shown that episignatures are unique for a particular CP or share similarities among specific CP subgroup. Consequently, these episignatures have emerged as promising biomarkers for diagnosing and treating CPs, differentiating subtypes, evaluating variants of unknown significance, and facilitating targeted therapies tailored to the underlying epigenetic dysregulation.The following review was conducted to collect, summarize, and analyze data regarding CPs in such aspects as clinical evaluation encompassing long-term patient care, underlying epigenetic changes, and innovative molecular and bioinformatic methodologies that have been devised for the assessment of CPs. We have also shed light on promising novel treatment options that have surfaced in recent research and presented a synthesis of ongoing clinical trials, contributing to the current understanding of the dynamic and evolving nature of CPs investigation.© 2024.

However, little is known about the precise function and consequences of PHF6 in MN. Here we show three main findings in our comprehensive genomic and proteomic study. Firstly, we show a different pattern of genes correlating with PHF6MTin male and female cases. When analyzing male and female cases separately, in only male cases, RUNX1 and U2AF1 are co-mutated with PHF6. In contrast, female cases reveal co-occurrence of ASXL1 mutations and X-chromosome deletions with PHF6MT. Next, proteomics analysis reveals a direct interaction between PHF6 and RUNX1. Both proteins co-localize in active enhancer regions that define the context of lineage differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate a negative prognostic role of PHF6MT, especially in association with RUNX1. The negative effects on survival are additive as PHF6MTcases with RUNX1 mutations have worse outcomes when compared to cases carrying single mutation or wild-type.© 2024.

Yet the cellular and molecular processes regulating their function throughout the course of the disease are poorly understood. Here, we present the transcriptional landscape of primary microglia from 189 human postmortem brains, including 58 healthy aging individuals and 131 with a range of disease phenotypes, including 63 patients representing the full spectrum of clinical and pathological severity of AD. We identified transcriptional changes associated with multiple AD phenotypes, capturing the severity of dementia and neuropathological lesions. Transcript-level analyses identified additional genes with heterogeneous isoform usage and AD phenotypes. We identified changes in gene-gene coordination in AD, dysregulation of co-expression modules, and disease subtypes with distinct gene expression. Taken together, these data further our understanding of the key role of microglia in AD biology and nominate candidates for therapeutic intervention.",1.17026318121528e-28

While both the incidence and mortality rates have shown a decline, older individuals with asthma exhibit not just more severe symptoms but also demonstrate an elevated mortality rate. This phenomenon could be attributed to the presence of chronic comorbidities that exert an influence on clinical outcomes among adult patients with asthma. This review aims to present various aspects of asthma comprehensively, including the prevalence, incidence, mortality rates, and causes of death in adult patients with asthma. Additionally, this review delves into the impact of chronic comorbidities that contribute to the morbidity and mortality of patients with asthma on a global scale, encompassing conditions such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, lung cancer, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, concerning asthma. Furthermore, the manuscript reviews the distinctions between asthma and asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap and adds perspective on asthma as an occupational lung disease. Thus, this review aims to enhance clinicians' awareness of the significance of chronic comorbidities in the management of patients with asthma. It seeks to provide insights that contribute to a more comprehensive approach to managing patients with asthma who also have comorbid conditions.Copyright © 2024 Listyoko, Okazaki, Harada, Inui and Yamasaki.",1.15131584590492e-28
38337765,NA,NA,"Salivary DNA is widely used for genetic analyses because of its easy collection. However, its extracellular fraction in particular, similar to the extracellular DNA (ecDNA) in plasma, could be a promising biomarker for oral or systemic diseases. In contrast to genetics, the quantity of salivary ecDNA is of importance and can be affected by the pre-analytical processing of samples, but the details are not known. The aim of our study was to analyze the effects of centrifugation and freezing of saliva on the concentration of ecDNA in saliva. Fifteen healthy volunteers, free of any known systemic or oral diseases, were asked to collect unstimulated saliva samples. Aliquots were centrifuged at 1600×gand frozen or directly processed. The fresh or thawed cell-free saliva samples underwent subsequent centrifugation at 16,000×g. The supernatants were used for DNA isolation and quantification using fluorometry and real-time PCR. While freezing had minimal effects on the salivary ecDNA concentration, another centrifugation step decreased ecDNA considerably in both fresh and frozen samples (by 97.8% and 98.4%, respectively). This was mirrored in the quantitative PCR targeting a nuclear (decrease by 93.5%) and mitochondrial (decrease by 97.7%) ecDNA sequence. In conclusion, in this first study focusing on the technical aspects of salivary ecDNA quantitation, we show that, regardless of its subcellular origin, the concentration of ecDNA in saliva is mainly affected by additional centrifugation and not by the freezing of centrifuged cell-free saliva samples. This suggests that most salivary ecDNA likely is associated with cell debris and apoptotic bodies. Which fraction is affected by a particular disease should be the focus of further targeted studies.",1.13229572864685e-28

Efforts to better understand the biological origins and outcomes of lung cancer in terms of this enormous variability often require of high-throughput experimental techniques paired with advanced data analytics. Anticipated advancements in multi-omic methodologies hold potential to reveal a broader molecular perspective of these tumors. This study introduces a theoretical and computational framework for generating network models depicting regulatory constraints on biological functions in a semi-automated way. The approach successfully identifies enriched functions in analyzed omics data, focusing on Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC, a type of NSCLC) in the lung. Valuable information about novel regulatory characteristics, supported by robust biological reasoning, is illustrated, for instance by considering the role of genes, miRNAs and CpG sites associated with NSCLC, both novel and previously reported. Utilizing multi-omic regulatory networks, we constructed robust models elucidating omics data interconnectedness, enabling systematic generation of mechanistic hypotheses.

Transcriptomic profiles of cancer cell lines are typically used for drug response prediction, but we hypothesize that proteomics or phosphoproteomics might be more suitable as they give a more direct insight into cellular processes. However, there has not yet been a systematic comparison between all three of these datatypes using consistent evaluation criteria.Due to the limited number of cell lines with phosphoproteomics profiles we use learning curves, a plot of predictive performance as a function of dataset size, to compare the current performance and predict the future performance of the three omics datasets with more data. We use neural networks and XGBoost and compare them against a simple rule-based benchmark. We show that phosphoproteomics slightly outperforms RNA-seq and proteomics using the 38 cell lines with profiles of all three omics data types. Furthermore, using the 877 cell lines with proteomics and RNA-seq profiles, we show that RNA-seq slightly outperforms proteomics. With the learning curves we predict that the mean squared error using the phosphoproteomics dataset would decrease by∼15%if a dataset of the same size as the proteomics/transcriptomics was collected. For the cell lines with proteomics and RNA-seq profiles the learning curves reveal that for smaller dataset sizes neural networks outperform XGBoost andvice versafor larger datasets. Furthermore, the trajectory of the XGBoost curve suggests that it will improve faster than the neural networks as more data are collected.See https://github.com/Nik-BB/Learning-curves-for-DRP for the code used.© The Author(s) 2023.

Databases including Embase, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang Data, VIP, and SINOMED were comprehensively searched for identifying studies published from 1977 to 19 May 2023. Model development studies specifically designed for assessing the occurrence of MACE after PCI with or without external validation were included. Bias and transparency were evaluated by the Prediction Model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) and Transparent Reporting of a multivariate Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement. The key findings were narratively summarized and presented in tables.A total of 5,234 articles were retrieved, and after thorough screening, 23 studies that met the predefined inclusion criteria were ultimately included. The models were mainly constructed using data from individuals diagnosed with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The discrimination of the models, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC) or C-index, varied between 0.638 and 0.96. The commonly used predictor variables include LVEF, age, Killip classification, diabetes, and various others. All models were determined to have a high risk of bias, and their adherence to the TRIPOD items was reported to be over 60%.The existing models show some predictive ability, but all have a high risk of bias due to methodological shortcomings.

Noncoding mutations that perturb cis-regulatory elements (CREs) likely contribute to the remaining cases, but their identification has been problematic. Using a lentiviral massively parallel reporter assay (lentiMPRA) in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), we functionally evaluated 6,590 noncoding de novo variants (ncDNVs) prioritized from the whole-genome sequencing of 750 CHD trios. A total of 403 ncDNVs substantially affected cardiac CRE activity. A majority increased enhancer activity, often at regions with undetectable reference sequence activity. Of ten DNVs tested by introduction into their native genomic context, four altered the expression of neighboring genes and iPSC-CM transcriptional state. To prioritize future DNVs for functional testing, we used the MPRA data to develop a regression model, EpiCard. Analysis of an independent CHD cohort by EpiCard found enrichment of DNVs. Together, we developed a scalable system to measure the effect of ncDNVs on CRE activity and deployed it to systematically assess the contribution of ncDNVs to CHD.© 2024.

Using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis, this study explored associations between genetically predicted levels of 173 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 25 in the brain with 14 neuropsychiatric disorders and risk factors. Follow-up analyses assessed consistency across plasma protein levels and gene expression in various brain regions. Proteins were instrumented using tissue-specific genetic variants, and colocalization analysis confirmed unbiased gene variants. Consistent MR and colocalization evidence revealed that lower cortical expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 8, coupled higher abundance in the CSF and plasma, associated with lower fluid intelligence scores and decreased bipolar disorder risk. Additionally, elevated apolipoprotein-E2 and hepatocyte growth factor-like protein in the CSF and brain were related to reduced leisure screen time and lower odds of physical activity, respectively. Furthermore, elevated CSF soluble tyrosine-protein kinase receptor 1 level increased liability to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia alongside lower fluid intelligence scores. This research provides genetic evidence supporting novel tissue-specific proteomic targets for neuropsychiatric disorders and their risk factors.

The mechanisms underlying the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation are well understood thanks to decades of research using DNA methylation mutants, primarily in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accession Columbia-0 (Col-0). Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using the methylomes of natural accessions have uncovered a complex and distinct genetic basis of variation in DNA methylation at the population level. Sequencing following bisulfite treatment has served as an excellent method for quantifying DNA methylation. Unlike studies focusing on specific accessions with reference genomes, population-scale methylome research often requires an additional round of sequencing beyond obtaining genome assemblies or genetic variations from whole genome sequencing data, which can be cost prohibitive. Here, we provide an overview of recently developed bisulfite-free methods for quantifying methylation and cost-effective approaches for the simultaneous detection of genetic and epigenetic information. We also discuss the plasticity of DNA methylation in a specific Arabidopsis accession, the contribution of DNA methylation to plant adaptation, and the genetic determinants of variation in DNA methylation in natural populations.

Taken together, blood-based screening for HPV+OPSCC may be feasible years prior to diagnosis.We developed an HPV whole genome sequencing assay, HPV-DeepSeek, with 99% sensitivity and specificity at clinical diagnosis. 28 plasma samples from HPV+OPSCC patients collected 1.3-10.8 years prior to diagnosis along with 1:1 age and gender-matched controls were run on HPV-DeepSeek and an HPV serology assay.22/28 (79%) of cases and 0/28 controls screened positive for HPV+OPSCC with 100% detection within four years of diagnosis and a maximum lead time of 7.8 years.

38187771,"DNA-sequence and epigenomic determinants of local rates of transcription elongation.","bioRxiv","Across all branches of life, transcription elongation is a crucial, regulated phase in gene expression. Many recent studies in eukaryotes have focused on the regulation of promoter-proximal pausing of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II), but rates of productive elongation also vary substantially throughout the gene body, both within and across genes. Here, we introduce a probabilistic model for systematically evaluating potential determinants of the local elongation rate based on nascent RNA sequencing (NRS) data. Our model is derived from a unified model for both the kinetics of Pol II movement along the DNA template and the generation of NRS read counts at steady state. It allows for a continuously variable elongation rate along the gene body, with the rate at each nucleotide defined by a generalized linear relationship with nearby genomic and epigenomic features. High-dimensional feature vectors are accommodated through a sparse-regression extension. We show with simulations that the model allows accurate detection of associated features and accurate prediction of local elongation rates. In an analysis of public PRO-seq and epigenomic data, we identify several features that are strongly associated with reductions in the local elongation rate, including DNA methylation, splice sites, RNA stem-loops, CTCF binding sites, and several histone marks, including H3K36me3 and H4K20me1. By contrast, low-complexity sequences and H3K79me2 marks are associated with increases in elongation rate. In an analysis of DNAk-mers, we find that cytosine nucleotides are strongly associated with reductions in local elongation rate, particularly when preceded by guanines and followed by adenines or thymines. Increases in elongation rate are associated with thymines and A+T-richk-mers. These associations are generally shared across cell types, and by considering them our model is effective at predicting features of held-out PRO-seq data. Overall, our analysis is the first to permit genome-wide predictions of relative nucleotide-specific elongation rates based on complex sets of genomic and epigenomic covariates. We have made predictions available for the K562, CD14+, MCF-7, and HeLa-S3 cell types in a UCSC Genome Browser track.",7.52554465881124e-29

Although the phases of cellular reprogramming are well characterized, details of the rejuvenation processes are poorly defined. To understand whether cellular reprogramming can ameliorate DNA damage, we created a reprogrammable accelerated aging mouse model with an ERCC1 mutation. Importantly, using enhanced partial reprogramming by combining small molecules with the Yamanaka factors, we observed potent reversion of DNA damage, significant upregulation of multiple DNA damage repair processes, and restoration of the epigenetic clock.

However, lifestyle factors are often neglected, and few studies have investigated microbiome composition in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.To explore associations between the gut microbiome and schizophrenia diagnosis, treatment resistance, clozapine response, and treatment-related adverse effects while adjusting for demographic and lifestyle factors.In this case-control study of adults aged 20 to 63 years, stool samples and data on demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and medication use were collected and gut microbiome measures obtained using shotgun metagenomics. Participants with a schizophrenia diagnosis were referred through psychiatric inpatient units and outpatient clinics. Data were collected for 4 distinct groups: control individuals without a psychiatric diagnosis (past or present), individuals with treatment-responsive schizophrenia taking nonclozapine antipsychotic medications, clozapine-responsive individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and clozapine-nonresponsive individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Participants were recruited between November 2020 and November 2021. Control individuals were recruited in parallel through posters and online advertisements and matched for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) to the individuals with schizophrenia. Participants were excluded if taking antibiotics in the past 2 months, if unable to communicate in English or otherwise follow study instructions, were pregnant or planning to become pregnant, or had any concomitant disease or condition making them unsuited to the study per investigator assessment.

Significant microbiome associations with schizophrenia were observed at multiple taxonomic and functional levels (eg, common species: b2, 30%; SE, 13%; adjusted P = .002) and treatment resistance (eg, common species: b2, 27%; SE, 16%; adjusted P = .03). In contrast, limited evidence was found for microbiome associations with clozapine response, constipation, or metabolic syndrome. Significantly decreased microbial richness was found in individuals with schizophrenia compared to control individuals (t95 = 4.25; P < .001; mean [SD] for control individuals, 151.8 [32.31]; mean [SD] for individuals with schizophrenia, 117.00 [36.2]; 95% CI, 18.6-51.0), which remained significant after a covariate and multiple comparison correction. However, limited evidence was found for differences in β diversity (weighted UniFrac) for schizophrenia diagnosis (permutational multivariate analysis of variance [PERMANOVA]: R2, 0.03; P = .02), treatment resistance (R2, 0.02; P = .18), or clozapine response (R2, 0.04; P = .08). Multiple differentially abundant bacterial species (19) and metabolic pathways (162) were found in individuals with schizophrenia, which were primarily associated with treatment resistance and clozapine exposure.The findings in this study are consistent with the idea that clozapine induces alterations to gut microbiome composition, although the possibility that preexisting microbiome differences contribute to treatment resistance cannot be ruled out. These findings suggest that prior reports of microbiome alterations in individuals with chronic schizophrenia may be due to medication or lifestyle factors and that future studies should incorporate these variables in their design and interpretation.",6.9103734278943e-29

However, in-depth information, such as data on epigenetic changes, is rarely acquired. Germ cells develop in close contact with supporting somatic cells during gametogenesis in vertebrates, and we hypothesize that the recipient's gonadal environment may cause epigenetic changes in produced gametes and progeny. Here, we extensively characterize the DNA methylome of donor-derived sperm and their intergenerational effects in both inter- and intraspecific surrogates.We found more than 3000 differentially methylated regions in both the sperm and progeny derived from inter- and intraspecific surrogates. Hypermethylation in the promoter regions of the protocadherin gamma gene in the intraspecific surrogates was found to be associated with germline transmission. On the contrary, gene expression level and the embryonic development of the offspring remained unaffected. We also discovered MAPK/p53 pathway disruption in interspecific surrogates due to promoter hypermethylation and identified that the inefficient removal of meiotic-arrested endogenous germ cells in hybrid gonads led to the production of infertile spermatozoa.Donor-derived sperm and progeny from inter- and intraspecific surrogates were more globally hypermethylated than those of the donors.

Given the known epigenetic regulation of critical SCLC transcriptional programs, we hypothesized that subtype-specific patterns of DNA methylation could be detected in tumor or blood from SCLC patients. Using genomic-wide reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) in two cohorts totaling 179 SCLC patients and using machine learning approaches, we report a highly accurate DNA methylation-based classifier (SCLC-DMC) that can distinguish SCLC subtypes. We further adjust the classifier for circulating-free DNA (cfDNA) to subtype SCLC from plasma. Using the cfDNA classifier (cfDMC), we demonstrate that SCLC phenotypes can evolve during disease progression, highlighting the need for longitudinal tracking of SCLC during clinical treatment. These data establish that tumor and cfDNA methylation can be used to identify SCLC subtypes and might guide precision SCLC therapy.Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Researchers have proposed different configurations of machine learning models for processing genomic sequences, and each of these models varies in terms of their performance & applicability characteristics. Models that use bioinspired optimizations are generally slower, but have superior incremental-performance, while models that use one-shot learning achieve higher instantaneous accuracy but cannot be scaled for larger disease-sets. Due to such variations, it is difficult for genomic system designers to identify optimum models for their application-specific & performance-specific use cases. To overcome this issue, a detailed survey of different genomic processing models in terms of their functional nuances, application-specific advantages, deployment-specific limitations, and contextual future scopes is discussed in this text. Based on this discussion, researchers will be able to identify optimal models for their functional use cases.

38370750,"Global diversity, recurrent evolution, and recent selection on amylase structural haplotypes in humans.","bioRxiv","The adoption of agriculture, first documented ~12,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, triggered a rapid shift toward starch-rich diets in human populations. Amylase genes facilitate starch digestion and increased salivary amylase copy number has been observed in some modern human populations with high starch intake, though evidence of recent selection is lacking. Here, using 52 long-read diploid assemblies and short read data from ~5,600 contemporary and ancient humans, we resolve the diversity, evolutionary history, and selective impact of structural variation at the amylase locus. We find that both salivary and pancreatic amylase genes have higher copy numbers in populations with agricultural subsistence compared to fishing, hunting, and pastoral groups. We identify 28 distinct amylase structural architectures and demonstrate that identical structures have arisen independently multiple times throughout recent human history. Using a pangenome graph-based approach to infer structural haplotypes across thousands of humans, we identify extensively duplicated haplotypes present at higher frequencies in modern agricultural populations. Leveraging 534 ancient human genomes we find that duplication-containing haplotypes have increased in frequency more than seven-fold over the last 12,000 years providing evidence for recent selection in Eurasians at this locus comparable in magnitude to that at lactase. Together, our study highlights the strong impact of the agricultural revolution on human genomes and the importance of long-read sequencing in identifying signatures of selection at structurally complex loci.",5.86234496051196e-29
38161361,"Whole-Genome Sequencing of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine at Base Resolution by Bisulfite-Free Single-Step Deamination with Engineered Cytosine Deaminase.","ACS Cent Sci","The epigenetic modification 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) plays a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression. Although some methods have been developed to detect 5hmC, direct genome-wide mapping of 5hmC at base resolution is still highly desirable. Herein, we proposed a single-step deamination sequencing (SSD-seq) method, designed to precisely map 5hmC across the genome at single-base resolution. SSD-seq takes advantage of a screened engineered human apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3A (A3A) protein, known as eA3A-v10, to selectively deaminate cytosine (C) and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) but not 5hmC. During sequencing, the deaminated C and 5mC are converted to uracil (U) and thymine (T), read as T in the sequencing data. However, 5hmC remains unaffected by eA3A-v10 and is read as C during sequencing. Consequently, the presence of C in the sequence reads indicates the original 5hmC. We applied SSD-seq to generate a base-resolution map of 5hmC in human lung tissue. Our findings revealed that 5hmC was predominantly localized to CpG dinucleotides. Furthermore, the base-resolution map of 5hmC generated by SSD-seq demonstrated a strong correlation with prior ACE-seq results. The advantages of SSD-seq are its single-step process, absence of bisulfite treatment or DNA glycosylation, cost effectiveness, and ability to detect and quantify 5hmC directly at single-base resolution.© 2023 The Authors.

38168841,"SilenceREIN: seeking silencers on anchors of chromatin loops by deep graph neural networks.","Brief Bioinform","Silencers are repressive cis-regulatory elements that play crucial roles in transcriptional regulation. Experimental methods for identifying silencers are always costly and time-consuming. Computational methods, which relies on genomic sequence features, have been introduced as alternative approaches. However, silencers do not have significant epigenomic signature. Therefore, we explore a new way to computationally identify silencers, by incorporating chromatin structural information. We propose the SilenceREIN method, which focuses on finding silencers on anchors of chromatin loops. By using graph neural networks, we extracted chromatin structural information from a regulatory element interaction network. SilenceREIN integrated the chromatin structural information with linear genomic signatures to find silencers. The predictive performance of SilenceREIN is comparable or better than other states-of-the-art methods. We performed a genome-wide scanning to systematically find silencers in human genome. Results suggest that silencers are widespread on anchors of chromatin loops. In addition, enrichment analysis of transcription factor binding motif support our prediction results. As far as we can tell, this is the first attempt to incorporate chromatin structural information in finding silencers.

38309261,"Locus-level L1 DNA methylation profiling reveals the epigenetic and transcriptional interplay between L1s and their integration sites.","Cell Genom","Long interspersed element 1 (L1) retrotransposons are implicated in human disease and evolution. Their global activity is repressed by DNA methylation, but deciphering the regulation of individual copies has been challenging. Here, we combine short- and long-read sequencing to unveil L1 methylation heterogeneity across cell types, families, and individual loci and elucidate key principles involved. We find that the youngest primate L1 families are specifically hypomethylated in pluripotent stem cells and the placenta but not in most tumors. Locally, intronic L1 methylation is intimately associated with gene transcription. Conversely, the L1 methylation state can propagate to the proximal region up to 300 bp. This phenomenon is accompanied by the binding of specific transcription factors, which drive the expression of L1 and chimeric transcripts. Finally, L1 hypomethylation alone is typically insufficient to trigger L1 expression due to redundant silencing pathways. Our results illuminate the epigenetic and transcriptional interplay between retrotransposons and their host genome.Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

38262408,"DNA-guided transcription factor cooperativity shapes face and limb mesenchyme.","Cell","Transcription factors (TFs) can define distinct cellular identities despite nearly identical DNA-binding specificities. One mechanism for achieving regulatory specificity is DNA-guided TF cooperativity. Although in vitro studies suggest that it may be common, examples of such cooperativity remain scarce in cellular contexts. Here, we demonstrate how ""Coordinator,"" a long DNA motif composed of common motifs bound by many basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and homeodomain (HD) TFs, uniquely defines the regulatory regions of embryonic face and limb mesenchyme. Coordinator guides cooperative and selective binding between the bHLH family mesenchymal regulator TWIST1 and a collective of HD factors associated with regional identities in the face and limb. TWIST1 is required for HD binding and open chromatin at Coordinator sites, whereas HD factors stabilize TWIST1 occupancy at Coordinator and titrate it away from HD-independent sites. This cooperativity results in the shared regulation of genes involved in cell-type and positional identities and ultimately shapes facial morphology and evolution.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

However, a fraction of injured proximal tubule cells fails to undergo normal repair and assumes a proinflammatory and profibrotic phenotype that may promote fibrosis and chronic kidney disease. The healthy to failed repair change is marked by cell state-specific transcriptomic and epigenomic changes. Single nucleus joint RNA- and ATAC-seq sequencing offers an opportunity to study the gene regulatory networks underpinning these changes in order to identify key regulatory drivers. We develop a regularized regression approach to construct genome-wide parametric gene regulatory networks using multiomic datasets. We generate a single nucleus multiomic dataset from seven adult human kidney samples and apply our method to study drivers of a failed injury response associated with kidney disease. We demonstrate that our approach is a highly effective tool for predicting key cis- and trans-regulatory elements underpinning the healthy to failed repair transition and use it to identify NFAT5 as a driver of the maladaptive proximal tubule state.© 2024.

In the study, a total of 135 mutation-driven enhancers, which displayed significant chromatin accessibility changes, were identified as candidate risk factors for breast cancer (BRCA). Furthermore, we identified four mutation-driven enhancers as independent prognostic factors for BRCA subtypes. In Her2 subtype, enhancer G > C mutation was associated with poorer prognosis through influencing its potential target genes FBXW9, TRIR, and WDR83. We identified aminoglutethimide and quinpirole as candidate drugs targeting the mutated enhancer. In normal subtype, enhancer G > A mutation was associated with poorer prognosis through influencing its target genes ALOX15B, LINC00324, and MPDU1. We identified eight candidate drugs such as erastin, colforsin, and STOCK1N-35874 targeting the mutated enhancer. Our findings suggest that somatic mutations contribute to breast cancer subtype progression by altering enhancer activity, which could be potential candidates for cancer therapy.© 2024 The Author(s).",4.04873276076297e-29

Deconvolution is a methodology for estimating the immune cell proportions from the transcriptome, and it is mainly applied to blood-derived samples and tumor tissues. However, the influence of tissue-specific modeling on the estimation results has rarely been investigated. Here, we constructed a system to evaluate the performance of the deconvolution method on liver transcriptome data. We prepared seven mouse liver injury models using small-molecule compounds and established a benchmark dataset with corresponding liver bulk RNA-Seq and immune cell proportions. RNA-Seq expression for nine leukocyte subsets and four liver-associated cell types were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus to provide a reference. We found that the combination of reference cell sets affects the estimation results of reference-based deconvolution methods and established a liver-specific deconvolution by optimizing the reference cell set for each cell to be estimated. We applied this model to independent datasets and showed that liver-specific modeling is highly extrapolatable. We expect that this approach will enable sophisticated estimation from rich tissue data accumulated in public databases and to obtain information on aggregated immune cell trafficking.© The Author(s) 2024.

The purpose of this article is to describe a novel technique of volar scaphotrapeziotrapezoid (STT) reconstruction which may be used to augment rotational control of the scaphoid, in conjunction with the ADCLR, for use in European Wrist Arthroscopy Society (EWAS) grade IV/V instabilities.Description of Technique Following completion of ADCLR, the STT joint is approached through the flexor carpi radialis sheath. The palmaris longus tendon is harvested. Fluoroscopy is used to site guide wires for tunnel placement in the distal scaphoid and the proximal trapezium; 3.5-mm tunnels are overdrilled in both bones, to a depth of 8 mm. The palmaris graft is then anchored in the scaphoid tunnel with a mini-DX SwiveLock anchor. The graft is tensioned, then anchored in the trapezium tunnel with another anchor.Patients and Methods We retrospectively selected two young men heavy manual workers who had this procedure more than 12 months previously for scapholunate instability, with static radiographic abnormalities and a drive through sign (EWAS grade V). The patients were reviewed after 12 months, for assessment of visual analog scale, quick disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand, and patient-rated wrist/hand evaluation scores, range of motion, and grip strength.Results Both patients had marked improvements of wrist comfort and function at 1 year, and were able to return to their normal duties at work and complete all activities of daily living with minimal symptoms.Conclusion This volar STT reconstruction may expand the success of the Mathoulin's ADCLR into higher grade instabilities.Thieme.

Many existing approaches rely on discretizing the data into clusters for differential gene expression (DGE), effectively ironing out any information unveiled by the single-cell variability across cell-types. In addition, DGE often assumes a statistical distribution that, if erroneous, can lead to false positive differentially expressed genes. Here, we present Cellograph: a semi-supervised framework that uses graph neural networks to quantify the effects of perturbations at single-cell granularity. Cellograph not only measures how prototypical cells are of each condition but also learns a latent space that is amenable to interpretable data visualization and clustering. The learned gene weight matrix from training reveals pertinent genes driving the differences between conditions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on publicly-available datasets including cancer drug therapy, stem cell reprogramming, and organoid differentiation. Cellograph outperforms existing methods for quantifying the effects of experimental perturbations and offers a novel framework to analyze single-cell data using deep learning.© 2024.

Consequences of TBI are associated with various alterations in the brain but little is known about long-term changes of epigenetic DNA methylation patterns. Moreover, nothing is known about potential treatments that can alter these epigenetic changes in beneficial ways. Therefore, we have examined myo-inositol (MI), which has positive effects on several pathological conditions.TBI was induced in mice by controlled cortical impact (CCI). One group of CCI animals received saline injections for two months (TBI+SAL), another CCI group received MI treatment (TBI+MI) for the same period and one group served as a sham-operated control. Mice were sacrificed 4 months after CCI and changes in DNA methylome and transcriptomes were examined.For the first time we: (i) provide comprehensive map of long-term DNA methylation changes after CCI in the hippocampus; (ii) identify differences by methylation sites between the groups; (iii) characterize transcriptome changes; (iv) provide association between DNA methylation sites and gene expression. MI treatment is linked with upregulation of genes covering 33 biological processes, involved in immune response and inflammation. In support of these findings, we have shown that expression of BATF2, a transcription factor involved in immune-regulatory networks, is upregulated in the hippocampus of the TBI+MI group where the BATF2 gene is demethylated.TBI is followed by long-term epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in hippocampus.

38265251,"The predictive capacity of polygenic risk scores for disease risk is only moderately influenced by imputation panels tailored to the target population.","Bioinformatics","Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) predict individuals' genetic risk of developing complex diseases. They summarize the effect of many variants discovered in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). However, to date, large GWASs exist primarily for the European population and the quality of PRS prediction declines when applied to other ethnicities. Genetic profiling of individuals in the discovery set (on which the GWAS was performed) and target set (on which the PRS is applied) is typically done by SNP arrays that genotype a fraction of common SNPs. Therefore, a key step in GWAS analysis and PRS calculation is imputing untyped SNPs using a panel of fully sequenced individuals. The imputation results depend on the ethnic composition of the imputation panel. Imputing genotypes with a panel of individuals of the same ethnicity as the genotyped individuals typically improves imputation accuracy. However, there has been no systematic investigation into the influence of the ethnic composition of imputation panels on the accuracy of PRS predictions when applied to ethnic groups that differ from the population used in the GWAS.We estimated the effect of imputation of the target set on prediction accuracy of PRS when the discovery and the target sets come from different ethnic groups. We analyzed binary phenotypes on ethnically distinct sets from the UK Biobank and other resources. We generated ethnically homogenous panels, imputed the target sets, and generated PRSs. Then, we assessed the prediction accuracy obtained from each imputation panel. Our analysis indicates that using an imputation panel matched to the ethnicity of the target population yields only a marginal improvement and only under specific conditions.The source code used for executing the analyses is this paper is available at https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/PRS-imputation-panels.© The Author(s) 2024.

Using a rodent TLE model induced by Kainic acid (KA), we investigated the impact of a single bout of exercise (i.e., acute) or 4 weeks of aerobic exercise (i.e., chronic). Blood was processed for epilepsy-associated serum markers, and DNA methylation (DNAme), and hippocampal area CA3 was assessed for gene expression levels for DNAme-associated enzymes. While acute aerobic exercise did not alter serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) or Interleukin-6 (IL-6), chronic exercise resulted in an exercise-specific decrease in serum BDNF and an increase in serum IL-6 levels in epileptic rats. Additionally, whole blood DNAme levels, specifically 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), decreased in epileptic animals following chronic exercise. Hippocampal CA3 5-hmC levels and ten-eleven translocation protein (TET1) expression mirrored these changes. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that most 5-hmC changes in response to chronic exercise were neuron-specific within area CA3 of the hippocampus.

We predicted target genes at GWAS signals by integrating them with molecular quantitative trait loci for liver gene expression (eQTL) and liver chromatin accessibility QTL (caQTL). We predicted specific regulatory caQTL variants at four GWAS signals located near EFHD1, LITAF, ZNF329, and GPR180. Using transcriptional reporter assays, we determined that caQTL variants rs13395911, rs11644920, rs34003091, and rs9556404 exhibit allelic differences in regulatory activity. We also performed a protein binding assay for rs13395911 and found that FOXA2 differentially interacts with the alleles of rs13395911. For variants rs13395911 and rs11644920 in putative enhancer regulatory elements, we used CRISPRi to demonstrate that repression of the enhancers altered the expression of the predicted target and/or nearby genes. Repression of the element at rs13395911 reduced the expression of EFHD1, and repression of the element at rs11644920 reduced the expression of LITAF, SNN, and TXNDC11. Finally, we showed that EFHD1 is a metabolically active gene in HepG2 cells.

Developing highly sensitive screening techniques for liquid biopsy samples is particularly beneficial, as it enables the early detection and molecular characterization of tumors with minimally invasive samples.We examined CSF and plasma samples from patients with pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) using custom multiplexed droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) assays based on whole genome sequencing data. These assays included a screening test to analyzeBRAFduplication and a targeted assay for the detection of patient-specificKIAA1549::BRAFfusion junction sequences or single nucleotide variants.Our findings revealed that 5 out of 13 individual cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples tested positive for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Among these cases, 3 exhibited theKIAA1549::BRAFfusion, which was detected through copy number variation (CNV) analysis (n= 1) or a fusion-specific probe (n= 2), while 1 case each displayed theBRAFV600E mutation and theFGFR1N577K mutation. Additionally, a quantitative analysis of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) concentrations in PA CSF samples showed that most cases had low cfDNA levels, below the limit of detection of our assay (<1.9 ng).While CNV analysis of CSF samples from LGGs still has some limitations, it has the potential to serve as a valuable complementary tool.

38259344,"Prediction of causal genes at GWAS loci with pleiotropic gene regulatory effects using sets of correlated instrumental variables.","ArXiv","Multivariate Mendelian randomization (MVMR) is a statistical technique that uses sets of genetic instruments to estimate the direct causal effects of multiple exposures on an outcome of interest. At genomic loci with pleiotropic gene regulatory effects, that is, loci where the same genetic variants are associated to multiple nearby genes, MVMR can potentially be used to predict candidate causal genes. However, consensus in the field dictates that the genetic instruments in MVMR must be independent (not in linkage disequilibrium), which is usually not possible when considering a group of candidate genes from the same locus. Here we used causal inference theory to show that MVMR with correlated instruments satisfies the instrumental set condition. This is a classical result by Brito and Pearl (2002) for structural equation models that guarantees the identifiability of individual causal effects in situations where multiple exposures collectively, but not individually, separate a set of instrumental variables from an outcome variable. Extensive simulations confirmed the validity and usefulness of these theoretical results even at modest sample sizes(n≳500 -1000). Importantly, the causal effect estimates remain unbiased and their variance small when instruments are highly correlated. We applied MVMR with correlated instrumental variable sets at genome-wide significant loci for coronary artery disease (CAD) risk using expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) data from seven vascular and metabolic tissues in the STARNET study. Our method predicts causal genes at twelve loci, each associated with multiple colocated genes in multiple tissues. We confirm causal roles forPHACTR1andADAMTS7in arterial tissues, among others. However, the extensive degree of regulatory pleiotropy across tissues and the limited number of causal variants in each locus still require that MVMR is run on a tissue-by-tissue basis, and testing all gene-tissue pairs withcis-eQTL associations at a given locus in a single model to predict causal gene-tissue combinations remains infeasible. Our results show that within tissues, MVMR with dependent, as opposed to independent, sets of instrumental variables significantly expands the scope for predicting causal genes in disease risk loci with pleiotropic regulatory effects. However, considering risk loci with regulatory pleiotropy that also spans across tissues remains an unsolved problem.",1.83989513473203e-29

In this work, we sequenced the genomes of threeC. linistrains of high (#390-1), medium (#757), and low (#771) virulence. We obtained more than 100× genome coverage with Oxford Nanopore Technologies reads (N50 = 12.1, 6.1, 5.0 kb) and more than 50× genome coverage with Illumina data (150 + 150 bp). Several assembly strategies were tested. The final assemblies were obtained using the Canu-Racon ×2-Medaka-Polca scheme. The assembled genomes had a size of 54.0-55.3 Mb, 26-32 contigs, N50 values > 5 Mb, and BUSCO completeness > 96%. A comparative genomic analysis showed high similarity among mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. However, a rearrangement event and the loss of a 0.7 Mb contig were revealed. After genome annotation with Funannotate, secreting proteins were selected using SignalP, and candidate effectors were predicted among them using EffectorP. The analysis of the InterPro annotations of predicted effectors revealed unique protein categories in each strain. The assembled genomes and the conducted comparative analysis extend the knowledge of the genetic diversity ofC. liniand form the basis for establishing the molecular mechanisms of its pathogenicity.",1.72500697262765e-29
38401029,"DNA Methylation Signatures Correlate with Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Metastatic Melanoma.","Target Oncol","DNA methylation profiles have emerged as potential predictors of therapeutic response in various solid tumors.This study aimed to analyze the DNA methylation profiles of patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma undergoing first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment and evaluate their correlation with a radiological response according to immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST).A total of 81 tissue samples from 71 patients with metastatic melanoma (27 female, 44 male) were included in this study. We utilized Illumina Methylation EPIC Beadchips to retrieve their genome-wide methylation profile by interrogating >850,000 CpG sites. Clustering based on the 500 most differentially methylated genes was conducted to identify distinct methylation patterns associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor response. Results were further aligned with an independent, previously published data set.The median progression-free survival was 8.5 months (range: 0-104.1 months), and the median overall survival was 30.6 months (range: 0-104.1 months). Objective responses were observed in 29 patients (40.8%). DNA methylation profiling revealed specific signatures that correlated with radiological response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Three distinct clusters were identified based on the methylation patterns of the 500 most differentially methylated genes. Cluster 1 (12/12) and cluster 2 (12/24) exhibited a higher proportion of responders, while cluster 3 (39/45) predominantly consisted of non-responders. In the validation data set, responders also showed more frequent hypomethylation although differences in the data sets limit the interpretation.These findings suggest that DNA methylation profiling of tumor tissues might serve as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor response in patients with metastatic melanoma. Further validation studies are warranted to confirm the efficiency of DNA methylation profiling as a predictive tool in the context of immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma.© 2024.

The current study used the Mendelian randomization (MR) technique to evaluate the possible causal relationship between Gal-3 and PAD.Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of Gal-3 and PAD were obtained through the MR-Base platform. Then, using Gal-3 as the exposure and PAD as the outcome, a two-sample MR analysis was performed utilizing several regression techniques, including MR-Egger regression, inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and weighted mode.Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified and designated as instrumental variables (IVs) that exhibited significant correlations with Gal-3 (linkage disequilibriumr2 < 0.001;P < 5 × 10-8). Various statistical methods showed that there was an absence of a significant link between Gal-3 and PAD (IVW: odds ratio (OR) = 0.9869, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8792-1.1078,P = 0.8232). In addition, the presence of genetic pleiotropy did impact the putative causal relationship between PAD and Gal-3 (MR-Egger intercept = 0.0099,P = 0.659).There is no current evidence to establish a causal relationship between the level of Gal-3 in circulation and PAD.© 2024 Gou, Chen, Zhu and Cui.",1.36757912826929e-29
38310164,NA,NA,"The rich chemical information from tissue metabolomics provides a powerful means to elaborate tissue physiology or tumor characteristics at cellular and tumor microenvironment levels. However, the process of obtaining such information requires invasive biopsies, is costly, and can delay clinical patient management. Conversely, computed tomography (CT) is a clinical standard of care but does not intuitively harbor histological or prognostic information. Furthermore, the ability to embed metabolome information into CT to subsequently use the learned representation for classification or prognosis has yet to be described. This study develops a deep learning-based framework -- tissue-metabolomic-radiomic-CT (TMR-CT) by combining 48 paired CT images and tumor/normal tissue metabolite intensities to generate ten image embeddings to infer metabolite-derived representation from CT alone. In clinical NSCLC settings, we ascertain whether TMR-CT results in an enhanced feature generation model solving histology classification/prognosis tasks in an unseen international CT dataset of 742 patients. TMR-CT non-invasively determines histological classes - adenocarcinoma/squamous cell carcinoma with an F1-score = 0.78 and further asserts patients' prognosis with a c-index = 0.72, surpassing the performance of radiomics models and deep learning on single modality CT feature extraction.

Although genomic alternations have been widely used in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis, studies on cell-based genomic alternations profiling for CTC detection are rare due to major technical limitations in single-cell whole genome sequencing (WGS) including low throughput, low accuracy and high cost. We report a single-cell low-pass WGS-based protocol (scMet-Seq) for sensitive and accurate CTC detection by combining a metabolic function-associated marker Hexokinase 2 (HK2) and a Tn5 transposome-based WGS method with improved cell fixation strategy. To explore the clinical use, scMet-Seq has been investigated with blood and non-blood body fluids in diagnosing metastatic diseases, including ascites-based diagnosis of malignant ascites (MA) and blood-based diagnosis of metastatic small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). ScMet-Seq shows high diagnostic sensitivity (MA: 79% in >10 cancer types; metastatic SCLC: 90%) and ~100% of diagnostic specificity and positive predictive value, superior to clinical cytology that exhibits diagnostic sensitivity of 52% in MA diagnosis and could not generate blood-based diagnosis.

To enhance the progress in this field, a spectrum of computational methodologies has been cultivated. AlphaFold2 has exhibited exceptional precision in predicting wild-type protein structures, with performance exceeding that of other methods. However, predicting the structures of missense mutant proteins using AlphaFold2 remains challenging due to the intricate and substantial structural alterations caused by minor sequence variations in the mutant proteins. Molecular dynamics (MD) has been validated for precisely capturing changes in amino acid interactions attributed to protein mutations. Therefore, for the first time, a strategy entitled 'MoDAFold' was proposed to improve the accuracy and reliability of missense mutant protein structure prediction by combining AlphaFold2 with MD. Multiple case studies have confirmed the superior performance of MoDAFold compared to other methods, particularly AlphaFold2.© The Author(s) 2024.

Dysfunctions of the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN) and frontoparietal network (FPN) are critical neural characteristics of MDD, however, the potential moderating role of sex on resting-state network dynamics in MDD has not been sufficiently evaluated. Thus, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 138 unmedicated patients with first-episode MDD (55 males) and 243 healthy controls (HCs; 106 males). Recurring functional network co-activation patterns (CAPs) were extracted, and time spent in each CAP (the total amount of volumes associated to a CAP), persistence (the average number of consecutive volumes linked to a CAP), and transitions across CAPs involving the SN, DMN and FPN were quantified. Relative to HCs, MDD patients exhibited greater persistence in a CAP involving activation of the DMN and deactivation of the FPN (DMN + FPN-). In addition, relative to the sex-matched HCs, the male MDD group spent more time in two CAPs involving the SN and DMN (i.e., DMN + SN- and DMN-SN + ) and transitioned more frequently from the DMN + FPN- CAP to the DMN + SN- CAP relative to the male HC group. Conversely, the female MDD group showed less persistence in the DMN + SN- CAP relative to the female HC group. Our findings highlight that the imbalance between SN and DMN could be a neurobiological marker supporting sex differences in MDD. Moreover, the dominance of the DMN accompanied by the deactivation of the FPN could be a sex-independent neurobiological correlate related to depression.© 2024.

In doing so, we defined three pathway-derived subtypes (PDS) in CRC: PDS1 tumors, which are canonical/LGR5+stem-rich, highly proliferative and display good prognosis; PDS2 tumors, which are regenerative/ANXA1+stem-rich, with elevated stromal and immune tumor microenvironmental lineages; and PDS3 tumors, which represent a previously overlooked slow-cycling subset of tumors within CMS2 with reduced stem populations and increased differentiated lineages, particularly enterocytes and enteroendocrine cells, yet display the worst prognosis in locally advanced disease.

Nucleosomal engagement through histone and DNA interactions directs UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity toward lysines on histone H3 tails, creating binding sites for DNMT1 through ubiquitin interacting motifs (UIM1 and UIM2). Here, we profile contributions of UHRF1 and DNMT1 to genome-wide DNA methylation inheritance and dissect specific roles for ubiquitin signaling in this process. We reveal DNA methylation maintenance at low-density CpGs is vulnerable to disruption of UHRF1 ubiquitin ligase activity and DNMT1 ubiquitin reading activity through UIM1. Hypomethylation of low-density CpGs in this manner induces formation of partially methylated domains (PMD), a methylation signature observed across human cancers. Furthermore, disrupting DNMT1 UIM2 function abolishes DNA methylation maintenance. Collectively, we show DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation inheritance is a ubiquitin-regulated process and suggest a disrupted UHRF1-DNMT1 ubiquitin signaling axis contributes to the development of PMDs in human cancers.",6.55141894145288e-30

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified 9 independent EoE risk loci reaching genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10-8) and 27 additional loci of suggestive significance (5 × 10-8 < p < 1 × 10-5). In the current study, we perform linkage disequilibrium (LD) expansion of these loci to nominate a set of 531 variants that are potentially causal. To systematically interrogate the gene regulatory activity of these variants, we designed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) containing the alleles of each variant within their genomic sequence context cloned into a GFP reporter library. Analysis of reporter gene expression in TE-7, HaCaT, and Jurkat cells revealed cell-type-specific gene regulation. We identify 32 allelic enhancer variants, representing 6 genome-wide significant EoE loci and 7 suggestive EoE loci, that regulate reporter gene expression in a genotype-dependent manner in at least one cellular context. By annotating these variants with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and chromatin looping data in related tissues and cell types, we identify putative target genes affected by genetic variation in individuals with EoE. Transcription factor enrichment analyses reveal possible roles for cell-type-specific regulators, including GATA3. Our approach reduces the large set of EoE-associated variants to a set of 32 with allelic regulatory activity, providing functional insights into the effects of genetic variation in this disease.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

To investigate if and how gene expression is modulated by social experience at the central level, we analyzed the effects of 5 weeks of social isolation in rats focusing on endocannabinoid system genes transcription in key brain regions involved in emotional control. We observed selective reduction in mRNA levels for fatty acid amide hydrolase (Faah) and cannabinoid receptor type 1 (Cnr1) genes in the amygdala complex and of Cnr1 in the prefrontal cortex of socially isolated rats when compared to controls, and these changes appear to be partially driven by trimethylation of Lysine 27 and acetylation of Lysine 9 at Histone 3. The alterations of Cnr1 transcriptional regulation result also directly correlated with those of oxytocin receptor gene. We here suggest that to counteract the effects of SI, it is of relevance to restore the endocannabinoid system homeostasis via the use of environmental triggers able to revert those epigenetic mechanisms accounting for the alterations observed.© 2024.

However, most promoter DNVs in ASD are not located immediately upstream of known ASD genes. In this study analyzing WGS data of 5,044 ASD probands, 4,095 unaffected siblings, and their parents, we show that promoter DNVs within topologically associating domains (TADs) containing ASD genes are significantly and specifically associated with ASD. An analysis considering TADs as functional units identified specific TADs enriched for promoter DNVs in ASD and indicated that common variants in these regions also confer ASD heritability. Experimental validation using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) showed that likely deleterious promoter DNVs in ASD can influence multiple genes within the same TAD, resulting in overall dysregulation of ASD-associated genes. These results highlight the importance of TADs and gene-regulatory mechanisms in better understanding the genetic architecture of ASD.Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Besides precise substitutions, BEs generate low-frequency 'stochastic' byproducts through unclear mechanisms. Here, we performed in-depth outcome profiling and genetic dissection, revealing that C-to-G BEs (CGBEs) generate substantial amounts of intermediate double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are at the centre of several byproducts. Imperfect DSB end-joining leads to small deletions via end-resection, templated insertions or aberrant transversions during end fill-in. Chromosomal translocations were detected between the editing target and off-targets of Cas9/deaminase origin. Genetic screenings of DNA repair factors disclosed a central role of abasic site processing in DSB formation. Shielding of abasic sites by the suicide enzyme HMCES reduced CGBE-initiated DSBs, providing an effective way to minimize DSB-triggered events without affecting substitutions. This work demonstrates that CGBEs can initiate deleterious intermediate DSBs and therefore require careful consideration for therapeutic applications, and that HMCES-aided CGBEs hold promise as safer tools.© 2024.

Methylation and copy number variation (CNV) of leukocyte RB1 gene were assessed using MS-MLPA probes. In addition, in blood samples, parameters of oxidative stress (ROS, MDA, SOD, and GSH) and inflammation (CRP, WBC, and NBC) were followed.In pre-chemotherapy samples, no CNVs and aberrant methylation of CpG106 promoter region of RB1 gene were detected; however, one patient had hypermethylation (by approximately 10%) of imprinted locus CpG85 in intron 2 of RB1 gene. In addition, a very good correlation of the tumor burden and CRP and tumor burden and GSH was found. The anthracycline-based chemotherapy reverts methylation of RB1 gene-imprinted locus CpG85 to normal level. Moreover, inflammation and oxidative stress parameters such as CRP, WBC, ROS, and MDA were significantly decreased in post-chemotherapy samples.This single-centered study on a cohort of consecutive sarcoma patients indicates that sarcoma patients can have aberrant germline DNA methylation and confirms the relationship of tumor burden with inflammation and oxidative stress.

Here, we leveraged a rare study of surgical intervention in 43 de novo metastatic prostate cancers to assess somatic genotypes across 607 synchronous primary and metastatic tissue regions plus circulating tumor DNA. Intra-prostate heterogeneity was pervasive and impacted clinically relevant genes, resulting in discordant genotypes between select primary restricted regions and synchronous metastases. Additional complexity was driven by polyclonal metastatic seeding from phylogenetically related primary populations. When simulating clinical practice relying on a single tissue region, genomic heterogeneity plus variable tumor fraction across samples caused inaccurate genotyping of dominant disease; however, pooling extracted DNA from multiple biopsy cores before sequencing can rescue misassigned somatic genotypes. Our results define the relationship between synchronous treatment-sensitive primary and metastatic lesions in men with de novo metastatic prostate cancer and provide a framework for implementing genomics-guided patient management.© 2024.

In addition to distinguishing one nucleobase from another, some transcription factors can distinguish between unmodified and modified bases. Current models of transcription factor binding tend not to take DNA modifications into account, while the recent few that do often have limitations. This makes a comprehensive and accurate profiling of transcription factor affinities difficult.Here, we develop methods to identify transcription factor binding sites in modified DNA. Our models expand the standard A/C/G/T DNA alphabet to include cytosine modifications. We develop Cytomod to create modified genomic sequences and we also enhance the MEME Suite, adding the capacity to handle custom alphabets. We adapt the well-established position weight matrix (PWM) model of transcription factor binding affinity to this expanded DNA alphabet. Using these methods, we identify modification-sensitive transcription factor binding motifs. We confirm established binding preferences, such as the preference of ZFP57 and C/EBPβ for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box motifs.Using known binding preferences to tune model parameters, we discover novel modified motifs for a wide array of transcription factors. Finally, we validate our binding preference predictions for OCT4 using cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments across conventional, methylation-, and hydroxymethylation-enriched sequences. Our approach readily extends to other DNA modifications. As more genome-wide single-base resolution modification data becomes available, we expect that our method will yield insights into altered transcription factor binding affinities across many different modifications.© 2023.

DNA methylation, a major modifier of gene expression and stability, is involved in CRC development and outcome.To investigate the correlation betweenHSF4methylation and CRC risk, and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms.Differences in β values ofHSF4methylation loci in multiple malignancies and their correlation withHSF4mRNA expression were analyzed based on Shiny Methylation Analysis Resource Tool.HSF4methylation-related genes were identified by LinkedOmics in CRC, and Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed. Protein-protein interaction network ofHSF4methylation-related genes was constructed by String database and MCODE algorithm.A total of 19 CpG methylation loci were identified inHSF4, and their β values were significantly increased in CRC tissues and exhibited a positive correlation withHSF4mRNA expression. Unfortunately, the prognostic and diagnostic performance of these CpG loci in CRC patients was mediocre. In CRC, there were 1694HSF4methylation-related genes; 1468 of which displayed positive and 226 negative associations, and they were involved in regulating phenotypes such as immune, inflammatory, and metabolic reprogramming.EGFR,RELA,STAT3,FCGR3A,POLR2K, andAXIN1are hub genes among theHSF4methylation-related genes.HSF4 is highly methylated in CRC, but there is no significant correlation between it and the prognosis and diagnosis of CRC.HSF4methylation may serve as one of the ways in which HSF4 mediates the CRC process.©The Author(s) 2023.

Much of these advances in the area of diabetes have been made possible through deep phenotyping of epidemiological cohorts, and analysis of the different omics data in relation to detailed clinical information. In this review, we aim to provide an overview on how omics research could be incorporated into the design of current and future epidemiological studies.We provide an up-to-date review of the current understanding in the area of genetic, epigenetic, proteomic and metabolomic markers for diabetes and related outcomes, including polygenic risk scores. We have drawn on key examples from the literature, as well as our own experience of conducting omics research using the Hong Kong Diabetes Register and Hong Kong Diabetes Biobank, as well as other cohorts, to illustrate the potential of omics research in diabetes. Recent studies highlight the opportunity, as well as potential benefit, to incorporate molecular profiling in the design and set-up of diabetes epidemiology studies, which can also advance understanding on the heterogeneity of diabetes. Learnings from these examples should facilitate other researchers to consider incorporating research on omics technologies into their work to advance the field and our understanding of diabetes and its related co-morbidities. Insights from these studies would be important for future development of precision medicine in diabetes.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.73071966836316e-30
38275362,"Chronic Pelvic Pain, Vulvar Pain Disorders, and Proteomics Profiles: New Discoveries, New Hopes.","Biomedicines","Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is generally defined as non-cyclic pain perceived in the pelvic area that has persisted from three to six months or longer and is unrelated to pregnancy. The etiology of CPP is complex, multifactorial, with heterogeneous presentation, and includes several diseases such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. It may also be associated with sexual dysfunction, musculoskeletal disorders, and comorbid psychiatric symptoms. Vulvar pain disorders (VPDs) are typically categorized separately from chronic pelvic pain; among all VPDs, vulvodynia is a chronic vulvar pain of unknown etiology, lasting at least 3 months and that might be associated with other potentially linked factors. Proteomics represents a useful approach to study the proteome profiles of clinical samples. In this review, we have considered a selection of articles that have analyzed the protein abundance and novel protein species from various biological samples, including eutopic/ectopic endometrium, urine, serum, follicular, peritoneal fluid, and cervical mucus, potentially involved in the pathogenesis and progression of CPP and VPDs. These findings could represent valuable targets for paving the way for the differential diagnosis and therapeutic management of CPP and VDPs, thereby optimizing both the prevention and treatment of these conditions.",1.50978871601304e-30

ALKBH1 as a recently discovered DNA N6-methyldeoxyadenosine (6mA) demethylase closely links to tumorigenesis. Whether theALKBH1polymorphism contributes to neuroblastoma risk remains unclear. In the present study, we genotyped theALKBH1single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 402 neuroblastoma patients and 473 healthy controls by TaqMan assay. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were also calculated to evaluate the strength of the association. Our result exhibited that the rs2267755 C>T (CT vs. CC, adjusted OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.50-0.94,P=0.019) is significantly associated with reduced neuroblastoma risk. And its protective effect is particularly significant in children with tumors originating from the retroperitoneal. Combined genotype analysis revealed that carriers with 1-2 protective genotypes are more susceptible to neuroblastoma than those with 3-4 protective genotypes (adjusted OR=0.71, 95% CI=0.53-0.97,P=0.028). Moreover, the rs2267755 C>T is significantly associated with messenger RNA (mRNA) expression ofALKBH1and three of its surrounding genes, includingSNWQ, ADCK1, andRPL21P10. These results suggest that the rs2267755 C>T may be a genetic variant to reduce neuroblastoma risk.© The author(s).",1.48440184648318e-30

LRS provides significant advantages over short-read sequencing approaches, including phased de novo genome assembly, access to previously excluded genomic regions, and discovery of more complex structural variants (SVs) associated with disease. Limitations remain with respect to cost, scalability, and platform-dependent read accuracy and the tradeoffs between sequence coverage and sensitivity of variant discovery are important experimental considerations for the application of LRS. We compare the genetic variant-calling precision and recall of Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi platforms over a range of sequence coverages. For read-based applications, LRS sensitivity begins to plateau around 12-fold coverage with a majority of variants called with reasonable accuracy (F1score above 0.5), and both platforms perform well for SV detection. Genome assembly increases variant-calling precision and recall of SVs and indels in HiFi data sets with HiFi outperforming ONT in quality as measured by the F1score of assembly-based variant call sets.

Identification of TE-derived functional elements, however, has relied on TE annotations in individual species, which limits its scope to relatively intact TE sequences. Here, we report a novel approach to uncover previously unannotated degenerate TEs (degTEs) by probing multiple ancestral genomes reconstructed from hundreds of species. We applied this method to the human genome and achieved a 10.8% increase in coverage over the most recent annotation. Further, we discovered that degTEs contribute to various cis-regulatory elements and transcription factor binding sites, including those of a known TE-controlling family, the KRAB zinc-finger proteins. We also report unannotated chimeric transcripts between degTEs and human genes expressed in embryos. This study provides a novel methodology and a freely available resource that will facilitate the investigation of TE co-option events on a full scale.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

We have since learned that gene expression is finely tuned in time and space, due to the activities of RNAs and proteins on regulatory DNA elements, and through cell-type-specific three-dimensional conformations of the genome. Here, we review major advances in genome biology and discuss a set of ideas on gene regulation and highlight how various biomolecular assemblies lead to the formation of structural and regulatory features within the nucleus, with roles in transcriptional control.

38260506,"Discovering Root Causal Genes with High Throughput Perturbations.","bioRxiv","Root causal gene expression levels - orroot causal genesfor short - correspond to the initial changes to gene expression that generate patient symptoms as a downstream effect. Identifying root causal genes is critical towards developing treatments that modify disease at its onset. However, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data introduces challenges such as measurement error, high dimensionality and non-linearity that compromise accurate estimation of root causal effects even with state-of-the-art methods. We therefore instead leverage Perturb-seq, or high throughput perturbations with single cell RNA-seq readout, to learn the causal order between the genes. We then transfer the causal order to bulk RNA-seq and identify root causal genes specific to a given patient using a novel statistic. Experiments demonstrate large improvements relative to existing algorithms. Applications to macular degeneration and multiple sclerosis also reveal root causal genes that lie on known pathogenic pathways, delineate patient subgroups and implicate a newly defined omnigenic root causal model.",1.14993355051459e-30

While ΔΨM loss and its consequences are well studied, little is known about the effects of increased ΔΨM. In this study, we used cells deleted ofATPIF1, a natural inhibitor of the hydrolytic activity of the ATP synthase, as a genetic model of mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Our data show that chronic ΔΨM increase leads to nuclear DNA hypermethylation, regulating transcription of mitochondria, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism genes. Surprisingly, remodeling of phospholipids, but not metabolites or redox changes, mechanistically links the ΔΨM to the epigenome. These changes were also observed upon chemical exposures and reversed by decreasing the ΔΨM, highlighting them as hallmark adaptations to chronic mitochondrial hyperpolarization. Our results reveal the ΔΨM as the upstream signal conveying the mitochondrial status to the epigenome to regulate cellular biology, providing a new framework for how mitochondria can influence health outcomes in the absence of canonical dysfunction.",1.14096655352605e-30

Here, by leveraging recently available spatial-CUT&Tag data, we systematically characterized the global spatial organization of the H3K4me3 profiles in a mouse embryo. Our analysis identified a subset of genes with spatially coherent H3K4me3 patterns, which together delineate the tissue boundaries. The spatially coherent genes are strongly enriched with tissue-specific transcriptional regulators. Remarkably, their corresponding genomic loci are marked by broad H3K4me3 domains, which is distinct from the typical H3K4me3 signature. Spatial transition across tissue boundaries is associated with continuous shortening of the broad H3K4me3 domains as well as expansion of H3K27me3 domains.

Each cardinal class contains multiple neuronal subtypes characterized by distinct molecular, anatomical, and physiological characteristics. Through a focus on the excitatory V3 interneuron class, here we demonstrate that interneuron subtype diversity is delineated through a combination of neurogenesis timing and final laminar settling position. We have revealed that early-born and late-born embryonic V3 temporal classes further diversify into subclasses with spatially and molecularly discrete identities. While neurogenesis timing accounts for V3 morphological diversification, laminar settling position accounts for electrophysiological profiles distinguishing V3 subtypes within the same temporal classes. Furthermore, V3 interneuron subtypes display independent behavioral recruitment patterns demonstrating a functional modularity underlying V3 interneuron diversity. These studies provide a framework for how early embryonic temporal and spatial mechanisms combine to delineate spinal interneuron classes into molecularly, anatomically, and functionally relevant subtypes in adults.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

This gene contains an exceptionally long and strictly monomorphic short tandem repeat (STR) of 9-repeats, (GA)9. STRs in regulatory regions, may impact on the expression of nearby genes. We used CRISPR-based tool to delete this GA-repeat in NT2 cells, and analyzed the consequence of this deletion on GPM6B expression. Subsequently, the edited cells were induced to differentiate into neural cells, using retinoic acid (RA) treatment. Deletion of the GA-repeat significantly decreased the expression of GPM6B at the RNA (p < 0.05) and protein (40%) levels. Compared to the control cells, the edited cells showed dramatic decrease of the astrocyte and neural cell markers, including GFAP (0.77-fold), TUBB3 (0.57-fold), and MAP2 (0.2-fold). Subsequent sorting of the edited cells showed an increased number of NES (p < 0.01), but a decreased number of GFAP (p < 0.001), TUBB3 (p < 0.05), and MAP2 (p < 0.01), compared to the control cells. In conclusion, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of a GA-repeat in human GPM6B, led to decreased expression of this gene, which in turn, disrupted differentiation of NT2 cells into neural cells.© 2024.

Here, we perform a pan-cancer 3' untranslated region alternative polyadenylation transcriptome-wide association analysis by integrating 55 well-powered (n > 50,000) genome-wide association studies datasets across 22 major cancer types with alternative polyadenylation quantification from 23,955 RNA sequencing samples across 7,574 individuals. We find that genetic variants associated with alternative polyadenylation are co-localized with 28.57% of cancer loci and contribute a significant portion of cancer heritability. We further identify 642 significant cancer susceptibility genes predicted to modulate cancer risk via alternative polyadenylation, 62.46% of which have been overlooked by traditional expression- and splicing- studies. As proof of principle validation, we show that alternative alleles facilitate 3' untranslated region lengthening of CRLS1 gene leading to increased protein abundance and promoted proliferation of breast cancer cells. Together, our study highlights the significant role of alternative polyadenylation in discovering new cancer susceptibility genes and provides a strong foundational framework for enhancing our understanding of the etiology underlying human cancers.© 2024.

Although PRS is used in clinical practice to predict breast cancer risk, it is more accurate for Europeans than for non-Europeans because of the sample size of training genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To address this disparity, we constructed a PRS model for predicting the risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the Korean population.Using GWAS analysis, we identified 43 Korean-specific variants and calculated the PRS. Subsequent to plotting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we selected the 31 best-performing variants to construct an optimal PRS model. The resultant PRS model with 31 variants demonstrated a prediction rate of 77.4%. The pathway analysis indicated that the identified non-coding variants are involved in regulating the expression of genes related to cancer initiation and progression. Notably, favorable lifestyle habits, such as avoiding tobacco and alcohol, mitigated the risk of RCC across PRS strata expressing genetic risk.A Korean-specific PRS model was established to predict the risk of RCC in the underrepresented Korean population. Our findings suggest that lifestyle-associated factors influencing RCC risk are associated with acquired risk factors indirectly through epigenetic modification, even among individuals in the higher PRS category.© 2024.

While STR length variations are known to regulate gene expression under physiological conditions, the functional impact of STR mutations in CRC remains unclear. Here, we integrate STR mutation data with clinical information and gene expression data to study the gene regulatory effects of STR mutations in CRC. We confirm that STR mutability in CRC highly depends on the MSI status, repeat unit size, and repeat length. Furthermore, we present a set of 1244 putative expression STRs (eSTRs) for which the STR length is associated with gene expression levels in CRC tumours. The length of 73 eSTRs is associated with expression levels of cancer-related genes, nine of which are CRC-specific genes. We show that linear models describing eSTR-gene expression relationships allow for predictions of gene expression changes in response to eSTR mutations. Moreover, we found an increased mutability of eSTRs in MSI tumours. Our evidence of gene regulatory roles for eSTRs in CRC highlights a mostly overlooked way through which tumours may modulate their phenotypes.

Yet, despite the urgent need for blood-based biomarkers for early detection, few studies capture ongoing biology to identify risk-stratifying biomarkers. We address this gap using the TGF-β pathway because of its biological role in liver disease and cancer, established through rigorous animal models and human studies. Using machine learning methods with blood levels of 108 proteomic markers in the TGF-β family, we found a pattern that differentiates HCC from non-HCC in a cohort of 216 patients with cirrhosis, which we refer to as TGF-β based Protein Markers for Early Detection of HCC (TPEARLE) comprising 31 markers. Notably, 20 of the patients with cirrhosis alone presented an HCC-like pattern, suggesting that they may be a group with as yet undetected HCC or at high risk for developing HCC. In addition, we found two other biologically relevant markers, Myostatin and Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2), which were significantly associated with HCC. We tested these for risk stratification of HCC in multivariable models adjusted for demographic and clinical variables, as well as batch and site. These markers reflect ongoing biology in the liver. They potentially indicate the presence of HCC early in its evolution and before it is manifest as a detectable lesion, thereby providing a set of markers that may be able to stratify risk for HCC.",6.80885809099226e-31

To investigate cell type-specific interspecies differences in brain gene expression, we conducted RNA-seq on neural progenitor cells, neurons, and astrocytes generated from induced pluripotent stem cells from humans and chimpanzees. Interspecies differential expression analyses revealed that twice as many genes exhibit differential expression in astrocytes (12.2% of all genes expressed) than neurons (5.8%). Pathway enrichment analyses determined that astrocytes, rather than neurons, diverged in expression of glucose and lactate transmembrane transport, as well as pyruvate processing and oxidative phosphorylation.

To estimate the diagnostic potential of liquid biopsies in guiding personalized treatment of PCa, we evaluated the utility of a custom-targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel based on the AmpliSeq HD Technology. Ultra-deep sequencing on plasma circulating free DNA (cfDNA) samples of 40 metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC) and 28 metastatic hormone-naive PCa (mCSPC) was performed.

In 21/42 (50%) patients, mutations from the primary tumor tissue were detected in the plasma cfDNA. In 7/42 (17%) patients, mutations found in the primary tumor were not detected in the cfDNA. Mutations from primary tumors were detected in all tested mCRPC patients (17/17), but only in 4/11 with mCSPC. AR amplifications were detected in 12/39 (31%) mCRPC patients.

Recent advances in large-scale genome-wide association studies have highlighted the potential of genetic risk, captured as polygenic risk scores (PRS), in clinical prevention. However, the current clinical utility of PRS models is limited to identifying high-risk populations based on the top percentiles of genetic susceptibility. While some studies have attempted integrative prediction using genetic and non-genetic factors, many of these studies have been cross-sectional and focused solely on risk stratification. Our primary objective in this study was to integrate unmodifiable (age / genetics) and modifiable (clinical / biometric) risk factors into a prospective prediction framework which also produces actionable and personalized risk estimates for the purpose of CAD prevention in a heterogenous adult population. Thus, we present an integrative, omnigenic, meta-prediction framework that effectively captures CAD risk subgroups, primarily distinguished by degree and nature of genetic risk, with distinct risk reduction profiles predicted from standard clinical interventions. Initial model development considered ~ 2,000 predictive features, including demographic data, lifestyle factors, physical measurements, laboratory tests, medication usage, diagnoses, and genetics. To power our meta-prediction approach, we stratified the UK Biobank into two primary cohorts: 1) a prevalent CAD cohort used to train baseline and prospective predictive models for contributing risk factors and diagnoses, and 2) an incident CAD cohort used to train the final CAD incident risk prediction model. The resultant 10-year incident CAD risk model is composed of 35 derived meta-features from models trained on the prevalent risk cohort, most of which are predicted baseline diagnoses with multiple embedded PRSs. This model achieved an AUC of 0.81 and macro-averaged F1-score of 0.65, outperforming standard clinical scores and prior integrative models. We further demonstrate that individualized risk reduction profiles can be derived from this model, with genetic risk mediating the degree of risk reduction achieved by standard clinical interventions.",4.51952878637826e-31

In this current evolve and resequencing (E&R) study, we conduct a genomic scan of the allele frequency changes along the genome in bumblebee-pollinated and hand-pollinated plants and perform a genomic principal component analysis (PCA).We highlight rapid genomic evolution associated with the observed phenotypic evolution mediated by bumblebees. Controlling for genetic drift, we observe significant changes in allelic frequencies at multiple loci.

We also compare the TRE-associated genes to those that are dysregulated in the heart tissues of individuals with cardiomyopathy.We demonstrate that tandem repeats that are rarely expanded in the general population are predominantly expanded in cardiomyopathy. We find that rare TREs are disproportionately present in constrained genes near transcriptional start sites, have high GC content, and frequently overlap active enhancer H3K27ac marks, where expansion-related DNA methylation may reduce gene expression. We demonstrate the gene silencing effect of expanded CGG tandem repeats in DIP2B through promoter hypermethylation. We show that the enhancer-associated loci are found in genes that are highly expressed in human cardiomyocytes and are differentially expressed in the left ventricle of the heart in individuals with cardiomyopathy.Our findings highlight the underrecognized contribution of rare tandem repeat expansions to the risk of cardiomyopathy and suggest that rare TREs contribute to ∼4% of cardiomyopathy risk.Government of Ontario (RKCY), The Canadian Institutes of Health Research PJT 175329 (RKCY), The Azrieli Foundation (RKCY), SickKids Catalyst Scholar in Genetics (RKCY), The University of Toronto McLaughlin Centre (RKCY, SM), Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research (SM), Data Sciences Institute at the University of Toronto (SM), The Canadian Institutes of Health Research PJT 175034 (SM), The Canadian Institutes of Health Research ENP 161429 under the frame of ERA PerMed (SM, RL), Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario & Robert M Freedom Chair in Cardiovascular Science (SM), Bitove Family Professorship of Adult Congenital Heart Disease (EO), Canada Foundation for Innovation (SWS, JR), Canada Research Chair (PS), Genome Canada (PS, JR), The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (PS).Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

38248118,"Plasma Cell-Free Tumor Methylome as a Biomarker in Solid Tumors: Biology and Applications.","Curr Oncol","DNA methylation is a fundamental mechanism of epigenetic control in cells and its dysregulation is strongly implicated in cancer development. Cancers possess an extensively hypomethylated genome with focal regions of hypermethylation at CPG islands. Due to the highly conserved nature of cancer-specific methylation, its detection in cell-free DNA in plasma using liquid biopsies constitutes an area of interest in biomarker research. The advent of next-generation sequencing and newer computational technologies have allowed for the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that utilize methylation profiling to diagnose disease and stratify risk. Methylome-based predictive biomarkers can determine the response to anti-cancer therapy. An additional emerging application of these biomarkers is in minimal residual disease monitoring. Several key challenges need to be addressed before cfDNA-based methylation biomarkers become fully integrated into practice. The first relates to the biology and stability of cfDNA. The second concerns the clinical validity and generalizability of methylation-based assays, many of which are cancer type-specific. The third involves their practicability, which is a stumbling block for translating technologies from bench to clinic. Future work on developing pan-cancer assays with their respective validities confirmed using well-designed, prospective clinical trials is crucial in pushing for the greater use of these tools in oncology.",4.07255901527297e-31

Their causative somatic mutations, for example, JAK2V617F, are common in the population, yet only a minority of carriers develop MPN. Here we show that the inherited polygenic loci that underlie common hematological traits influence JAK2V617Fclonal expansion. We identify polygenic risk scores (PGSs) for monocyte count and plateletcrit as new risk factors for JAK2V617Fpositivity. PGSs for several hematological traits influenced the risk of different MPN subtypes, with low PGSs for two platelet traits also showing protective effects in JAK2V617Fcarriers, making them two to three times less likely to have essential thrombocythemia than carriers with high PGSs. We observed that extreme hematological PGSs may contribute to an MPN diagnosis in the absence of somatic driver mutations. Our study showcases how polygenic backgrounds underlying common hematological traits influence both clonal selection on somatic mutations and the subsequent phenotype of cancer.© 2024.

38267856,"High-fidelity (repeat) consensus sequences from short reads using combined read clustering and assembly.","BMC Genomics","Despite the many cheap and fast ways to generate genomic data, good and exact genome assembly is still a problem, with especially the repeats being vastly underrepresented and often misassembled. As short reads in low coverage are already sufficient to represent the repeat landscape of any given genome, many read cluster algorithms were brought forward that provide repeat identification and classification. But how can trustworthy, reliable and representative repeat consensuses be derived from unassembled genomes?Here, we combine methods from repeat identification and genome assembly to derive these robust consensuses. We test several use cases, such as (1) consensus building from clustered short reads of non-model genomes, (2) from genome-wide amplification setups, and (3) specific repeat-centred questions, such as the linked vs. unlinked arrangement of ribosomal genes. In all our use cases, the derived consensuses are robust and representative. To evaluate overall performance, we compare our high-fidelity repeat consensuses to RepeatExplorer2-derived contigs and check, if they represent real transposable elements as found in long reads. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to generate useful, reliable and trustworthy consensuses from short reads by a combination from read cluster and genome assembly methods in an automatable way.We anticipate that our workflow opens the way towards more efficient and less manual repeat characterization and annotation, benefitting all genome studies, but especially those of non-model organisms.© 2024.

The aim of this study was to perform an integrative epigenetic analysis to explore the epigenetic abnormalities involved in the development and progression of PCa, and present advanced diagnostics and improved individual outcomes.Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed and a diagnostic model was constructed. For validation, we employed profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and methylation data derived from clinical samples. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) were employed for GSEA and to assess immune cell infiltration, respectively.An accurate diagnostic method for PCa was established based on the methylation level of Cyclin-D2 (CCND2) and glutathione S-transferase pi-1 (GSTP1), with an impressive area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.937. The model's reliability was further confirmed through validation using four GEO datasets GSE76938 (AUC =0.930), GSE26126 (AUC =0.906), GSE112047 (AUC =1.000), GSE84749 (AUC =0.938) and clinical samples (AUC =0.980). Notably, the TIMER analysis indicated that hypermethylation ofCCND2andGSTP1was associated with reduced immune cell infiltration, higher tumor purity, and an increased risk of tumor progression.In conclusion, our study provides a robust and reliable methylation-based diagnostic model for PCa. This model holds promise as an improved approach for screening and diagnosing PCa, potentially enhancing early detection and patient outcomes, as well as for an advanced clinical management for PCa in the framework of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine.2023 Translational Andrology and Urology.

Here, we use single-cell-indexed ATAC-seq to identify cell-type-specific accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) associated with C4enzymes for five different grass species. This study spans four C4species, covering three distinct photosynthetic subtypes:Zea maysandSorghum bicolor(NADP-ME),Panicum miliaceum(NAD-ME),Urochloa fusca(PEPCK), along with the C3outgroupOryza sativa. We studied thecis-regulatory landscape of enzymes essential across all C4species and those unique to C4subtypes, measuring cell-type-specific biases for C4enzymes using chromatin accessibility data. Integrating these data with phylogenetics revealed diverse co-option of gene family members between species, showcasing the various paths of C4evolution. Besides promoter proximal ACRs, we found that, on average, C4genes have two to three distal cell-type-specific ACRs, highlighting the complexity and divergent nature of C4evolution. Examining the evolutionary history of these cell-type-specific ACRs revealed a spectrum of conserved and novel ACRs, even among closely related species, indicating ongoing evolution ofcis-regulation at these C4loci. This study illuminates the dynamic and complex nature of CRE evolution in C4photosynthesis, particularly highlighting the intricatecis-regulatory evolution of key loci.

As with any advance that rests upon statistical learning approaches, the recent progress in biomolecular sciences is enabled by the availability of vast volumes of sufficiently-variable data. To be useful, such data must be well-structured, machine-readable, intelligible and manipulable. These and related requirements pose challenges that become especially acute at the computational scales typical in ML. Furthermore, in structural bioinformatics such data generally relate to protein three-dimensional (3D) structures, which are inherently more complex than sequence-based data. A significant and recurring challenge concerns the creation of large, high-quality, openly-accessible datasets that can be used for specific training and benchmarking tasks in ML pipelines for predictive modeling projects, along with reproducible splits for training and testing.Here, we report 'Prop3D', a platform that allows for the creation, sharing and extensible reuse of libraries of protein domains, featurized with biophysical and evolutionary properties that can range from detailed, atomically-resolved physicochemical quantities (e.g., electrostatics) to coarser, residue-level features (e.g., phylogenetic conservation). As a community resource, we also supply a 'Prop3D-20sf' protein dataset, obtained by applying our approach to CATH . We have developed and deployed the Prop3D framework, both in the cloud and on local HPC resources, to systematically and reproducibly create comprehensive datasets via the Highly Scalable Data Service ( HSDS ). Our datasets are freely accessible via a public HSDS instance, or they can be used with accompanying Python wrappers for popular ML frameworks.Prop3D and its associated Prop3D-20sf dataset can be of broad utility in at least three ways. Firstly, the Prop3D workflow code can be customized and deployed on various cloud-based compute platforms, with scalability achieved largely by saving the results to distributed HDF5 files via HSDS . Secondly, the linked Prop3D-20sf dataset provides a hand-crafted, already-featurized dataset of protein domains for 20 highly-populated CATH families; importantly, provision of this pre-computed resource can aid the more efficient development (and reproducible deployment) of ML pipelines. Thirdly, Prop3D-20sf's construction explicitly takes into account (in creating datasets and data-splits) the enigma of 'data leakage', stemming from the evolutionary relationships between proteins.© 2024.

Exposure to nicotine and other compounds in tobacco and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has been shown to increases the risk of miscarriage, prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight, perinatal morbidity, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Additionally, recent data provided by clinical and pre-clinical research demonstrates that nicotine exposure during pregnancy may heighten the risk for adverse neurodevelopmental disorders such as Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity (ADHD), anxiety, and depression along with altering the infants underlying brain circuitry, response to neurotransmitters, and brain volume. In the United States, one in 14 women (7.2%) reported to have smoked cigarettes during their pregnancy with the global prevalence of smoking during pregnancy estimated to be 1.7%. Approximately 1.1% of women in the United States also reported to have used e-cigarettes during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Due to the large percentage of women utilizing nicotine products during pregnancy in the United States and globally, this review seeks to centralize pre-clinical and clinical studies focused on the neurobehavioral and neurodevelopmental complications associated with prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) such as alterations to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC), ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NA), hippocampus, and caudate as well as changes to nAChR and cholinergic receptor signaling, long-term drug seeking behavior following PNE, and other related developmental disorders.

Despite its importance, consensus is lacking on how to choose the most appropriate feature selection methods, especially when the performance of the feature selection methods itself depends on hyper-parameters. Bayesian optimization has demonstrated its advantages in automatically configuring the settings of hyper-parameters for various models. However, it remains unclear whether Bayesian optimization can benefit feature selection methods. In this research, we conducted extensive simulation studies to compare the performance of various feature selection methods, with a particular focus on the impact of Bayesian optimization on those where hyper-parameters tuning is needed. We further utilized the gene expression data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to predict various brain imaging-related phenotypes, where various feature selection methods were employed to mine the data. We found through simulation studies that feature selection methods with hyper-parameters tuned using Bayesian optimization often yield better recall rates, and the analysis of transcriptomic data further revealed that Bayesian optimization-guided feature selection can improve the accuracy of disease risk prediction models. In conclusion, Bayesian optimization can facilitate feature selection methods when hyper-parameter tuning is needed and has the potential to substantially benefit downstream tasks.© 2024.

However, the ultimate goal is to construct a customized model for predicting the drug resistance of MTB and eventually for the biological phenotypes based on genotypes. Here, we constructed a DL training framework to standardize and modularize each step during the training process using the latest tensorflow 2 API. A systematic and comprehensive evaluation of each module in the three currently representative models, including Convolutional Neural Network, Denoising Autoencoder, and Wide & Deep, which were adopted by CNNGWP, DeepAMR, and WDNN, respectively, was performed in this framework regarding module contributions in order to assemble a novel model with proper dedicated modules. Based on the whole-genome level mutations, a de novo learning method was developed to overcome the intrinsic limitations of previous models that rely on known drug resistance-associated loci. A customized DL model with the multilayer perceptron architecture was constructed and achieved a competitive performance (the mean sensitivity and specificity were 0.90 and 0.87, respectively) compared to previous ones.

To develop additional therapeutics that may prevent opioid misuse, further studies on the neurobiological consequences of opioid exposure are needed. Here we sought to characterize molecular neuroadaptations involving microRNA (miRNA) pathways in the brain and blood of adult male rats that self-administered the opioid heroin. miRNAs are ∼18-24 nucleotide RNAs that regulate protein expression by preventing mRNA translation into proteins. Manipulation of miRNAs and their downstream pathways can critically regulate drug seeking behavior. We performed small-RNA sequencing of miRNAs and proteomics profiling on tissue from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a brain region associated with heroin seeking, following 2 days of forced abstinence from self-administration of 0.03 mg/kg/infusion heroin or sucrose. Heroin self-administration resulted in a robust shift of the OFC miRNA profile, regulating 77 miRNAs, while sucrose self-administration only regulated 9 miRNAs that did not overlap with the heroin-induced profile. Conversely, proteomics revealed dual regulation of seven proteins by both heroin and sucrose in the OFC. Pathway analysis determined that heroin-associated miRNA pathways are predicted to target genes associated with the term ""prion disease,"" a term that was also enriched in the heroin-induced protein expression dataset. Lastly, we confirmed that a subset of heroin-induced miRNA expression changes in the OFC are regulated in peripheral serum and correlate with heroin infusions. These findings demonstrate that peripheral blood samples may have biomarker utility for assessment of drug-induced miRNA pathway alterations that occur in the brain following chronic drug exposure.Copyright © 2023 Zanda, Saikali, Morris and Sillivan.",2.06370739075554e-31

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), or the accumulation of the intermediate amino acid homocysteine, is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, but the intricate biological processes mediating this effect remain elusive. Several factors regulate homocysteine levels, including the activity of several enzymes and adequate levels of their coenzymes, including pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B6), folate (vitamin B9), and methylcobalamin (vitamin B12). To better understand the biological influence of HHcy on the development and progression of atherosclerosis, apolipoprotein-E-deficient (apoE-/-mice), a model for human atherosclerosis, were fed a hyperhomocysteinemic diet (low in methyl donors and B vitamins) (HHD) or a control diet (CD). After eight weeks, the plasma, aorta, and liver were collected to quantify methylation metabolites, while plasma was also used for a broad targeted metabolomic analysis. Aortic plaque burden in the brachiocephalic artery (BCA) was quantified via 14T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A severe accumulation of plasma and hepatic homocysteine and an increased BCA plaque burden were observed, thus confirming the atherogenic effect of the HHD. Moreover, a decreased methylation capacity in the plasma and aorta, indirectly assessed by the ratio of S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAM:SAH) was detected in HHD mice together with a 172-fold increase in aortic cystathionine levels, indicating increased flux through the transsulfuration pathway. Betaine and its metabolic precursor, choline, were significantly decreased in the livers of HHD mice versus CD mice. Widespread changes in the plasma metabolome of HHD mice versus CD animals were detected, including alterations in acylcarnitines, amino acids, bile acids, ceramides, sphingomyelins, triacylglycerol levels, and several indicators of dysfunctional lipid metabolism.

It offers a range of positive benefits for cognitive function, regardless of age. However, as our population ages and life expectancy increases, cognitive impairment has become a prevalent issue, often coexisting with age-related neurodegenerative conditions. This can result in devastating consequences such as memory loss, difficulty speaking, and confusion, greatly hindering one's ability to lead an ordinary life. In addition, the decrease in mental capacity has a significant effect on an individual's physical and emotional well-being, greatly reducing their overall level of contentment and causing a significant financial burden for communities. While most current approaches aim to slow the decline of cognition, exercise offers a non-pharmacological, safe, and accessible solution. Its effects on cognition are intricate and involve changes in the brain's neural plasticity, mitochondrial stability, and energy metabolism. Moreover, exercise triggers the release of cytokines, playing a significant role in the body-brain connection and its impact on cognition. Additionally, exercise can influence gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms, leading to lasting improvements in brain function and behavior. Herein, we summarized various genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that can be modulated by exercise in cognitive dysfunction.© 2024.

To investigate this question, we compared the chromatin accessibility landscape and gene expression/alternative splicing pattern of young adult and aged mouse hippocampus in both males and females using ATAC-seq and RNA-seq. We detected significant aging-dependent changes in the expression of genes involved in immune response and synaptic function and aging-dependent changes in the alternative splicing of myelin sheath genes. We found significant sex-bias in the expression and alternative splicing of hundreds of genes, including aging-dependent female-biased expression of myelin sheath genes and aging-dependent male-biased expression of genes involved in synaptic function. Aging was associated with increased chromatin accessibility in both male and female hippocampus, especially in repetitive elements, and with an increase in LINE-1 transcription. We detected significant sex-bias in chromatin accessibility in both autosomes and the X chromosome, with male-biased accessibility enriched at promoters and CpG-rich regions. Sex differences in gene expression and chromatin accessibility were amplified with aging, findings that may shed light on sex differences in aging-related and pathological memory loss.Copyright © 2024 Achiro, Tao, Gao, Lin, Watanabe, Neumann, Coppola, Black and Martin.",1.05521647872147e-31

We also discuss how these methylation changes might occur in the first place - whether in the context of the CpG island methylator phenotype or constitutional DNA methylation. The choice of assay used to measure methylation can have a significant impact on interpretation of methylation states, and some examples where this can influence clinical decision-making are presented. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns in circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) are also showing great promise in the context of non-invasive cancer detection and monitoring using liquid biopsies; however, caution must be taken in interpreting these results in cases where constitutional methylation may be present. Thus, this review aims to provide researchers and clinicians with a comprehensive summary of this broad, but important subject, illustrating the potentials and pitfalls of assessing aberrant DNA methylation in cancer.© The Author(s), 2024.",9.44133982307026e-32
38213821,"PaintorPipe: a pipeline for genetic variant fine-mapping using functional annotations.","Bioinform Adv","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants associated with common diseases. These results include a mix of causal and non-causal variants related through strong linkage disequilibrium (LD, i.e. highly correlated). Fine-mapping methods have been developed to decipher the causal from non-causal variants using GWAS results and LD information, assigning to each variant a probability of being causal. In this field, the PAINTOR program has become a standard, one of its advantages being its ability to take into account functional annotations. This approach requires many pre- and post-processing steps. Here, we developed a Nextflow pipeline called PaintorPipe that wraps all these steps and the fine-mapping itself together. PaintorPipe uses three independent sources of information: GWAS summary statistics, LD information and functional annotations, to rank the variants according to their susceptibility to be involved in the disease development. The PAINTOR framework is used to calculate the posterior probability of each variant (single nucleotide polymorphism) to be causal (a.k.a. Bayesian fine-mapping). The resulting credible sets of variants are annotated with their biological functions and visualized using CANVIS. This pipeline requires minimal input from users (a GWAS summary statistics file and a set of functional annotation files) and is designed to be modular and customizable, allowing for an easy integration of diverse functional annotations.PaintorPipe is implemented in the Nextflow pipeline specific language, can be run locally or on a slurm cluster and handles containerization using Singularity.

38347379,"Understanding the Mechanisms of Diminished Ovarian Reserve: Insights from Genetic Variants and Regulatory Factors.","Reprod Sci","Delaying childbearing age has become a trend in modern times, but it has also led to a common challenge in clinical reproductive medicine-diminished ovarian reserve (DOR). Since the mechanism behind DOR is unknown and its clinical features are complex, physicians find it difficult to provide targeted treatment. Many factors affect ovarian reserve function, and existing studies have shown that genetic variants, upstream regulatory genes, and changes in protein expression levels are present in populations with reduced ovarian reserve function. However, existing therapeutic regimens often do not target the genetic profile for more individualized treatment. In this paper, we review the types of genetic variants, mutations, altered expression levels of microRNAs, and other related factors and their effects on the regulation of follicular development, as well as altered DNA methylation. We hope this review will have significant implications for the future treatment of individuals with reduced ovarian reserve.© 2024.

38279653,"CAP-RNAseq: an integrated pipeline for functional annotation and prioritization of co-expression clusters.","Brief Bioinform","Cluster analysis is one of the most widely used exploratory methods for visualization and grouping of gene expression patterns across multiple samples or treatment groups. Although several existing online tools can annotate clusters with functional terms, there is no all-in-one webserver to effectively prioritize genes/clusters using gene essentiality as well as congruency of mRNA-protein expression. Hence, we developed CAP-RNAseq that makes possible (1) upload and clustering of bulk RNA-seq data followed by identification, annotation and network visualization of all or selected clusters; and (2) prioritization using DepMap gene essentiality and/or dependency scores as well as the degree of correlation between mRNA and protein levels of genes within an expression cluster. In addition, CAP-RNAseq has an integrated primer design tool for the prioritized genes. Herein, we showed using comparisons with the existing tools and multiple case studies that CAP-RNAseq can uniquely aid in the discovery of co-expression clusters enriched with essential genes and prioritization of novel biomarker genes that exhibit high correlations between their mRNA and protein expression levels.

Here, we present a single cell multi-omic framework integrating embryonic mouse chromatin accessibility, histone modification, and gene expression assays to discover cranial motor neuron (cMN) cis-regulatory elements and subsequently nominate candidate non-coding variants in the congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders (CCDDs), a set of Mendelian disorders altering cMN development. We generated single cell epigenomic profiles for ~86,000 cMNs and related cell types, identifying ~250,000 accessible regulatory elements with cognate gene predictions for ~145,000 putative enhancers. Seventy-five percent of elements (44 of 59) validated in anin vivotransgenic reporter assay, demonstrating that single cell accessibility is a strong predictor of enhancer activity. Applying our cMN atlas to 899 whole genome sequences from 270 genetically unsolved CCDD pedigrees, we achieved significant reduction in our variant search space and nominated candidate variants predicted to regulate known CCDD disease genesMAFB, PHOX2A, CHN1, andEBF3- as well as new candidates in recurrently mutated enhancers through peak- and gene-centric allelic aggregation.

38253606,"Pangenome graphs improve the analysis of structural variants in rare genetic diseases.","Nat Commun","Rare DNA alterations that cause heritable diseases are only partially resolvable by clinical next-generation sequencing due to the difficulty of detecting structural variation (SV) in all genomic contexts. Long-read, high fidelity genome sequencing (HiFi-GS) detects SVs with increased sensitivity and enables assembling personal and graph genomes. We leverage standard reference genomes, public assemblies (n = 94) and a large collection of HiFi-GS data from a rare disease program (Genomic Answers for Kids, GA4K, n = 574 assemblies) to build a graph genome representing a unified SV callset in GA4K, identify common variation and prioritize SVs that are more likely to cause genetic disease (MAF < 0.01). Using graphs, we obtain a higher level of reproducibility than the standard reference approach. We observe over 200,000 SV alleles unique to GA4K, including nearly 1000 rare variants that impact coding sequence. With improved specificity for rare SVs, we isolate 30 candidate SVs in phenotypically prioritized genes, including known disease SVs. We isolate a novel diagnostic SV in KMT2E, demonstrating use of personal assemblies coupled with pangenome graphs for rare disease genomics. The community may interrogate our pangenome with additional assemblies to discover new SVs within the allele frequency spectrum relevant to genetic diseases.© 2024.

38177329,"Transcriptional and epigenetic dysregulation impairs generation of proliferative neural stem and progenitor cells during brain aging.","Nat Aging","The decline in stem cell function during aging may affect the regenerative capacity of mammalian organisms; however, the gene regulatory mechanism underlying this decline remains unclear. Here we show that the aging of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the male mouse brain is characterized by a decrease in the generation efficacy of proliferative NSPCs rather than the changes in lineage specificity of NSPCs. We reveal that the downregulation of age-dependent genes in NSPCs drives cell aging by decreasing the population of actively proliferating NSPCs while increasing the expression of quiescence markers. We found that epigenetic deregulation of the MLL complex at promoters leads to transcriptional inactivation of age-dependent genes, highlighting the importance of the dynamic interaction between histone modifiers and gene regulatory elements in regulating transcriptional program of aging cells. Our study sheds light on the key intrinsic mechanisms driving stem cell aging through epigenetic regulators and identifies potential rejuvenation targets that could restore the function of aging stem cells.© 2024.

However, the regulatory effects and programmability of such DNA sequences remain difficult to map or predict because we have lacked scalable methods to precisely edit regulatory DNA and quantify the effects in an endogenous genomic context. Here we present an approach to measure the quantitative effects of hundreds of designed DNA sequence variants on gene expression, by combining pooled CRISPR prime editing with RNA fluorescencein situhybridization and cell sorting (Variant-FlowFISH). We apply this method to mutagenize and rewrite regulatory DNA sequences in an enhancer and the promoter ofPPIFin two immune cell lines. Of 672 variant-cell type pairs, we identify 497 that affectPPIFexpression. These variants appear to act through a variety of mechanisms including disruption or optimization of existing transcription factor binding sites, as well as creation ofde novosites. Disrupting a single endogenous transcription factor binding site often led to large changes in expression (up to -40% in the enhancer, and -50% in the promoter). The same variant often had different effects across cell types and states, demonstrating a highly tunable regulatory landscape. We use these data to benchmark performance of sequence-based predictive models of gene regulation, and find that certain types of variants are not accurately predicted by existing models. Finally, we computationally design 185 small sequence variants (≤10 bp) and optimize them for specific effects on expressionin silico. 84% of these rationally designed edits showed the intended direction of effect, and some had dramatic effects on expression (-100% to +202%). Variant-FlowFISH thus provides a powerful tool to map the effects of variants and transcription factor binding sites on gene expression, test and improve computational models of gene regulation, and reprogram regulatory DNA.",6.01679568247749e-32

Schizophrenia has been associated with a restrictive epigenome, and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been postulated as coadjuvant agents to potentiate the efficacy of current antipsychotic drugs. We aimed to evaluate global histone posttranslational modifications (HPTMs) and HDAC expression and activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of individuals with schizophrenia.We used postmortem DLPFC samples of individuals with schizophrenia and controls matched for sex, age, and postmortem interval. Schizophrenia samples were classified into antipsychotic-treated or antipsychotic-free subgroups according to blood toxicology. Expression of HPTMs and HDAC was quantified by Western blot. HDAC activity was measured with a fluorometric assay.H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H3K4me3 were globally enhanced in the DLPFC of individuals with schizophrenia (+24%-42%,p< 0.05). HDAC activity (-17%,p< 0.01) and HDAC4 protein expression (-20%,p< 0.05) were downregulated in individuals with schizophrenia. Analyses of antipsychotic-free and antipsychotic-treated subgroups revealed enhanced H3K4me3 and H3K27ac (+24%-49%,p< 0.05) and reduced HDAC activity in the antipsychotic-treated, but not in the antipsychotic-free subgroup.Special care was taken to control the effect of confounding factors: age, sex, postmortem interval, and storage time. However, replication studies in bigger cohorts might strengthen the association between permissive HPTMs and schizophrenia.We found global HPTM alterations consistent with an aberrantly permissive epigenome in schizophrenia. Further studies to elucidate the significance of enhanced permissive HPTMs in schizophrenia and its association with the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs are encouraged.© 2024 CMA Impact Inc. or its licensors.",5.83053334676534e-32
38238429,"Exploring potential causal associations between autoimmune diseases and colorectal cancer using bidirectional Mendelian randomization.","Sci Rep","Several observational studies have revealed an association between autoimmune diseases (AIDs) and colorectal cancer (CRC), although their causal association remained controversial. Therefore, our study used a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to verify the causal association between AIDs and CRC. We employed three common MR approaches, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger methods, to assess the causal association between type 1 diabetes (T1D), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, celiac disease, and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and CRC. The reverse MR analysis was performed to assess the possibility of reverse causation. To evaluate the validity of the analysis, we also performed sensitivity analysis, such as the heterogeneity test, the horizontal pleiotropy test, and the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, and validated the results in the validation cohort. Our results showed that genetically predicted T1D was nominally associated with a lower risk of CRC (IVW OR = 0.965, 95% CI = 0.939-0.992, P = 0.012). However, genetic susceptibility to psoriasis nominally increased the risk of CRC (IVW OR = 1.026, 95% CI = 1.002-1.050, P = 0.037). Genetically predicted PSC had a significant causal effect on the increasing risk of CRC (IVW OR = 1.038, 95% CI = 1.016-1.060, P = 5.85 × 10-4). Furthermore, the MR analysis between PSC and the CRC validation cohort indicated consistent results. We found no causal association between genetically predicted other five AIDs and CRC (P > 0.05). The results of reverse MR analysis showed that genetically predicted CRC had no causal effect on T1D, psoriasis, and PSC (P > 0.05). The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results of the MR analysis were reliable. Our findings help to understand the causal association between AIDs and CRC, which deserves further investigation.© 2024. The Author(s).",5.81371155079448e-32

An absolute correlate measure of protection against malaria is lacking. However, antibody-mediated functions againstPlasmodium falciparumcorrelate with protection against malaria. In children, antibody-mediated functions againstP. falciparumdecline with reduced exposure. It is unclear whether adults maintain antibody-mediated functions as malaria transmission declines. This study assessed antibody-dependent respiratory burst (ADRB) in individuals from an area with declining malaria transmission. In an age-matched analysis, we compare ADRB activity during high versus low malaria transmission periods. Age significantly predicted higher ADRB activity in the high (p< 0.001) and low (p< 0.001) malaria transmission periods. ADRB activity was higher during the high compared to the low malaria transmission period in older children and adults. Only older adults during the high malaria transmission period had their median ADRB activity above the ADRB cut-off. OngoingP. falciparuminfection influenced ADRB activity during the low (p= 0.01) but not the high (p= 0.29) malaria transmission period. These findings propose that naturally acquired immunity toP. falciparumis affected in children and adults as malaria transmission declines, implying that vaccines will be necessary to induce and maintain protection against malaria.",4.61409480697986e-32

Here, utilizing unbiased whole chromosome genetic screens combined with in vitro evolution to generate arm- and subarm-level events, we iteratively selected the fittest karyotypes from aneuploidized human renal and mammary epithelial cells. Proliferation-based karyotype selection in these epithelial lines modeled tissue-specific tumor aneuploidy patterns in patient cohorts in the absence of driver mutations. Hi-C-based translocation mapping revealed that arm-level events usually emerged in multiples of two via centromeric translocations and occurred more frequently in tetraploids than diploids, contributing to the increased diversity in evolving tetraploid populations. Isogenic clonal lineages enabled elucidation of pro-tumorigenic mechanisms associated with common copy number alterations, revealing Notch signaling potentiation as a driver of 1q gain in breast cancer.

Here, we study the regulatory roles of TOP2 paralogs in response to estrogen, which triggers an acute transcriptional induction that involves rewiring of genome organization. We find that, whereas TOP2A facilitates transcription, as expected for a topoisomerase, TOP2B limits the estrogen response. Consistent with this, TOP2B activity is locally downregulated upon estrogen treatment to favor the establishment and stabilization of regulatory chromatin contacts, likely through an accumulation of DNA supercoiling. We show that estrogen-mediated inhibition of TOP2B requires estrogen receptor α (ERα), a non-catalytic function of TOP2A, and the action of the atypical SUMO-ligase ZATT. This mechanism of topological transcriptional-control, which may be shared by additional gene-expression circuits, highlights the relevance of DNA topoisomerases as central actors of genome dynamics.",3.46466292317175e-32

However, the relationship between variations in RIB levels and depression as well as potential RIB participation in depressive disorder is yet unknown. Here, a reanalysis of metabonomics data from depressed patients and depression model rats is performed to clarify whether the increased RIB level is positively correlated with the severity of depression. Moreover, we characterize intestinal epithelial barrier damage, gut microbial composition and function, and microbiota-gut-brain metabolic signatures in RIB-fed mice using colonic histomorphology, 16 S rRNA gene sequencing, and untargeted metabolomics analysis. The results show that RIB caused intestinal epithelial barrier impairment and microbiota-gut-brain axis dysbiosis. These microbial and metabolic modules are consistently enriched in peripheral (fecal, colon wall, and serum) and central (hippocampus) glycerophospholipid metabolism. In addition, three differential genera (Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006, Turicibacter, and Akkermansia) and two types of glycerophospholipids (phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine) have greater contributions to the overall correlations between differential genera and glycerophospholipids.

Missense variants present a bottleneck in genetic diagnoses as their effects are less straightforward than truncations or nonsense mutations. While computational prediction methods are increasingly successful at prediction for variants inknowndisease genes, they do not generalize well to other genes as the scores are not calibrated across the proteome1-6. To address this, we developed a deep generative model, popEVE, that combines evolutionary information with population sequence data7and achieves state-of-the-art performance at ranking variants by severity to distinguish patients with severe developmental disorders8from potentially healthy individuals9. popEVE identifies 442 genes in patients this developmental disorder cohort, including evidence of 123 novel genetic disorders, many without the need for gene-level enrichment and without overestimating the prevalence of pathogenic variants in the population. A majority of these variants are close to interacting partners in 3D complexes. Preliminary analyses on child exomes indicate that popEVE can identify candidate variants without the need for inheritance labels. By placing variants on a unified scale, our model offers a comprehensive perspective on the distribution of fitness effects across the entire proteome and the broader human population. popEVE provides compelling evidence for genetic diagnoses even in exceptionally rare single-patient disorders where conventional techniques relying on repeated observations may not be applicable.",3.25277331585943e-32

It can impact the function of gastrointestinal secretions, as well as increasing the intestinal permeability leading to an aberrant immunological response and subsequent intestinal inflammation. Studies have reported anatomical and functional brain changes in Crohn's Disease patients (CDs), possibly due to increased inflammatory markers and microglial cells that play key roles in communicating between the brain, gut, and systemic immune system. To date, no studies have demonstrated similarities between morphological brain changes seen in IBD and brain morphometry observed in older healthy controls..For the present study, twelve young CDs in remission (M = 26.08 years, SD = 4.9 years, 7 male) were recruited from an IBD Clinic. Data from 12 young age-matched healthy controls (HCs) (24.5 years, SD = 3.6 years, 8 male) and 12 older HCs (59 years, SD = 8 years, 8 male), previously collected for a different study under a similar MR protocol, were analyzed as controls. T1 weighted images and structural image processing techniques were used to extract surface-based brain measures, to test our hypothesis that young CDs have different brain surface morphometry than their age-matched young HCs and furthermore, appear more similar to older HCs. The phonemic verbal fluency (VF) task (the Controlled Oral Word Association Test, COWAT) (Benton, 1976) was administered to test verbal cognitive ability and executive control.On the whole, CDs had more brain regions with differences in brain morphometry measures when compared to the young HCs as compared to the old HCs, suggesting that CD has an effect on the brain that makes it appear more similar to old HCs. Additionally, our study demonstrates this atypical brain morphometry is associated with function on a cognitive task. These results suggest that even younger CDs may be showing some evidence of structural brain changes that demonstrate increased resemblance to older HC brains rather than their similarly aged healthy counterparts.Copyright © 2024 Yeske, Hou, Chu, Adluru, Nair, Beniwal-Patel, Saha and Prabhakaran.",3.11975302639115e-32
38170065,"Cancer cells possess different isotopic enrichment: Isotopic induced functionalizations of normal DNA mutations leading to cancer.","Heliyon","Although the dynamics of telomeres during the life expectancy of normal cells has been extensively studied, there are still some unresolved issues regarding this research field. For example, the conditions required for telomere shortening leading to malignant transformations are not fully understood. In this work, we mass analyzed DNA of normal and cancer cells for comparing telomere isotopic compositions of white blood cells and cancer cells. We have found that the 1327 Da and 1672 Da characteristic telomere mass to charges cause differential mass distributions of about 1 Da among normal cells relative to cancer cells. These isotopic differences are consistent with a prior theory according to which replacing primordial, common isotopes of1H,12C,14N,16O,24Mg,31P and/or32S by nonprimordial, uncommon isotopes of2D,13C,15N,17O,25Mg and/or33S leads to altered enzymatic dynamics. This replacement may subsequently modulate DNA and telomere codons resulting in transformation of normal cells to cancer cells (in 15 N depletion in telomeres dependent manner). The prior theory and the current data are consistent also with a recently observed non-uniform methylation pattern of the DNA of cancer cells relative to a more uniform methylation in the DNA of normal cells. We observe further evidence of nonprimordial isotopic accelerations of acetylations, methylations, hydroxylations and aminations of nucleosides with alterations of phosphorylations of nucleotides; which may explain the induction of mutations at the DNA, RNA and proteins leading to cancer and more general alterations of DNA, which are associated with aging. This difference in mass spectra between normal and cancer DNA may stem from different functionalizations and isotopic enrichments affecting the motion derived from nuclear magnetic moments (NMMs). We suggest that this phenomenon may lead to malignant transformation.© 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2.07522712353127e-32

We introduce a new method, LD SNP-pair effect correlation regression (LDSPEC), to estimate the correlation of causal disease effect sizes of derived alleles between proximal SNPs, depending on their allele frequencies, LD, and functional annotations; LDSPEC produced robust estimates in simulations across various genetic architectures. We applied LDSPEC to 70 diseases and complex traits from the UK Biobank (averageN=306K), meta-analyzing results across diseases/traits. We detected significantly nonzero effect correlations for proximal SNP pairs (e.g., -0.37±0.09 for low-frequency positive-LD 0-100bp SNP pairs) that decayed with distance (e.g., -0.07±0.01 for low-frequency positive-LD 1-10kb), varied with allele frequency (e.g., -0.15±0.04 for common positive-LD 0-100bp), and varied with LD between SNPs (e.g., +0.12±0.05 for common negative-LD 0-100bp) (because we consider derived alleles, positive-LD and negative-LD SNP pairs may yield very different results). We further determined that SNP pairs with shared functions had stronger effect correlations that spanned longer genomic distances, e.g., -0.37±0.08 for low-frequency positive-LD same-gene promoter SNP pairs (average genomic distance of 47kb (due to alternative splicing)) and -0.32±0.04 for low-frequency positive-LD H3K27ac 0-1kb SNP pairs. Consequently, SNP-heritability estimates were substantially smaller than estimates of the sum of causal effect size variances across all SNPs (ratio of 0.87±0.02 across diseases/traits), particularly for certain functional annotations (e.g., 0.78±0.01 for common Super enhancer SNPs)-even though these quantities are widely assumed to be equal. We recapitulated our findings via forward simulations with an evolutionary model involving stabilizing selection, implicating the action of linkage masking, whereby haplotypes containing linked SNPs with opposite effects on disease have reduced effects on fitness and escape negative selection.",1.96690970642998e-32

As to PTSD, the Freeze 2 datasets were originated from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Working Group (PGC-PTSD), and the replicated datasets were obtained from FinnGen consortium. Single nucleotide polymorphisms meeting MR assumptions were selected as instrumental variables. The inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was employed as the main approach, supplemented by sensitivity analyses to evaluate potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity and ensure the robustness of the MR results. We also performed reverse MR analyses to explore PTSD's causal effects on the relative abundances of specific features of the gut microbiome.In Freeze 2 datasets from PGC-PTSD, eight bacterial traits revealed a potential causal association between gut microbiome and PTSD (IVW, all P < 0.05). In addition, Genus.Dorea and genus.Sellimonas were replicated in FinnGen datasets, in which eight bacterial traits revealed a potential causal association between gut microbiome and the occurrence of PTSD. The heterogeneity and pleiotropy analyses further supported the robustness of the IVW findings, providing additional evidence for their reliability.Our study provides the potential causal impact of gut microbiomes on the development of PTSD, shedding new light on the understanding of the dysfunctional gut-brain axis in this disorder. Our findings present novel evidence and call for investigations to confirm the association between their links, as well as to illuminate the underlying mechanisms.© 2024.

38394209,"Identification of the metaphyseal skeletal stem cell building trabecular bone.","Sci Adv","Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) that are capable of self-renewal and multipotent differentiation contribute to bone development and homeostasis. Several populations of SSCs at different skeletal sites have been reported. Here, we identify a metaphyseal SSC (mpSSC) population whose transcriptional landscape is distinct from other bone mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs). These mpSSCs are marked by Sstr2 or Pdgfrb+Kitl-, located just underneath the growth plate, and exclusively derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes (HCs). These HC-derived mpSSCs have properties of self-renewal and multipotency in vitro and in vivo, producing most HC offspring postnatally. HC-specific deletion of Hgs, a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport, impairs the HC-to-mpSSC conversion and compromises trabecular bone formation. Thus, mpSSC is the major source of BMSCs and osteoblasts in bone marrow, supporting the postnatal trabecular bone formation.",1.55143557107276e-32

The role of CaMKIIa+ neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) was explored using chemogenetic silencing and -stimulation. Additionally, the study examined how these effects interacted with the internal state of the animals. Through detailed behavioral analysis, it was demonstrated that CaMKIIa+ neurons in the BNST play a significant role in the regulation of both sexual behavior and sucrose self-administration. Although the behavioral outcome measures differed between the two behaviors, the regulatory role of the CaMKIIa+ neurons in the BNST was found to converge on the modulation of the pacing of engagement in these behaviors in male rats. Moreover, our study confirmed that the internal physiological state of the animal affects how the BNST modulates these behaviors. These findings suggest that different types of natural rewards may recruit a similar brain circuitry to regulate the display of motivated behaviors. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying natural reward seeking and sheds light on the interconnected nature of reward-related behaviors in male rats.© 2024.

38395805,"The genetic architecture of youth anxiety: a study protocol.","BMC Psychiatry","Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric problems among Canadian youth and typically have an onset in childhood or adolescence. They are characterized by high rates of relapse and chronicity, often resulting in substantial impairment across the lifespan. Genetic factors play an important role in the vulnerability toward anxiety disorders. However, genetic contribution to anxiety in youth is not well understood and can change across developmental stages. Large-scale genetic studies of youth are needed with detailed assessments of symptoms of anxiety disorders and their major comorbidities to inform early intervention or preventative strategies and suggest novel targets for therapeutics and personalization of care.The Genetic Architecture of Youth Anxiety (GAYA) study is a Pan-Canadian effort of clinical and genetic experts with specific recruitment sites in Calgary, Halifax, Hamilton, Toronto, and Vancouver. Youth aged 10-19 (n = 13,000) will be recruited from both clinical and community settings and will provide saliva samples, complete online questionnaires on demographics, symptoms of mental health concerns, and behavioural inhibition, and complete neurocognitive tasks. A subset of youth will be offered access to a self-managed Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy resource. Analyses will focus on the identification of novel genetic risk loci for anxiety disorders in youth and assess how much of the genetic risk for anxiety disorders is unique or shared across the life span.Results will substantially inform early intervention or preventative strategies and suggest novel targets for therapeutics and personalization of care. Given that the GAYA study will be the biggest genomic study of anxiety disorders in youth in Canada, this project will further foster collaborations nationally and across the world.© 2024.

Precision engineered tissues with single-cell spatial resolution, therefore, have tremendous potential for next generation disease models, drug discovery, and regenerative therapeutics. Despite significant advancements in biofabrication approaches to improve feature resolution, strategies to fabricate tissues with the exact same organization of individual cells in their native cellular microenvironment have remained virtually non-existent to date. Here we report a method to spatially pattern single cells with up to eight cell phenotypes and subcellular spatial precision. As proof-of-concept we first demonstrate the ability to systematically assess the influence of cellular microenvironments on cell behavior by controllably altering the spatial arrangement of cell types in bioprinted precision cell-cell interaction arrays. We then demonstrate, for the first time, the ability to produce high-fidelity replicas of a patient's annotated cancer biopsy with subcellular resolution. The ability to replicate native cellular microenvironments marks a significant advancement for precision biofabricated in-vitro models, where heterogenous tissues can be engineered with single-cell spatial precision to advance our understanding of complex biological systems in a controlled and systematic manner.",8.92037644162254e-33
38409080,"Selective alterations of endocannabinoid system genes expression in obsessive compulsive disorder.","Transl Psychiatry","Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is listed as one of the top 10 most disabling neuropsychiatric conditions in the world. The neurobiology of OCD has not been completely understood and efforts are needed in order to develop new treatments. Beside the classical neurotransmitter systems and signalling pathways implicated in OCD, the possible involvement of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) has emerged in pathophysiology of OCD. We report here selective downregulation of the genes coding for enzymes allowing the synthesis of the endocannabinoids. We found reduced DAGLα and NAPE-PLD in blood samples of individuals with OCD (when compared to healthy controls) as well as in the amygdala complex and prefrontal cortex of dopamine transporter (DAT) heterozygous rats, manifesting compulsive behaviours. Also mRNA levels of the genes coding for cannabinoid receptors type 1 and type 2 resulted downregulated, respectively in the rat amygdala and in human blood. Moreover, NAPE-PLD changes in gene expression resulted to be associated with an increase in DNA methylation at gene promoter, and the modulation of this gene in OCD appears to be correlated to the progression of the disease. Finally, the alterations observed in ECS genes expression appears to be correlated with the modulation in oxytocin receptor gene expression, consistently with what recently reported. Overall, we confirm here a role for ECS in OCD at both preclinical and clinical level. Many potential biomarkers are suggested among its components, in particular NAPE-PLD, that might be of help for a prompt and clear diagnosis.© 2024. The Author(s).",8.39739077117116e-33
38337682,"Vitamin D and Aging: Central Role of Immunocompetence.","Nutrients","The pro-hormone vitamin D3is an important modulator of both innate and adaptive immunity since its biologically active metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3) regulates via the transcription factor VDR (vitamin D receptor) the epigenome and transcriptome of human immune cells and controls in this way the expression of hundreds of vitamin D target genes. Since the myeloid linage of hematopoiesis is epigenetically programmed by VDR in concert with the pioneer factors PU.1 (purine-rich box 1) and CEBPα (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α), monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells are the most vitamin D-sensitive immune cell types. The central role of the immune system in various aging-related diseases suggests that immunocompetence describes not only the ability of an individual to resist pathogens and parasites but also to contest non-communicative diseases and the process of aging itself. In this review, we argue that the individual-specific responsiveness to vitamin D relates to a person's immunocompetence via the epigenetic programming function of VDR and its ligand 1,25(OH)2D3during hematopoiesis as well as in the periphery. This may provide a mechanism explaining how vitamin D protects against major common diseases and, in parallel, promotes healthy aging.",7.23359306676162e-33

We previously probed pairwise genetic interactions between residues within and surrounding the TL and identified widespread incompatibility between TLs of different species when placed in theSaccharomyces cerevisiaePol II context, indicating epistasis between the TL and its surrounding context. We sought to understand the nature of this incompatibility and probe higher order epistasis internal to the TL. We have employed deep mutational scanning with selected natural TL variants (""haplotypes""), and all possible intermediate substitution combinations between them and the yeast Pol II TL. We identified both positive and negative higher-order residue interactions within example TL haplotypes. Intricate higher-order epistasis formed by TL residues was sometimes only apparent from analysis of intermediate genotypes, emphasizing complexity of epistatic interactions. Furthermore, we distinguished TL substitutions with distinct classes of epistatic patterns, suggesting specific TL residues that potentially influence TL evolution. Our examples of complex residue interactions suggest possible pathways for epistasis to facilitate Pol II evolution.",6.33128202090239e-33
38196638,"A deep learning transformer model predicts high rates of undiagnosed rare disease in large electronic health systems.","medRxiv","It is estimated that as many as 1 in 16 people worldwide suffer from rare diseases. Rare disease patients face difficulty finding diagnosis and treatment for their conditions, including long diagnostic odysseys, multiple incorrect diagnoses, and unavailable or prohibitively expensive treatments. As a result, it is likely that large electronic health record (EHR) systems include high numbers of participants suffering from undiagnosed rare disease. While this has been shown in detail for specific diseases, these studies are expensive and time consuming and have only been feasible to perform for a handful of the thousands of known rare diseases. The bulk of these undiagnosed cases are effectively hidden, with no straightforward way to differentiate them from healthy controls. The ability to access them at scale would enormously expand our capacity to study and develop drugs for rare diseases, adding to tools aimed at increasing availability of study cohorts for rare disease. In this study, we train a deep learning transformer algorithm, RarePT (Rare-Phenotype Prediction Transformer), to impute undiagnosed rare disease from EHR diagnosis codes in 436,407 participants in the UK Biobank and validated on an independent cohort from 3,333,560 individuals from the Mount Sinai Health System. We applied our model to 155 rare diagnosis codes with fewer than 250 cases each in the UK Biobank and predicted participants with elevated risk for each diagnosis, with the number of participants predicted to be at risk ranging from 85 to 22,000 for different diagnoses. These risk predictions are significantly associated with increased mortality for 65% of diagnoses, with disease burden expressed as disability-adjusted life years (DALY) for 73% of diagnoses, and with 72% of available disease-specific diagnostic tests. They are also highly enriched for known rare diagnoses in patients not included in the training set, with an odds ratio (OR) of 48.0 in cross-validation cohorts of the UK Biobank and an OR of 30.6 in the independent Mount Sinai Health System cohort. Most importantly, RarePT successfully screens for undiagnosed patients in 32 rare diseases with available diagnostic tests in the UK Biobank. Using the trained model to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed disease in the UK Biobank for these 32 rare phenotypes, we find that at least 50% of patients remain undiagnosed for 20 of 32 diseases. These estimates provide empirical evidence of a high prevalence of undiagnosed rare disease, as well as demonstrating the enormous potential benefit of using RarePT to screen for undiagnosed rare disease patients in large electronic health systems.",5.84956288686047e-33

Characterizing how genetic variation impacts cell morphology can provide an important link between disease association and cellular function. Here, we combine genomic sequencing and high-content imaging approaches on iPSCs from 297 unique donors to investigate the relationship between genetic variants and cellular morphology to map what we term cell morphological quantitative trait loci (cmQTLs). We identify novel associations between rare protein altering variants in WASF2, TSPAN15, and PRLR with several morphological traits related to cell shape, nucleic granularity, and mitochondrial distribution. Knockdown of these genes by CRISPRi confirms their role in cell morphology. Analysis of common variants yields one significant association and nominate over 300 variants with suggestive evidence (P < 10-6) of association with one or more morphology traits. We then use these data to make predictions about sample size requirements for increasing discovery in cellular genetic studies. We conclude that, similar to molecular phenotypes, morphological profiling can yield insight about the function of genes and variants.© 2024. The Author(s).",5.31476384426881e-33

However, patient responses to DAC are highly variable, and predictive biomarkers are warranted. Herein, the DNA methylation landscape of patients treated with a DAC-based combination regimen was compared with that of patients treated with standard chemotherapy to develop a molecular approach for predicting clinical response to DAC.Twenty-five non-M3 AML patients were enrolled and subjected to DNA methylation sequencing and profiling to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and genes of interest. Moreover, the effects of a DAC-based regimen on apoptosis and gene expression were explored using Kasumi-1 and K562 cells.Overall, we identified 541 DMRs that were specifically responsive to DAC, among which 172 DMRs showed hypomethylation patterns upon treatment and were aligned with the promoter regions of 182 genes. In particular, GNAS was identified as a critical DAC-responsive gene, with in vitro GNAS downregulation leading to reduced cell apoptosis induced by DAC and cytarabine combo treatment.We found that GNAS is a DAC-sensitive gene in AML and may serve as a prognostic biomarker to assess the responsiveness of patients with AML to DAC-based therapy.Copyright © 2024.

Recently, many computational algorithms for predicting cell type composition have been developed, and these methods are typically evaluated on different datasets and performance metrics using diverse techniques. Consequently, the lack of comprehensive and standardized comparative analysis makes it difficult to gain a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. To address this gap, we reviewed 20 cutting-edge unsupervised cell type identification methods and evaluated these methods comprehensively using 24 real scRNA-seq datasets of varying scales. In addition, we proposed a new ensemble cell-type identification method, named scEM, which learns the consensus similarity matrix by applying the entropy weight method to the four representative methods are selected. The Louvain algorithm is adopted to obtain the final classification of individual cells based on the consensus matrix. Extensive evaluation and comparison with 11 other similarity-based methods under real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that the newly developed ensemble algorithm scEM is effective in predicting cellular type composition.© 2024.

We interrogated the role of DNA methylation, an environmentally malleable epigenetic mechanism, in orofacial development. Expression of the key DNA methyltransferase enzyme DNMT1 was detected throughout palate morphogenesis in the epithelium and underlying cranial neural crest cell (cNCC) mesenchyme, a highly proliferative multipotent stem cell population that forms orofacial connective tissue. Genetic and pharmacologic manipulations of DNMT activity were then applied to define the tissue- and timing-dependent requirement of DNA methylation in orofacial development. cNCC-specificDnmt1inactivation targeting initial palate outgrowth resulted in OFCs, while later targeting during palatal shelf elevation and elongation did not. ConditionalDnmt1deletion reduced cNCC proliferation and subsequent differentiation trajectory, resulting in attenuated outgrowth of the palatal shelves and altered development of cNCC-derived skeletal elements. Finally, we found that the cellular mechanisms of cleft pathogenesis observed in vivo can be recapitulated by pharmacologically reducing DNA methylation in multipotent cNCCs cultured in vitro. These findings demonstrate that DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic regulator of cNCC biology, define a critical period of development in which its disruption directly causes OFCs, and provide opportunities to identify environmental influences that contribute to OFC risk.",2.70741192328261e-33

Non-coding sequences that are evolutionarily conserved and biochemically active could offer clues to the mechanisms underpinning GWAS discoveries. However, genetic effects of such sequences have not been systematically examined across a wide range of human tissues and traits, hampering progress to fully understand regulatory causes of human complex traits.Here we develop a simple yet effective strategy to identify functional elements exhibiting high levels of human-mouse sequence conservation and enhancer-like biochemical activity, which scales well to 313 epigenomic datasets across 106 human tissues and cell types. Combined with 468 GWAS of European (EUR) and East Asian (EAS) ancestries, these elements show tissue-specific enrichments of heritability and causal variants for many traits, which are significantly stronger than enrichments based on enhancers without sequence conservation.

However, these findings have not been consistently observed in all studies. We sought to evaluate the causal relationship between circulating glycine levels and atherosclerosis using large-scale genetic analyses in humans and dietary supplementation experiments in mice.Serum glycine levels were evaluated for association with prevalent and incident CAD in the UK Biobank. A multi-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis was carried out to identify genetic determinants for circulating glycine levels, which were then used to evaluate the causal relationship between glycine and risk of CAD by Mendelian randomization (MR). A glycine feeding study was carried out with atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE-/-) mice to determine the effects of increased circulating glycine levels on amino acid metabolism, metabolic traits, and aortic lesion formation.Among 105,718 subjects from the UK Biobank, elevated serum glycine levels were associated with significantly reduced risk of prevalent CAD (Quintile 5 vs. Quintile 1 OR=0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.87; P<0.0001) and incident CAD (Quintile 5 vs. Quintile 1 HR=0.70, 95% CI 0.65-0.77; P<0.0001) in models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering medications, blood pressure, kidney function, and diabetes. A meta-analysis of 13 GWAS datasets (total n=230,947) identified 61 loci for circulating glycine levels, of which 26 were novel. MR analyses provided modest evidence that genetically elevated glycine levels were causally associated with reduced systolic blood pressure and risk of type 2 diabetes, but did provide evidence for an association with risk of CAD. Furthermore, glycine-supplementation inApoE-/-mice did not alter cardiometabolic traits, inflammatory biomarkers, or development of atherosclerotic lesions.Circulating glycine levels were inversely associated with risk of prevalent and incident CAD in a large population-based cohort. While substantially expanding the genetic architecture of circulating glycine levels, MR analyses andin vivofeeding studies in humans and mice, respectively, did not provide evidence that the clinical association of this amino acid with CAD represents a causal relationship, despite being associated with two correlated risk factors.",1.99444807981637e-33

38200245,"Cell cycle gene alterations associate with a redistribution of mutation risk across chromosomal domains in human cancers.","Nat Cancer","Mutations in human cells exhibit increased burden in heterochromatic, late DNA replication time (RT) chromosomal domains, with variation in mutation rates between tissues mirroring variation in heterochromatin and RT. We observed that regional mutation risk further varies between individual tumors in a manner independent of cell type, identifying three signatures of domain-scale mutagenesis in >4,000 tumor genomes. The major signature reflects remodeling of heterochromatin and of the RT program domains seen across tumors, tissues and cultured cells, and is robustly linked with higher expression of cell proliferation genes. Regional mutagenesis is associated with loss of activity of the tumor-suppressor genes RB1 and TP53, consistent with their roles in cell cycle control, with distinct mutational patterns generated by the two genes.

38177678,"DNA methylation restricts coordinated germline and neural fates in embryonic stem cell differentiation.","Nat Struct Mol Biol","As embryonic stem cells (ESCs) transition from naive to primed pluripotency during early mammalian development, they acquire high DNA methylation levels. During this transition, the germline is specified and undergoes genome-wide DNA demethylation, while emergence of the three somatic germ layers is preceded by acquisition of somatic DNA methylation levels in the primed epiblast. DNA methylation is essential for embryogenesis, but the point at which it becomes critical during differentiation and whether all lineages equally depend on it is unclear. Here, using culture modeling of cellular transitions, we found that DNA methylation-free mouse ESCs with triple DNA methyltransferase knockout (TKO) progressed through the continuum of pluripotency states but demonstrated skewed differentiation abilities toward neural versus other somatic lineages. More saliently, TKO ESCs were fully competent for establishing primordial germ cell-like cells, even showing temporally extended and self-sustained capacity for the germline fate. By mapping chromatin states, we found that neural and germline lineages are linked by a similar enhancer dynamic upon exit from the naive state, defined by common sets of transcription factors, including methyl-sensitive ones, that fail to be decommissioned in the absence of DNA methylation. We propose that DNA methylation controls the temporality of a coordinated neural-germline axis of the preferred differentiation route during early development.© 2024.

Here, we selectively knocked out (KO) the transcription factorTbx5in the atrial working myocardium to evaluate its requirement for atrial identity. AtrialTbx5inactivation downregulated atrial cardiomyocyte (aCM) selective gene expression. Using concurrent single nucleus transcriptome and open chromatin profiling, genomic accessibility differences were identified between control andTbx5KO aCMs, revealing that 69% of the control-enriched ATAC regions were bound by TBX5. Genes associated with these regions were downregulated in KO aCMs, suggesting they function as TBX5-dependent enhancers. Comparing enhancer chromatin looping using H3K27ac HiChIP identified 510 chromatin loops sensitive to TBX5 dosage, and 74.8% of control-enriched loops contained anchors in control-enriched ATAC regions. Together, these data demonstrate TBX5 maintains the atrial gene expression program by binding to and preserving the tissue-specific chromatin architecture of atrial enhancers.",1.37022989824483e-33

The radiomics features were extracted from each sequence using Pyradiomics and fused using a multimodal feature fusion classification model based on distance matching and discriminative representation learning to obtain a classification model. The discriminative performance of the classification model for differentiating HGG from SBM was evaluated using five-fold cross-validation with metrics of specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and quantitatively compared with other feature fusion models. Visual experiments were conducted to examine the fused features obtained by the proposed model to validate its feasibility and effectiveness.The five-fold cross-validation results showed that the proposed multimodal feature fusion classification model had a specificity of 0.871, a sensitivity of 0.817, an accuracy of 0.843, and an AUC of 0.930 for distinguishing HGG from SBM. This feature fusion method exhibited excellent discriminative performance in the visual experiments.The proposed multimodal feature fusion classification model has an excellent ability for differentiating HGG from SBM with significant advantages over other feature fusion classification models in discrimination and classification tasks between HGG and SBM.",1.1315280449307e-33
38402365,"Dissecting the genetic overlap between severe mental disorders and markers of cellular aging: Identification of pleiotropic genes and druggable targets.","Neuropsychopharmacology","Patients with severe mental disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) show a substantial reduction in life expectancy, increased incidence of comorbid medical conditions commonly observed with advanced age and alterations of aging hallmarks. While severe mental disorders are heritable, the extent to which genetic predisposition might contribute to accelerated cellular aging is not known. We used bivariate causal mixture models to quantify the trait-specific and shared architecture of mental disorders and 2 aging hallmarks (leukocyte telomere length [LTL] and mitochondrial DNA copy number), and the conjunctional false discovery rate method to detect shared genetic loci. We integrated gene expression data from brain regions from GTEx and used different tools to functionally annotate identified loci and investigate their druggability. Aging hallmarks showed low polygenicity compared with severe mental disorders. We observed a significant negative global genetic correlation between MDD and LTL (rg = -0.14, p = 6.5E-10), and no significant results for other severe mental disorders or for mtDNA-cn. However, conditional QQ plots and bivariate causal mixture models pointed to significant pleiotropy among all severe mental disorders and aging hallmarks. We identified genetic variants significantly shared between LTL and BD (n = 17), SCZ (n = 55) or MDD (n = 19), or mtDNA-cn and BD (n = 4), SCZ (n = 12) or MDD (n = 1), with mixed direction of effects. The exonic rs7909129 variant in the SORCS3 gene, encoding a member of the retromer complex involved in protein trafficking and intracellular/intercellular signaling, was associated with shorter LTL and increased predisposition to all severe mental disorders. Genetic variants underlying risk of SCZ or MDD and shorter LTL modulate expression of several druggable genes in different brain regions. Genistein, a phytoestrogen with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, was an upstream regulator of 2 genes modulated by variants associated with risk of MDD and shorter LTL. While our results suggest that shared heritability might play a limited role in contributing to accelerated cellular aging in severe mental disorders, we identified shared genetic determinants and prioritized different druggable targets and compounds.© 2024.

However, the genetic and non-genetic influences on TMB/CNB and, critically, the manner by which they influence patient outcomes remain poorly understood. Here, we present a large germline-somatic study of TMB/CNB with >23,000 individuals across 17 cancer types, of which 12,000 also have extensive clinical, treatment, and overall survival (OS) measurements available. We report dozens of clinical associations with TMB/CNB, observing older age and male sex to have a strong effect on TMB and weaker impact on CNB. We additionally identified significant germline influences on TMB/CNB, including fine-scale European ancestry and germline polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for smoking, tanning, white blood cell counts, and educational attainment. We quantify the causal effect of exposures on somatic mutational processes using Mendelian randomization. Many of the identified features associated with TMB/CNB were additionally associated with OS for individuals treated at a single tertiary cancer center. For individuals receiving immunotherapy, we observed a complex relationship between PRSs for educational attainment, self-reported college attainment, TMB, and survival, suggesting that the influence of this biomarker may be substantially modified by socioeconomic status. While the accumulation of somatic alterations is a stochastic process, our work demonstrates that it can be shaped by host characteristics including germline genetics.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

Over the last two decades, the advent of AI into numerous aspects of pathology has opened transformative possibilities in how we practise laboratory medicine. Objectives of this study were to explore how AI could impact the clinical practices of professionals working in Clinical Chemistry laboratories, while also identifying effective strategies in medical education to facilitate the required changes.From March to August 2022, an exploratory qualitative study was conducted at the Section of Clinical Chemistry, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan, in collaboration with Keele University, Newcastle, United Kingdom. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect information from diverse group of professionals working in Clinical Chemistry laboratories. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. They were asked what changes AI would involve in the laboratory, what resources would be necessary, and how medical education would assist them in adapting to the change. A content analysis was conducted, resulting in the development of codes and themes based on the analyzed data.The interviews were analysed to identify three primary themes: perspectives and considerations for AI adoption, educational and curriculum adjustments, and implementation techniques. Although the use of diagnostic algorithms is currently limited in Pakistani Clinical Chemistry laboratories, the application of AI is expanding. All thirteen participants stated their reasons for being hesitant to use AI. Participants stressed the importance of critical aspects for effective AI deployment, the need of a collaborative integrative approach, and the need for constant horizon scanning to keep up with AI developments.Three primary themes related to AI adoption were identified: perspectives and considerations, educational and curriculum adjustments, and implementation techniques. The study's findings give a sound foundation for making suggestions to clinical laboratories, scientific bodies, and national and international Clinical Chemistry and laboratory medicine organisations on how to manage pathologists' shifting practises because of AI.© 2024.

38198480,"Joint representation of molecular networks from multiple species improves gene classification.","PLoS Comput Biol","Network-based machine learning (ML) has the potential for predicting novel genes associated with nearly any health and disease context. However, this approach often uses network information from only the single species under consideration even though networks for most species are noisy and incomplete. While some recent methods have begun addressing this shortcoming by using networks from more than one species, they lack one or more key desirable properties: handling networks from more than two species simultaneously, incorporating many-to-many orthology information, or generating a network representation that is reusable across different types of and newly-defined prediction tasks. Here, we present GenePlexusZoo, a framework that casts molecular networks from multiple species into a single reusable feature space for network-based ML. We demonstrate that this multi-species network representation improves both gene classification within a single species and knowledge-transfer across species, even in cases where the inter-species correspondence is undetectable based on shared orthologous genes. Thus, GenePlexusZoo enables effectively leveraging the high evolutionary molecular, functional, and phenotypic conservation across species to discover novel genes associated with diverse biological contexts.Copyright: © 2024 Mancuso et al.

Here, we use single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing to show that LOY is present in the kidney and increases with age and chronic kidney disease.The likelihood of a cell having LOY varies depending on its location in the nephron. Cortical epithelial cell types have a greater proportion of LOY than medullary or glomerular cell types, which may reflect their proliferative history. Proximal tubule cells are the most abundant cell type in the cortex and are susceptible to hypoxic injury. A subset of these cells acquires a pro-inflammatory transcription and chromatin accessibility profile associated with expression of HAVCR1, VCAM1, and PROM1. These injured epithelial cells have the greatest proportion of LOY and their presence predicts future kidney function decline. Moreover, proximal tubule cells with LOY are more likely to harbor additional large chromosomal gains and express pro-survival pathways. Spatial transcriptomics localizes injured proximal tubule cells to a pro-fibrotic microenvironment where they adopt a secretory phenotype and likely communicate with infiltrating immune cells.We hypothesize that LOY is an indicator of increased DNA damage and potential marker of cellular senescence that can be applied to single-cell datasets in other tissues.© 2024.

Integrative omics-based studies have shown the pathology and fundamental molecular characteristics differ significantly and cannot be extrapolated from the more widely studied adult disease. Recent clinical advances in our understanding of paediatric astrocytomas, with the aid of next-generation sequencing and epigenome-wide profiling, have led to the identification of key canonical mutations that vary based on the tumour location and age of onset. These driver mutations, in particular the identification of the recurrent histone H3 mutations in high-grade tumours, have confirmed the important role epigenetic dysregulations play in cancer progression. This review summarises the current updates of the classification, epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical management of paediatric astrocytoma based on their grades and the ongoing clinical trials.

For many Mendelian neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), there is a lack of pre-existing model systems for mechanistic work. Thus, it is critical for translational researchers to have an accessible phenotype- and genotype-informed approach for model system selection. Single-cell RNA sequencing data can be informative in such an approach, as it can indicate which cell types express a gene of interest at the highest levels across time. For Mendelian NDDs, such data for the developing human brain is especially useful. A valuable single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of the second trimester developing human brain was produced by Bhaduri et al in 2021, but access to these data can be limited by computing power and the learning curve of single-cell data analysis. To reduce these barriers for translational research on Mendelian NDDs, we have built the web-based tool, Neurodevelopment in Trimester 2 - VIsualization of Single cell Data Online Tool (NeuroTri2-VISDOT), for exploring this single-cell dataset, and we have employed it in several different settings to demonstrate its utility for the translational research community.",6.74341544805009e-34

Research initially focused on rare hereditary arrhythmias, but over the last two decades, the role of genetic variation (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in heart rate, rhythm, and arrhythmias has been taken into consideration as well. In particular, genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of genomic loci associated with quantitative electrocardiographic traits, atrial fibrillation, and less common arrhythmias such as Brugada syndrome. A significant number of associated variants have been found to systematically localize in non-coding regulatory elements that control the tissue-specific and temporal transcription of genes encoding transcription factors, ion channels, and other proteins. However, the identification of causal variants and the mechanism underlying their impact on phenotype has proven difficult due to the complex tissue-specific, time-resolved, condition-dependent, and combinatorial function of regulatory elements, as well as their modest conservation across different model species.

Forty-two patients received nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks and regorafenib 80 mg daily (3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule). The primary endpoint was the investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). ORR per RECIST version 1.1 was 31.0%, meeting the primary endpoint. The most common adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (38.1%), alopecia (26.2%) and skin rash (23.8%). Median PFS was 7.38 months. The 1-year OS rate was 80.5%, and the median OS was not reached.

However, computational methods for analyzing these high-content images are still emerging, and there is a need for more robust and generalizable tools for evaluating the cellular constituents and underlying stroma captured by high-plex imaging [2]. To address this need, we have adapted spectral angle mapping - an algorithm used widely in hyperspectral image analysis - to compress the channel dimension of high-plex immunofluorescence images. As many high-plex immunofluorescence imaging experiments probe unique sets of protein markers, existing cell and pixel classification models do not typically generalize well. Pseudospectral angle mapping (pSAM) uses reference pseudospectra - or pixel vectors - to assign each pixel in an image a similarity score to several cell class reference vectors, which are defined by each unique staining panel. Here, we demonstrate that the class maps provided by pSAM can directly provide insight into the prevalence of each class defined by reference pseudospectra. In a dataset of high-plex images of colon biopsies from patients with gut autoimmune conditions, sixteen pSAM class representation maps were combined with instance segmentation of cells to provide cell class predictions. Finally, pSAM detected a diverse set of structure and immune cells when applied to a novel dataset of kidney biopsies imaged with a 43-marker panel. In summary, pSAM provides a powerful and readily generalizable method for evaluating high-plex immunofluorescence image data.",4.98686698171652e-34

Programming is particularly important as long-distance movements typically anticipate future environmental conditions. Hence, migration has long been of particular interest in chronobiology. Captivity studies using a proxy, the shift to nocturnality during migration seasons (i.e., migratory restlessness), have revealed circannual and circadian regulation, as well as an innate sense of direction. Thanks to rapid development of tracking technology, detailed information from free-flying birds, including annual-cycle data and actograms, now allows relating this mechanistic background to behaviour in the wild. Likewise, genomic approaches begin to unravel the many physiological pathways that contribute to migration. Despite these advances, it is still unclear how migration programmes are integrated with specific environmental conditions experienced during the journey. Such knowledge is imminently important as temporal environments undergo rapid anthropogenic modification. Migratory birds as a group are not dealing well with the changes, yet some species show remarkable adjustments at behavioural and genetic levels.

38255267,"Carriers of Heterozygous Loss-of-Function ACE Mutations Are at Risk for Alzheimer's Disease.","Biomedicines","We hypothesized that subjects with heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF)ACEmutations are at risk for Alzheimer's disease because amyloid Aβ42, a primary component of the protein aggregates that accumulate in the brains of AD patients, is cleaved by ACE (angiotensin I-converting enzyme). Thus, decreased ACE activity in the brain, either due to genetic mutation or the effects of ACE inhibitors, could be a risk factor for AD. To explore this hypothesis in the current study, existing SNP databases were analyzed for LoFACEmutations using four predicting tools, including PolyPhen-2, and compared with the topology of knownACEmutations already associated with AD. The combined frequency of >400 of these LoF-damagingACEmutations in the general population is quite significant-up to 5%-comparable to the frequency of AD in the population > 70 y.o., which indicates that the contribution of low ACE in the development of AD could be under appreciated. Our analysis suggests several mechanisms by which ACE mutations may be associated with Alzheimer's disease. Systematic analysis of blood ACE levels in patients with allACEmutations is likely to have clinical significance because available sequencing data will help detect persons with increased risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Patients with transport-deficientACEmutations (about 20% of damaging ACE mutations) may benefit from preventive or therapeutic treatment with a combination of chemical and pharmacological (e.g., centrally acting ACE inhibitors) chaperones and proteosome inhibitors to restore impaired surface ACE expression, as was shown previously by our group for another transport-deficient ACE mutation-Q1069R.",4.19983748521299e-34

Successful identification of these patterns depends on both the statistical approach and the quality of sequencing. To address this challenge, at first, a new statistical method called LD-ABF was developed, employing efficient Bayesian techniques to effectively test for balancing selection. LD-ABF demonstrated the most robust detection of selection in a variety of simulation scenarios, compared against a range of existing tests/tools (Tajima's D, HKA, Dng, BetaScan, and BalLerMix). Furthermore, the impact of the quality of sequencing on detection of balancing selection was explored, as well, using: (i) SNP genotyping and exome data, (ii) targeted high-resolution HLA genotyping (IHIW), and (iii) whole-genome long-read sequencing data (Pangenome). In the analysis of SNP genotyping and exome data, we identified known targets and 38 new selection signatures in genes not previously linked to balancing selection. To further investigate the impact of sequencing quality on detection of balancing selection, a detailed investigation of the MHC was performed with high-resolution HLA typing data. Higher quality sequencing revealed the HLA-DQ genes consistently demonstrated strong selection signatures otherwise not observed from the sparser SNP array and exome data. The HLA-DQ selection signature was also replicated in the Pangenome samples using considerably less samples but, with high-quality long-read sequence data. The improved statistical method, coupled with higher quality sequencing, leads to more consistent identification of selection and enhanced localization of variants under selection, particularly in complex regions.© The Author(s) 2024.

Recent studies reported the importance of understanding the cooperation and function of SE internal components, i.e., the constituent enhancers (CE). However, there are no pan-cancer studies to identify cancer-specific SE signatures at the constituent level. Here, by revisiting pan-cancer SE activities with H3K27Ac ChIP-seq datasets, we report fingerprint SE signatures for 28 cancer types in the NCI-60 cell panel. We implement a mixture model to discriminate active CEs from inactive CEs by taking into consideration ChIP-seq variabilities between cancer samples and across CEs. We demonstrate that the model-based estimation of CE states provides improved functional interpretation of SE-associated regulation. We identify cancer-specific CEs by balancing their active prevalence with their capability of encoding cancer type identities. We further demonstrate that cancer-specific CEs have the strongest per-base enhancer activities in independent enhancer sequencing assays, suggesting their importance in understanding critical SE signatures. We summarize fingerprint SEs based on the cancer-specific statuses of their component CEs and build an easy-to-use R package to facilitate the query, exploration, and visualization of fingerprint SEs across cancers.Copyright: © 2024 Liu et al.

38253266,"Deciphering cell states and genealogies of human haematopoiesis.","Nature","The human blood system is maintained through the differentiation and massive amplification of a limited number of long-lived haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)1. Perturbations to this process underlie diverse diseases, but the clonal contributions to human haematopoiesis and how this changes with age remain incompletely understood. Although recent insights have emerged from barcoding studies in model systems2-5, simultaneous detection of cell states and phylogenies from natural barcodes in humans remains challenging. Here we introduce an improved, single-cell lineage-tracing system based on deep detection of naturally occurring mitochondrial DNA mutations with simultaneous readout of transcriptional states and chromatin accessibility. We use this system to define the clonal architecture of HSCs and map the physiological state and output of clones. We uncover functional heterogeneity in HSC clones, which is stable over months and manifests as both differences in total HSC output and biases towards the production of different mature cell types. We also find that the diversity of HSC clones decreases markedly with age, leading to an oligoclonal structure with multiple distinct clonal expansions. Our study thus provides a clonally resolved and cell-state-aware atlas of human haematopoiesis at single-cell resolution, showing an unappreciated functional diversity of human HSC clones and, more broadly, paving the way for refined studies of clonal dynamics across a range of tissues in human health and disease.© 2024.

However, the exact mechanism remains unknown.The study population consisted of IBD and Ps genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. Genetic correlations were first evaluated. Then, the overall evaluation employed LD score regression (LDSC), while the local assessment utilized heritability estimation from summary statistics (HESS). Causality assessment was conducted through two-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR), and genetic overlap analysis utilized the conditional false discovery rate/conjunctional FDR (cond/conjFDR) method. Finally, LDSC applied to specifically expressed genes (LDSC-SEG) was performed at the tissue level. For IBD and Ps-specific expressed genes, genetic correlation, causality, shared genetics, and trait-specific associated tissues were methodically examined.At the genomic level, both overall and local genetic correlations were found between IBD and Ps. MR analysis indicated a positive causal relationship between Ps and IBD. The conjFDR analysis with a threshold of < 0.01 identified 43 loci shared between IBD and Ps. Subsequent investigations into disease-associated tissues indicated a close association of IBD and Ps with whole blood, lung, spleen, and EBV-transformed lymphocytes.The current research offers a novel perspective on the association between IBD and Ps.

We previously identified that circGlis3, a circRNA derived from exon 4 of the diabetes susceptibility geneGlis3, was upregulated in lipotoxic β cells. However, the functional role and molecular mechanism of circGlis3 in β cells remain largely unknown. Here, we revealed that the splicing factor CUGBP Elav-Like Family Member 1 (CELF1) facilitated the biogenesis of circGlis3. Moreover, we established a transgenic mouse model and confirmed that the overexpression of circGlis3 impaired β-cell function. Mechanistically, circGlis3 bound to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein F (hnRNPF) and blocked its nuclear translocation, thereby reducingSirt1levels. Additionally, circGlis3 encoded a 348aa protein that interacted with GLIS3 and inhibited its transcriptional activity.

However, for many wild populations, removal of related individuals from the data would result in small sample sizes. In 2013, Zaitlen et al. proposed a method to estimate heritability in populations that include close relatives by simultaneously fitting an identity-by-state (IBS) genomic relatedness matrix (GRM) and an identity-by-descent (IBD) GRM. The IBD GRM is identical to the IBS GRM, except relatedness estimates below a specified threshold are set to 0. We applied this method to a sample of 8557 wild Soay sheep from St. Kilda, with genotypic information for 419,281 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We aimed to see how this method would partition heritability into population-level (IBS) and family-associated (IBD) variance for a range of genetic architectures, and so we focused on a mixture of polygenic and monogenic traits. We also implemented a variant of the model in which the IBD GRM was replaced by a GRM constructed from SNPs with low minor allele frequency to examine whether any additive genetic variance is captured by rare alleles. Whilst the inclusion of the IBD GRM did not significantly improve the fit of the model for the monogenic traits, it improved the fit for some of the polygenic traits, suggesting that dominance, epistasis and/or common environment not already captured by the non-genetic random effects fitted in our models may influence these traits.© 2024.

To elucidate the underlying mechanism behind this variability, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the anti-spike IgG serostatus of UK Biobank participants who were previously uninfected by SARS-CoV-2 and had received either the first dose (n = 54,066) or the second dose (n = 46,232) of COVID-19 vaccines. Our analysis revealed significant genome-wide associations between the IgG antibody serostatus following the initial vaccine and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles. Specifically, the HLA-DRB1∗13:02 allele (MAF = 4.0%, OR = 0.75, p = 2.34e-16) demonstrated the most statistically significant protective effect against IgG seronegativity. This protective effect was driven by an alteration from arginine (Arg) to glutamic acid (Glu) at position 71 on HLA-DRβ1 (p = 1.88e-25), leading to a change in the electrostatic potential of pocket 4 of the peptide binding groove. Notably, the impact of HLA alleles on IgG responses was cell type specific, and we observed a shared genetic predisposition between IgG status and susceptibility/severity of COVID-19. These results were replicated within independent cohorts where IgG serostatus was assayed by two different antibody serology tests. Our findings provide insights into the biological mechanism underlying individual variation in responses to COVID-19 vaccines and highlight the need to consider the influence of constitutive genetics when designing vaccination strategies for optimizing protection and control of infectious disease across diverse populations.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

Here, we combine persistent labeling with time-series single-cell RNA sequencing to build a real-time, quantitative model of in vivo tissue dynamics for murine bone marrow hematopoiesis. We couple cascading single-cell expression patterns with dynamic changes in differentiation and growth speeds. The resulting explicit linkage between molecular states and cellular behavior reveals widely varying self-renewal and differentiation properties across distinct lineages. Transplanted stem cells show strong acceleration of differentiation at specific stages of erythroid and neutrophil production, illustrating how the model can quantify the impact of perturbations.

High-throughputin vitrobinding assays coupled with computational analysis have made it possible to accurately define such sequence recognition in a biophysically interpretable yet mechanism-agonistic way for individual TFs. The fact that such sequence-to-affinity models are now available for hundreds of TFs provides new avenues for predicting how the DNA binding specificity of a TF changes when its protein sequence is mutated. To this end, we developed an analytical framework based on a tetrahedron embedding that can be applied at the level of a given structural TF family. Using bHLH as a test case, we demonstrate that we can systematically map dependencies between the protein sequence of a TF and base preference within the DNA binding site. We also develop a regression approach to predict the quantitative energetic impact of mutations in the DNA binding domain of a TF on its DNA binding specificity, and perform SELEX-seq assays on mutated TFs to experimentally validate our results. Our results point to the feasibility of predicting the functional impact of disease mutations and allelic variation in the cell-wide TF repertoire by leveraging high-quality functional information across sets of homologous wild-type proteins.",1.12363254086084e-34

38187631,"RNA polymerases reshape chromatin and coordinate transcription on individual fibers.","bioRxiv","During eukaryotic transcription, RNA polymerases must initiate and pause within a crowded, complex environment, surrounded by nucleosomes and other transcriptional activity. This environment creates a spatial arrangement along individual chromatin fibers ripe for both competition and coordination, yet these relationships remain largely unknown owing to the inherent limitations of traditional structural and sequencing methodologies. To address these limitations, we employed long-read chromatin fiber sequencing (Fiber-seq) to visualize RNA polymerases within their native chromatin context at single-molecule and near single-nucleotide resolution along up to 30 kb fibers. We demonstrate that Fiber-seq enables the identification of single-molecule RNA Polymerase (Pol) II and III transcription associated footprints, which, in aggregate, mirror bulk short-read sequencing-based measurements of transcription. We show that Pol II pausing destabilizes downstream nucleosomes, with frequently paused genes maintaining a short-term memory of these destabilized nucleosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrate pervasive direct coordination and anti-coordination between nearby Pol II genes, Pol III genes, transcribed enhancers, and insulator elements. This coordination is largely limited to spatially organized elements within 5 kb of each other, implicating short-range chromatin environments as a predominant determinant of coordinated polymerase initiation. Overall, transcription initiation reshapes surrounding nucleosome architecture and coordinates nearby transcriptional machinery along individual chromatin fibers.",8.33801432050715e-35

The role of ferroptosis, a type of cell death linked to oxidative stress, in AA is yet to be explored, even though it's implicated in various diseases. Using transcriptome data from AA patients and controls from datasets GSE68801 and GSE80342, we aimed to identify AA diagnostic marker genes linked to ferroptosis. We employed Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) for immune cell infiltration evaluation. Correlations between ferroptosis-related differentially expressed genes (FRDEGs) and immune cells/functions were identified using Spearman analysis. Feature selection was done through Support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and LASSO regression models. Validation was performed using the GSE80342 dataset, followed by hierarchical internal validation. We also constructed a nomogram to assess the predictive ability of FRDEGs in AA. Furthermore, the expression and distribution of these molecules were confirmed through immunofluorescence. Four genes, namely SLC40A1, LCN2, CREB5, and SLC7A11, were identified as markers for AA. A prediction model based on these genes showed high accuracy (AUC = 0.9052). Immunofluorescence revealed reduced expression of these molecules in AA patients compared to normal controls (NC), with SLC40A1 and CREB5 showing significant differences. Notably, they were primarily localized to the outer root sheath and in proximity to the sebaceous glands. Our study identified several ferroptosis-related genes associated with AA.

However, its potential as a target to counteract therapy resistance remains largely unaddressed. Here, we show that epigenetic therapy with decitabine (5-Aza-mC) suppresses tumor growth in xenograft models of pre-clinical metastatic estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast tumor. Decitabine-induced genome-wide DNA hypomethylation results in large-scale 3D epigenome deregulation, including de-compaction of higher-order chromatin structure and loss of boundary insulation of topologically associated domains. Significant DNA hypomethylation associates with ectopic activation of ER-enhancers, gain in ER binding, creation of new 3D enhancer-promoter interactions and concordant up-regulation of ER-mediated transcription pathways. Importantly, long-term withdrawal of epigenetic therapy partially restores methylation at ER-enhancer elements, resulting in a loss of ectopic 3D enhancer-promoter interactions and associated gene repression. Our study illustrates the potential of epigenetic therapy to target ER+ endocrine-resistant breast cancer by DNA methylation-dependent rewiring of 3D chromatin interactions, which are associated with the suppression of tumor growth.© 2024.

This study primarily aimed to perform preliminary screening of genes associated with streptomycin resistance through conjoint analysis of multiple genomics. Genome-wide methylation, transcriptome, and proteome analyses were used to elucidate the associations between specific genes and streptomycin resistance in M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Methylation analysis revealed that 188 genes were differentially methylated between the SM-resistant and normal groups, with 89 and 99 genes being hypermethylated and hypomethylated, respectively. Furthermore, functional analysis revealed that these 188 differentially methylated genes were enriched in 74 pathways, with most of them being enriched in metabolic pathways. Transcriptome analysis revealed that 516 genes were differentially expressed between the drug-resistant and normal groups, with 263 and 253 genes being significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. KEGG analysis indicated that these 516 genes were enriched in 79 pathways, with most of them being enriched in histidine metabolism. The methylation level was negatively related to mRNA abundance. Proteome analysis revealed 56 differentially expressed proteins, including 14 upregulated and 42 downregulated proteins. Moreover, three hub genes (coaE, fadE5, and mprA) were obtained using synthetic analysis.

In vitro screening of different editor designs indicated that zinc-finger proteins were the best-performing DNA-binding platform for efficient silencing of mouse Pcsk9. A single administration of lipid nanoparticles loaded with the editors' mRNAs almost halved the circulating levels of PCSK9 for nearly one year in mice. Notably, Pcsk9 silencing and accompanying epigenetic repressive marks also persisted after forced liver regeneration, further corroborating the heritability of the newly installed epigenetic state. Improvements in construct design resulted in the development of an all-in-one configuration that we term evolved engineered transcriptional repressor (EvoETR). This design, which is characterized by a high specificity profile, further reduced the circulating levels of PCSK9 in mice with an efficiency comparable with that obtained through conventional gene editing, but without causing DNA breaks.

However, due to biological differences between species, translating these findings into human applications remains challenging. Moreover, commonly used orthologous gene information is often incomplete and entails a significant information loss during gene-id conversion. To address these issues, we present a novel methodology for species-agnostic transfer learning with heterogeneous domain adaptation. We extended the cross-domain structure-preserving projection toward out-of-sample prediction. Our approach not only allows knowledge integration and translation across various species without relying on gene orthology but also identifies similar GO among the most influential genes composing the latent space for integration. Subsequently, during the alignment of latent spaces, each composed of species-specific genes, it is possible to identify functional annotations of genes missing from public orthology databases. We evaluated our approach with four different single-cell sequencing datasets focusing on cell-type prediction and compared it against related machine-learning approaches. In summary, the developed model outperforms related methods working without prior knowledge when predicting unseen cell types based on other species' data. The results demonstrate that our novel approach allows knowledge transfer beyond species barriers without the dependency on known gene orthology but utilizing the entire gene sets.© The Author(s) 2024.

Gene expression provides a promising opportunity for studying the molecular basis of brain evolution, but it has been explored in very few primate species to date (e.g. Khaitovich et al., 2005; Khrameeva et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2022; Somel et al., 2009). To understand the landscape of gene expression evolution across the primate lineage, we generated and analyzed RNA-seq data from four brain regions in an unprecedented eighteen species. Here, we show a remarkable level of variation in gene expression among hominid species, including humans and chimpanzees, despite their relatively recent divergence time from other primates. We found that individual genes display a wide range of expression dynamics across evolutionary time reflective of the diverse selection pressures acting on genes within primate brain tissue. Using our samples that represent a 190-fold difference in primate brain size, we identified genes with variation in expression most correlated with brain size.

To address this gap, we analyzed single-cell glycogene expressions in the Tabula Sapiens dataset of human tissues and cell types using a recent glycosylation-specific gene ontology (GlycoEnzOnto). At the median sequencing (count) depth, ~40-50 out of 400 glycogenes were detected in individual cells. Upon increasing the sequencing depth, the number of detectable glycogenes saturates at ~200 glycogenes, suggesting that the average human cell expresses about half of the glycogene repertoire. Hierarchies in glycogene and glycopathway expressions emerged from our analysis: nucleotide-sugar synthesis and transport exhibited the highest gene expressions, followed by genes for core enzymes, glycan modification and extensions, and finally terminal modifications. Interestingly, the same cell types showed variable glycopathway expressions based on their organ or tissue origin, suggesting nuanced cell- and tissue-specific glycosylation patterns. Probing deeper into the transcription factors (TFs) of glycogenes, we identified distinct groupings of TFs controlling different aspects of glycosylation: core biosynthesis, terminal modifications, etc. We present webtools to explore the interconnections across glycogenes, glycopathways, and TFs regulating glycosylation in human cell/tissue types. Overall, the study presents an overview of glycosylation across multiple human organ systems.",4.14506481499096e-35
38201283,"Epigenetic Regulation of Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's Disease.","Cells","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease and clinically manifests with cognitive decline and behavioral disabilities. Over the past years, mounting studies have demonstrated that the inflammatory response plays a key role in the onset and development of AD, and neuroinflammation has been proposed as the third major pathological driving factor of AD, ranking after the two well-known core pathologies, amyloid β (Aβ) deposits and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Epigenetic mechanisms, referring to heritable changes in gene expression independent of DNA sequence alterations, are crucial regulators of neuroinflammation which have emerged as potential therapeutic targets for AD. Upon regulation of transcriptional repression or activation, epigenetic modification profiles are closely involved in inflammatory gene expression and signaling pathways of neuronal differentiation and cognitive function in central nervous system disorders. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about epigenetic control mechanisms with a focus on DNA and histone modifications involved in the regulation of inflammatory genes and signaling pathways in AD, and the inhibitors under clinical assessment are also discussed.",3.76647093242187e-35

The objective of this study was to take a fresh look at neonatal intestinal disease classification using unsupervised machine learning.Patients admitted to the University of Florida Shands Neonatal Intensive Care Unit January 2013-September 2019 diagnosed with an intestinal injury, or had imaging findings of portal venous gas, pneumatosis, abdominal free air, or had an abdominal drain placed or exploratory laparotomy during admission were included. Congenital gastroschisis, omphalocele, intestinal atresia, malrotation were excluded. Data was collected via retrospective chart review with subsequent hierarchal, unsupervised clustering analysis.Five clusters of intestinal injury were identified: Cluster 1 deemed the ""Low Mortality"" cluster, Cluster 2 deemed the ""Mature with Inflammation"" cluster, Cluster 3 deemed the ""Immature with High Mortality"" cluster, Cluster 4 deemed the ""Late Injury at Full Feeds"" cluster, and Cluster 5 deemed the ""Late Injury with High Rate of Intestinal Necrosis"" cluster.Unsupervised machine learning can be used to cluster acquired neonatal intestinal injuries. Future study with larger multicenter datasets is needed to further refine and classify types of intestinal diseases.Unsupervised machine learning can be used to cluster types of acquired neonatal intestinal injury. Five major clusters of acquired neonatal intestinal injury are described, each with unique features. The clusters herein described deserve future, multicenter study to determine more specific early biomarkers and tailored therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes of often devastating neonatal acquired intestinal injuries.© 2024.

38170777,"Transcriptional determinants of lipid mobilization in human adipocytes.","Sci Adv","Defects in adipocyte lipolysis drive multiple aspects of cardiometabolic disease, but the transcriptional framework controlling this process has not been established. To address this, we performed a targeted perturbation screen in primary human adipocytes. Our analyses identified 37 transcriptional regulators of lipid mobilization, which we classified as (i) transcription factors, (ii) histone chaperones, and (iii) mRNA processing proteins. On the basis of its strong relationship with multiple readouts of lipolysis in patient samples, we performed mechanistic studies on one hit,ZNF189, which encodes the zinc finger protein 189. Using mass spectrometry and chromatin profiling techniques, we show that ZNF189 interacts with the tripartite motif family member TRIM28 and represses the transcription of an adipocyte-specific isoform of phosphodiesterase 1B (PDE1B2). The regulation of lipid mobilization by ZNF189 requires PDE1B2, and the overexpression of PDE1B2 is sufficient to attenuate hormone-stimulated lipolysis. Thus, our work identifies the ZNF189-PDE1B2 axis as a determinant of human adipocyte lipolysis and highlights a link between chromatin architecture and lipid mobilization.",2.44755074210192e-35

Identifying genetic mechanisms underlying these traits requires pinpointing the relevant cell types, regulatory elements, target genes, and causal variants. Here, we used genetic multiplexing to generate population-scale single nucleus (sn) chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq) and transcriptome (snRNA-seq) maps across 287 frozen human skeletal muscle biopsies representing 456,880 nuclei. We identified 13 cell types that collectively represented 983,155 ATAC summits. We integrated genetic variation to discover 6,866 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and 100,928 chromatin accessibility QTL (caQTL) (5% FDR) across the five most abundant cell types, cataloging caQTL peaks that atlas-level snATAC maps often miss. We identified 1,973 eGenes colocalized with caQTL and used mediation analyses to construct causal directional maps for chromatin accessibility and gene expression. 3,378 genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals across 43 relevant traits colocalized with sn-e/caQTL, 52% in a cell-specific manner. 77% of GWAS signals colocalized with caQTL and not eQTL, highlighting the critical importance of population-scale chromatin profiling for GWAS functional studies. GWAS-caQTL colocalization showed distinct cell-specific regulatory paradigms. For example, aC2CD4A/BT2D GWAS signal colocalized with caQTL in muscle fibers and multiple chromatin loop models nominatedVPS13C, a glucose uptake gene. Sequence of the caQTL peak overlapping caSNP rs7163757 showed allelic regulatory activity differences in a human myocyte cell line massively parallel reporter assay.

38396040,"rMATS-turbo: an efficient and flexible computational tool for alternative splicing analysis of large-scale RNA-seq data.","Nat Protoc","Pre-mRNA alternative splicing is a prevalent mechanism for diversifying eukaryotic transcriptomes and proteomes. Regulated alternative splicing plays a role in many biological processes, and dysregulated alternative splicing is a feature of many human diseases. Short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is now the standard approach for transcriptome-wide analysis of alternative splicing. Since 2011, our laboratory has developed and maintained Replicate Multivariate Analysis of Transcript Splicing (rMATS), a computational tool for discovering and quantifying alternative splicing events from RNA-seq data. Here we provide a protocol for the contemporary version of rMATS, rMATS-turbo, a fast and scalable re-implementation that maintains the statistical framework and user interface of the original rMATS software, while incorporating a revamped computational workflow with a substantial improvement in speed and data storage efficiency. The rMATS-turbo software scales up to massive RNA-seq datasets with tens of thousands of samples. To illustrate the utility of rMATS-turbo, we describe two representative application scenarios. First, we describe a broadly applicable two-group comparison to identify differential alternative splicing events between two sample groups, including both annotated and novel alternative splicing events. Second, we describe a quantitative analysis of alternative splicing in a large-scale RNA-seq dataset (~1,000 samples), including the discovery of alternative splicing events associated with distinct cell states. We detail the workflow and features of rMATS-turbo that enable efficient parallel processing and analysis of large-scale RNA-seq datasets on a compute cluster. We anticipate that this protocol will help the broad user base of rMATS-turbo make the best use of this software for studying alternative splicing in diverse biological systems.© 2024.

38326303,"Androgen drives melanoma invasiveness and metastatic spread by inducing tumorigenic fucosylation.","Nat Commun","Melanoma incidence and mortality rates are historically higher for men than women. Although emerging studies have highlighted tumorigenic roles for the male sex hormone androgen and its receptor (AR) in melanoma, cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these sex-associated discrepancies are poorly defined. Here, we delineate a previously undisclosed mechanism by which androgen-activated AR transcriptionally upregulates fucosyltransferase 4 (FUT4) expression, which drives melanoma invasiveness by interfering with adherens junctions (AJs). Global phosphoproteomic and fucoproteomic profiling, coupled with in vitro and in vivo functional validation, further reveal that AR-induced FUT4 fucosylates L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), which is required for FUT4-increased metastatic capacity. Tumor microarray and gene expression analyses demonstrate that AR-FUT4-L1CAM-AJs signaling correlates with pathological staging in melanoma patients. By delineating key androgen-triggered signaling that enhances metastatic aggressiveness, our findings help explain sex-associated clinical outcome disparities and highlight AR/FUT4 and its effectors as potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in melanoma.© 2024.

Dysregulated CRE and SCRE activities have been reported to alter the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, thereby regulating cancer hallmarks. To address the strong need for a comprehensive catalogue of dysregulated CREs and SCREs in human cancers, we present TSCRE (http://tscre.zsqylab.com/), an open resource providing tumor-specific and cell type-specific CREs and SCREs derived from the re-analysis of publicly available histone modification profiles. Currently, TSCRE contains 1 864 941 dysregulated CREs and 68 253 dysregulated SCREs identified from 1366 human patient samples spanning 17 different cancer types and 9 histone marks. Over 95% of these elements have been validated in public resources. TSCRE offers comprehensive annotations for each element, including associated genes, expression patterns, clinical prognosis, somatic mutations, transcript factor binding sites, cancer-type specificity, and drug response. Additionally, TSCRE integrates pathway and transcript factor enrichment analyses for each study, enabling in-depth functional and mechanistic investigations.

Factors including DNA methylation patterns, an intricate process in sperm cells, have an impact on the production of quality semen in buffalo bulls under abiotic stress conditions. The present study was conducted to identify DNA methylome signatures for semen quality in Murrah buffalo bulls, acclaimed as a major dairy breed globally, under summer heat stress. Based on semen quality parameters that significantly varied between the two groups over the seasons, the breeding bulls were classified into seasonally affected (SA = 6) and seasonally non-affected (SNA = 6) categories. DNA was isolated from purified sperm cells and sequenced using the RRBS (Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing) technique for genome-wide methylome data generation. During the hot summer months, the physiological parameters such as scrotal surface temperature, rectal temperature, and respiration rate for both the SA and SNA bulls were significantly higher in the afternoon than in the morning. Whereas, the global CpG% of SA bulls was positively correlated with the afternoon's scrotal surface and rectal temperature. The RRBS results conveyed differentially methylated cytosines in the promoter region of the genes encoding the channels responsible for Ca2+exchange, NPTN, Ca2+activated chloride channels, ANO1, and a few structure-related units such as septins (SEPT4 and SEPT6), SPATA, etc. Additionally, the hypermethylated set of genes in SA was significantly enriched for pathways such as the FOXO signaling pathway and oocyte meiosis. The methylation patterns suggest promoter methylation in the genes regulating the sperm structure as well as surface transporters, which could contribute to the reduced semen quality in the Murrah buffalo bulls during the season-related heat stress.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

38177314,"Evolutionary insights from profiling LINE-1 activity at allelic resolution in a single human genome.","EMBO J","Transposable elements have created the majority of the sequence in many genomes. In mammals, LINE-1 retrotransposons have been expanding for more than 100 million years as distinct, consecutive lineages; however, the drivers of this recurrent lineage emergence and disappearance are unknown. Most human genome assemblies provide a record of this ancient evolution, but fail to resolve ongoing LINE-1 retrotranspositions. Utilizing the human CHM1 long-read-based haploid assembly, we identified and cloned all full-length, intact LINE-1s, and found 29 LINE-1s with measurable in vitro retrotransposition activity. Among individuals, these LINE-1s varied in their presence, their allelic sequences, and their activity. We found that recently retrotransposed LINE-1s tend to be active in vitro and polymorphic in the population relative to more ancient LINE-1s. However, some rare allelic forms of old LINE-1s retain activity, suggesting older lineages can persist longer than expected. Finally, in LINE-1s with in vitro activity and in vivo fitness, we identified mutations that may have increased replication in ancient genomes and may prove promising candidates for mechanistic investigations of the drivers of LINE-1 evolution and which LINE-1 sequences contribute to human disease.© 2023.

Here, we perform interaction proteomics for 11 CAD-risk genes to map their protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in human vascular cells and elucidate their roles in CAD. The resulting PPI networks contain interactions that are outside of known biology in the vasculature and are enriched for genes involved in immunity-related and arterial-wall-specific mechanisms. Several PPI networks derived from smooth muscle cells are significantly enriched for genetic variants associated with CAD and related vascular phenotypes. Furthermore, the networks identify 61 genes that are found in genetic loci associated with risk of CAD, prioritizing them as the causal candidates within these loci. These findings indicate that the PPI networks we have generated are a rich resource for guiding future research into the molecular pathogenesis of CAD.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.3680882700469e-35
38317984,"Rare and common genetic determinants of mitochondrial function determine severity but not risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","Heliyon","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease involving selective vulnerability of energy-intensive motor neurons (MNs). It has been unclear whether mitochondrial function is an upstream driver or a downstream modifier of neurotoxicity. We separated upstream genetic determinants of mitochondrial function, including genetic variation within the mitochondrial genome or autosomes; from downstream changeable factors including mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtCN). Across three cohorts including 6,437 ALS patients, we discovered that a set of mitochondrial haplotypes, chosen because they are linked to measurements of mitochondrial function, are a determinant of ALS survival following disease onset, but do not modify ALS risk. One particular haplotype appeared to be neuroprotective and was significantly over-represented in two cohorts of long-surviving ALS patients. Causal inference for mitochondrial function was achievable using mitochondrial haplotypes, but not autosomal SNPs in traditional Mendelian randomization (MR). Furthermore, rare loss-of-function genetic variants within, and reduced MN expression of, ACADM and DNA2 lead to ∼50 % shorter ALS survival; both proteins are implicated in mitochondrial function. Both mtCN and cellular vulnerability are linked to DNA2 function in ALS patient-derived neurons. Finally, MtCN responds dynamically to the onset of ALS independently of mitochondrial haplotype, and is correlated with disease severity. We conclude that, based on the genetic measures we have employed, mitochondrial function is a therapeutic target for amelioration of disease severity but not prevention of ALS.© 2024 The Authors.",1.35983772431762e-35

Our review encompassed the applications of metabolic modelling in the theoretical investigation of the origin of life within prebiotic environments, as well as the compilation of existing uses of genome-scale metabolic models of extremophiles. Furthermore, we emphasize the current challenges associated with applying this technique in extreme environments, and conclude this review by discussing the potential implementation of metabolic models to explore theoretically optimal metabolic networks under various space conditions.

38374212,"Pleiotropic contribution of rbfox1 to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental phenotypes in two zebrafish models.","Transl Psychiatry","RBFOX1 is a highly pleiotropic gene that contributes to several psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Both rare and common variants in RBFOX1 have been associated with several psychiatric conditions, but the mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of RBFOX1 are not yet understood. Here we found that, in zebrafish, rbfox1 is expressed in spinal cord, mid- and hindbrain during developmental stages. In adults, expression is restricted to specific areas of the brain, including telencephalic and diencephalic regions with an important role in receiving and processing sensory information and in directing behaviour. To investigate the contribution of rbfox1 to behaviour, we used rbfox1sa15940, a zebrafish mutant line with TL background. We found that rbfox1sa15940mutants present hyperactivity, thigmotaxis, decreased freezing behaviour and altered social behaviour. We repeated these behavioural tests in a second rbfox1 mutant line with a different genetic background (TU), rbfox1del19, and found that rbfox1 deficiency affects behaviour similarly in this line, although there were some differences. rbfox1del19mutants present similar thigmotaxis, but stronger alterations in social behaviour and lower levels of hyperactivity than rbfox1sa15940fish. Taken together, these results suggest that mutations in rbfox1 lead to multiple behavioural changes in zebrafish that might be modulated by environmental, epigenetic and genetic background effects, and that resemble phenotypic alterations present in Rbfox1-deficient mice and in patients with different psychiatric conditions. Our study, thus, highlights the evolutionary conservation of rbfox1 function in behaviour and paves the way to further investigate the mechanisms underlying rbfox1 pleiotropy on the onset of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.© 2024.

Further understanding of ethanol-related cell damage can contribute to reducing or treating alcohol-related cancers. Here, we investigated the effects of both short- and long-term exposure of human laryngeal epithelial cells to different ethanol concentrations. RNA sequencing shows that ethanol altered gene expression patterns in a time- and concentration-dependent way, affecting genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, cytoskeleton remodeling, Wnt signaling, and transmembrane ion transport. Additionally, ethanol induced a slower cell proliferation, a delayed cell cycle progression, and replication fork stalling. In addition, ethanol exposure resulted in morphological changes, which could be associated with membrane stress.

38390378,"Modifications to gene body methylation do not alter gene expression plasticity in a reef-building coral.","Evol Appl","As coral reefs continue to decline due to climate change, the role of coral epigenetics (specifically, gene body methylation, GBM) in coral acclimatization warrants investigation. The evidence is currently conflicting. In diverse animal phyla, the baseline GBM level is associated with gene function: continuously expressed ""housekeeping"" genes are typically highly methylated, while inducible context-dependent genes have low or no methylation at all. Some authors report an association between GBM and the environment and interpret this observation as evidence of the GBM's role in acclimatization. Yet, others argue that the correlation between GBM change and gene expression change is typically absent or negligible. Here, we used the reef-building coral,Acropora millepora,to test whether environmentally driven changes in GBM are associated with a gene's ability to respond to environmental changes (plasticity) rather than expression level. We analyzed two cases of modified gene expression plasticity observed in a 3-week-long heat acclimatization experiment. The first one was a group of heat-induced genes that failed to revert their expression after the coral was translocated back to the control tank. The second case involved genes that changed the magnitude of their response to the daily temperature fluctuations over the course of the experiment. In both cases, we found negligible or no association with GBM change. We conclude that although both gene expression plasticity and GBM can change during acclimatization, there is no direct association between the two. This adds to the increasing volume of evidence that the function of GBM in invertebrates is unrelated to acclimatization on physiological timescales.© 2024 The Authors.

In fact, sex and gender are currently not considered in most treatment decisions in the fields of oncology and hematology. The lack of knowledge about potential sex differences in both disciplines may lead to differences in treatment efficacy, toxicity, and the overall survival (OS) of patients.To evaluate their awareness about sex and gender in clinical practice we surveyed Swiss hematologists and oncologists from September to November 2022.We collected data about the clinical knowledge, experimental research, palliative care, quality of life, as well as the participant perception of the importance of sex and gender. We identified 767 eligible clinicians, of whom 150 completed the survey (20% response rate).While most participants agreed that sex and gender were relevant when treating patients, it became clear that fewer participants knew about sex and gender differences in treatment toxicity and survival, which in turn would affect the treatment of their patients. Most participants agreed that this topic should be integrated into continuing education and research.Our findings indicate the need for more awareness and training on sex and gender in cancer research and clinical care among oncologists and hematologists.

Taking full account of intricate biological interactions is highly important in accurately predicting drug synergy. However, the extremely limited prior knowledge poses great challenges in developing current computational methods. To address this, we introduce SynergyX, a multi-modality mutual attention network to improve anti-tumor drug synergy prediction. It dynamically captures cross-modal interactions, allowing for the modeling of complex biological networks and drug interactions. A convolution-augmented attention structure is adopted to integrate multi-omic data in this framework effectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art models, SynergyX demonstrates superior predictive accuracy in both the General Test and Blind Test and cross-dataset validation. By exhaustively screening combinations of approved drugs, SynergyX reveals its ability to identify promising drug combination candidates for potential lung cancer treatment. Another notable advantage lies in its multidimensional interpretability. Taking Sorafenib and Vorinostat as an example, SynergyX serves as a powerful tool for uncovering drug-gene interactions and deciphering cell selectivity mechanisms. In summary, SynergyX provides an illuminating and interpretable framework, poised to catalyze the expedition of drug synergy discovery and deepen our comprehension of rational combination therapy.© The Author(s) 2024.

Currently, it is unknown whether medulloblastoma dysregulates the translation of putatively oncogenic non-canonical open reading frames (ORFs). To address this question, we performed ribosome profiling of 32 medulloblastoma tissues and cell lines and observed widespread non-canonical ORF translation. We then developed a stepwise approach using multiple CRISPR-Cas9 screens to elucidate non-canonical ORFs and putative microproteins implicated in medulloblastoma cell survival. We determined that multiple lncRNA-ORFs and upstream ORFs (uORFs) exhibited selective functionality independent of main coding sequences. A microprotein encoded by one of these ORFs, ASNSD1-uORF or ASDURF, was upregulated, associated with MYC-family oncogenes, and promoted medulloblastoma cell survival through engagement with the prefoldin-like chaperone complex. Our findings underscore the fundamental importance of non-canonical ORF translation in medulloblastoma and provide a rationale to include these ORFs in future studies seeking to define new cancer targets.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

In this study, we explore the cellular landscape of the hippocampus in a DS mouse model, the Ts65Dn, through single-nuclei transcriptional profiling. Our findings demonstrate that trisomy manifests as a highly specific modification of the transcriptome within distinct cell types. Remarkably, we observed a significant shift in the transcriptomic profile of granule cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) associated with trisomy. We identified the downregulation of a specific small nucleolar RNA host gene, Snhg11, as the primary driver behind this observed shift in the trisomic DG. Notably, reduced levels of Snhg11 in this region were also observed in a distinct DS mouse model, the Dp(16)1Yey, as well as in human postmortem brain tissue, indicating its relevance in Down syndrome. To elucidate the function of this long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), we knocked down Snhg11 in the DG of wild-type mice. Intriguingly, this intervention alone was sufficient to impair synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis, resembling the cognitive phenotypes associated with trisomy in the hippocampus. Our study uncovers the functional role of Snhg11 in the DG and underscores the significance of this lncRNA in intellectual disability.

38227575,"Transcription factor interactions explain the context-dependent activity of CRX binding sites.","PLoS Comput Biol","The effects of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) on the activity of a cis-regulatory element (CRE) depend on the local sequence context. In rod photoreceptors, binding sites for the transcription factor (TF) Cone-rod homeobox (CRX) occur in both enhancers and silencers, but the sequence context that determines whether CRX binding sites contribute to activation or repression of transcription is not understood. To investigate the context-dependent activity of CRX sites, we fit neural network-based models to the activities of synthetic CREs composed of photoreceptor TFBSs. The models revealed that CRX binding sites consistently make positive, independent contributions to CRE activity, while negative homotypic interactions between sites cause CREs composed of multiple CRX sites to function as silencers. The effects of negative homotypic interactions can be overcome by the presence of other TFBSs that either interact cooperatively with CRX sites or make independent positive contributions to activity. The context-dependent activity of CRX sites is thus determined by the balance between positive heterotypic interactions, independent contributions of TFBSs, and negative homotypic interactions. Our findings explain observed patterns of activity among genomic CRX-bound enhancers and silencers, and suggest that enhancers may require diverse TFBSs to overcome negative homotypic interactions between TFBSs.Copyright: © 2024 Loell et al.

38297353,"The influence of the environment and lifestyle on myopia.","J Physiol Anthropol","Myopia, commonly known as near-sightedness, has emerged as a global epidemic, impacting almost one in three individuals across the world. The increasing prevalence of myopia during early childhood has heightened the risk of developing high myopia and related sight-threatening eye conditions in adulthood. This surge in myopia rates, occurring within a relatively stable genetic framework, underscores the profound influence of environmental and lifestyle factors on this condition. In this comprehensive narrative review, we shed light on both established and potential environmental and lifestyle contributors that affect the development and progression of myopia.Epidemiological and interventional research has consistently revealed a compelling connection between increased outdoor time and a decreased risk of myopia in children. This protective effect may primarily be attributed to exposure to the characteristics of natural light (i.e., sunlight) and the release of retinal dopamine. Conversely, irrespective of outdoor time, excessive engagement in near work can further worsen the onset of myopia. While the exact mechanisms behind this exacerbation are not fully comprehended, it appears to involve shifts in relative peripheral refraction, the overstimulation of accommodation, or a complex interplay of these factors, leading to issues like retinal image defocus, blur, and chromatic aberration. Other potential factors like the spatial frequency of the visual environment, circadian rhythm, sleep, nutrition, smoking, socio-economic status, and education have debatable independent influences on myopia development.The environment exerts a significant influence on the development and progression of myopia. Improving the modifiable key environmental predictors like time spent outdoors and engagement in near work can prevent or slow the progression of myopia. The intricate connections between lifestyle and environmental factors often obscure research findings, making it challenging to disentangle their individual effects. This complexity underscores the necessity for prospective studies that employ objective assessments, such as quantifying light exposure and near work, among others. These studies are crucial for gaining a more comprehensive understanding of how various environmental factors can be modified to prevent or slow the progression of myopia.© 2024.

38409093,"Transcriptomic effects of paternal cocaine-seeking on the reward circuitry of male offspring.","Transl Psychiatry","It has been previously established that paternal development of a strong incentive motivation for cocaine can predispose offspring to develop high cocaine-seeking behavior, as opposed to sole exposure to the drug that results in drug resistance in offspring. However, the adaptive changes of the reward circuitry have not been fully elucidated. To infer the key nuclei and possible hub genes that determine susceptibility to addiction in offspring, rats were randomly assigned to three groups, cocaine self-administration (CSA), yoked administration (Yoke), and saline self-administration (SSA), and used to generate F1. We conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of the male F1 offspring across seven relevant brain regions, both under drug-naïve conditions and after cocaine self-administration. Pairwise differentially expressed gene analysis revealed that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) exhibited more pronounced transcriptomic changes in response to cocaine exposure, while the dorsal hippocampus (dHip), dorsal striatum (dStr), and ventral tegmental area (VTA) exhibited changes that were more closely associated with the paternal voluntary cocaine-seeking behavior. Consistently, these nuclei showed decreased dopamine levels, elevated neuronal activation, and elevated between-nuclei correlations, indicating dopamine-centered rewiring of the midbrain circuit in the CSA offspring. To determine if possible regulatory cascades exist that drive the expression changes, we constructed co-expression networks induced by paternal drug addiction and identified three key clusters, primarily driven by transcriptional factors such as MYT1L, POU3F4, and NEUROD6, leading to changes of genes regulating axonogenesis, synapse organization, and membrane potential, respectively. Collectively, our data highlight vulnerable neurocircuitry and novel regulatory candidates with therapeutic potential for disrupting the transgenerational inheritance of vulnerability to cocaine addiction.© 2024.

Supervised ensemble methods have gained popularity in recent years for multi-omics data analysis. However, existing research based on supervised learning algorithms often fails to fully harness the information from unlabeled nodes and overlooks the latent features within and among different omics, as well as the various associations among features. Here, we present a novel multi-omics integrative method MOSEGCN, based on the Transformer multi-head self-attention mechanism and Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN), with the aim of enhancing the accuracy of complex disease classification. MOSEGCN first employs the Transformer multi-head self-attention mechanism and Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) to separately learn the inherent correlations of latent features within and among different omics, constructing a comprehensive view of diseases. Subsequently, it feeds the learned crucial information into a self-ensembling Graph Convolutional Network (SEGCN) built upon semi-supervised learning methods for training and testing, facilitating a better analysis and utilization of information from multi-omics data to achieve precise classification of disease subtypes.The experimental results show that MOSEGCN outperforms several state-of-the-art multi-omics integrative analysis approaches on three types of omics data: mRNA expression data, microRNA expression data, and DNA methylation data, with accuracy rates of 83.0% for Alzheimer's disease and 86.7% for breast cancer subtyping. Furthermore, MOSEGCN exhibits strong generalizability on the GBM dataset, enabling the identification of important biomarkers for related diseases.MOSEGCN explores the significant relationship information among different omics and within each omics' latent features, effectively leveraging labeled and unlabeled information to further enhance the accuracy of complex disease classification. It also provides a promising approach for identifying reliable biomarkers, paving the way for personalized medicine.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.50594241295933e-36
38352419,"Evolutionary innovation in conserved regulatory elements across the mammalian tree of life.","bioRxiv","Transcriptional enhancers orchestrate cell type- and time point-specific gene expression programs. Evolution of enhancer sequences can alter target gene expression without causing detrimental misexpression in other contexts. It has long been thought that this modularity allows evolutionary changes in enhancers to escape pleiotropic constraints, which is especially important for evolutionary constrained developmental patterning genes. However, there is still little data supporting this hypothesis. Here we identified signatures of accelerated evolution in conserved enhancer elements across the mammalian phylogeny. We found that pleiotropic genes involved in gene regulatory and developmental processes were enriched for accelerated sequence evolution within their enhancer elements. These genes were associated with an excess number of enhancers compared to other genes, and due to this they exhibit a substantial degree of sequence acceleration over all their enhancers combined. We provide evidence that sequence acceleration is associated with turnover of regulatory function. We studied one acceleration event in depth and found that its sequence evolution led to the emergence of a new enhancer activity domain that may be involved in the evolution of digit reduction in hoofed mammals. Our results provide tangible evidence that enhancer evolution has been a frequent contributor to modifications involving constrained developmental signaling genes in mammals.",1.97102191149974e-36

We extracted DR-characteristic genes using transcriptome profiles of cells in which DR was induced by TFs, and performed a variant of simulated annealing to explore small molecule combinations with similar gene expression patterns with DR-inducing TFs. We applied DIRECTEUR to predicting combinations of small molecules that convert fibroblasts into neurons or cardiomyocytes, and were able to reproduce experimentally verified and functionally related molecules inducing the corresponding conversions.

We also aimed to investigate the influence of CpG methylation on the transcriptional levels of RANKL and OPG.A total of 32 GCTB tissue samples were analyzed, and the expression of RANKL, OPG, and RUNX2 was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The methylation status of RANKL and OPG was also evaluated by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP).We found that RANKL and RUNX2 gene expression was upregulated more in recurrent than in non-recurrent GCTB tissues, while OPG gene expression was downregulated more in recurrent than in non-recurrent GCTB tissues. Additionally, we proved that changes in DNA methylation contribute to upregulating the expression of RANKL and downregulating the expression of OPG, which are critical for bone homeostasis and GCTB development.Our results suggest that the overexpression of RANKL/RUNX2 and the lower expression of OPG are associated with recurrence in GCTB patients.© 2024 Amri et al.",1.81258852349657e-36

These pollutants can harm aquatic life. The behavioral characteristics of animals are an external manifestation of their internal mechanisms. Changes in behavior reflect damage and changes in the internal mechanisms. Environmental pollution may lead to behavioral changes not only in the parental generation but also in the offspring that has not been exposed to the pollutants. That is, the intrinsic mechanism that leads to behavioral changes is inheritable. Fish are representative species of aquatic organisms and are commonly used in various research studies. The behavior of fish has also received extensive attention, and the monitoring technology for fish behavior has developed rapidly. This article summarizes the development process of behavior monitoring technology and introduces some of the latest technologies for studying fish behavior.

38404912,"Genetic Variants Associated with Hypertension Risk: Progress and Implications.","Pulse (Basel)","Genetic variants causing diseases with hypertension as a secondary feature have previously been identified. Studies focussing on primary hypertension have utilised common and latterly rare genetic variants in attempts to elucidate the genetic contribution to the risk of primary hypertension.Using genome-wide association studies (GWASs), associations of hypertension with hundreds of common genetic variants have been reported, implicating thousands of genes. Individual variants have small effect sizes and cumulatively account for around 6% of genetic risk. The common variant signal is enriched for relevant tissues and physiological processes, while some variants are associated with traits expected to have secondary impacts on hypertension risk, such as fruit intake, BMI, or time watching television. Studies using rare variants obtained from exome sequence data have implicated a small number of genes for which impaired function has moderate effects on blood pressure and/or hypertension risk. Notably, genetic variants which impair elements of guanylate cyclase activation, stimulated by either natriuretic hormones or nitric oxide, increase hypertension risk. Conversely, variants impairing dopamine beta-hydroxylase or renin production are associated with lower blood pressure. Variants for which a definite effect can be designated remain cumulatively extremely rare and again make only a small contribution to overall genetic risk. Although these results are of interest, it is not clear that they provide radical new insights or identify drug targets which were not previously known. Nor does it seem that genetic testing could be useful in terms of quantifying disease risk or guiding treatment.Research has increased our knowledge about the relationship between naturally occurring genetic variation and risk of hypertension. Although some results serve to confirm our understanding of underlying physiology, their value in terms of potentially leading to practical advances in the management of hypertension appears questionable.© 2024 The Author(s).

Previous genome-wide association studies for PSP were based on genotype array, therefore, were inadequate for the analysis of rare variants as well as larger mutations, such as small insertions/deletions (indels) and structural variants (SVs).In this study, we performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) and conducted association analysis for single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels, and SVs, in a cohort of 1,718 cases and 2,944 controls of European ancestry. Of the 1,718 PSP individuals, 1,441 were autopsy-confirmed and 277 were clinically diagnosed.Our analysis of common SNVs and indels confirmed known genetic loci atMAPT,MOBP, STX6,SLCO1A2,DUSP10, andSP1, and further uncovered novel signals inAPOE,FCHO1/MAP1S, KIF13A, TRIM24, TNXB, and ELOVL1. Notably, in contrast to Alzheimer's disease (AD), we observed theAPOEε2 allele to be the risk allele in PSP. Analysis of rare SNVs and indels identified significant association inZNF592and further gene network analysis identified a module of neuronal genes dysregulated in PSP. Moreover, seven common SVs associated with PSP were observed in the H1/H2 haplotype region (17q21.31) and other loci, includingIGH,PCMT1,CYP2A13, andSMCP. In the H1/H2 haplotype region, there is a burden of rare deletions and duplications (P= 6.73×10-3) in PSP.Through WGS, we significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis of PSP, providing new targets for exploring disease mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.",1.65939824286986e-36

Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the clinical significance of ATP6AP1 and its relationship with the immune infiltration in CRC. Transcriptome data of CRC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and analyzed using the combination of R packages and tumor-related databases, including TIMER2, TISIDB, cBioPortal, and MethSurv. The tissue arrays and immunohistochemical staining were performed to verify the expression and clinical characteristics of ATP6AP1. The results revealed that ATP6AP1 expression was significantly elevated in CRC and associated with poor clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrated ATP6AP1 expression was correlated with the infiltration of immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts in the microenvironment of CRC. Moreover, ATP6AP1 was found to be linked to various immune checkpoints and chemokines, with enrichment of cytoplasmic vesicle lumen, endopeptidase regulator activity, and endopeptidase inhibitor activity observed in the high ATP6AP1 expressional group. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that ATP6AP1 upregulation may serve as a biomarker for poor diagnosis in CRC and offer a potential target for immunotherapy in CRC.© 2024.

38388464,"Paternal cocaine-seeking motivation defines offspring's vulnerability to addiction by down-regulating GABAergic GABRG3 in the ventral tegmental area.","Transl Psychiatry","Epidemiological investigations indicate that parental drug abuse experiences significantly influenced the addiction vulnerability of offspring. Studies using animal models have shown that paternal cocaine use and highly motivated drug-seeking behavior are important determinants of offspring addiction susceptibility. However, the key molecules contributing to offspring addiction susceptibility are currently unclear. The motivation for cocaine-seeking behavior in offspring of male rats was compared between those whose fathers self-administered cocaine (SA) and those who were yoked with them and received non-contingent cocaine administrations (Yoke). We found that paternal experience with cocaine-seeking behavior, but not direct cocaine exposure, could lead to increased lever-pressing behavior in male F1 offspring. This effect was observed without significant changes to the dose-response relationship. The transcriptomes of ventral tegmental area (VTA) in offspring were analyzed under both naive state and after self-administration training. Specific transcriptomic changes in response to paternal cocaine-seeking experiences were found, which mainly affected biological processes such as synaptic connections and receptor signaling pathways. Through joint analysis of these candidate genes and parental drug-seeking motivation scores, we found that gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit gamma-3 (Gabrg3) was in the hub position of the drug-seeking motivation-related module network and highly correlated with parental drug-seeking motivation scores. The downregulation of Gabrg3 expression, caused by paternal motivational cocaine-seeking, mainly occurred in GABAergic neurons in the VTA. Furthermore, down-regulating GABAergic Gabrg3 in VTA resulted in an increase in cocaine-seeking behavior in the Yoke F1 group. This down-regulation also reduced transcriptome differences between the Yoke and SA groups, affecting processes related to synaptic formation and neurotransmitter transmission. Taken together, we propose that paternal cocaine-seeking behavior, rather than direct drug exposure, significantly influences offspring addiction susceptibility through the downregulation of Gabrg3 in GABAergic neurons of the VTA, highlighting the importance of understanding specific molecular pathways in the intergenerational inheritance of addiction vulnerability.© 2024.

Exploration of taxonomic compositions beyond bacteria as well as an understanding of the interaction between the bacteriome with the other members is limited using 16S rDNA sequencing. Here, we developed a pipeline enabling the simultaneous interrogation of the gut microbiome (bacteriome, mycobiome, archaeome, eukaryome, DNA virome) and of antibiotic resistance genes based on optimized long-read shotgun metagenomics protocols and custom bioinformatics. Using our pipeline we investigated the longitudinal composition of the gut microbiome in an exploratory clinical study in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT; n = 31). Pre-transplantation microbiomes exhibited a 3-cluster structure, characterized by Bacteroides spp. /Phocaeicola spp., mixed composition and Enterococcus abundances. We revealed substantial inter-individual and temporal variabilities of microbial domain compositions, human DNA, and antibiotic resistance genes during the course of alloHSCT. Interestingly, viruses and fungi accounted for substantial proportions of microbiome content in individual samples. In the course of HSCT, bacterial strains were stable or newly acquired.

No known studies have evaluated COVID-19 risk factors in adults recently vaccinated against poliovirus.Among adults with no history of COVID-19 infection or vaccination, who recently received an inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), we sought to determine which biological factors and social determinants of health (SDOH) may be associated with (1) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, (2) experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, and (3) a longer duration of COVID-19 symptoms.The influence of biological factors and SDOH on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 symptoms were evaluated among 282 adults recently inoculated with IPV. Participant-reported surveys were analyzed over 12 months post-enrollment. Bivariate and multivariate linear and logistic regression models identified associations between variables and COVID-19 outcomes.Adjusting for COVID-19 vaccinations, variants, and other SDOH, secondary analyses revealed that underlying conditions, employment, vitamin D, education, and the oral poliovirus vaccination (OPV) were associated with COVID-19 outcomes. The odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and experiencing symptoms were significantly reduced among participants who took vitamin D (OR 0.12 and OR 0.09, respectively). Unemployed or part-time working participants were 72% less likely to test positive compared with full-time workers. No prior dose of OPV was one of the strongest predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 4.36) and COVID-19 symptoms (OR 6.95).Findings suggest that prophylactic measures and mucosal immunity may mitigate the risk and severity of COVID-19 outcomes.

Here, we investigated the preferential expression of 29 genes that are implicated in such malformations and their immediate interactome (a total of 67 genes). We conducted our analyses across several single-cell atlases of embryonic development, encompassing approximately 150,000 cells from the mouse foregut, 180,000 cells from human embryos, and 500,000 cells from 24 human organs.

Analyzing hundreds of hiPSCs derived from different individuals, we show the proportions of these pluripotent states vary considerably across lines. We discover 13 gene network modules (GNMs) and 13 regulatory network modules (RNMs), which are highly correlated with each other suggesting that the coordinated co-accessibility of regulatory elements in the RNMs likely underlie the coordinated expression of genes in the GNMs. Epigenetic analyses reveal that regulatory networks underlying self-renewal and pluripotency are more complex than previously realized. Genetic analyses identify thousands of regulatory variants that overlapped predicted transcription factor binding sites and are associated with chromatin accessibility in the hiPSCs. We show that the master regulator of pluripotency, the NANOG-OCT4 Complex, and its associated network are significantly enriched for regulatory variants with large effects, suggesting that they play a role in the varying cellular proportions of pluripotency states between hiPSCs. Our work bins tens of thousands of regulatory elements in hiPSCs into discrete regulatory networks, shows that pluripotency and self-renewal processes have a surprising level of regulatory complexity, and suggests that genetic factors may contribute to cell state transitions in human iPSC lines.© 2024.

38284341,"The Psychedelic Future of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Treatment.","Curr Neuropharmacol","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can occur following exposure to a traumatic experience. An estimated 12 million U.S. adults are presently affected by this disorder. Current treatments include psychological therapies (e.g., exposure-based interventions) and pharmacological treatments (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)). However, a significant proportion of patients receiving standard-of-care therapies for PTSD remain symptomatic, and new approaches for this and other trauma-related mental health conditions are greatly needed. Psychedelic compounds that alter cognition, perception, and mood are currently being examined for their efficacy in treating PTSD despite their current status as Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)- scheduled substances. Initial clinical trials have demonstrated the potential value of psychedelicassisted therapy to treat PTSD and other psychiatric disorders. In this comprehensive review, we summarize the state of the science of PTSD clinical care, including current treatments and their shortcomings. We review clinical studies of psychedelic interventions to treat PTSD, trauma-related disorders, and common comorbidities. The classic psychedelics psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and DMT-containing ayahuasca, as well as the entactogen 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and the dissociative anesthetic ketamine, are reviewed. For each drug, we present the history of use, psychological and somatic effects, pharmacology, and safety profile. The rationale and proposed mechanisms for use in treating PTSD and traumarelated disorders are discussed. This review concludes with an in-depth consideration of future directions for the psychiatric applications of psychedelics to maximize therapeutic benefit and minimize risk in individuals and communities impacted by trauma-related conditions.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.",8.03911710164841e-37

However, the functions ofR2R3-MYBgenes inDendrobium nobileremains largely unknown.Here, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis ofD. nobile R2R3-MYBgenes was performed, in which phylogenic relationships, gene structures, motif composition, chromosomal locations, collinearity analysis, andcis-acting elements were investigated. Moreover, the expression patterns of selectedDnMYBgenes were analyzed in various tissues and under different abiotic stresses.In total, 125DnMYBgenes were identified in theD. nobilegenome, and were subdivided into 26 groups based on phylogenetic analysis. Most genes in the same subgroup showed similar exon/intron structure and motif composition. All theDnMYBgenes were mapped to 19 chromosomes with the co-linearity relationship. Reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) results showed that 8DnMYBsexhibited different expression patterns in different plant tissues, and were differentially expressed in response to abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, low-temperature stress.This work contributes to a comprehensive understanding of theR2R3-MYBgene family inD. nobile, and provides candidate genes for future research on abiotic stress in this plant.© 2024 The Author(s).

These methods have been used to build cellular maps of the brain, its different regions, and catalog the diversity of cells in each of them during development, aging and even in disease. Now we know that cellular diversity is way beyond what was previously thought. Single-cell transcriptomics analyses have revealed that cell types previously considered homogeneous based on imaging techniques differ depending on several factors including sex, age and location within the brain. The expression profiles of these cells have also been exploited to understand which are the regulatory programs behind cellular diversity and decipher the transcriptional pathways driving them. In this review, we summarize how single-cell transcriptomics have changed our view on the cellular diversity in the human brain, and how it could impact the way we study neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, we describe the new computational approaches that can be used to study cellular differentiation and gain insight into the functions of individual cell populations under different conditions and their alterations in disease.",6.88829520808755e-37

Whole exome and whole genome sequencing are now routinely used for diagnostic purposes; however, the overall diagnosis rate remains lower than expected. In this work, we review current approaches used for calling and interpretation of germline genetic variants in the human genome, and discuss the most important challenges that persist in the bioinformatic analysis of NGS data in medical genetics. We describe and attempt to quantitatively assess the remaining problems, such as the quality of the reference genome sequence, reproducible coverage biases, or variant calling accuracy in complex regions of the genome. We also discuss the prospects of switching to the complete human genome assembly or the human pan-genome and important caveats associated with such a switch. We touch on arguably the hardest problem of NGS data analysis for medical genomics, namely, the annotation of genetic variants and their subsequent interpretation. We highlight the most challenging aspects of annotation and prioritization of both coding and non-coding variants. Finally, we demonstrate the persistent prevalence of pathogenic variants in the coding genome, and outline research directions that may enhance the efficiency of NGS-based disease diagnostics.© The Author(s) 2024.

Its prevalence dramatically increases with age and could reach up to ∼10% in the elderly. The management of AF is a complex issue that is object of extensive ongoing basic and clinical research, it depends on its genetic and epigenetic causes, and it varies considerably geographically and also according to the ethnicity. Mechanistically, over the last decade, Genome Wide Association Studies have uncovered over 100 genetic loci associated with AF, and have shown that European ancestry is associated with elevated risk of AF. These AF-associated loci revolve around different types of disturbances, including inflammation, electrical abnormalities, and structural remodeling. Moreover, the discovery of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, involving non-coding RNAs, DNA methylation and histone modification, has allowed unravelling what modifications reshape the processes leading to arrhythmias. Our review provides a current state of the field regarding the identification and functional characterization of AF-related genetic and epigenetic regulatory networks, including ethnic differences.

However, the pathogenesis of FFA has not been fully elucidated.Herein, we collected the transcriptome data of scalp lesions of seven patients with FFA and seven healthy controls. The differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis were conducted and we identified 458 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in two key modules. Later, we performed functional enrichment analysis and functional modules identification, revealing the participation of immune response and fatty acid metabolism. Based on the results, we processed further studies. On the one hand, we analyzed the infiltrating immune cells of FFA through CIBERSORT algorithm, indicating the activation of M1 macrophage and CD8+ T cell. On the other hand, considering lipid metabolism of FFA and oxidative stress of hair follicle cells in alopecia, we explored the potential ferroptosis of FFA. By intersection of DEGs and ferroptosis-related genes from FerrDb database, 19 genes were identified and their expression was validated in an external dataset containing 36 FFA cases and 12 controls. Then, we used LASSO algorithms to construct a four-gene diagnostic model, which achieved an AUC of 0.924 in validation dataset. Additionally, the immune cells were found to be related to ferroptosis in FFA.Taken together, this study contributed to reveal the molecular mechanisms of FFA and is expected to inspire future research on treatment.© 2024 The Authors.

Functional studies of novel genes associated with co-morbidities can provide clues to understand the pathogenic mechanisms and interventions. NOMO1 is one of the candidate genes located at 16p13.11, a hotspot of neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, we generate nomo1-/-zebrafish to get further insight into the function of NOMO1. Nomo1 mutants show abnormal brain and neuronal development and activation of apoptosis and inflammation-related pathways in the brain. Adult Nomo1-deficient zebrafish exhibit multiple neuropsychiatric behaviors such as hyperactive locomotor activity, social deficits, and repetitive stereotypic behaviors. The Habenular nucleus and the pineal gland in the telencephalon are affected, and the melatonin level of nomo1-/-is reduced. Melatonin treatment restores locomotor activity, reduces repetitive stereotypic behaviors, and rescues the noninfectious brain inflammatory responses caused by nomo1 deficiency. These results suggest melatonin supplementation as a potential therapeutic regimen for neuropsychiatric disorders caused by NOMO1 deficiency.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.96094294075918e-37

Metastasis is supported by suppression of the immune system at secondary organs and within the circulation. Modulation of the immune system is now being exploited as a therapeutic target with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The tracking of therapeutic efficacy in a real-time can be achieved with liquid biopsy, and evaluation of circulating tumour cells and the associated immune cells. A stable liquid biopsy biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer lung cancer has yet to be approved for clinical use. We performed a cross-sectional single-site study, and collected liquid biopsies from patients diagnosed with early, locally advanced, or metastatic lung cancer, undergoing surgery, or systemic therapy (chemotherapy/checkpoint inhibitors). Evaluation of overall circulating tumour cell counts, or cluster counts did not correlate with patient outcome. Interestingly, the numbers of Pan cytokeratin positive circulating tumour cells engulfed by tumour associated monocytes correlated strongly with patient outcome independent of circulating tumour cell counts and the use of checkpoint inhibitors. We suggest that Pan cytokeratin staining within monocytes is an important indicator of tumour-associated inflammation post-therapy and an effective biomarker with strong prognostic capability for patient outcome.© 2024.

Advancements in generative AI have paved the way for designing synthetic sequences with the aim of safely and accurately modulating gene expression. We leverage diffusion models to design context-specific DNA regulatory sequences, which hold significant potential toward enabling novel therapeutic applications requiring precise modulation of gene expression. Our framework uses a cell type-specific diffusion model to generate synthetic 200 bp regulatory elements based on chromatin accessibility across different cell types. We evaluate the generated sequences based on key metrics to ensure they retain properties of endogenous sequences: transcription factor binding site composition, potential for cell type-specific chromatin accessibility, and capacity for sequences generated by DNA diffusion to activate gene expression in different cell contexts using state-of-the-art prediction models. Our results demonstrate the ability to robustly generate DNA sequences with cell type-specific regulatory potential.

However, the specific role of Th2 cells in adipose tissue function has remained elusive. Eight-week-old male CD3ε─/─mice were randomly divided into two groups (≥ 5 mice per group): one received intravenous injection of Th2 cells isolated from LATY136Fmice, while the other receiving PBS as a control. Both of groups were subjected to a high-fat diet (HFD). The adoptive transfer of polarized Th2 cells led to a significant reduction in obesity following a HFD. This reduction was accompanied by improvements in hepatic steatosis, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, Th2 cell treatment promoted oxidative phosphorylation of adipocytes, thereby contributing to a reduction of lipid droplet accumulation. These findings suggest that Th2 cell therapy represents a novel approach for treating diet-induced obesity and other diseases involving lipid droplet accumulation disorders.© 2024.

However, there has been inconsistent reporting on the effectiveness of smartphones and web-based apps in influencing dietary behaviors. Moreover, previous reviews have been limited in scope, either by focusing on a specific population group or by being outdated. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to investigate the impacts of smartphone- and web-based dietary interventions on promoting healthy eating behaviors worldwide.A systematic literature search of randomized controlled trials was conducted using databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Global Health, Informit, Web of Science, and CINAHL (EBSCO). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed to prepare the entire document. EndNote (version 20) was used for reference management. The risk of bias in the articles was assessed using the ""Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0)"" by the Cochrane Collaboration. Narrative synthesis, using text and tables, was used to present the results. The study was registered in PROSPERO under protocol number CRD42023464315.This review analyzed a total of 39 articles, which consisted of 25 smartphone-based apps and 14 web-based apps. The studies involved a total of 14,966 participants. Out of the 25 studies, 13 (52%) showed that offline-capable smartphone apps are successful in promoting healthier eating habits. The impact of smartphone apps on healthy adults has been inconsistently reported. However, studies have shown their effectiveness in chronically ill patients. Likewise, internet-based mobile apps, such as social media or nutrition-specific apps, have been found to effectively promote healthy eating behaviors. These findings were consistent across 14 studies, which included healthy adults, overweight or obese adults, chronically ill patients, and pregnant mothers.Overall, the findings suggest that smartphone apps contribute to improving healthy eating behaviors. Both nutrition-specific and social media-based mobile apps consistently prove effective in promoting long-term healthy eating habits. Therefore, policymakers in the food system should consider harnessing the potential of internet-based mobile apps and social media platforms to foster sustainable healthy eating behaviors.© 2024 Seid, Fufa and Bitew.",2.25022116752927e-37

The global population is aging, driving an urgent need for therapeutics that stop disease progression and eliminate symptoms. In this study, we create an open framework and resource for evidence-based identification of therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disease. We use summary-data-based Mendelian randomization to identify genetic targets for drug discovery and repurposing. In parallel, we provide mechanistic insights into disease processes and potential network-level consequences of gene-based therapeutics. We identify 116 Alzheimer disease, 3 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MIM: 105400), 5 Lewy body dementia (MIM: 127750), 46 Parkinson disease (MIM: 605909), and 9 progressive supranuclear palsy (MIM: 601104) target genes passing multiple test corrections (pSMR_multi < 2.95 × 10-6and pHEIDI > 0.01).

Two major mechanisms direct AD pathology: (1) accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) plaque and (2) tau-derived neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). The most common variants in the Aβ pathway inAPP,PSEN1,andPSEN2are largely responsible for early-onset AD (EOAD), whileMAPT,APOE,TREM2andABCA7have a modifying effect on late-onset AD (LOAD). More recent studies implicate chaperone proteins and Aβ degrading proteins in AD.

Concurrently, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a grave global public health challenge. Existing literature suggests that T cells, pivotal components of cellular immunity, are integral to both antiviral and antitumor responses. Yet, the nuanced alterations and consequent functions of T cells across diverse disease states have not been comprehensively elucidated. We gathered transcriptomic data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from lung adenocarcinoma patients, COVID-19 patients, and healthy controls. We followed a standardized analytical approach for quality assurance, batch effect adjustments, and preliminary data processing. We discerned distinct T cell subsets and conducted differential gene expression analysis. Potential key genes and pathways were inferred from GO and Pathway enrichment analyses. Additionally, we implemented Mendelian randomization to probe the potential links between pivotal genes and lung adenocarcinoma susceptibility. Our findings underscored a notable reduction in mature CD8 + central memory T cells in both lung adenocarcinoma and COVID-19 cohorts relative to the control group. Notably, the downregulation of specific genes, such as TRGV9, could impede the immunological efficacy of CD8 + T cells. Comprehensive multi-omics assessment highlighted genetic aberrations in genes, including TRGV9, correlating with heightened lung adenocarcinoma risk. Through rigorous single-cell transcriptomic analyses, this investigation meticulously delineated variations in T cell subsets across different pathological states and extrapolated key regulatory genes via an integrated multi-omics approach, establishing a robust groundwork for future functional inquiries.

Integrative tissue and single-cell analysis revealed sources of genomic, epigenomic, and microenvironmental intratumoral heterogeneity and their spatial patterning. By distinguishing tumor-wide molecular features from those with regional specificity, we inferred GBM evolutionary trajectories from neurodevelopmental lineage origins and initiating events such as chromothripsis to emergence of genetic subclones and spatially restricted activation of differential tumor and microenvironmental programs in the core, periphery, and contrast-enhancing regions.

Building upon our previous success, we here present a priority index solution designed to address this challenge, generating the target and drug resource that consists of two indexes: the target index and the drug index. The primary purpose of the target index is to identify clinically actionable targets by prioritising genes associated with Covid-19. We illustrate the validity of the target index by demonstrating its ability to identify pre-existing Covid-19 phase-III drug targets, with the majority of these targets being found at the leading prioritisation (leading targets). These leading targets have their evolutionary origins in Amniota ('four-leg vertebrates') and are predominantly involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and JAK-STAT signaling. The drug index highlights opportunities for repurposing clinically approved JAK-STAT inhibitors, either individually or in combination.

38352517,"Single-molecule chromatin configurations link transcription factor binding to expression in human cells.","bioRxiv","The binding of multiple transcription factors (TFs) to genomic enhancers activates gene expression in mammalian cells. However, the molecular details that link enhancer sequence to TF binding, promoter state, and gene expression levels remain opaque. We applied single-molecule footprinting (SMF) to measure the simultaneous occupancy of TFs, nucleosomes, and components of the transcription machinery on engineered enhancer/promoter constructs with variable numbers of TF binding sites for both a synthetic and an endogenous TF. We find that activation domains enhance a TF's capacity to compete with nucleosomes for binding to DNA in a BAF-dependent manner, TF binding on nucleosome-free DNA is consistent with independent binding between TFs, and average TF occupancy linearly contributes to promoter activation rates. We also decompose TF strength into separable binding and activation terms, which can be tuned and perturbed independently. Finally, we develop thermodynamic and kinetic models that quantitatively predict both the binding microstates observed at the enhancer and subsequent time-dependent gene expression. This work provides a template for quantitative dissection of distinct contributors to gene activation, including the activity of chromatin remodelers, TF activation domains, chromatin acetylation, TF concentration, TF binding affinity, and TF binding site configuration.",8.30896888081268e-38
38339281,"A Comprehensive Investigation of Active Learning Strategies for Conducting Anti-Cancer Drug Screening.","Cancers (Basel)","It is well-known that cancers of the same histology type can respond differently to a treatment. Thus, computational drug response prediction is of paramount importance for both preclinical drug screening studies and clinical treatment design. To build drug response prediction models, treatment response data need to be generated through screening experiments and used as input to train the prediction models. In this study, we investigate various active learning strategies of selecting experiments to generate response data for the purposes of (1) improving the performance of drug response prediction models built on the data and (2) identifying effective treatments. Here, we focus on constructing drug-specific response prediction models for cancer cell lines. Various approaches have been designed and applied to select cell lines for screening, including a random, greedy, uncertainty, diversity, combination of greedy and uncertainty, sampling-based hybrid, and iteration-based hybrid approach. All of these approaches are evaluated and compared using two criteria: (1) the number of identified hits that are selected experiments validated to be responsive, and (2) the performance of the response prediction model trained on the data of selected experiments. The analysis was conducted for 57 drugs and the results show a significant improvement on identifying hits using active learning approaches compared with the random and greedy sampling method. Active learning approaches also show an improvement on response prediction performance for some of the drugs and analysis runs compared with the greedy sampling method.",7.94266879709784e-38
38275383,"Oncogenic BRCA1,2 Mutations in the Human Lineage-A By-Product of Sexual Selection?","Biomedicines","In this review, we discuss the long-known problem of tissue-specific carcinogenesis in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers: while the genes are expressed ubiquitously, increased cancer risk is observed mostly in the breast and ovaries, and to a much lesser extent, in some other tissues such as the prostate or pancreas. We reevaluate hypotheses on the evolutionary origin of these mutations in humans. Also, we align together the reports that at least some great apes have much lower risks of epithelial cancers in general and breast cancer in particular with the fact that humans have more voluminous breast tissue as compared to their closest extant relatives, particularly chimpanzees and bonobos. We conjecture that this disparity may be a consequence of sexual selection, augmented via selection for enhanced lactation. Further, we argue that there is an organ-specific enigma similar to the Peto paradox: breast cancer risk in humans is only minimally correlated with breast size. These considerations lead to the hypothesis that, along with the evolutionary development of larger breasts in humans, additional changes have played a balancing role in suppressing breast cancer. These yet-to-be-discovered mechanisms, while purely speculative, may be valuable to understanding human breast cancer, though they may not be exclusive to the mammary gland epithelial cells. Combining these themes, we review some anti-carcinogenesis preventive strategies and prospects of new interventions against breast cancer.",7.81881202804942e-38

However, its translational application is still limited. One challenge is that the proposed clinical requirements and data mining are not synchronized. Additionally, the exotic predictions of data mining are difficult to apply directly in local medical institutions. Hence, it is necessary to incisively review the translational application of clinical data mining, providing an analytical workflow for developing and validating prediction models to ensure the scientific validity of analytic workflows in response to clinical questions. This review systematically revisits the purpose, process, and principles of clinical data mining and discusses the key causes contributing to the detachment from practice and the misuse of model verification in developing predictive models for research. Based on this, we propose a niche-targeting framework of four principles: Clinical Contextual, Subgroup-Oriented, Confounder- and False Positive-Controlled (CSCF), to provide guidance for clinical data mining prior to the model's development in clinical settings. Eventually, it is hoped that this review can help guide future research and develop personalized predictive models to achieve the goal of discovering subgroups with varied remedial benefits or risks and ensuring that precision medicine can deliver its full potential.© 2024.

This paper delves into the potential of multi-omics in deepening our understanding of biological age, examining the techniques available in light of evolving technology and computational models. The primary objective is to review the relationship between ionizing radiation and biological age, exploring a wide array of functional, physiological, and psychological parameters. This comprehensive review draws upon an extensive range of sources, including peer-reviewed journal articles, government documents, and reputable websites. The literature review spans from fundamental insights into radiation effects to the latest developments in aging research. Ionizing radiation exerts its influence through direct mechanisms, notably single- and double-strand DNA breaks and cross links, along with other critical cellular events. The cumulative impact of DNA damage forms the foundation for the intricate process of natural aging, intersecting with numerous diseases and pivotal biomarkers. Furthermore, there is a resurgence of interest in ionizing radiation research from various organizations and countries, reinvigorating its importance as a key contributor to the study of biological age. Biological age serves as a vital reference point for the monitoring and mitigation of the effects of various stressors, including ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation emerges as a potent candidate for modeling the separation of biological age from chronological age, offering a promising avenue for tailoring protocols across diverse fields, including the rigorous demands of space exploration.",6.95943966829888e-38

Furthermore, the multi-omics profiling technology could jointly measure two or more traits in a single cell simultaneously. In order to process the various data accumulated rapidly, computational methods for multimodal data integration are needed.Here, we present inClust+, a deep generative framework for the multi-omics. It's built on previous inClust that is specific for transcriptome data, and augmented with two mask modules designed for multimodal data processing: an input-mask module in front of the encoder and an output-mask module behind the decoder. InClust+ was first used to integrate scRNA-seq and MERFISH data from similar cell populations, and to impute MERFISH data based on scRNA-seq data. Then, inClust+ was shown to have the capability to integrate the multimodal data (e.g. tri-modal data with gene expression, chromatin accessibility and protein abundance) with batch effect. Finally, inClust+ was used to integrate an unlabeled monomodal scRNA-seq dataset and two labeled multimodal CITE-seq datasets, transfer labels from CITE-seq datasets to scRNA-seq dataset, and generate the missing modality of protein abundance in monomodal scRNA-seq data. In the above examples, the performance of inClust+ is better than or comparable to the most recent tools in the corresponding task.The inClust+ is a suitable framework for handling multimodal data. Meanwhile, the successful implementation of mask in inClust+ means that it can be applied to other deep learning methods with similar encoder-decoder architecture to broaden the application scope of these models.© 2024.

However, little is known regarding the mechanisms underpinning the activation of alternative promoters.Here we describe how alternative cancer-testis-specific transcription is activated. We show that intergenic and intronic CTCF binding sites, which are transcriptionally inert in normal somatic cells, could be epigenetically reprogrammed into active de novo promoters in germ and cancer cells. BORIS/CTCFL, the testis-specific paralog of the ubiquitously expressed CTCF, triggers the epigenetic reprogramming of CTCF sites into units of active transcription. BORIS binding initiates the recruitment of the chromatin remodeling factor, SRCAP, followed by the replacement of H2A histone with H2A.Z, resulting in a more relaxed chromatin state in the nucleosomes flanking the CTCF binding sites. The relaxation of chromatin around CTCF binding sites facilitates the recruitment of multiple additional transcription factors, thereby activating transcription from a given binding site. We demonstrate that the epigenetically reprogrammed CTCF binding sites can drive the expression of cancer-testis genes, long noncoding RNAs, retro-pseudogenes, and dormant transposable elements.Thus, BORIS functions as a transcription factor that epigenetically reprograms clustered CTCF binding sites into transcriptional start sites, promoting transcription from alternative promoters in both germ cells and cancer cells.© 2024.

38319148,"Nucleosome conformation dictates the histone code.","Elife","Histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a critical role in chromatin regulation. It has been proposed that these PTMs form localized 'codes' that are read by specialized regions (reader domains) in chromatin-associated proteins (CAPs) to regulate downstream function. Substantial effort has been made to define [CAP: histone PTM] specificities, and thus decipher the histone code and guide epigenetic therapies. However, this has largely been done using the reductive approach of isolated reader domains and histone peptides, which cannot account for any higher-order factors. Here, we show that the [BPTF PHD finger and bromodomain: histone PTM] interaction is dependent on nucleosome context. The tandem reader selectively associates with nucleosomal H3K4me3 and H3K14ac or H3K18ac, a combinatorial engagement that despite being in cis is not predicted by peptides. This in vitro specificity of the BPTF tandem reader for PTM-defined nucleosomes is recapitulated in a cellular context. We propose that regulatable histone tail accessibility and its impact on the binding potential of reader domains necessitates we refine the 'histone code' concept and interrogate it at the nucleosome level.© 2024, Marunde, Fuchs et al.",5.20350996685055e-38
38338996,NA,NA,"Renal fibrosis, the result of different pathological processes, impairs kidney function and architecture, and usually leads to renal failure development. Piezo1 is a mechanosensitive cation channel highly expressed in kidneys. Activation of Piezo1 by mechanical stimuli increases cations influx into the cell with slight preference of calcium ions. Two different models of Piezo1 activation are considered: force through lipid and force through filament. Expression of Piezo1 on mRNA and protein levels was confirmed within the kidney. Their capacity is increased in the fibrotic kidney. The pharmacological tools for Piezo1 research comprise selective activators of the channels (Yoda1 and Jedi1/2) as well as non-selective inhibitors (spider peptide toxin) GsMTx4. Piezo1 is hypothesized to be the upstream element responsible for the activation of integrin. This pathway (calcium/calpain2/integrin beta1) is suggested to participate in profibrotic response induced by mechanical stimuli. Administration of the Piezo1 unspecific inhibitor or activators to unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO) mice or animals with folic acid-induced fibrosis modulates extracellular matrix deposition and influences kidney function.

38271473,"Integration of expression QTLs with fine mapping via SuSiE.","PLoS Genet","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have achieved remarkable success in associating thousands of genetic variants with complex traits. However, the presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) makes it challenging to identify the causal variants. To address this critical gap from association to causation, many fine-mapping methods have been proposed to assign well-calibrated probabilities of causality to candidate variants, taking into account the underlying LD pattern. In this manuscript, we introduce a statistical framework that incorporates expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) information to fine-mapping, built on the sum of single-effects (SuSiE) regression model. Our new method, SuSiE2, connects two SuSiE models, one for eQTL analysis and one for genetic fine-mapping. This is achieved by first computing the posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) from an eQTL-based SuSiE model with the expression level of the candidate gene as the phenotype. These calculated PIPs are then utilized as prior inclusion probabilities for risk variants in another SuSiE model for the trait of interest. By prioritizing functional variants within the candidate region using eQTL information, SuSiE2 improves SuSiE by increasing the detection rate of causal SNPs and reducing the average size of credible sets. We compared the performance of SuSiE2 with other multi-trait fine-mapping methods with respect to power, coverage, and precision through simulations and applications to the GWAS results of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and body mass index (BMI). Our results demonstrate the better performance of SuSiE2, both when the in-sample linkage disequilibrium (LD) matrix and an external reference panel is used in inference.Copyright: © 2024 Zhang et al.

Causative cell therapies for muscle deficiencies are not state of the art. Animal models to study the therapy efficacy are, therefore, needed. We developed an improved protocol to produce myoblasts suitable for pre-clinical muscle therapy studies in a large animal model. Myoblasts were isolated from the striated muscle, expanded by employing five different protocols, and characterized on transcript and protein expression levels to determine procedures that yielded optimized regeneration-competent myoblasts and multi-nucleated myotubes. We report that swine skeletal myoblasts proliferated well under improved conditions without signs of cellular senescence, and expressed significant levels of myogenic markers including Pax7, MyoD1, Myf5, MyoG, Des, Myf6, CD56 (p≤ 0.05 each). Upon terminal differentiation, myoblasts ceased proliferation and generated multi-nucleated myotubes. Injection of such myoblasts into the urethral sphincter complex of pigs with sphincter muscle insufficiency yielded an enhanced functional regeneration of this muscle (81.54% of initial level) when compared to the spontaneous regeneration in the sham controls without myoblast injection (67.03% of initial level). We conclude that the optimized production of porcine myoblasts yields cells that seem suitable for preclinical studies of cell therapy in a porcine large animal model of muscle insufficiency.",4.41293547179491e-38

However, the relationship is still inconclusive as it is likely to be interfered with by substantial confounding factors and potential reverse causality. The present study aimed to investigate causal correlation of the two diseases by a Mendelian randomization (MR) study and further elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.With the biggest summary datasets of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the East Asian population, we conducted a two-sample, bidirectional MR study to assess the causal correlation between shrimp allergy (SA) and MDD. Subsequently, we identified the pleiotropic genes' susceptibility to the two diseases at whole-genome and tissue-specific levels, respectively. Enriched GO sets and KEGG pathways were also discovered to elucidate the potential underlying mechanisms.With the most suitable MR method, SA was identified as a causal risk factor for MDD based on three different groups of independent genetic instruments, respectively (p< 2.81 × 10-2). In contrast, we did not observe a significant causal effect of MDD on SA. The GWAS-pairwise program successfully identified seven pleiotropic genetic variants (PPA3 > 0.8), indicating that the two diseases indeed have a shared genetic basis. At a whole-genome level, the MAGMA program identified 44 pleiotropic genes, which were enriched in allergy-related pathways, such as antigen processing and presentation pathway (p= 1.46 × 10-2). In brain-specific tissue, the S-MultiXcan program found 17 pleiotropic genes that were significantly enriched in immune-related pathways and GO sets, including asthma-related pathway, T-cell activation-related, and major histocompatibility complex protein-related GO sets. Regarding whole-blood tissue, the program identified six pleiotropic genes that are significantly enriched in tolerance induction-related GO sets.The present study for the first time indicated a significant causal effect of SA on the occurrence of MDD, but the reverse was not true. Enrichment analyses of pleiotropic genes at whole-genome and tissue-specific levels implied the involvement of allergy and immune-related pathways in the shared genetic mechanism of the two diseases. Elucidating the causal effect and the acting direction may be beneficial in reducing the incidence rate of MDD for the massive group of SA patients in the East Asian region.",3.85428402606076e-38

The formative state was recently established as a critical intermediate between the two states. Here, we demonstrate the role of the histone chaperone FACT in regulating the naive-to-formative transition. We found that the Q265K mutation in the FACT subunit SSRP1 increased the binding of FACT to histone H3-H4, impaired nucleosome disassemblyin vitro, and reduced the turnover of FACT on chromatinin vivo. Strikingly, mouse ESCs harboring this mutation showed elevated naive-to-formative transition. Mechanistically, the SSRP1-Q265K mutation enriched FACT at the enhancers of formative-specific genes to increase targeted gene expression. Together, these findings suggest that the turnover of FACT on chromatin is crucial for regulating the enhancers of formative-specific genes, thereby mediating the naive-to-formative transition.

38212304,"Apically localized PANX1 impacts neuroepithelial expansion in human cerebral organoids.","Cell Death Discov","Dysfunctional paracrine signaling through Pannexin 1 (PANX1) channels is linked to several adult neurological pathologies and emerging evidence suggests that PANX1 plays an important role in human brain development. It remains unclear how early PANX1 influences brain development, or how loss of PANX1 alters the developing human brain. Using a cerebral organoid model of early human brain development, we find that PANX1 is expressed at all stages of organoid development from neural induction through to neuroepithelial expansion and maturation. Interestingly, PANX1 cellular distribution and subcellular localization changes dramatically throughout cerebral organoid development. During neural induction, PANX1 becomes concentrated at the apical membrane domain of neural rosettes where it co-localizes with several apical membrane adhesion molecules. During neuroepithelial expansion, PANX1-/- organoids are significantly smaller than control and exhibit significant gene expression changes related to cell adhesion, WNT signaling and non-coding RNAs. As cerebral organoids mature, PANX1 expression is significantly upregulated and is primarily localized to neuronal populations outside of the ventricular-like zones. Ultimately, PANX1 protein can be detected in all layers of a 21-22 post conception week human fetal cerebral cortex. Together, these results show that PANX1 is dynamically expressed by numerous cell types throughout embryonic and early fetal stages of human corticogenesis and loss of PANX1 compromises neuroepithelial expansion due to dysregulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, perturbed intracellular signaling, and changes to gene regulation.© 2024.

For each autoimmune disease, we extracted single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated (P< 5×10-8) with that disease and that were independent of one another (R2< 1×10-3) as genetic instruments. SNPs within the human leukocyte antigen region were not considered due to potential pleiotropy. Our primary MR analysis was the inverse-variance weighted analysis. Additionally, we conducted MR-Egger, weighted mode, and weighted median regression to address potential bias due to pleiotropy, and robust adjusted profile scores to address weak instrument bias. We carried out sensitivity analysis limited to the non-immune pathway for nominally significant findings. To account for multiple testing, we set the thresholds for statistical significance atP< 5×10-3.The number of cases and controls identified in the relevant GWASs were 437 and 3,325 for Behçet's disease, 4,918 and 5,684 for coeliac disease, 435 and 341,188 for dermatitis herpetiformis, 4,576 and 8,039 for lupus, 11,988 and 275,335 for psoriasis, 22,350 and 74,823 for rheumatoid arthritis, 3,597 and 337,121 for sarcoidosis, 2,735 and 332,115 for Sjögren's syndrome, 9,095 and 17,584 for systemic sclerosis, 18,942 and 501,638 for type 1 diabetes, 2,400 and 410,350 for NHL; and 296 to 2,340 cases and 271,463 controls for NHL subtypes.Genetic variants predicting ten autoimmune diseases: Behçet's disease, coeliac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, lupus, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes.Estimated associations between genetically predicted susceptibility to ten autoimmune diseases and the risk of NHL.The variance of each autoimmune disease explained by the SNPs ranged from 0.3% to 3.1%. Negative associations between type 1 diabetes and sarcoidosis and the risk of NHL were observed (odds ratio [OR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92 to 0.98,P= 5×10-3, and OR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85 to 0.99,P= 2.8×10-2, respectively). These findings were supported by the sensitivity analyses accounting for potential pleiotropy and weak instrument bias. No significant associations were found between the other eight autoimmune diseases and NHL risk. Of the NHL subtypes, type 1 diabetes was most strongly associated with follicular lymphoma (OR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86 to 0.96,P= 1×10-3), while sarcoidosis was most strongly associated with other and unspecified NHL (OR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.97,P= 1.8×10-2).These findings suggest that genetically predicted susceptibility to type 1 diabetes, and to some extent sarcoidosis, might reduce the risk of NHL. However, future studies with different datasets, approaches, and populations are warranted to further examine the potential associations between these autoimmune diseases and the risk of NHL.",3.01067602260908e-38

Bioinformatics-based big data analysis has increasingly gained significance in cancer research. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the role of DNMT3L in HCC by integrating big data analysis with experimental validation.Dozens of HCC datasets were collected to analyze the expression of DNMT3L and its relationship with prognostic indicators, and were used for molecular regulatory relationship evaluation. The effects of DNMT3L on the malignant phenotypes of hepatoma cells were confirmed in vitro and in vivo. The regulatory mechanisms of DNMT3L were explored through MSP, western blot, and dual-luciferase assays.DNMT3L was found to be downregulated in HCC tissues and associated with better prognosis. Overexpression of DNMT3L inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis. Additionally, CDO1 was identified as a target gene of DNMT3L and also exhibits anti-cancer effects. DNMT3L upregulates CDO1 expression by competitively inhibiting DNMT3A-mediated methylation of CDO1 promoter.Our study revealed the role and epi-transcriptomic regulatory mechanism of DNMT3L in HCC, and underscored the essential role and applicability of big data analysis in elucidating complex biological processes.© 2024.

38168283,"Genetic implication of prenatal GABAergic and cholinergic neuron development in susceptibility to schizophrenia.","medRxiv","The ganglionic eminences are fetal-specific structures that give rise to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)- and acetylcholine- releasing neurons of the forebrain. Given evidence for GABAergic and cholinergic disturbances in schizophrenia, as well as an early neurodevelopmental component to the disorder, we tested the potential involvement of developing cells of the ganglionic eminences in mediating genetic risk for the condition.We combined data from a recent large-scale genome-wide association study of schizophrenia with single cell RNA sequencing data from the human ganglionic eminences to test enrichment of schizophrenia risk variation in genes with high expression specificity for particular developing cell populations within these structures. We additionally performed the single nuclei Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with Sequencing (snATAC-Seq) to map potential regulatory genomic regions operating in individual cell populations of the human ganglionic eminences, using these to additionally test for enrichment of schizophrenia common genetic variant liability and to functionally annotate non-coding variants associated with the disorder.Schizophrenia common variant liability was enriched in genes with high expression specificity for developing neuron populations that are predicted to form dopamine D1 and D2 receptor expressing GABAergic medium spiny neurons of the striatum, cortical somatostatin-positive GABAergic interneurons, calretinin-positive GABAergic neurons and cholinergic neurons. Consistent with these findings, schizophrenia genetic risk was also concentrated in predicted regulatory genomic sequence mapped in developing neuronal populations of the ganglionic eminences.Our study provides evidence for a role of prenatal GABAergic and cholinergic neuron development in later susceptibility to schizophrenia.",2.50852235736902e-38

However, the small sample size of typical RNA-seq experiments which is several orders of magnitude fewer than the number of genes is too low to infer GCNs reliably.recount3, a publicly available dataset comprised of 316,443 uniformly processed human RNA-seq samples, provides an opportunity to improve power for accurate network reconstruction and obtain biological insight from the resulting networks.We compared alternate aggregation strategies to identify an optimal workflow for GCN inference by data aggregation and inferred three consensus networks: a universal network, a non-cancer network, and a cancer network in addition to 27 tissue context-specific networks. Central network genes from our consensus networks were enriched for evolutionarily constrained genes and ubiquitous biological pathways, whereas central context-specific network genes included tissue-specific transcription factors and factorization based on the hubs led to clustering of related tissue contexts. We discovered that annotations corresponding to context-specific networks inferred from aggregated data were enriched for trait heritability beyond known functional genomic annotations and were significantly more enriched when we aggregated over a larger number of samples.This study outlines best practices for network GCN inference and evaluation by data aggregation. We recommend estimating and regressing confounders in each data set before aggregation and prioritizing large sample size studies for GCN reconstruction. Increased statistical power in inferring context-specific networks enabled the derivation of variant annotations that were enriched for concordant trait heritability independent of functional genomic annotations that are context-agnostic. While we observed strictly increasing held-out log-likelihood with data aggregation, we noted diminishing marginal improvements. Future directions aimed at alternate methods for estimating confounders and integrating orthogonal information from modalities such as Hi-C and ChIP-seq can further improve GCN inference.",2.44388575731524e-38

In various tissue microenvironments, multiple fibroblast subtypes interact with immunocytes by secreting growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, leading to wound healing, fibrosis, and escape of cancer immune surveillance. However, the specific mechanisms involved in the fibroblast-immunocyte interaction network have not yet been fully elucidated.Therefore, we systematically reviewed the molecular mechanisms of fibroblast-immunocyte interactions in fibrosis, from the history of cellular evolution and cell subtype divisions to the regulatory networks between fibroblasts and immunocytes. We also discuss how these communications function in different tissue and organ statuses, as well as potential therapies targeting the reciprocal fibroblast-immunocyte interplay in fibrosis.

Astronauts perform daily exercise programmes to mitigate these effects but knowing which muscles to target would optimise effectiveness. Accurate inflight assessment to inform exercise programmes is critical due to lack of technologies suitable for spaceflight. Changes in mechanical properties indicate muscle health status and can be measured rapidly and non-invasively using novel technology. A hand-held MyotonPRO device enabled monitoring of muscle health for the first time in spaceflight (> 180 days). Greater/maintained stiffness indicated countermeasures were effective. Tissue stiffness was preserved in the majority of muscles (neck, shoulder, back, thigh) but Tibialis Anterior (foot lever muscle) stiffness decreased inflight vs. preflight (p < 0.0001; mean difference 149 N/m) in all 12 crewmembers. The calf muscles showed opposing effects, Gastrocnemius increasing in stiffness Soleus decreasing. Selective stiffness decrements indicate lack of preservation despite daily inflight countermeasures. This calls for more targeted exercises for lower leg muscles with vital roles as ankle joint stabilizers and in gait. Muscle stiffness is a digital biomarker for risk monitoring during future planetary explorations (Moon, Mars), for healthcare management in challenging environments or clinical disorders in people on Earth, to enable effective tailored exercise programmes.© 2024.

However, patient outcomes vary among disease indications. Studies have identified prognostic biomarkers associated with immunotherapy response and patient outcomes derived from diverse data types, including next-generation bulk and single-cell DNA, RNA, T cell and B cell receptor sequencing data, liquid biopsies, and clinical imaging. Owing to inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity and the immune system's complexity, these biomarkers have diverse efficacy in clinical trials of ICB. Here, we review the genetic and genomic signatures and image features of ICB studies for pan-cancer applications and specific indications.

38254165,"Targeted long-read sequencing identified a causal structural variant in X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.","BMC Med Genomics","X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare genetic renal disease caused by pathogenic variants in the AVPR2 gene. Single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions in AVPR2 are reliably detected by routine clinical sequencing. Nevertheless, structural variants involving AVPR2 are challenging to identify accurately by conventional genetic testing. Here, we report a novel deletion of AVPR2 in a Czech family identified for the first time by targeted long-read sequencing (T-LRS).A male proband with X-linked NDI underwent clinical sequencing of the AVPR2 gene that failed and thus indicated possible whole-gene deletion. Therefore, PCR mapping and subsequent targeted long-read sequencing (T-LRS) using a Pacific Biosciences sequencer were applied to search for the suspected deletion. To validate the deletion breakpoints and prove variant segregation in the family with X-linked NDI, Sanger sequencing of the deletion junction was performed. Quantitative real-time PCR was further carried out to confirm the carrier status of heterozygous females.By T-LRS, a novel 7.5 kb deletion of AVPR2 causing X-linked NDI in the proband was precisely identified. Sanger sequencing of the deletion junction confirmed the variant breakpoints and detected the deletion in the probands´ mother, maternal aunt, and maternal cousin with X-linked NDI. The carrier status in heterozygous females was further validated by quantitative real-time PCR.Identifying the 7.5 kb deletion gave a precise molecular diagnosis for the proband, enabled genetic counselling and genetic testing for the family, and further expanded the spectrum of structural variants causing X-linked NDI. Our results also show that T-LRS has significant potential for accurately identifying putative structural variants.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.66297973039426e-38
38198519,"Systems approach for congruence and selection of cancer models towards precision medicine.","PLoS Comput Biol","Cancer models are instrumental as a substitute for human studies and to expedite basic, translational, and clinical cancer research. For a given cancer type, a wide selection of models, such as cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, organoids and genetically modified murine models, are often available to researchers. However, how to quantify their congruence to human tumors and to select the most appropriate cancer model is a largely unsolved issue. Here, we present Congruence Analysis and Selection of CAncer Models (CASCAM), a statistical and machine learning framework for authenticating and selecting the most representative cancer models in a pathway-specific manner using transcriptomic data. CASCAM provides harmonization between human tumor and cancer model omics data, systematic congruence quantification, and pathway-based topological visualization to determine the most appropriate cancer model selection. The systems approach is presented using invasive lobular breast carcinoma (ILC) subtype and suggesting CAMA1 followed by UACC3133 as the most representative cell lines for ILC research. Two additional case studies for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and patient-derived xenograft/organoid (PDX/PDO) are further investigated. CASCAM is generalizable to any cancer subtype and will authenticate cancer models for faithful non-human preclinical research towards precision medicine.Copyright: © 2024 Zou et al.

One such environment that can significantly affect innate immunity is spaceflight. In this study, we explored the impact of microgravity stress on key elements of the NFκB innate immune pathway. The symbiosis between the bobtail squid Euprymna scolopes and its beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri was used as a model system under a simulated microgravity environment. The expression of genes associated with the NFκB pathway was monitored over time as the symbiosis progressed. Results revealed that although the onset of the symbiosis was the major driver in the differential expression of NFκB signaling, the stress of simulated low-shear microgravity also caused a dysregulation of expression. Several genes were expressed at earlier time points suggesting that elements of the E. scolopes NFκB pathway are stress-inducible, whereas expression of other pathway components was delayed. The results provide new insights into the role of NFκB signaling in the squid-vibrio symbiosis, and how the stress of microgravity negatively impacts the host immune response. Together, these results provide a foundation to develop mitigation strategies to maintain host-microbe homeostasis during spaceflight.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.34005243993835e-38

In clinical practice, body mass index and waist-related measurements can be used for obesity screening. The estimated prevalence of obesity among adults worldwide is 12%. With the expected further increase in overall obesity prevalence, clinicians will increasingly be managing patients with obesity. Energy balance is regulated by a complex neurohumoral system that involves the central nervous system and circulating mediators, among which leptin is the most studied. The functioning of these systems is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Obesity generally occurs when a genetically predisposed individual lives in an obesogenic environment for a long period. Cardiologists are deeply involved in evaluating patients with obesity. Cardiovascular risk profile is one of the most important items to be quantified to understand the health risk due to obesity and the clinical benefit that a single patient can obtain with weight loss. At the individual level, appropriate patient involvement, the detection of potential obesity causes, and a multidisciplinary approach are tools that can improve clinical outcomes. In the near future, we will probably have new pharmacological tools at our disposal that will facilitate achieving and maintaining weight loss. However, pharmacological treatment alone cannot cure such a complex disease. The aim of this paper is to summarize some key points of this field, such as obesity definition and measurement tools, its epidemiology, the main mechanisms underlying energy homeostasis, health consequences of obesity with a focus on cardiovascular diseases and the obesity paradox.Level of evidence V: report of expert committees.© 2024.

Here, we performed genome-scale CRISPR screens along with computational analyses of cancer dependency and gene expression datasets to identify the inositol-metabolizing phosphatase INPP5A as a selective dependency in GNAQ/11-mutant UM cells in vitro and in vivo. Mutant cells intrinsically produce high levels of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) that accumulate upon suppression of INPP5A, resulting in hyperactivation of IP3-receptor signaling, increased cytosolic calcium and p53-dependent apoptosis. Finally, we show that GNAQ/11-mutant UM cells and patients' tumors exhibit elevated levels of IP4, a biomarker of enhanced IP3 production; these high levels are abolished by GNAQ/11 inhibition and correlate with sensitivity to INPP5A depletion. Our findings uncover INPP5A as a synthetic lethal vulnerability and a potential therapeutic target for GNAQ/11-mutant-driven cancers.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.20740929639775e-38

Here, we find that disruption of H3K36 methylation dramatically impairs normal epithelial differentiation and development, which promotes increased cellular plasticity and enrichment of alternative cell fates. Specifically, we observe a striking increase in the aberrant generation of excessive epithelial glandular tissues, including hypertrophic salivary, sebaceous, and meibomian glands, as well as enhanced squamous tumorigenesis. These phenotypic and gene expression manifestations are associated with loss of H3K36me2 and rewiring of repressive H3K27me3, changes we also observe in human patients with glandular hyperplasia. Collectively, these results have identified a critical role for H3K36 methylation in both in vivo epithelial cell-fate decisions and the prevention of squamous carcinogenesis and suggest that H3K36 methylation modulation may offer new avenues for the treatment of numerous common disorders driven by altered glandular function, which collectively affect large segments of the human population.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

38271377,"Prenatal alcohol exposure alters expression of genes involved in cell adhesion, immune response, and toxin metabolism in adolescent rat hippocampus.","PLoS One","Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can result in mild to severe consequences for children throughout their lives, with this range of symptoms referred to as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). These consequences are thought to be linked to changes in gene expression and transcriptional programming in the brain, but the identity of those changes, and how they persist into adolescence are unclear. In this study, we isolated RNA from the hippocampus of adolescent rats exposed to ethanol during prenatal development and compared gene expression to controls. Briefly, dams were either given free access to standard chow ad libitum (AD), pair-fed a liquid diet (PF) or were given a liquid diet with ethanol (6.7% ethanol, ET) throughout gestation (gestational day (GD) 0-20). All dams were given control diet ad libitum beginning on GD 20 and throughout parturition and lactation. Hippocampal tissue was collected from adolescent male and female offspring (postnatal day (PD) 35-36). Exposure to ethanol caused widespread downregulation of many genes as compared to control rats. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that affected pathways included cell adhesion, toxin metabolism, and immune responses. Interestingly, these differences were not strongly affected by sex. Furthermore, these changes were consistent when comparing ethanol-exposed rats to pair-fed controls provided with a liquid diet and those fed ad libitum on a standard chow diet. We conclude from this study that changes in genetic architecture and the resulting neuronal connectivity after prenatal exposure to alcohol continue through adolescent development. Further research into the consequences of specific gene expression changes on neural and behavioral changes will be vital to our understanding of the FASD spectrum of diseases.Copyright: © 2024 Khalifa et al.

38177668,"Auto-suppression of Tet dioxygenases protects the mouse oocyte genome from oxidative demethylation.","Nat Struct Mol Biol","DNA cytosine methylation plays a vital role in repressing retrotransposons, and such derepression is linked with developmental failure, tumorigenesis and aging. DNA methylation patterns are formed by precisely regulated actions of DNA methylation writers (DNA methyltransferases) and erasers (TET, ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases). However, the mechanisms underlying target-specific oxidation of 5mC by TET dioxygenases remain largely unexplored. Here we show that a large low-complexity domain (LCD), located in the catalytic part of Tet enzymes, negatively regulates the dioxygenase activity. Recombinant Tet3 lacking LCD is shown to be hyperactive in converting 5mC into oxidized species in vitro. Endogenous expression of the hyperactive Tet3 mutant in mouse oocytes results in genome-wide 5mC oxidation. Notably, the occurrence of aberrant 5mC oxidation correlates with a consequent loss of the repressive histone mark H3K9me3 at ERVK retrotransposons. The erosion of both 5mC and H3K9me3 causes ERVK derepression along with upregulation of their neighboring genes, potentially leading to the impairment of oocyte development. These findings suggest that Tet dioxygenases use an intrinsic auto-regulatory mechanism to tightly regulate their enzymatic activity, thus achieving spatiotemporal specificity of methylome reprogramming, and highlight the importance of methylome integrity for development.© 2024.

For a long time regarded as being completely shielded from host immune responses due to viral latency, these cells do, on closer examination with single-cell analytic techniques, display discrete footprints of immune selection, implying that human immune responses may be able to effectively engage and target at least some of these cells. The failure to eliminate rebound-competent virally infected cells in the majority of persons likely reflects the evolution of a highly selected pool of reservoir cells that are effectively camouflaged from immune recognition or rely on sophisticated approaches for resisting immune-mediated killing.

38246423,"Association of GAL-8 promoter methylation levels with coronary plaque inflammation.","Int J Cardiol","Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a condition that carries a high risk of mortality and is associated with aging. CHD is characterized by the chronic inflammatory response of the coronary intima. Recent studies have shown that the methylation level of blood mononuclear cell DNA is closely associated with adverse events in CHD, but the roles and mechanisms of DNA methylation in CHD remain elusive.In this study, the DNA methylation status within the epigenome of human coronary tissue in the sudden coronary death (SCD) group and control (CON) group of coronary heart disease was analyzed using the Illumina® Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850 K chip), resulting in the identification of a total of 2553 differentially methylated genes (DMGs). The differentially methylated genes were then subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, and significant differential DNA methylation was found. Among the differentially hypomethylated genes were GAL-8, LTF, and RFPL3, while the highly methylated genes were TMEM9B, ANK3, and C6orF48. These genes were mainly enriched in 10 significantly enriched pathways, such as cell adhesion junctions, among which the differentially methylated gene GAL-8 was involved in inflammatory pathway signaling. For functional analysis of GAL-8, we first examined the differences in GAL-8 promoter methylation levels among different subgroups of human coronary tissue in the CON, CHD, and SCD groups using pyrophosphate sequencing. The results revealed reduced GAL-8 promoter methylation levels in the SCD group, while the difference between the CHD and CON groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The reduced GAL-8 promoter methylation level was associated with upregulated GAL-8 expression, which led to increased expression of the inflammatory markers TNF-α, IL-1β, MCP-1, MIP-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9. This enhanced inflammatory response contributed to the accumulation of foam cells, thickening of the intima of human coronary arteries, and increased luminal stenosis, which promoted the occurrence of sudden coronary death. Next, we found that GAL-8 promoter methylation levels in PBMC were consistent with human coronary tissue. The unstable angina group (UAP) had significantly lower GAL-8 promoter methylation levels than stable angina (SAP) and healthy controls (CON) (P < 0.05), and there was a significant correlation between reduced GAL-8 promoter methylation levels and risk factors for coronary heart disease. These findings highlight the association between decreased GAL-8 promoter methylation and the presence of coronary heart disease risk factors. ROC curve analysis suggests that methylation of the GAL 8 promoter region is an independent risk factor for CHD. In conclusion, our study confirmed differential expression of GAL-8, LTF, MUC4D, TMEM9B, MYOM2, and ANK3 genes due to DNA methylation in the SCD group. We also established the consistency of GAL-8 promoter methylation alterations between human coronary tissue and patient peripheral blood monocytes. The decreased methylation level of the GAL-8 promoter may be related to the increased expression of GAL-8 and the coronary risk factors.Accordingly, we hypothesized that reduced levels of GAL-8 promoter methylation may be an independent risk factor for adverse events in coronary heart disease.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

38243132,"Depletion of SAM leading to loss of heterochromatin drives muscle stem cell ageing.","Nat Metab","The global loss of heterochromatin during ageing has been observed in eukaryotes from yeast to humans, and this has been proposed as one of the causes of ageing. However, the cause of this age-associated loss of heterochromatin has remained enigmatic. Here we show that heterochromatin markers, including histone H3K9 di/tri-methylation and HP1, decrease with age in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) as a consequence of the depletion of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). We find that restoration of intracellular SAM in aged MuSCs restores heterochromatin content to youthful levels and rejuvenates age-associated features, including DNA damage accumulation, increased cell death, and defective muscle regeneration. SAM is not only a methyl group donor for transmethylation, but it is also an aminopropyl donor for polyamine synthesis. Excessive consumption of SAM in polyamine synthesis may reduce its availability for transmethylation. Consistent with this premise, we observe that perturbation of increased polyamine synthesis by inhibiting spermidine synthase restores intracellular SAM content and heterochromatin formation, leading to improvements in aged MuSC function and regenerative capacity in male and female mice. Together, our studies demonstrate a direct causal link between polyamine metabolism and epigenetic dysregulation during murine MuSC ageing.© 2024.

Previous studies indicate that the frailty index, facial aging, telomere length (TL), and epigenetic aging clock acceleration are commonly used biological aging proxy indicators. This study aims to comprehensively explore potential relationships between biological aging and neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors by integrating various biological aging proxy indicators, employing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.Two-sample bidirectional MR analyses were conducted using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. Summary statistics for various neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors, along with biological aging proxy indicators, were obtained from extensive meta-analyses of GWAS. Genetic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the exposures were used as instrumental variables, assessing causal relationships between three neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), two benign neurological tumors (vestibular schwannoma and meningioma), one malignant neurological tumor (glioma), and four biological aging indicators (frailty index, facial aging, TL, and epigenetic aging clock acceleration). Sensitivity analyses were also performed.Our analysis revealed that genetically predicted longer TL reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease but increases the risk of vestibular schwannoma and glioma (All Glioma, GBM, non-GBM). In addition, there is a suggestive causal relationship between some diseases (PD and GBM) and DNA methylation GrimAge acceleration. Causal relationships between biological aging proxy indicators and other neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors were not observed.Building upon prior investigations into the causal relationships between telomeres and neurodegenerative diseases and neurological tumors, our study validates these findings using larger GWAS data and demonstrates, for the first time, that Parkinson's disease and GBM may promote epigenetic age acceleration.

38308077,"Calreticulin and JAK2V617F driver mutations induce distinct mitotic defects in myeloproliferative neoplasms.","Sci Rep","Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) encompass a diverse group of hematologic disorders driven by mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL. The prevailing working model explaining how these driver mutations induce different disease phenotypes is based on the decisive influence of the cellular microenvironment and the acquisition of additional mutations. Here, we report increased levels of chromatin segregation errors in hematopoietic cells stably expressing CALRdel52 or JAK2V617F mutations. Our investigations employing murine 32DMPLand human erythroleukemic TF-1MPLcells demonstrate a link between CALRdel52 or JAK2V617F expression and a compromised spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a phenomenon contributing to error-prone mitosis. This defective SAC is associated with imbalances in the recruitment of SAC factors to mitotic kinetochores upon CALRdel52 or JAK2V617F expression. We show that JAK2 mutant CD34 + MPN patient-derived cells exhibit reduced expression of the master mitotic regulators PLK1, aurora kinase B, and PP2A catalytic subunit. Furthermore, the expression profile of mitotic regulators in CD34 + patient-derived cells allows to faithfully distinguish patients from healthy controls, as well as to differentiate primary and secondary myelofibrosis from essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera. Altogether, our data suggest alterations in mitotic regulation as a potential driver in the pathogenesis in MPN.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.76467088497239e-39
38228888,"An ancient polymorphic regulatory region within the BDNF gene associated with obesity modulates anxiety-like behaviour in mice and humans.","Mol Psychiatry","Obesity and anxiety are morbidities notable for their increased impact on society during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the mechanisms governing susceptibility to these conditions will increase our quality of life and resilience to future pandemics. In the current study, we explored the function of a highly conserved regulatory region (BE5.1) within the BDNF gene that harbours a polymorphism strongly associated with obesity (rs10767664; p = 4.69 × 10-26). Analysis in primary cells suggested that the major T-allele of BE5.1 was an enhancer, whereas the obesity-associated A-allele was not. However, CRISPR/CAS9 deletion of BE5.1 from the mouse genome (BE5.1KO) produced no significant effect on the expression of BDNF transcripts in the hypothalamus, no change in weight gain after 28 days and only a marginally significant increase in food intake. Nevertheless, transcripts were significantly increased in the amygdala of female mice and elevated zero maze and marble-burying tests demonstrated a significant increase in anxiety-like behaviour that could be reversed by diazepam. Consistent with these observations, human GWAS cohort analysis demonstrated a significant association between rs10767664 and anxiousness in human populations. Intriguingly, interrogation of the human GTEx eQTL database demonstrated no effect on BDNF mRNA levels associated with rs10767664 but a highly significant effect on BDNF-antisense (BDNF-AS) gene expression and splicing. The subsequent observation that deletion of BE5.1 also significantly reduced BDNF-AS expression in mice suggests a novel mechanism in the regulation of BDNF expression common to mice and humans, which contributes to the modulation of mood and anxiety in both species.© 2024.

However, the identification of a reliable biomarker for predicting the response to this chemo-immunotherapy regimen remains elusive. While computed tomography (CT) is widely utilized for response evaluation, its inherent limitations in terms of accuracy are well recognized. Therefore, in this study, we present a novel technique to predict the response of ESCC patients before receiving chemo-immunotherapy by testing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath.This study employed a prospective-specimen-collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation design. Patients' baseline breath samples were collected and analyzed using high-pressure photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPPI-TOFMS). Subsequently, patients were categorized as responders or non-responders based on the evaluation of therapeutic response using pathology (for patients who underwent surgery) or CT images (for patients who did not receive surgery).A total of 133 patients were included in this study, with 91 responders who achieved either a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR), and 42 non-responders who had stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). Among 83 participants who underwent both evaluations with CT and pathology, the paired t-test revealed significant differences between the two methods (p < 0.05). For the breath test prediction model using breath test data from all participants, the validation set demonstrated mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 ± 0.06. For 83 patients with pathological reports, the breath test achieved mean AUC of 0.845 ± 0.123.Since CT has inherent weakness in hollow organ assessment and no other ideal biomarker has been found, our study provided a noninvasive, feasible, and inexpensive tool that could precisely predict ESCC patients' response to neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy combination using breath test based on HPPI-TOFMS.© 2024.

38297070,"Selection on synonymous sites: the unwanted transcript hypothesis.","Nat Rev Genet","Although translational selection to favour codons that match the most abundant tRNAs is not readily observed in humans, there is nonetheless selection in humans on synonymous mutations. We hypothesize that much of this synonymous site selection can be explained in terms of protection against unwanted RNAs - spurious transcripts, mis-spliced forms or RNAs derived from transposable elements or viruses. We propose not only that selection on synonymous sites functions to reduce the rate of creation of unwanted transcripts (for example, through selection on exonic splice enhancers and cryptic splice sites) but also that high-GC content (but low-CpG content), together with intron presence and position, is both particular to functional native mRNAs and used to recognize transcripts as native. In support of this hypothesis, transcription, nuclear export, liquid phase condensation and RNA degradation have all recently been shown to promote GC-rich transcripts and suppress AU/CpG-rich ones. With such 'traps' being set against AU/CpG-rich transcripts, the codon usage of native genes has, in turn, evolved to avoid such suppression. That parallel filters against AU/CpG-rich transcripts also affect the endosomal import of RNAs further supports the unwanted transcript hypothesis of synonymous site selection and explains the similar design rules that have enabled the successful use of transgenes and RNA vaccines.© 2024.

38238311,"Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination (DISE) correlates with neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease and aging.","Nat Commun","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, but the specific events that cause cell death remain poorly understood. Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination (DISE) is a cell death mechanism mediated by short (s) RNAs acting through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). DISE is thus a form of RNA interference, in which G-rich 6mer seed sequences in the sRNAs (position 2-7) target hundreds of C-rich 6mer seed matches in genes essential for cell survival, resulting in the activation of cell death pathways. Here, using Argonaute precipitation and RNAseq (Ago-RP-Seq), we analyze RISC-bound sRNAs to quantify 6mer seed toxicity in several model systems. In mouse AD models and aging brain, in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from AD patients, and in cells exposed to Aβ42 oligomers, RISC-bound sRNAs show a shift to more toxic 6mer seeds compared to controls. In contrast, in brains of ""SuperAgers"", humans over age 80 who have superior memory performance, RISC-bound sRNAs are shifted to more nontoxic 6mer seeds. Cells depleted of nontoxic sRNAs are sensitized to Aβ42-induced cell death, and reintroducing nontoxic RNAs is protective. Altogether, the correlation between DISE and Aβ42 toxicity suggests that increasing the levels of nontoxic miRNAs in the brain or blocking the activity of toxic RISC-bound sRNAs could ameliorate neurodegeneration.© 2024.

38172489,"Cell Tree Rings: the structure of somatic evolution as a human aging timer.","Geroscience","Biological age is typically estimated using biomarkers whose states have been observed to correlate with chronological age. A persistent limitation of such aging clocks is that it is difficult to establish how the biomarker states are related to the mechanisms of aging. Somatic mutations could potentially form the basis for a more fundamental aging clock since the mutations are both markers and drivers of aging and have a natural timescale. Cell lineage trees inferred from these mutations reflect the somatic evolutionary process, and thus, it has been conjectured, the aging status of the body. Such a timer has been impractical thus far, however, because detection of somatic variants in single cells presents a significant technological challenge. Here, we show that somatic mutations detected using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from thousands of cells can be used to construct a cell lineage tree whose structure correlates with chronological age. De novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) are detected in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells using a modified protocol. A default model based on penalized multiple regression of chronological age on 31 metrics characterizing the phylogenetic tree gives a Pearson correlation of 0.81 and a median absolute error of ~4 years between predicted and chronological ages. Testing of the model on a public scRNA-seq dataset yields a Pearson correlation of 0.85. In addition, cell tree age predictions are found to be better predictors of certain clinical biomarkers than chronological age alone, for instance glucose, albumin levels, and leukocyte count. The geometry of the cell lineage tree records the structure of somatic evolution in the individual and represents a new modality of aging timer. In addition to providing a numerical estimate of ""cell tree age,"" it unveils a temporal history of the aging process, revealing how clonal structure evolves over life span. Cell Tree Rings complements existing aging clocks and may help reduce the current uncertainty in the assessment of geroprotective trials.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.16641545690175e-39

This study made use of tissue from IDH1 wild type (IDH1-wt) glioblastoma (n = 18) and IDH1 mutant (IDH1-mt) astrocytoma (n = 12) tumors. We uncover a prevalent and intriguing surplus of lipids. The bulk of the lipids manifested as sizable cytoplasmic inclusions and extracellular deposits in the tumor microenvironment (TME); in some tumors the lipids were stored in the classical membraneless spheroidal lipid droplets (LDs). Frequently, lipids accumulated inside mitochondria, suggesting possible dysfunction of the beta-oxidation pathway. Additionally, the tumor vasculature have lipid deposits in their lumen and vessel walls; this lipid could have shifted in from the tumor microenvironment or have been produced by the vessel-invading tumor cells. Lipid excess in gliomas stems from disrupted beta-oxidation and dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation pathways. The implications of this lipid-driven environment include structural support for the tumor cells and protection against immune responses, non-lipophilic drugs, and free radicals.",1.8148109003351e-39

The incidence is likely an underestimation as the condition is usually recognized based on observable phenotypes at birth. BWS children have up to a 28% risk of developing tumors and currently, only 80% of patients can be corroborated molecularly (epimutations/variants). It is unknown how the subtypes of this condition are molecularly similar/dissimilar globally, therefore there is a need to deeply characterize the syndrome at the molecular level. Here we characterize the methylome, transcriptome and chromatin configuration of 18 BWS individuals together with the animal model of the condition, the bovine large offspring syndrome (LOS). Sex specific comparisons are performed for a subset of the BWS patients and LOS. Given that this epigenetic overgrowth syndrome has been characterized as a loss-of-imprinting condition, parental allele-specific comparisons were performed using the bovine animal model. In general, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) detected in BWS and LOS showed significant enrichment for CTCF binding sites. Altered chromosome compartments in BWS and LOS were positively correlated with gene expression changes, and the promoters of differentially expressed genes showed significant enrichment for DMRs, differential topologically associating domains, and differential A/B compartments in some comparisons of BWS subtypes and LOS. We show shared regions of dysregulation between BWS and LOS, including several HOX gene clusters, and also demonstrate that altered DNA methylation differs between the clinically epigenetically identified BWS patients and those identified as having DNA variants (i.e.CDKN1Cmicrodeletion). Lastly, we highlight additional genes and genomic regions that have the potential to serve as targets for biomarker development to improve current molecular methodologies. In summary, our results suggest that genome-wide alternation of chromosome architecture, which is partially caused by DNA methylation changes, also contribute to the development of BWS and LOS.",1.34992473024357e-39

While in H. pylori, 6mA sites were enriched at 5' end of protein-coding genes, potentially enhancing gene expression. Genes with low 6mA density were closely related to defense mechanism.This study elucidated the distribution characteristics of 6mA in A. veronii and H. pylori, highlighting the effects of 6mA on gene expression and function.

Mature germline piRNAs have distinct characteristics including a 24- to 32-nucleotide length and a 2'-O-methylation signature at the 3' end. Although recent studies have identified piRNAs in somatic tissues, they remain poorly characterized. For example, we recently demonstrated notable expression of piRNA in the murine soma, and while overall expression was lower than that of the germline, unique characteristics suggested tissue-specific functions of this class. While currently available databases commonly use length and association with PIWI proteins to identify piRNA, few have included a chemical oxidation method that detects piRNA based on its 3' modification. This method leads to reproducible and rigorous data processing when coupled with next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.

38396041,"Reconstructing phylogenetic trees from genome-wide somatic mutations in clonal samples.","Nat Protoc","Phylogenetic trees are a powerful means to display the evolutionary history of species, pathogens and, more recently, individual cells of the human body. Whole-genome sequencing of laser capture microdissections or expanded stem cells has allowed the discovery of somatic mutations in clones, which can be used as natural barcodes to reconstruct the developmental history of individual cells. Here we describe Sequoia, our pipeline to reconstruct lineage trees from clones of normal cells. Candidate somatic mutations are called against the human reference genome and filtered to exclude germline mutations and artifactual variants. These filtered somatic mutations form the basis for phylogeny reconstruction using a maximum parsimony framework. Lastly, we use a maximum likelihood framework to explicitly map mutations to branches in the phylogenetic tree. The resulting phylogenies can then serve as a basis for many subsequent analyses, including investigating embryonic development, tissue dynamics in health and disease, and mutational signatures. Sequoia can be readily applied to any clonal somatic mutation dataset, including single-cell DNA sequencing datasets, using the commands and scripts provided. Moreover, Sequoia is highly flexible and can be easily customized. Typically, the runtime of the core script ranges from minutes to an hour for datasets with a moderate number (50,000-150,000) of variants. Competent bioinformatic skills, including in-depth knowledge of the R programming language, are required.

We integrated metabolomics data from patients admitted to an intensive care unit for sepsis, with commonly collected clinical features of their cases and two measures of endothelial function relevant to blood vessel function, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule and soluble thrombomodulin concentrations in plasma. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalized regression, and pathway enrichment analysis to identify features most able to predict 30-day survival. The features important to sepsis survival include carnitines, and amino acids. Endothelial proteins in plasma also predict 30-day mortality and the levels of these proteins also correlate with a somewhat overlapping set of metabolites. Overall metabolic dysregulation, particularly in endothelial cells, may be a contributory factor to sepsis response.

The effects of aging affect not only the elderly but also those of younger ages, posing significant challenges to global healthcare. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with aging in different diseases is essential. One intriguing factor is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which serves as a cytoplasmic receptor and ligand-activated transcription factor and has been linked to the aging process.

Neurons uniquely express the longest genes in the genome and utilize neuron-enriched non-CG DNA methylation (mCA) together with the Rett syndrome protein, MeCP2, to control gene expression, but the function of these unique gene structures and machinery in regulating finely resolved neuron type-specific gene programs has not been explored. Here, we employ epigenomic and spatial transcriptomic analyses to discover a major role for mCA and MeCP2 in maintaining neuron type-specific gene programs at the finest scale of cellular resolution. We uncover differential susceptibility to MeCP2 loss in neuronal populations depending on global mCA levels and dissect methylation patterns and intragenic enhancer repression that drive overlapping and distinct gene regulation between neuron types. Strikingly, we show that mCA and MeCP2 regulate genes that are repeatedly tuned to differentiate neuron types at the highest cellular resolution, including spatially resolved, vision-dependent gene programs in the visual cortex. These repeatedly tuned genes display genomic characteristics, including long length, numerous intragenic enhancers, and enrichment for mCA, that predispose them to regulation by MeCP2.

Whereas exome sequencing failed to detect the non-coding deletion, genome-wide CpG methylation analysis revealed an episignature suggestive of a Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome diagnosis. This diagnosis was further supported by PhenoScore, a novel facial recognition software package. Subsequent whole-genome sequencing resolved the three-base pair ADNP deletion c.[-5-1_-4del] with transcriptome sequencing showing this deletion leads to skipping of exon 4. An N-terminal truncated protein could not be detected in transfection experiments with a mutant expression vector in HEK293T cells, strongly suggesting this is a first confirmed diagnosis exclusively due to haploinsufficiency of the ADNP gene. Pathway analysis of the methylome indicated differentially methylated genes involved in brain development, the cytoskeleton, locomotion, behavior, and muscle development. Along the same line, transcriptome analysis identified most of the differentially expressed genes as upregulated, in line with the hypomethylated CpG episignature and confirmed the involvement of the cytoskeleton and muscle development pathways that are also affected in patient cell lines and animal models. In conclusion, this novel mutation for the first time demonstrates that Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome can be caused by a loss-of-function mutation. Moreover, our study elegantly illustrates the use of EpiSignatures, WGS and Phenoscore as novel complementary diagnostic tools in case a of negative WES result.© 2024.

38370645,"Microglia-astrocyte crosstalk regulates synapse remodeling via Wnt signaling.","bioRxiv","Astrocytes and microglia are emerging key regulators of activity-dependent synapse remodeling that engulf and remove synapses in response to changes in neural activity. Yet, the degree to which these cells communicate to coordinate this process remains an open question. Here, we use whisker removal in postnatal mice to induce activity-dependent synapse removal in the barrel cortex. We show that astrocytes do not engulf synapses in this paradigm. Instead, astrocytes reduce their contact with synapses prior to microglia-mediated synapse engulfment. We further show that reduced astrocyte-contact with synapses is dependent on microglial CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signaling and release of Wnts from microglia following whisker removal. These results demonstrate an activity-dependent mechanism by which microglia instruct astrocyte-synapse interactions, which then provides a permissive environment for microglia to remove synapses. We further show that this mechanism is critical to remodel synapses in a changing sensory environment and this signaling is upregulated in several disease contexts.",4.70498616049807e-40

Evolving techniques and experimental systems have helped refine our understanding of this complex cellular network. Current single-cell RNA sequencing methods can resolve subtle differences between cell types and states, thus providing a great tool for studying the molecular and cellular repertoire of the oral mucosa in health and disease. However, it requires the dissociation of tissue samples, which means that the interrelationships between cells are lost. Spatial transcriptomic methods bypass tissue dissociation and retain this spatial information, thereby allowing gene expression to be assessed across thousands of cells within the context of tissue structural organization. Here, we discuss the contribution of spatial technologies in shaping our understanding of this complex system. We consider the impact on identifying disease cellular neighborhoods and how space defines cell state. We also discuss the limitations and future directions of spatial sequencing technologies with recent advances in machine learning. Finally, we offer a perspective on open questions about mucosal homeostasis that these technologies are well placed to address.",4.51889806919784e-40
38169461,"Cellular zinc metabolism and zinc signaling: from biological functions to diseases and therapeutic targets.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Zinc metabolism at the cellular level is critical for many biological processes in the body. A key observation is the disruption of cellular homeostasis, often coinciding with disease progression. As an essential factor in maintaining cellular equilibrium, cellular zinc has been increasingly spotlighted in the context of disease development. Extensive research suggests zinc's involvement in promoting malignancy and invasion in cancer cells, despite its low tissue concentration. This has led to a growing body of literature investigating zinc's cellular metabolism, particularly the functions of zinc transporters and storage mechanisms during cancer progression. Zinc transportation is under the control of two major transporter families: SLC30 (ZnT) for the excretion of zinc and SLC39 (ZIP) for the zinc intake. Additionally, the storage of this essential element is predominantly mediated by metallothioneins (MTs). This review consolidates knowledge on the critical functions of cellular zinc signaling and underscores potential molecular pathways linking zinc metabolism to disease progression, with a special focus on cancer. We also compile a summary of clinical trials involving zinc ions. Given the main localization of zinc transporters at the cell membrane, the potential for targeted therapies, including small molecules and monoclonal antibodies, offers promising avenues for future exploration.© 2023.

Invasive tissue biopsy is the gold standard for acquiring molecular data and categorizing lymphoma patients into genetic subtypes. However, surgical intervention is unfeasible for patients who are critically ill, have unresectable tumors, or demonstrate low compliance, making tissue biopsies inaccessible to these patients. A critical need for a minimally invasive approach in T-cell lymphoma is evident, particularly in the areas of early diagnosis, prognostic monitoring, treatment response, and drug resistance. Therefore, the clinical application of liquid biopsy techniques has gained significant attention in T-cell lymphoma. Moreover, liquid biopsy requires fewer samples, exhibits good reproducibility, and enables real-time monitoring at molecular levels, thereby facilitating personalized health care. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current liquid biopsy biomarkers used for T-cell lymphoma, focusing on circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA, antibodies, and cytokines. Additionally, we discuss their clinical application, detection methodologies, ongoing clinical trials, and the challenges faced in the field of liquid biopsy.© 2024.

This facilitated research focusing on understanding the evolution of adaptive traits and the search for novel compounds that can be applied in agriculture and medicine. However, the toxin annotation of genomes is a laborious and time-consuming task, and no consensus pipeline is currently available. No computational tool currently exists to address the challenges specific to toxin annotation and to ensure the reproducibility of the process.Here, we present ToxCodAn-Genome, the first software designed to perform automated toxin annotation in genomes of venomous lineages. This pipeline was designed to retrieve the full-length coding sequences of toxins and to allow the detection of novel truncated paralogs and pseudogenes. We tested ToxCodAn-Genome using 12 genomes of venomous lineages and achieved high performance on recovering their current toxin annotations. This tool can be easily customized to allow improvements in the final toxin annotation set and can be expanded to virtually any venomous lineage. ToxCodAn-Genome is fast, allowing it to run on any personal computer, but it can also be executed in multicore mode, taking advantage of large high-performance servers. In addition, we provide a guide to direct future research in the venomics field to ensure a confident toxin annotation in the genome being studied. As a case study, we sequenced and annotated the toxin repertoire of Bothrops alternatus, which may facilitate future evolutionary and biomedical studies using vipers as models.ToxCodAn-Genome is suitable to perform toxin annotation in the genome of venomous species and may help to improve the reproducibility of further studies.

Using genetic engineering, molecular approaches, and live-cell single-molecule imaging, we quantify the number of proteins within condensates formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and find that in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), approximately 3 CBX2 proteins nucleate many PRC1 and PRC2 subunits to form one non-stoichiometric condensate. We demonstrate that sparse CBX2 prevents Polycomb proteins from migrating to constitutive heterochromatin, demarcates the spatial boundaries of facultative heterochromatin, controls the deposition of H3K27me3, regulates transcription, and impacts cellular differentiation. Furthermore, we show that LLPS of CBX2 is required for the demarcation and deposition of H3K27me3 and is essential for cellular differentiation. Our findings uncover new functional roles of LLPS in the formation of facultative heterochromatin and unravel a new mechanism by which low-abundant proteins nucleate many other proteins to form compartments that enable them to execute their functions.",2.79285589140099e-40

Although both genetic abnormalities and environmental factors can contribute to abnormal vertebral development, our knowledge on molecular mechanisms of numerous VMs is still limited. Furthermore, there is a lack of resource that consolidates the current knowledge in this field. In this pioneering review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the latest research on the molecular basis of VMs and the association of the VMs-related causative genes with bone developmental signaling pathways. Our study identifies 118 genes linked to VMs, with 98 genes involved in biological pathways crucial for the formation of the vertebral column.

Among these, neural stem cells (NSCs) play a fundamental role in neural development and repair processes. NSC characteristics and fate are intricately regulated by the microenvironment and intracellular signaling. Interestingly, metabolism plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the epigenome dynamics during neural differentiation, facilitating the transition from undifferentiated NSC to specialized neuronal and glial cell types. This intricate interplay between metabolism and the epigenome is essential for precisely regulating gene expression patterns and ensuring proper neural development. This review highlights the mechanisms behind metabolic regulation of NSC fate and their connections with epigenetic regulation to shape transcriptional programs of stemness and neural differentiation.

Recent technological developments now make it possible to detect CTCs reliably and repeatedly from a simple and straightforward blood test. Multicenter trials to assess the clinical value of CTCs have demonstrated the prognostic value of these cancer cells. Studies on CTCs have filled huge knowledge gap in understanding the process of metastasis since their identification in the late 19th century. However, these rare cancer cells have not been regularly used to tailor precision medicine and or identify novel druggable targets.

Correlative evidence from genetic studies indicate that the aggregated effects of distinct genetic risk factor combinations found in each patient converge onto common molecular mechanisms. To prove this on a functional level, we employed a reductionistic cellular model system for polygenic risk by differentiating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 104 individuals with high polygenic risk load and controls into cortical glutamatergic neurons (iNs). Multi-omics profiling identified widespread differences in alternative polyadenylation (APA) in the 3' untranslated region of many synaptic transcripts between iNs from SCZ patients and healthy donors. On the cellular level, 3'APA was associated with a reduction in synaptic density of iNs. Importantly, differential APA was largely conserved between postmortem human prefrontal cortex from SCZ patients and healthy donors, and strongly enriched for transcripts related to synapse biology. 3'APA was highly correlated with SCZ polygenic risk and affected genes were significantly enriched for SCZ associated common genetic variation. Integrative functional genomic analysis identified the RNA binding protein and SCZ GWAS risk gene PTBP2 as a critical trans-acting factor mediating 3'APA of synaptic genes in SCZ subjects. Functional characterization of PTBP2 in iNs confirmed its key role in 3'APA of synaptic transcripts and regulation of synapse density. Jointly, our findings show that the aggregated effects of polygenic risk converge on 3'APA as one common molecular mechanism that underlies synaptic impairments in SCZ.",1.91207801100418e-40

Genetic ablation of senescent cells can ameliorate various age-related pathologies, including metabolic dysfunction and decreased physical fitness. While small-molecule drugs that eliminate senescent cells ('senolytics') partially replicate these phenotypes, they require continuous administration. We have developed a senolytic therapy based on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting the senescence-associated protein urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and we previously showed these can safely eliminate senescent cells in young animals. We now show that uPAR-positive senescent cells accumulate during aging and that they can be safely targeted with senolytic CAR T cells. Treatment with anti-uPAR CAR T cells improves exercise capacity in physiological aging, and it ameliorates metabolic dysfunction (for example, improving glucose tolerance) in aged mice and in mice on a high-fat diet. Importantly, a single administration of these senolytic CAR T cells is sufficient to achieve long-term therapeutic and preventive effects.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.75544643087213e-40

High levels of aneuploidy are generally correlated with metastasis and poor prognosis in cancer patients. However, the causality of aneuploidy in cancer metastasis remains to be explored. Here we demonstrate that teratomas derived from aneuploid murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs), but not from isogenic diploid ESCs, disseminated to multiple organs, for which no additional copy number variations were required. Notably, no cancer driver gene mutations were identified in any metastases. Aneuploid circulating teratoma cells were successfully isolated from peripheral blood and showed high capacities for migration and organ colonization. Single-cell RNA sequencing of aneuploid primary teratomas and metastases identified a unique cell population with high stemness that was absent in diploid ESCs-derived teratomas. Further investigation revealed that aneuploid cells displayed decreased proteasome activity and overactivated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress during differentiation, thereby restricting the degradation of proteins produced from extra chromosomes in the ESC state and causing differentiation deficiencies. Noticeably, both proteasome activator Oleuropein and ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA can effectively inhibit aneuploid teratoma metastasis.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.48302323124739e-40

Whereas, in the early days, mainly morphological criteria were used to define cell types, later supplemented by electrophysiological and neurochemical properties, nowadays. single-cell transcriptomics is the method of choice for cell type classification. Bringing recent insight together, we conclude that despite all established layer- and area-dependent differences, there is a set of reliably identifiable cortical cell types that were named (among others) intratelencephalic (IT), extratelencephalic (ET), and corticothalamic (CT) for the excitatory cells, which altogether comprise ~ 56 transcriptomic cell types (t-types). By the same means, inhibitory neurons were subdivided into parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and ""other (i.e. Lamp5/Sncg)"" subpopulations, which altogether comprise ~ 60 t-types. The coming years will show which t-types actually translate into ""real"" cell types that show a common set of multimodal features, including not only transcriptome but also physiology and morphology as well as connectivity and ultimately function.

Current annotation tools usually assume the simultaneous acquisition of well-annotated data, but without the ability to expand knowledge from new data. Yet, such tools are inconsistent with the continuous emergence of scRNA-seq data, calling for a continuous cell-type annotation model. In addition, by their powerful ability of information integration and model interpretability, transformer-based pre-trained language models have led to breakthroughs in single-cell biology research. Therefore, the systematic combining of continual learning and pre-trained language models for cell-type annotation tasks is inevitable.We herein propose a universal cell-type annotation tool, called CANAL, that continuously fine-tunes a pre-trained language model trained on a large amount of unlabeled scRNA-seq data, as new well-labeled data emerges. CANAL essentially alleviates the dilemma of catastrophic forgetting, both in terms of model inputs and outputs. For model inputs, we introduce an experience replay schema that repeatedly reviews previous vital examples in current training stages. This is achieved through a dynamic example bank with a fixed buffer size. The example bank is class-balanced and proficient in retaining cell-type-specific information, particularly facilitating the consolidation of patterns associated with rare cell types. For model outputs, we utilize representation knowledge distillation to regularize the divergence between previous and current models, resulting in the preservation of knowledge learned from past training stages. Moreover, our universal annotation framework considers the inclusion of new cell types throughout the fine-tuning and testing stages. We can continuously expand the cell-type annotation library by absorbing new cell types from newly arrived, well-annotated training datasets, as well as automatically identify novel cells in unlabeled datasets. Comprehensive experiments with data streams under various biological scenarios demonstrate the versatility and high model interpretability of CANAL.An implementation of CANAL is available from https://github.com/aster-ww/CANAL-torch.dengmh@pku.edu.cn.Supplementary data are available at Journal Name online.© The Author(s) 2024.

The Drosophila Ets transcription factor Pointed (Pnt) is the downstream effector of the Epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) pathway and is required for cell cycle progression, specification, and differentiation of most cell types in the larval eye disc. Despite its critical role in development, very few targets of Pnt have been reported previously. Here, we employed an integrated approach by combining genome-wide single cell and bulk data to identify putative cell type-specific Pnt targets. First, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to determine the genome-wide occupancy of Pnt in late larval eye discs. We identified enriched regions that mapped to an average of 6,941 genes, the vast majority of which are novel putative Pnt targets. Next, we integrated ChIP-seq data with two other larval eye single cell genomics datasets (scRNA-seq and snATAC-seq) to reveal 157 putative cell type-specific Pnt targets that may help mediate unique cell type responses upon Egfr-induced differentiation. Finally, our integrated data also predicts cell type-specific functional enhancers that were not reported previously. Together, our study provides a greatly expanded list of putative cell type-specific Pnt targets in the eye and is a resource for future studies that will allow mechanistic insights into complex developmental processes regulated by Egfr signaling.© 2024.

DNMT3B localises to H3K36me3 at actively transcribing gene bodies via its PWWP domain. It also functions at heterochromatin through an unknown recruitment mechanism. Here, we find that knockout of DNMT3B causes loss of methylation predominantly at H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin and that DNMT3B PWWP domain mutations or deletion result in striking increases of methylation in H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. Removal of the N-terminal region of DNMT3B affects its ability to methylate H3K9me3-marked regions. This region of DNMT3B directly interacts with HP1α and facilitates the bridging of DNMT3B with H3K9me3-marked nucleosomes in vitro. Our results suggest that DNMT3B is recruited to H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin in a PWWP-independent manner that is facilitated by the protein's N-terminal region through an interaction with a key heterochromatin protein. More generally, we suggest that DNMT3B plays a role in DNA methylation homeostasis at heterochromatin, a process which is disrupted in cancer, aging and Immunodeficiency, Centromeric Instability and Facial Anomalies (ICF) syndrome.© 2024.

Studies indicate that prostate cancer accumulates genomic changes during disease progression and displays the highest levels of chromosomal instability (CIN) across all types of metastatic tumours. CIN, which refers to ongoing chromosomal DNA gain or loss during mitosis, and derived aneuploidy, are known to be associated with increased tumour heterogeneity, metastasis and therapy resistance in many tumour types. Paradoxically, high CIN levels are also proposed to be detrimental to tumour cell survival, suggesting that cancer cells must develop adaptive mechanisms to ensure their survival. In the context of prostate cancer, studies indicate that CIN has a key role in disease progression and might also offer a therapeutic vulnerability that can be pharmacologically targeted. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the causes and consequences of CIN in prostate cancer, its contribution to aggressive advanced disease and a better understanding of the acquired CIN tolerance mechanisms can translate into new tumour classifications, biomarker development and therapeutic strategies.© 2024.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate pivotal molecular markers that may facilitate the diagnosis of EoE in pediatric patients.Three available EoE-associated gene expression datasets in children: GSE184182, GSE 197702, GSE55794, along with GSE173895 were downloaded from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified by ""limma"" were intersected with key module genes identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and the shared genes went through functional enrichment analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and the machine learning algorithms: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest (RF), and XGBoost were used to reveal candidate diagnostic markers for EoE. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed the efficacy of differential diagnosis of this marker, along with online databases predicting its molecular regulatory network. Finally, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and assessed immune cell infiltration of EoE/control samples by using the CIBERSORT algorithm. The correlations between the key diagnostic biomarker and immune cells were also investigated.The intersection of 936 DEGs and 1446 key module genes in EoE generated 567 genes, which were primarily enriched in immune regulation. Following the construction of the PPI network and filtration by machine learning, CXCR2 served as a potential diagnostic biomarker of pediatric EoE with a perfect diagnostic efficacy (AUC = ~1.00) in regional tissue/peripheral whole blood samples. Multiple infiltrated immune cells were observed to participate in disrupting the homeostasis of esophageal epithelium to varying degrees.The immune-correlated CXCR2 gene was proved to be a promising diagnostic indicator for EoE, and dysregulated regulatory T cells (Tregs)/neutrophils might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of EoE in children.© 2024 Wu et al.",3.67045417691267e-41

Specifically, we sought to highlight the disparities in research efforts and outcomes between studies predominantly involving European ancestry participants and those deliberately targeting non-European or multi-ancestry populations across NDDs.We conducted a systematic review utilizing existing GWAS results and publications to assess the inclusion of diverse ancestry groups in neurodegeneration and neurogenetics studies. Our search encompassed studies published up to the end of 2022, with a focus on identifying research that deliberately included non-European or multi-ancestry cohorts. We employed rigorous methods for the inclusion of identified articles and quality assessment.Our review identified a total of 123 NDD GWAS. Strikingly, 82% of these studies predominantly featured participants of European ancestry. Endeavors specifically targeting non-European or multi-ancestry populations across NDDs identified only 52 risk loci. This contrasts with predominantly European studies, which reported over 90 risk loci for a single disease. Encouragingly, over 65% of these discoveries occurred in 2020 or later, indicating a recent increase in studies deliberately including non-European cohorts.Our findings underscore the pressing need for increased diversity in neurodegenerative research. The significant under-representation of non-European ancestry participants in NDD GWAS limits our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of these diseases. To advance the field of neurodegenerative research and develop more effective therapies, it is imperative that future investigations prioritize and harness the genomic diversity present within and across global populations.",3.48267909836759e-41
38366144,"Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of brainstem, cerebellum and olfactory tissues in early- and late-phase COVID-19.","Nat Neurosci","Neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment and fatigue, can occur in both the acute infection phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and at later stages, yet the mechanisms that contribute to this remain unclear. Here we profiled single-nucleus transcriptomes and proteomes of brainstem tissue from deceased individuals at various stages of COVID-19. We detected an inflammatory type I interferon response in acute COVID-19 cases, which resolves in the late disease phase. Integrating single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, we could localize two patterns of reaction to severe systemic inflammation, one neuronal with a direct focus on cranial nerve nuclei and a separate diffuse pattern affecting the whole brainstem. The latter reflects a bystander effect of the respiratory infection that spreads throughout the vascular unit and alters the transcriptional state of mainly oligodendrocytes, microglia and astrocytes, while alterations of the brainstem nuclei could reflect the connection of the immune system and the central nervous system via, for example, the vagus nerve. Our results indicate that even without persistence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the central nervous system, local immune reactions are prevailing, potentially causing functional disturbances that contribute to neurological complications of COVID-19.© 2024.

In addition, alterations in histone proteins such as cancer mutations and post-translational modifications have profound effects on histone/nucleosome interactions. To elucidate the principles of histone interactions and the effects of those alterations, we developed histone interactomes for comprehensive mapping of histone-histone interactions (HHIs), histone-DNA interactions (HDIs), histone-partner interactions (HPIs) and DNA-partner interactions (DPIs) of 37 organisms, which contains a total of 3808 HPIs from 2544 binding proteins and 339 HHIs, 100 HDIs and 142 DPIs across 110 histone variants. With the developed networks, we explored histone interactions at different levels of granularities (protein-, domain- and residue-level) and performed systematic analysis on histone interactions at a large scale. Our analyses have characterized the preferred binding hotspots on both nucleosomal/linker DNA and histone octamer and unraveled diverse binding modes between nucleosome and different classes of binding partners. Last, to understand the impact of histone cancer-associated mutations on histone/nucleosome interactions, we complied one comprehensive cancer mutation dataset including 7940 cancer-associated histone mutations and further mapped those mutations onto 419,125 histone interactions at the residue level. Our quantitative analyses point to histone cancer-associated mutations' strongly disruptive effects on HHIs, HDIs and HPIs. We have further predicted 57 recurrent histone cancer mutations that have large effects on histone/nucleosome interactions and may have driver status in oncogenesis.© The Author(s) 2024.

There's a growing need for in-depth research into these cancers, especially at the molecular level. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) – these don't code for proteins but are crucial in controlling genes – and the tumor microenvironment (TME), which is no longer seen as just a background factor but as an active player in cancer progression. Understanding how ncRNAs and the TME interact is key for finding new ways to diagnose and predict outcomes in urological cancers, and for developing new treatments. This article reviews the basic features of ncRNAs and goes into detail about their various roles in the TME, focusing specifically on how different ncRNAs function and act in urological malignancies.",2.39800708019793e-41
38413567,"Metabolic memory: mechanisms and diseases.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Metabolic diseases and their complications impose health and economic burdens worldwide. Evidence from past experimental studies and clinical trials suggests our body may have the ability to remember the past metabolic environment, such as hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia, thus leading to chronic inflammatory disorders and other diseases even after the elimination of these metabolic environments. The long-term effects of that aberrant metabolism on the body have been summarized as metabolic memory and are found to assume a crucial role in states of health and disease. Multiple molecular mechanisms collectively participate in metabolic memory management, resulting in different cellular alterations as well as tissue and organ dysfunctions, culminating in disease progression and even affecting offspring. The elucidation and expansion of the concept of metabolic memory provides more comprehensive insight into pathogenic mechanisms underlying metabolic diseases and complications and promises to be a new target in disease detection and management. Here, we retrace the history of relevant research on metabolic memory and summarize its salient characteristics. We provide a detailed discussion of the mechanisms by which metabolic memory may be involved in disease development at molecular, cellular, and organ levels, with emphasis on the impact of epigenetic modulations. Finally, we present some of the pivotal findings arguing in favor of targeting metabolic memory to develop therapeutic strategies for metabolic diseases and provide the latest reflections on the consequences of metabolic memory as well as their implications for human health and diseases.© 2024.

By integrating kidney function GWAS, human kidney expression and methylation quantitative trait analyses, we identified Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) DNA demethylase 2: TET2 as a novel kidney disease risk gene. Utilizing single-cell chromatin accessibility and CRISPR-based genome editing, we highlight GWAS variants that influenceTET2expression in kidney proximal tubule cells. Experiments using kidney-tubule-specificTet2knockout mice indicated its protective role in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury, as well as chronic kidney disease and fibrosis, induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction or adenine diet. Single-cell gene profiling of kidneys fromTet2knockout mice andTET2-knock-down tubule cells revealed the altered expression of DNA damage repair and chromosome segregation genes, notably includingINO80, another kidney function GWAS target gene itself. Remarkably bothTET2-null andINO80-null cells exhibited an increased accumulation of micronuclei after injury, leading to the activation of cytosolic nucleotide sensor cGAS-STING. Genetic deletion of cGAS or STING in kidney tubules or pharmacological inhibition of STING protected TET2 null mice from disease development. In conclusion, our findings highlight TET2 and INO80 as key genes in the pathogenesis of kidney diseases, indicating the importance of DNA damage repair mechanisms.",1.86546627462983e-41

Currently, the mechanisms regulating neuroprotective astrocytes and the extent of neuroprotection are poorly understood. Here, we report that conditional deletion of serum response factor (SRF) in adult astrocytes causes reactive-like hypertrophic astrocytes throughout the mouse brain. TheseSrfGFAP-ERCKO astrocytes do not affect neuron survival, synapse numbers, synaptic plasticity or learning and memory. However, the brains ofSrfknockout mice exhibited neuroprotection against kainic-acid induced excitotoxic cell death. Relevant to human neurodegenerative diseases,SrfGFAP-ERCKO astrocytes abrogate nigral dopaminergic neuron death and reduce β-amyloid plaques in mouse models of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Taken together, these findings establish SRF as a key molecular switch for the generation of reactive astrocytes with neuroprotective functions that attenuate neuronal injury in the setting of neurodegenerative diseases.© 2024, Thumu et al.",1.15204192461718e-41

Nevertheless, the extensive array of potential combinations poses challenges in terms of cost and time constraints for experimental screening. Thus, it is crucial to narrow down the search space. Deep learning approaches have gained widespread popularity in predicting synergistic drug combinations tailored for specific cell lines in vitro settings. In the present study, we introduce a novel method termed GTextSyn, which utilizes the integration of gene expression data and chemical structure information for the prediction of synergistic effects in drug combinations. GTextSyn employs a sentence classification model within the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), wherein drugs and cell lines are regarded as entities possessing biochemical relevance. Meanwhile, combinations of drug pairs and cell lines are construed as sentences with biochemical relational significance. To assess the efficacy of GTextSyn, we conduct a comparative analysis with alternative deep learning approaches using a standard benchmark dataset. The results from a five-fold cross-validation demonstrate a 49.5% reduction in Mean Square Error (MSE) achieved by GTextSyn, surpassing the performance of the next best method in the regression task. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive literature survey on the predicted novel drug combinations and find substantial support from prior experimental studies for many of the combinations identified by GTextSyn.© 2024.

Cellular senescence is considered to contribute to cellular dysfunction and inflammaging. According to the threshold theory of senescent cell accumulation, the vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases is associated with the rates of senescent cell generation and clearance within the brain. Given the role of microglia in eliminating senescent cells, the accumulation of senescent microglia may lead to the acceleration of brain aging, contributing to inflammaging and increased vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we propose the idea that the senescence of microglia, which is notably vulnerable to aging, could potentially serve as a central catalyst in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.

However, it requires specific bioinformatics skills to compare gene expression levels across cell lines. This has hindered non-bioinformaticians from fully utilizing these valuable datasets in their research. To bridge this gap, we established a curated Pan-cancer Cell Line Transcriptome Atlas (PCTA) dataset. This resource aims to provide a user-friendly platform, allowing researchers without extensive bioinformatics expertise to access and leverage the wealth of information within the dataset for their studies. Importantly, PCTA stands out by offering sufficient sample numbers per cell line in comparison to other pan-cancer datasets.Cell lines' meta data and RNA sequencing data were retrieved from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), SRA and ARCHS4 databases. Utilizing the programming language R, we conducted data retrieval, normalization, and visualization. Only expression data for protein-coding genes and long-non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) were considered in this study, streamlining the focus to enhance the precision and relevance of the analysis.The resulting PCTA dataset encompasses the expression matrix of 24,965 genes, featuring data from 84,385 samples derived from 5,677 studies. This comprehensive compilation spans 535 cell lines, representing a spectrum of 114 cancer types originating from 30 diverse tissue types.

A total of 52 healthy controls and 64 patients with AD were included. Compared to the controls, the patients with AD exhibited 2392 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 1015 and 1377 were upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively. Among them, nine common genes were identified by intersecting the AD-related module genes with the DEGs and ICD-associated genes. Gene ontology (GO)analysis further revealed ""positive regulation of cytokine production"" as the most significant term. Moreover, the enriched molecular functions were primarily related to the inflammatory body complex, while the overlapping genes were significantly enriched in lipopolysaccharide binding. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analysis also indicated that these overlapping genes were mainly enriched in immunity, inflammation, and lipid metabolism pathways. Furthermore, the following four hub genes were detected using machine learning algorithms: P2RX7, HSP90AA1, NT5E, and NLRP3. These genes demonstrated significant differences in expression between the AD and healthy control groups (P < 0.05). Additionally, the area under the curve values of these four genes were all > 0.7, indicating their potential diagnostic value for AD. We further validated the protein levels of these four genes in the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD and C57BL/6J mice, showing P2RX7 and HSP90AA1 expression levels consistent with the previously analyzed trends. Finally, the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm provided additional evidence by demonstrating the crucial role of immune cell infiltration and its link with the hub genes in AD progression. Our study results suggest that ICD-mediated elevation of HSP90AA1 and P2RX7 levels and the resulting induction of tau hyperphosphorylation and neuroinflammation are vital in the AD pathogenic mechanism.© 2024.

However, there is a substantial mismatch between the small number of food and drug administration (FDA)-approved drugs and annotated coding variants compared to the needs of precision medicine. This review introduces the concept of physics-based precision medicine, a scalable framework that promises to improve our understanding of sequence-function relationships and accelerate drug discovery. We show that accounting for the ensemble of structures a protein adopts in solution with computer simulations overcomes many of the limitations imposed by assuming a single protein structure. We highlight studies of protein dynamics and recent methods for the analysis of structural ensembles. These studies demonstrate that differences in conformational distributions predict functional differences within protein families and between variants. Thanks to new computational tools that are providing unprecedented access to protein structural ensembles, this insight may enable accurate predictions of variant pathogenicity for entire libraries of variants. We further show that explicitly accounting for protein ensembles, with methods like alchemical free energy calculations or docking to Markov state models, can uncover novel lead compounds. To conclude, we demonstrate that cryptic pockets, or cavities absent in experimental structures, provide an avenue to target proteins that are currently considered undruggable.

Vascular disorders such as atherosclerotic diseases largely occur at curvatures and bifurcations where disturbed blood flow activates endothelial cells while unidirectional flow at the straight part of vessels promotes endothelial health. Integrated analysis of the endothelial transcriptome, the 3D epigenome, and human genetics systematically identified the SNP-enriched cistrome in vascular endothelium subjected to well-defined atherosclerosis-prone disturbed flow or atherosclerosis-protective unidirectional flow. Our results characterized the endothelial typical- and super-enhancers and underscored the critical regulatory role of flow-sensitive endothelial super-enhancers. CRISPR interference and activation validated the function of a previously unrecognized unidirectional flow-induced super-enhancer that upregulates antioxidant genes NQO1, CYB5B, and WWP2, and a disturbed flow-induced super-enhancer in endothelium which drives prothrombotic genes EDN1 and HIVEP in vascular endothelium.

Of individuals with MDD, 30% to 50% are unresponsive to common antidepressants, highlighting untapped causal biological mechanisms. Dysfunction in the microbiota-gut-brain axis has been implicated in MDD pathogenesis. Exposure to chronic stress disrupts blood-brain barrier integrity; still, little is known about intestinal barrier function in these conditions, particularly for the small intestine, where absorption of most foods and drugs takes place.We investigated how chronic social or variable stress, two mouse models of depression, impact the jejunum intestinal barrier in males and females. Mice were subjected to stress paradigms followed by analysis of gene expression profiles of intestinal barrier-related targets, fecal microbial composition, and blood-based markers.Altered microbial populations and changes in gene expression of jejunum tight junctions were observed depending on the type and duration of stress, with sex-specific effects. We used machine learning to characterize in detail morphological tight junction properties, identifying a cluster of ruffled junctions in stressed animals. Junctional ruffling is associated with inflammation, so we evaluated whether lipopolysaccharide injection recapitulates stress-induced changes in the jejunum and observed profound sex differences. Finally, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, a marker of gut barrier leakiness, was associated with stress vulnerability in mice, and translational value was confirmed on blood samples from women with MDD.Our results provide evidence that chronic stress disrupts intestinal barrier homeostasis in conjunction with the manifestation of depressive-like behaviors in a sex-specific manner in mice and, possibly, in human depression.© 2023 The Authors.",6.77500328894933e-42

Mice lackingCav1show abnormal gene expression in the fetal brain. Though evidence for placental influence on brain development is emerging, whether the ablation ofCav1affects the regulation of the brain-placental axis remains unexamined. The current study tests the hypothesis that gene expression changes in specific cells of the placenta and the fetal brain are linked to the deregulation of the brain-placental axis inCav1-null mice. By performing single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) analyses, we show that the abundance of the extravillious trophoblast (EVT) and stromal cells, but not the cytotrophoblast (CTB) or syncytiotrophoblast (STB), are significantly impacted due toCav1ablation in mice. Interestingly, specific genes related to brain development and neurogenesis were significantly differentially expressed in trophoblast cells due toCav1deletion. Comparison of single-cell gene expression between the placenta and the fetal brain further showed that specific genes such as plexin A1 (Plxna1), phosphatase and actin regulator 1 (Phactr1) and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (Aplp2) were differentially expressed between the EVT and STB cells of the placenta, and also, between the radial glia and ependymal cells of the fetal brain. Bulk RNA-seq analysis of the whole placenta and the fetal brain further identified genes differentially expressed in a similar manner between the placenta and the fetal brain due to the absence ofCav1. The deconvolution of reference cell types from the bulk RNA-seq data further showed that the loss ofCav1impacted the abundance of EVT cells relative to the stromal cells in the placenta, and that of the glia cells relative to the neuronal cells in the fetal brain. Together, the results of this study suggest that the ablation ofCav1causes deregulated gene expression in specific cell types of the placenta and the fetal brain in mice.",4.54867575942321e-42

However, the mechanisms by which DSP regulates the tumour microenvironment remain unclear. Thus, we analysed the transcriptome profiles and clinical data, which were obtained from the TCGA database, of 540 patients with colorectal cancer. Compared with the patients with low DSP expression, those with high DSP expression exhibited significantly better survival outcomes; lower stromal and ESTIMATE scores; significantly higher numbers of CD4+ T cells, M2 macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils; higher expression of immune checkpoint-related genes; and lower Tregs and HLA-DQB2 levels. A prognostic signature established based on DSP-related genes demonstrated an increase in risk score with a higher clinical stage. Risk scores negatively correlated with dendritic cells, eosinophils, and CD4+ T cells and significantly positively correlated with Treg cells. Patients with higher risk scores experienced significantly worse survival outcomes and immunotherapy non-response. Our nomogram model, combining clinicopathological features and risk scores, exhibited robust prognostic and predictive power.

This limitation arises from GWAS not considering functional implications of noncoding variants that can affect transcription factor binding and potentially regulate gene expression. The aim of this study is to investigate a candidate noncoding functional variant within a genetic locus flagged by a GWAS SNP associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition characterized by liver fat accumulation in non-alcohol consumers.CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in HepG2 cells was used to modify the regulatory element containing the candidate functional variant linked to NAFLD. Global gene expression in mutant cells was assessed through RT-qPCR and targeted transcriptomics. A phenotypic assay measured lipid droplet accumulation in the CRISPR-Cas9 mutants.The candidate functional variant, rs2294510, closely linked to the NAFLD-associated GWAS SNP rs11206226, resided in a regulatory element within the DIO1 gene's promoter region. Altering this element resulted in changes in transcription factor binding sites and differential expression of candidate target genes like DIO1, TMEM59, DHCR24, and LDLRAD1, potentially influencing the NAFLD phenotype. Mutant HepG2 cells exhibited increased lipid accumulation, a hallmark of NAFLD, along with reduced LDL-C, HDL-C and elevated triglycerides.This comprehensive approach, that combines genome editing, transcriptomics, and phenotypic assays identified the DIO1 promoter region as a potential enhancer.

Recent single-cell RNA sequencing approaches have led to a whole brain taxonomy of transcriptomically-defined cell types, yet cell type definitions that include multiple cellular properties can offer additional insights into a neuron's role in brain circuits. While the Patch-seq method can investigate how transcriptomic properties relate to the local morphological and electrophysiological properties of cell types, linking transcriptomic identities to long-range projections is a major unresolved challenge. To address this, we collected coordinated Patch-seq and whole brain morphology data sets of excitatory neurons in mouse visual cortex. From the Patch-seq data, we defined 16 integrated morpho-electric-transcriptomic (MET)-types; in parallel, we reconstructed the complete morphologies of 300 neurons. We unified the two data sets with a multi-step classifier, to integrate cell type assignments and interrogate cross-modality relationships. We find that transcriptomic variations within and across MET-types correspond with morphological and electrophysiological phenotypes. In addition, this variation, along with the anatomical location of the cell, can be used to predict the projection targets of individual neurons. We also shed new light on infragranular cell types and circuits, including cell-type-specific, interhemispheric projections. With this approach, we establish a comprehensive, integrated taxonomy of excitatory neuron types in mouse visual cortex and create a system for integrated, high-dimensional cell type classification that can be extended to the whole brain and potentially across species.",3.47058209611802e-42
38319963,"DNA hypomethylation ameliorates erosive inflammatory arthritis by modulating interferon regulatory factor-8.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory arthritis. DNA hypomethylating agents, such as decitabine (DAC), have been shown to dampen inflammation and restore immune homeostasis. In the present study, we demonstrate that DAC elicits potent anti-inflammatory effects and attenuates disease symptoms in several animal models of arthritis. Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling show that DAC-mediated hypomethylation regulates a wide range of cell types in arthritis, altering the differentiation trajectories of anti-inflammatory macrophage populations, regulatory T cells, and tissue-protective synovial fibroblasts (SFs). Mechanistically, DAC-mediated demethylation of intragenic 5'-Cytosine phosphate Guanine-3' (CpG) islands of the transcription factor Irf8 (interferon regulatory factor 8) induced its re-expression and promoted its repressor activity. As a result, DAC restored joint homeostasis by resetting the transcriptomic signature of negative regulators of inflammation in synovial macrophages (MerTK, Trem2, and Cx3cr1), TREGs(Foxp3), and SFs (Pdpn and Fapα). In conclusion, we found that Irf8 is necessary for the inhibitory effect of DAC in murine arthritis and that direct expression of Irf8 is sufficient to significantly mitigate arthritis.",2.60481840212791e-42
38326615,"Convergence of coronary artery disease genes onto endothelial cell programs.","Nature","Linking variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to underlying mechanisms of disease remains a challenge1-3. For some diseases, a successful strategy has been to look for cases in which multiple GWAS loci contain genes that act in the same biological pathway1-6. However, our knowledge of which genes act in which pathways is incomplete, particularly for cell-type-specific pathways or understudied genes. Here we introduce a method to connect GWAS variants to functions. This method links variants to genes using epigenomics data, links genes to pathways de novo using Perturb-seq and integrates these data to identify convergence of GWAS loci onto pathways. We apply this approach to study the role of endothelial cells in genetic risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), and discover 43 CAD GWAS signals that converge on the cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) signalling pathway. Two regulators of this pathway, CCM2 and TLNRD1, are each linked to a CAD risk variant, regulate other CAD risk genes and affect atheroprotective processes in endothelial cells. These results suggest a model whereby CAD risk is driven in part by the convergence of causal genes onto a particular transcriptional pathway in endothelial cells. They highlight shared genes between common and rare vascular diseases (CAD and CCM), and identify TLNRD1 as a new, previously uncharacterized member of the CCM signalling pathway. This approach will be widely useful for linking variants to functions for other common polygenic diseases.© 2024.

38321095,"Network-based drug repurposing for schizophrenia.","Neuropsychopharmacology","Despite recent progress, the challenges in drug discovery for schizophrenia persist. However, computational drug repurposing has gained popularity as it leverages the wealth of expanding biomedical databases. Network analyses provide a comprehensive understanding of transcription factor (TF) regulatory effects through gene regulatory networks, which capture the interactions between TFs and target genes by integrating various lines of evidence. Using the PANDA algorithm, we examined the topological variances in TF-gene regulatory networks between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. This algorithm incorporates binding motifs, protein interactions, and gene co-expression data. To identify these differences, we subtracted the edge weights of the healthy control network from those of the schizophrenia network. The resulting differential network was then analysed using the CLUEreg tool in the GRAND database. This tool employs differential network signatures to identify drugs that potentially target the gene signature associated with the disease. Our analysis utilised a large RNA-seq dataset comprising 532 post-mortem brain samples from the CommonMind project. We constructed co-expression gene regulatory networks for both schizophrenia cases and healthy control subjects, incorporating 15,831 genes and 413 overlapping TFs. Through drug repurposing, we identified 18 promising candidates for repurposing as potential treatments for schizophrenia. The analysis of TF-gene regulatory networks revealed that the TFs in schizophrenia predominantly regulate pathways associated with energy metabolism, immune response, cell adhesion, and thyroid hormone signalling. These pathways represent significant targets for therapeutic intervention. The identified drug repurposing candidates likely act through TF-targeted pathways. These promising candidates, particularly those with preclinical evidence such as rimonabant and kaempferol, warrant further investigation into their potential mechanisms of action and efficacy in alleviating the symptoms of schizophrenia.© 2024.

However, our knowledge regarding intercellular communication mediated by dysregulated ligand-receptor (LR) interactions remains very limited in AD brains.We systematically assessed the intercellular communication networks by using a discovery snRNA-seq dataset comprising 69,499 nuclei from 48 human postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples. We replicated the findings using an independent snRNA-seq dataset of 56,440 nuclei from 18 PFC samples. By integrating genetic signals from AD genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, we prioritized AD-associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms containing dysregulated LR interactions. We further explored drug repurposing for the prioritized LR pairs using the Therapeutic Targets Database.We identified 190 dysregulated LR interactions across six major cell types in AD PFC, of which 107 pairs were replicated. Among the replicated LR signals, we found globally downregulated communications in the astrocytes-to-neurons signaling axis, characterized, for instance, by the downregulation of APOE-related and Calmodulin (CALM)-related LR interactions and their potential regulatory connections to target genes. Pathway analyses revealed 44 GO terms significantly linked to AD, highlighting Biological Processes such as 'amyloid precursor protein processing' and 'ion transmembrane transport,' among others. We prioritized several drug repurposing candidates, such as cromoglicate, targeting the identified dysregulated LR pairs.Our integrative analysis identified key dysregulated LR interactions in a cell type-specific manner and the associated GO terms in AD, offering novel insights into potential therapeutic targets involved in disrupted cell-cell communication in AD.© 2023.

The control group comprised specimens from the same location in patients with femoral neck fractures. With DIA proteomics, we quantitatively and qualitatively tested both groups and analyzed the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between groups. Additionally, we enriched the analysis of DEP functions using gene ontology terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways and verified the key proteins in ONFH through Western blot.Proteomics experiment uncovered 937 common DEPs (422 upregulated and 515 downregulated) between the two groups. These DEPs mainly participate in biological processes such as hidden attributes, catalytic activity, molecular function regulators, and structural molecule activity, and in pathways such as starch and sucrose metabolism, ECM-receptor interaction, PI3K-Akt signaling, complement and coagulation cascades, IL-17 signaling, phagosome, transcriptional misregulation in cancers, and focal adhesion. Through protein-protein interaction network target gene analysis and Western blot validation, we identified C3, MMP9, APOE, MPO, LCN2, ELANE, HPX, LTF, and THBS1 as key proteins in ONFH.With DIA proteomics and bioinformatics analysis, this study reveals the molecular mechanisms of intra-articular lesions in ONFH. A correlation in the necrotic area and load-bearing cartilage of ONFH at ARCO stages IIIB-IV as well as potential key regulatory proteins was identified.

Here, we performed a whole-exome sequencing analysis on the LLC cell line to elucidate its molecular characteristics and etiologies. Our data showed that LLC originated from a male mouse belonging to C57BL/6L (a transitional strain between C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N) and contains substantial somatic SNV and InDel mutations (> 20,000). Extensive regional mutation clusters are present in its genome, which were caused mainly by the mutational processes underlying the SBS1, SBS5, SBS15, SBS17a, and SBS21 signatures during frequent structural rearrangements. Thirty three deleterious mutations are present in 30 cancer genes including Kras, Nras, Trp53, Dcc, and Cacna1d. Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b are biallelically deleted from the genome. Five pathways (RTK/RAS, p53, cell cycle, TGFB, and Hippo) are oncogenically deregulated or affected. The major mutational processes in LLC include chromosomal instability, exposure to metabolic mutagens, spontaneous 5-methylcytosine deamination, defective DNA mismatch repair, and reactive oxygen species. Our data also suggest that LLC is a lung cancer similar to human lung adenocarcinoma. This study lays a molecular basis for the more targeted application of LLC in preclinical research.© 2024.

Gut microbiota may interact with nasal microbiota and contribute to the development of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). However, the specific role of gut microbiota in CRS has not been fully investigated. Therefore, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study to reveal the potential genetic causal effect of gut microbiota on CRS.We performed a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis using aggregated data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on gut microbiota and CRS. The primary method used to assess the causal relationship between gut microbiota and CRS was the inverse variance weighting (IVW) method. In addition, sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the MR results, including heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and leave-one-out tests.Genetically predicted twelve gut microbiota, including class Coriobacteriia, class Methanobacteria, family Coriobacteriaceae, family Methanobacteriaceae, family Pasteurellaceae, genus Haemophilus, genus Ruminococcus torques group, genus Subdoligranulum, order Coriobacteriales, order Methanobacteriales, order Pasteurellales, and phylum Proteobacteria, demonstrated a potential inhibitory effect on CRS risk (P < 0.05). In addition, four gut microbiota, including family Streptococcaceae, genus Clostridium innocuum group, genus Oscillospira, and genus Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group, exhibited a causal role in increasing CRS risk (P < 0.05).

38327653,"Oxford Nanopore Technology and its Application in Liquid Biopsies.","Curr Genomics","Advanced medical technologies are transforming the future of healthcare, in particular, the screening and detection of molecular-genetic changes in patients suspected of having a neoplasm. They are based on the assumption that neoplasms release small amounts  of  various  neoplasm-specific molecules, such as tumor DNA, called circulating DNA (cirDNA), into the extracellular space and subsequently into the blood. The detection of tumor-specific molecules and specific molecular changes in body fluids in a noninvasive or minimally invasive approach is known as ""liquid biopsy."" The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of the application of ONT for analyzing circulating DNA in the field of liquid biopsies among cancer patients. Databases were searched using the keywords ""nanopore"" and ""liquid biopsy"" and by applying strict inclusion criteria. This technique can be used for the detection of neoplastic disease, including metastases, guiding precision therapy, and monitoring its effects. There are many challenges, however, for the successful implementation of this technology into the clinical practice. The first one is the low amount of tumor-specific molecules in the body fluids. Secondly, a tumor molecular signature should be discriminated from benign conditions like clonal hematopoiesis of unknown significance. Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) is a third-generation sequencing technology that seems particularly promising to complete these tasks. It offers rapid sequencing thanks to its ability to detect changes in the density of the electric current passing through nanopores. Even though ONT still needs validation technology, it is a promising approach for early diagnosis, therapy guidance, and monitoring of different neoplasms based on analyzing the cirDNA.© 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.",1.32040229802062e-42

Heterogeneous monocyte myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC) are implicated in the altered immune response in GBM, but M-MDSC ontogeny and definitive phenotypic markers are unknown. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we revealed heterogeneity in blood M-MDSC from GBM subjects and an enrichment in a transcriptional state reminiscent of neutrophil-like monocytes (NeuMo), a newly described pathway of monopoiesis in mice. Human NeuMo gene expression and Neu-like deconvolution fraction algorithms were created to quantitate the enrichment of this transcriptional state in GBM subjects. NeuMo populations were also observed in M-MDSCs from lung and head and neck cancer subjects. Dexamethasone (DEX) and prednisone exposures increased the usage of Neu-like states, which were inversely associated with tumor purity and survival in isocitrate dehydrogenase wildtype (IDH WT) gliomas. Anti-inflammatoryZC3HA12/Regnase-1transcripts were highly correlated with NeuMo expression in tumors and in blood M-MDSC from GBM, lung, and head and neck cancer subjects. Additional novel transcripts of immune-modulating proteins were identified. Collectively, these findings provide a framework for understanding the heterogeneity of M-MDSCs in GBM as cells with different clonal histories and may reshape approaches to study and therapeutically target these cells.",1.07718014195639e-42
38326622,"Circulating myeloid-derived MMP8 in stress susceptibility and depression.","Nature","Psychosocial stress has profound effects on the body, including the immune system and the brain1,2. Although a large number of pre-clinical and clinical studies have linked peripheral immune system alterations to stress-related disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD)3, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show that expression of a circulating myeloid cell-specific proteinase, matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8), is increased in the serum of humans with MDD as well as in stress-susceptible mice following chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). In mice, we show that this increase leads to alterations in extracellular space and neurophysiological changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as well as altered social behaviour. Using a combination of mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing, we performed high-dimensional phenotyping of immune cells in circulation and in the brain and demonstrate that peripheral monocytes are strongly affected by stress. In stress-susceptible mice, both circulating monocytes and monocytes that traffic to the brain showed increased Mmp8 expression following chronic social defeat stress. We further demonstrate that circulating MMP8 directly infiltrates the NAc parenchyma and controls the ultrastructure of the extracellular space. Depleting MMP8 prevented stress-induced social avoidance behaviour and alterations in NAc neurophysiology and extracellular space. Collectively, these data establish a mechanism by which peripheral immune factors can affect central nervous system function and behaviour in the context of stress. Targeting specific peripheral immune cell-derived matrix metalloproteinases could constitute novel therapeutic targets for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.© 2024.

Nevertheless, lung organoids still face limitations concerning heterogeneity, complexity, and maturity compared to the native lung tissue. To address these limitations, researchers have employed co-culture methods with various cell types including endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and immune cells, and incorporated bioengineering platforms such as air-liquid interfaces, microfluidic chips, and functional hydrogels. These advancements have facilitated applications of lung organoids to studies of pulmonary diseases, providing insights into disease mechanisms and potential treatments.

To determine potential therapeutic effects of matrilin-3, rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion was produced using transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO); intracranial hemorrhage and infarct volumes were assayed through hemoglobin determination and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazoliumchloride (TTC) staining, respectively. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) modeling of ischemia was performed on C8-D1A cells. Interactions between matrilin-3 and YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein F2 (YTHDF2) were determined using RNA immunoprecipitation assay and actinomycin D treatment. Reperfusion after tMCAO modeling increased hemorrhage, hemoglobin content, and infarct volumes; these were alleviated by matrilin treatment. Matrilin-3 was expressed at low levels and YTHDF2 was expressed at high levels in ischemic brains. In OGD-induced cells, matrilin-3 was negatively regulated by YTHDF2. Matrilin-3 overexpression downregulated p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, ZO-1, VE-cadherin and occludin, and upregulated p-JNK/JNK in ischemic rat brains; these effects were reversed by LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor). YTHDF2 knockdown inactivated the PI3K/AKT pathway, inhibited inflammation and decreased blood-brain barrier-related protein levels in cells; these effects were reversed by matrilin-3 deficiency. These results indicate that YTHDF2-regulated matrilin-3 protected ischemic rats against post-reperfusion hemorrhagic transformation via the PI3K/AKT pathway and that matrilin may have therapeutic potential in ischemic stroke.© The Author(s) 2024.

Breakage fusion bridge (BFB) cycles, like extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA), can lead to high copy numbers of oncogenes, but their impact on intratumoral heterogeneity, treatment response, and patient survival are not well understood due to difficulty in detecting them by DNA sequencing. We describe a novel algorithm that detects and reconstructs BFB amplifications using optical genome maps (OGMs), called OM2BFB. OM2BFB showed high precision (>93%) and recall (92%) in detecting BFB amplifications in cancer cell lines, PDX models and primary tumors. OM-based comparisons demonstrated that short-read BFB detection using our AmpliconSuite (AS) toolkit also achieved high precision, albeit with reduced sensitivity. We detected 371 BFB events using whole genome sequences from 2,557 primary tumors and cancer lines. BFB amplifications were preferentially found in cervical, head and neck, lung, and esophageal cancers, but rarely in brain cancers. BFB amplified genes show lower variance of gene expression, with fewer options for regulatory rewiring relative to ecDNA amplified genes. BFB positive (BFB (+)) tumors showed reduced heterogeneity of amplicon structures, and delayed onset of resistance, relative to ecDNA(+) tumors.

However, a comprehensive view of the genetic architecture of growth as a cohesive whole is poorly understood. We propose a systems biology approach for mapping growth trajectories in genome-wide association studies viewing growth as a complex (phenotypic) system in which above- and below-ground components (or traits) interact with each other to mediate systems behavior. We further assume that trait-trait interactions are controlled by a genetic system composed of many different interactive genes and integrate the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model to dissect phenotypic and genetic systems into pleiotropic and epistatic interaction components by which the detailed genetic mechanism of above- and below-ground co-growth can be charted. We apply the approach to analyze linkage mapping data ofPopulus euphratica, which is the only tree species that can grow in the desert, and characterize several loci that govern how above- and below-ground growth is cooperated or competed over development. We reconstruct multilayer and multiplex genetic interactome networks for the developmental trajectories of each trait and their developmental covariation. Many significant loci and epistatic effects detected can be annotated to candidate genes for growth and developmental processes. The results from our model may potentially be useful for marker-assisted selection and genetic editing in applied tree breeding programs. The model provides a general tool to characterize a complete picture of pleiotropic and epistatic genetic architecture in growth traits in forest trees and any other organisms.Copyright © 2024 Kaiyan Lu et al.",3.13910247934646e-43

However, many patients with suspected genetic diseases remain undiagnosed. Long-read sequencing technologies are expected to significantly improve the diagnostic rate by overcoming the limitations of short-read sequencing. In addition, Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offers adaptive sampling and computationally driven target enrichment technology. This enables more affordable intensive analysis of target gene regions compared to standard non-selective long-read sequencing. In this study, we developed an efficient computational workflow for target adaptive sampling long-read sequencing (TAS-LRS) and evaluated it through application to 33 genomes collected from suspected hereditary cancer patients. Our workflow can identify single nucleotide variants with nearly the same accuracy as the short-read platform and elucidate complex forms of structural variations. We also newly identified several SINE-R/VNTR/Alu (SVA) elements affecting the APC gene in two patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, as well as their sites of origin. In addition, we demonstrated that off-target reads from adaptive sampling, which is typically discarded, can be effectively used to accurately genotype common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the entire genome, enabling the calculation of a polygenic risk score. Furthermore, we identified allele-specific MLH1 promoter hypermethylation in a Lynch syndrome patient.

In-vitro evaluations were conducted to assess the synergistic effects between DNMT1 and ATR/ATM in five AML cell lines (MOLM-16, NB-4, HEL 92.1.7, HEL, EOL-1). In our study, ATR and ATM are primarily the kinases associated with DNMT1-related genes in AML. We observed a significant upregulation of DNMT1, ATR, and ATM expression in AML tissues and cell lines. The five AML cell lines demonstrated sensitivity to monotherapy with GSK-368, AZD-1390, or AZD-6738 (EC50 value ranges from 5.461 to 7.349 nM, 5.821 to 10.120 nM, and 7.618 to 10.100 nM, respectively). A considerable synergistic effect was observed in AML cell lines when combining GSK-368 and AZD-1390, GSK-368 and AZD-6738, or AZD-1390 and AZD-6738, resulting in induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell growth.

This study aimed to assess the causal relationship between the IGF family and diabetes using Mendelian randomization (MR).We conducted a two-sample MR analysis to investigate the causal effects of the IGF family on diabetes. Instrumental variables for the IGF family and diabetes were derived from summary-level statistics obtained from genome-wide association studies.

To test the robustness of the results, we also employed MR-Egger regression, the weighted median method, and a leave-one-out analysis.Our study revealed that IGF-1 causally increases the risk of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), while IGFBP-6, adiponectin and INSR decreases the risk (IGF-1, OR 1.02 [95% CI 1-1.03],p = 0.01; IGFBP-6, OR 0.92 [95% CI 0.87-0.98],p = 0.01; Adiponectin, OR 0.837 [95% CI 0.721-0.970],p = 0.018; INSR, OR 0.910 [95% CI 0.872-0.950],p = 1.52 × 10-5). Additionally, genetically lower levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-5, along with higher levels of IGFBP-7, were associated with an increased risk of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) (IGF-1, OR 0.981 [95% CI 0.963-0.999],p = 0.037; IGFBP-5, OR 0.882 [95% CI 0.778-0.999],p = 0.049; IGFBP-7, OR 1.103 [95% CI 1.008-1.206],p = 0.033).In summary, our investigation has unveiled causal relationships between specific IGF family members and T1D and T2D through MR analysis. Generally, the IGF family appears to reduce the risk of T1D, but it presents a more complex and controversial role in the context of T2D. These findings provide compelling evidence that T2D is intricately linked with developmental impairment. Our study results offer fresh insights into the pathogenesis and the significance of serum IGF family member concentrations in assessing diabetes risk.Copyright © 2024 Li, Tang, Lin, Liu and Li.",1.17786118294486e-43
38332411,"Management of Hypertension in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Structured Review.","Am J Cardiovasc Drugs","This article reviews available evidence regarding hypertension management in the Asia-Pacific region, focussing on five research questions that deal with specific aspects: blood pressure (BP) control, guideline recommendations, role of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in clinical practice, pharmacological management and real-world adherence to guideline recommendations. A PubMed search identified 2537 articles, of which 94 were considered relevant. Compared with Europeans, Asians have higher systolic/diastolic/mean arterial BP, with a stronger association between BP and stroke. Calcium channel blockers are the most-commonly prescribed monotherapy in Asia, with significant variability between countries in the rates of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis)/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and single-pill combination (SPC) use. In clinical practice, ARBs are used more commonly than ACEis, despite the absence of recommendation from guidelines and clinical evidence supporting the use of one class of drug over the other. Ideally, antihypertensive treatment should be tailored to the individual patient, but currently there are limited data on the characteristics of hypertension in Asia-Pacific individuals. Large outcome studies assessing RAAS inhibitor efficacy and safety in multi-national Asian populations are lacking. Among treated patients, BP control rates were ~ 35 to 40%; BP control in Asia-Pacific is suboptimal, and disproportionately so compared with Western nations. Strategies to improve the management of hypertension include wider access/availability of affordable treatments, particularly SPCs (which improve adherence), effective public health screening programs targeting patients to drive health-seeking behaviours, an increase in physician/patient awareness and early implementation of lifestyle changes. A unified Asia-Pacific guideline on hypertension management with pragmatic recommendations, particularly in resource-limited settings, is essential.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.06369831078067e-43

Here we introduce a new glia-enriched cortical organoid model that exhibits accelerated astrogliogenesis. We demonstrated that induction of a gliogenic switch in a subset of progenitors enabled the rapid derivation of astroglial cells, which account for 25-31% of the cell population within 8-10 weeks of differentiation. Intracerebral transplantation of these organoids reliably generated a diverse repertoire of cortical neurons and anatomical subclasses of human astrocytes. Spatial transcriptome profiling identified layer-specific expression patterns among distinct subclasses of astrocytes within organoid transplants. Using an in vivo acute neuroinflammation model, we identified a subpopulation of astrocytes that rapidly activates pro-inflammatory pathways upon cytokine stimulation. Additionally, we demonstrated that CD38 signaling has a crucial role in mediating metabolic and mitochondrial stress in reactive astrocytes. This model provides a robust platform for investigating human astrocyte function.© 2024. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",9.94936275260102e-44
38198800,"Fine-Scale Map Reveals Highly Variable Recombination Rates Associated with Genomic Features in the Eurasian Blackcap.","Genome Biol Evol","Recombination is responsible for breaking up haplotypes, influencing genetic variability, and the efficacy of selection. Bird genomes lack the protein PR domain-containing protein 9, a key determinant of recombination dynamics in most metazoans. Historical recombination maps in birds show an apparent stasis in positioning recombination events. This highly conserved recombination pattern over long timescales may constrain the evolution of recombination in birds. At the same time, extensive variation in recombination rate is observed across the genome and between different species of birds. Here, we characterize the fine-scale historical recombination map of an iconic migratory songbird, the Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), using a linkage disequilibrium-based approach that accounts for population demography. Our results reveal variable recombination rates among and within chromosomes, which associate positively with nucleotide diversity and GC content and negatively with chromosome size. Recombination rates increased significantly at regulatory regions but not necessarily at gene bodies. CpG islands are associated strongly with recombination rates, though their specific position and local DNA methylation patterns likely influence this relationship. The association with retrotransposons varied according to specific family and location. Our results also provide evidence of heterogeneous intrachromosomal conservation of recombination maps between the blackcap and its closest sister taxon, the garden warbler. These findings highlight the considerable variability of recombination rates at different scales and the role of specific genomic features in shaping this variation. This study opens the possibility of further investigating the impact of recombination on specific population-genomic features.© The Author(s) 2024.

The upheaval of the epigenetic landscape is a key event in the onset of many pathologies including tumours, where epigenetic changes cooperate with genetic aberrations to establish the neoplastic phenotype and to drive cell plasticity during its evolution. DNA methylation, histone modifiers and readers or other chromatin components are indeed often altered in cancers, such as carcinomas that develop in epithelia. Lining the surfaces and the cavities of our body and acting as a barrier from the environment, epithelia are frequently subjected to acute or chronic tissue damages, such as mechanical injuries or inflammatory episodes. These events can activate plasticity mechanisms, with a deep impact on cells' epigenome. Despite being very effective, tissue repair mechanisms are closely associated with tumour onset. Here we review the similarities between tissue repair and carcinogenesis, with a special focus on the epigenetic mechanisms activated by cells during repair and opted by carcinoma cells in multiple epithelia. Moreover, we discuss the recent findings on inflammatory and wound memory in epithelia and describe the epigenetic modifications that characterise them. Finally, as wound memory in epithelial cells promotes carcinogenesis, we highlight how it represents an early step for the establishment of field cancerization.© 2024.

Epigenetic mechanisms play a critical role in driving age-related diseases through altered gene expression, genomic instability, and irregular chromatin remodeling. In this review, we focus on histones, a central component of the epigenome, and consolidate the key findings of histone loss and genome-wide redistribution as fundamental processes contributing to aging and senescence. The review provides insights into novel histone expression profiles, nucleosome occupancy, disruptions in higher-order chromatin architecture, and the emergence of noncanonical histone variants in the aging cellular landscape. Furthermore, we explore the current state of our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of histone deficiency in aging cells. Specific emphasis is placed on highlighting histone degradation pathways in the cell and studies that have explored potential strategies to mitigate histone loss or restore histone levels in aging cells. Finally, in addressing future perspectives, the insights gained from this review hold profound implications for advancing strategies that actively intervene in modulating histone expression profiles in the context of cellular aging and identifying potential therapeutic targets for alleviating a multitude of age-related diseases.",6.53148882067954e-44
38331927,"The interaction between DNA methylation and tumor immune microenvironment: from the laboratory to clinical applications.","Clin Epigenetics","DNA methylation is a pivotal epigenetic modification that affects gene expression. Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) comprises diverse immune cells and stromal components, creating a complex landscape that can either promote or inhibit tumor progression. In the TIME, DNA methylation has been shown to play a critical role in influencing immune cell function and tumor immune evasion. DNA methylation regulates immune cell differentiation, immune responses, and TIME composition Targeting DNA methylation in TIME offers various potential avenues for enhancing immune cytotoxicity and reducing immunosuppression. Recent studies have demonstrated that modification of DNA methylation patterns can promote immune cell infiltration and function. However, challenges persist in understanding the precise mechanisms underlying DNA methylation in the TIME, developing selective epigenetic therapies, and effectively integrating these therapies with other antitumor strategies. In conclusion, DNA methylation of both tumor cells and immune cells interacts with the TIME, and thus affects clinical efficacy. The regulation of DNA methylation within the TIME holds significant promise for the advancement of tumor immunotherapy.

Yet, translating disease-associated genetic variants into functional knowledge remains a fundamental challenge of drug discovery. A key issue is that the vast majority of complex disease associations cannot be cleanly mapped to a gene. Immune disease-associated variants are enriched within regulatory elements found in T-cell-specific open chromatin regions.To identify genes and molecular programs modulated by these regulatory elements, we develop a CRISPRi-based single-cell functional screening approach in primary human T cells. Our pipeline enables the interrogation of transcriptomic changes induced by the perturbation of regulatory elements at scale. We first optimize an efficient CRISPRi protocol in primary CD4+ T cells via CROPseq vectors. Subsequently, we perform a screen targeting 45 non-coding regulatory elements and 35 transcription start sites and profile approximately 250,000 T -cell single-cell transcriptomes. We develop a bespoke analytical pipeline for element-to-gene (E2G) mapping and demonstrate that our method can identify both previously annotated and novel E2G links. Lastly, we integrate genetic association data for immune-related traits and demonstrate how our platform can aid in the identification of effector genes for GWAS loci.We describe ""primary T cell crisprQTL"" - a scalable, single-cell functional genomics approach for mapping regulatory elements to genes in primary human T cells.

It is widely believed that genetic factors play a significant role in the development of IgAN. Previous studies of IgAN have provided important insights to unravel the genetic architecture of IgAN and its potential pathogenic mechanisms. The genome-wide association studies (GWASs) together have identified over 30 risk loci for IgAN, which emphasizes the importance of IgA production and regulation in the pathogenesis of IgAN. Follow-up fine-mapping studies help to elucidate the candidate causal variant and the potential pathogenic molecular pathway and provide new potential therapeutic targets. With the rapid development of next-generation sequencing technologies, linkage studies based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS)/whole-exome sequencing (WES) also identify rare variants associated with IgAN, accounting for some of the missing heritability. The complexity of pathogenesis and phenotypic variability may be better understood by integrating genetics, epigenetics, and environment.

Big cats, such as tigers and lions, are of great concern and have received considerable conservation attention through policies and international actions. However, knowledge of and conservation actions for small wild cats are lagging considerably behind. The black-footed cat,Felis nigripes, one of the smallest felid species, is experiencing increasing threats with a rapid reduction in population size. However, there is a lack of genetic information to assist in developing effective conservation actions. A de novo assembly of a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome of the black-footed cat was made, and comparative genomics and population genomics analyses were carried out. These analyses revealed that the most significant genetic changes in the evolution of the black-footed cat are the rapid evolution of sensory and metabolic-related genes, reflecting genetic adaptations to its characteristic nocturnal hunting and a high metabolic rate. Genomes of the black-footed cat exhibit a high level of inbreeding, especially for signals of recent inbreeding events, which suggest that they may have experienced severe genetic isolation caused by habitat fragmentation. More importantly, inbreeding associated with two deleterious mutated genes may exacerbate the risk of amyloidosis, the dominant disease that causes mortality of about 70% of captive individuals. Our research provides comprehensive documentation of the evolutionary history of the black-footed cat and suggests that there is an urgent need to investigate genomic variations of small felids worldwide to support effective conservation actions.",2.76325666331009e-44

Components of volatile substances and important genes for monoterpene synthesis in the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway were examined in this study. Twenty volatile compounds (2 in the budding stage, 3 in the initial flowering stage, 7 in the semi-flowering stage, 17 in the full-flowering stage, and 5 in withering stage) were detected in the Oriental lily 'Sorbonne' using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The semi- and full-flowering stages were key periods for volatile substance production and enzyme function. Sequence assembly from samples collected during all flowering stages resulted in the detection of 274,849 genes and 129,017 transcripts. RNA sequencing and heatmapping led to the detection of genes in the MEP monoterpene metabolism pathway. Through gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, we extracted key genes (LiDXS2, LiLIS, and LiMYS) and transcription factors (in the bHLH, MYB, HD-ZIP, and NAC families) associated with the MEP pathway. Tissue localization revealed that LiDXS2, LiLIS, and LiMYS were expressed in Lilium 'Sorbonne' petals in the full-flowering stage. Genes regulating the 1-deoxy-D-X-lignone-5-phosphate synthase family of rate-limiting enzymes, involved in the first step of monoterpene synthesis, showed high expression in the semi- and full-flowering stages. LiDXS2 was cloned and localized in chloroplast subcells. The relative expression of terpene-related genes in the MEP and mevalonic acid pathways of wild-type and LiLIS/LiMYS transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, and changes in chemical composition, confirmed that LiLIS/LiMYS regulates the monoterpene synthesis pathway. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the synthesis of lily aromatic substances and the cultivation of new garden flower varieties.© 2024.

The complexity and ubiquity of structural alterations in cancer genomes make it difficult to identify enhancer hijacking using genome sequencing alone. Here we describe a 3D genomics-based analysis called HAPI (Highly Active Promoter Interactions) to characterize enhancer hijacking caused by structural alterations. HAPI analysis of HiChIP data from 34 cancer cell lines identified novel enhancer hijacking events that involve chromosomal rearrangements and activate both known and potentially novel oncogenes such asMYC, CCND1,ETV1,CRKL, andID4, which we validated using CRISPRi assays and RNA-seq analysis. Furthermore, we found that ecDNAs often contain multiple oncogenes from different chromosomes, which causes nested enhancer hijacking among them. We found that ecDNAs containingMYCoften harbor additional oncogenes from other chromosomes such asCDX2, ERBB2,orCD44that co-optMYC's enhancers for their overexpression, which we validated using dual-color DNA FISH and CRISPRi assays. These enhancer hijacking events involving multiple oncogenes on ecDNAs have important implications for therapeutic strategies that either target the co-opting oncogenes or the hijacked enhancers. Our publicly available HAPI analysis tool provides a robust strategy to detect enhancer hijacking and reveals novel insights into oncogene activation caused by chromosomal and extrachromosomal structural alterations.",2.68445909636612e-44

To chart this complexity, we generated a comprehensive cell atlas of 55 neuroblastoma patient tumors, collected from two pediatric cancer institutions, spanning a range of clinical, genetic, and histologic features. Our atlas combines single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq (sc/scRNA-seq), bulk RNA-seq, whole exome sequencing, DNA methylation profiling, spatial transcriptomics, and two spatial proteomic methods. Sc/snRNA-seq revealed three malignant cell states with features of sympathoadrenal lineage development. All of the neuroblastomas had malignant cells that resembled sympathoblasts and the more differentiated adrenergic cells. A subset of tumors had malignant cells in a mesenchymal cell state with molecular features of Schwann cell precursors. DNA methylation profiles defined four groupings of patients, which differ in the degree of malignant cell heterogeneity and clinical outcomes. Using spatial proteomics, we found that neuroblastomas are spatially compartmentalized, with malignant tumor cells sequestered away from immune cells. Finally, we identify spatially restricted signaling patterns in immune cells from spatial transcriptomics.

38352597,"Single-cell and bulk transcriptional profiling of mouse ovaries reveals novel genes and pathways associated with DNA damage response in oocytes.","bioRxiv","Immature oocytes enclosed in primordial follicles stored in female ovaries are under constant threat of DNA damage induced by endogenous and exogenous factors. Checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) is a key mediator of the DNA damage response in all cells. Genetic studies have shown that CHEK2 and its downstream targets, p53 and TAp63, regulate primordial follicle elimination in response to DNA damage, however the mechanism leading to their demise is still poorly characterized. Single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing were used to determine the DNA damage response in wildtype andChek2-deficient ovaries. A low but oocyte-lethal dose of ionizing radiation induces a DNA damage response in ovarian cells that is solely dependent on CHEK2. DNA damage activates multiple ovarian response pathways related to apoptosis, p53, interferon signaling, inflammation, cell adhesion, and intercellular communication. These pathways are differentially employed by different ovarian cell types, with oocytes disproportionately affected by radiation. Novel genes and pathways are induced by radiation specifically in oocytes, shedding light on their sensitivity to DNA damage, and implicating a coordinated response between oocytes and pre-granulosa cells within the follicle. These findings provide a foundation for future studies on the specific mechanisms regulating oocyte survival in the context of aging, as well as therapeutic and environmental genotoxic exposures.",1.54305004213177e-44

However, little is known about their relationship and developmental functions during the preimplantation window, which is essential for the acquisition of totipotency and pluripotency. Herein, we reported that glutathione (GSH), a ubiquitous intracellular protective antioxidant that maintains mitochondrial function and redox homeostasis, plays a critical role in safeguarding postfertilization DNA demethylation and is essential for establishing developmental potential in preimplantation embryos. By profiling mitochondria-related transcriptome that coupled with different pluripotency, we found GSH is a potential marker that is tightly correlated with full pluripotency, and its beneficial effect on prompting developmental potential was functionally conformed using in vitro fertilized mouse and bovine embryos as the model. Mechanistic study based on preimplantation embryos and embryonic stem cells further revealed that GSH prompts the acquisition of totipotency and pluripotency by facilitating ten-eleven-translocation (TET)-dependent DNA demethylation, and ascorbic acid (AsA)-GSH cycle is implicated in the process. In addition, we also reported that GSH serves as an oviductal paracrine factor that supports development potential of preimplantation embryos.

By assembling a single-cell atlas of chromatin state within human islets, we identified β cell subtypes governed by either high or low activity of the lineage-determining factor pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1). β cells with reduced PDX1 activity displayed increased chromatin accessibility at latent nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) enhancers. Pdx1 hypomorphic mice exhibited de-repression of NF-κB and impaired glucose tolerance at night. Three-dimensional analyses in tandem with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing revealed that PDX1 silences NF-κB at circadian and inflammatory enhancers through long-range chromatin contacts involving SIN3A. Conversely, Bmal1 ablation in β cells disrupted genome-wide PDX1 and NF-κB DNA binding. Finally, antagonizing the interleukin (IL)-1β receptor, an NF-κB target, improved insulin secretion in Pdx1 hypomorphic islets.

Although the definitive set of molecular mechanisms responsible for aging remain to be discovered, epigenetic change over time is proving to be a promising piece of the puzzle. Several posttranslational histone modifications (PTMs) have been linked to the maintenance of longevity. Here, we focus on lysine-36 of the replication-independent histone protein, H3.3 (H3.3K36). To interrogate the role of this residue inDrosophiladevelopmental gene regulation, we generated a lysine to arginine mutant that blocks the activity of its cognate modifying enzymes. We found that anH3.3BK36Rmutation causes a significant reduction in adult lifespan, accompanied by dysregulation of the genomic and transcriptomic architecture. Transgenic co-expression of wild-typeH3.3Bcompletely rescues the longevity defect. Because H3.3 is known to accumulate in non-dividing tissues, we carried out transcriptome profiling of young vs aged adult fly heads. The data show that loss of H3.3K36 results in age-dependent misexpression of NF-κB and other innate immune target genes, as well as defects in silencing of heterochromatin. We propose H3.3K36 maintains the postmitotic epigenomic landscape, supporting longevity by regulating both pericentric and telomeric retrotransposons and by suppressing aberrant immune signaling.",9.65495597737702e-45
38381741,"Tet-dependent 5-hydroxymethyl-Cytosine modification of mRNA regulates axon guidance genes in Drosophila.","PLoS One","Modifications of mRNA, especially methylation of adenosine, have recently drawn much attention. The much rarer modification, 5-hydroxymethylation of cytosine (5hmC), is not well understood and is the subject of this study. Vertebrate Tet proteins are 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylases and catalyze the transition of 5mC to 5hmC in DNA. These enzymes have recently been shown to have the same function in messenger RNAs in both vertebrates and in Drosophila. The Tet gene is essential in Drosophila as Tet knock-out animals do not reach adulthood. We describe the identification of Tet-target genes in the embryo and larval brain by mapping one, Tet DNA-binding sites throughout the genome and two, the Tet-dependent 5hmrC modifications transcriptome-wide. 5hmrC modifications are distributed along the entire transcript, while Tet DNA-binding sites are preferentially located at the promoter where they overlap with histone H3K4me3 peaks. The identified mRNAs are preferentially involved in neuron and axon development and Tet knock-out led to a reduction of 5hmrC marks on specific mRNAs. Among the Tet-target genes were the robo2 receptor and its slit ligand that function in axon guidance in Drosophila and in vertebrates. Tet knock-out embryos show overlapping phenotypes with robo2 and both Robo2 and Slit protein levels were markedly reduced in Tet KO larval brains. Our results establish a role for Tet-dependent 5hmrC in facilitating the translation of modified mRNAs primarily in cells of the nervous system.Copyright: © 2024 Singh et al.

Unique molecular events follow, including epigenetic resetting, to establish functional gametes (egg and sperm). Due to the inaccessibility of human embryos, it is essential to have an amenable experimental platform to investigate the mechanisms and potential dysfunctions of the events. We previously established a PGC-like cell (PGCLC) differentiation method using human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) via induction of precursor cells followed by stimulation with a cytokine cocktail including BMP. We also revealed that the expression of PGC specifiers, SOX17 and PRDM1, can robustly induce PGCLCs from PSCs without the cytokines. The balance of SOX17 and PRDM1 is critical for germ cell fate since the two factors also regulate endoderm differentiation. Here we describe a detailed procedure for PGCLC differentiation with the balanced induction of SOX17 and PRDM1. The protocol can be used for PGC induction in other mammalian species exhibiting PGCs with SOX17 expression.

Modulating reactive astrocytes therefore represent an attractive therapeutic strategy. Here we describe the development of an astrocyte phenotypic screening platform for identifying chemical modulators of astrocyte reactivity. Leveraging this platform for chemical screening, we identify histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibitors as effective suppressors of pathological astrocyte reactivity. We demonstrate that HDAC3 inhibition reduces molecular and functional characteristics of reactive astrocytes in vitro. Transcriptional and chromatin mapping studies show that HDAC3 inhibition disarms pathological astrocyte gene expression and function while promoting the expression of genes associated with beneficial astrocytes. Administration of RGFP966, a small molecule HDAC3 inhibitor, blocks reactive astrocyte formation and promotes neuroprotection in vivo in mice.

The development of epigenetics provides a compelling justification for how environmental, lifestyle, and other risk factors contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity. Furthermore, epigenetic dysregulations can be restored, and it has been reported that certain natural products obtained from plants, such as tea polyphenols, ellagic acid, urolithins, curcumin, genistein, isothiocyanates, and citrus isoflavonoids, were shown to inhibit weight gain. These substances have great antioxidant potential and are of great interest because they can also modify epigenetic mechanisms. Therefore, understanding epigenetic modifications to target the primary cause of obesity and the epigenetic mechanisms of anti-obesity effects with certain phytochemicals can prove rational strategies to prevent the disease and develop novel therapeutic interventions. Thus, the current review aimed to summarize the epigenetic mechanisms and advances in therapies for obesity based on natural products to provide evidence for the development of several potential anti-obesity drug targets.© 2024 The Authors.

38287071,"Prognostic DNA mutation and mRNA expression analysis of perineural invasion in oral squamous cell carcinoma.","Sci Rep","This study analyzed oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) genomes and transcriptomes in relation to perineural invasion (PNI) and prognosis using Cancer Genome Atlas data and validated these results with GSE41613 data. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were conducted. We identified 22 DNA mutations associated with both overall survival (OS) and PNI. Among them, TGFBR1 and RPS6KA4 mRNAs were overexpressed, while TYRO3 and GPR137 mRNAs were underexpressed in PNI patients. Among the 141 mRNA genes associated with both OS and PNI, we found overlap with PNI-related DNA mutations, including ZNF43, TEX10, TPSD1, and PSD3. In GSE41613 data, TGFBR1, RPS6KA4, TYRO3, GPR137, TEX10 and TPSD1 mRNAs were expressed differently according to the prognosis. The 22 DNA-mutated genes clustered into nervous system development, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, and transforming growth factor beta binding. GSEA analysis of mRNAs revealed upregulation of hallmarks epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), TNFα signaling via NF-κB, and IL2 STAT5 signaling. EMT upregulation aligned with the TGFBR1 DNA mutation, supporting its significance in PNI. These findings suggest a potential role of PNI genes in the prognosis of OSCC, providing insights for diagnosis and treatment of OSCC.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.61860720616942e-45

Single-cell transcriptomic studies have revealed numerous disease-emergent/enriched cell types/states in PF lungs, but the spatial contexts wherein these cells contribute to disease pathogenesis has remained uncertain. Using sub-cellular resolution image-based spatial transcriptomics, we analyzed the gene expression of more than 1 million cells from 19 unique lungs. Through complementary cell-based and innovative cell-agnostic analyses, we characterized the localization of PF-emergent cell-types, established the cellular and molecular basis of classical PF histopathologic disease features, and identified a diversity of distinct molecularly-defined spatial niches in control and PF lungs. Using machine-learning and trajectory analysis methods to segment and rank airspaces on a gradient from normal to most severely remodeled, we identified a sequence of compositional and molecular changes that associate with progressive distal lung pathology, beginning with alveolar epithelial dysregulation and culminating with changes in macrophage polarization. Together, these results provide a unique, spatially-resolved characterization of the cellular and molecular programs of PF and control lungs, provide new insights into the heterogeneous pathobiology of PF, and establish analytical approaches which should be broadly applicable to other imaging-based spatial transcriptomic studies.",1.4691749442337e-45

Although long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in mCRPC, past studies have relied on bulk sequencing methods with low depth and lack of single-cell resolution. Hence, we performed a lncRNA-focused analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data (n = 14) from mCRPC biopsies followed by integration with bulk multi-omic datasets. This yielded 389 cell-enriched lncRNAs in prostate cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME). These lncRNAs demonstrated enrichment with regulatory elements and exhibited alterations during prostate cancer progression. Prostate-lncRNAs were correlated with AR mutational status and response to treatment with enzalutamide, while TME-lncRNAs were associated with RB1 deletions and poor prognosis. Finally, lncRNAs identified between prostate adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine tumors exhibited distinct expression and methylation profiles. Our findings demonstrate the ability of single-cell analysis to refine our understanding of lncRNAs in mCRPC and serve as a resource for future mechanistic studies.© 2024.

38343218,"Machine Learning-Based Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiomics Model for Preoperative Predicting the Deep Stromal Invasion in Patients with Early Cervical Cancer.","J Imaging Inform Med","Deep stromal invasion is an important pathological factor associated with the treatments and prognosis of cervical cancer patients. Accurate determination of deep stromal invasion before radical hysterectomy (RH) is of great value for early clinical treatment decision-making and improving the prognosis of these patients. Machine learning is gradually applied in the construction of clinical models to improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis or prediction, but whether machine learning can improve the preoperative diagnosis accuracy of deep stromal invasion in patients with cervical cancer was still unclear. This cross-sectional study was to construct three preoperative diagnostic models for deep stromal invasion in patients with early cervical cancer based on clinical, radiomics, and clinical combined radiomics data using the machine learning method. We enrolled 229 patients with early cervical cancer receiving RH combined with pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the fivefold cross-validation were applied to screen out radiomics features. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify clinical predictors. All subjects were divided into the training set (n = 160) and testing set (n = 69) at a ratio of 7:3. Three light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) models were constructed in the training set and verified in the testing set. The radiomics features were statistically different between deep stromal invasion < 1/3 group and deep stromal invasion ≥ 1/3 group. In the training set, the area under the curve (AUC) of the prediction model based on radiomics features was 0.951 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.922-0.980), the AUC of the prediction model based on clinical predictors was 0.769 (95% CI 0.703-0.835), and the AUC of the prediction model based on radiomics features and clinical predictors was 0.969 (95% CI 0.947-0.990). The AUC of the prediction model based on radiomics features and clinical predictors was 0.914 (95% CI 0.848-0.980) in the testing set. The prediction model for deep stromal invasion in patients with early cervical cancer based on clinical and radiomics data exhibited good predictive performance with an AUC of 0.969, which might help the clinicians early identify patients with high risk of deep stromal invasion and provide timely interventions.© 2024.

As supplements to standard of care (SOC), various immunotherapies improve the therapeutic effect in other cancers. Among them, tumour vaccines can serve as complementary monotherapy or boost the clinical efficacy with other immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) therapy. Previous studies in GBM therapeutic vaccines have suggested that few neoantigens could be targeted in GBM due to low mutation burden, and single-peptide therapeutic vaccination had limited efficacy in tumour control as monotherapy. Combining diverse antigens, including neoantigens, tumour-associated antigens (TAAs), and pathogen-derived antigens, and optimizing vaccine design or vaccination strategy may help with clinical efficacy improvement. In this review, we discussed current GBM therapeutic vaccine platforms, evaluated and potential antigenic targets, current challenges, and perspective opportunities for efficacy improvement.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Previous studies identified the association between LBW and placenta deterioration, potentially resulting from disturbed genomic DNA methylation in oocytes caused by OS. However, the mechanisms by which OS leads to aberrant DNA methylation patterns in oocytes remains unclear.Mouse oocytes and mouse parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells (pESCs) were used to investigate the roles of OS in oocyte DNA methylation. Global 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels were evaluated using immunofluorescence or colorimetry. Genome-wide DNA methylation was quantified using an Agilent SureSelectXT mouse Methyl-Seq. The DNA methylation status of mesoderm-specific transcript homologue (Mest) promoter region was analyzed using bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP). The regulatory network between estrogen receptor alpha (ERα, ESR1) and DNA methylation status of Mest promoter region was further detected following the knockdown of ERα or ten-eleven translocation 2 (Tet2).OS resulted in a significant decrease in global 5mC levels and an increase in global 5hmC levels in oocytes. Further investigation revealed that supraphysiological β-estradiol (E2) during OS induced a notable decrease in DNA 5mC and an increase in 5hmC in both oocytes and pESCs of mice, whereas inhibition of estrogen signaling abolished such induction. Moreover, Tet2 may be a direct transcriptional target gene of ERα, and through the ERα-TET2 axis, supraphysiological E2 resulted in the reduced global levels of DNA 5mC. Furthermore, we identified that MEST, a maternal imprinted gene essential for placental development, lost its imprinted methylation in parthenogenetic placentas originating from OS, and ERα and TET2 combined together to form a protein complex that may promote Mest demethylation.In this study, a possible mechanism of loss of DNA methylation in oocyte caused by OS was revealed, which may help increase safety and reduce epigenetic abnormalities in ART procedures.© 2024.

We explored an understudied cistromic mechanism involving RARγ's ability to govern AR cistrome-transcriptome relationships, including those associated with more aggressive PCa features. The RARγ complex in PCa cell models was enriched for canonical cofactors, as well as proteins involved in RNA processing and bookmarking. Identifying the repertoire of miR-96 bound and regulated gene targets, including those recognition elements marked by m6A, revealed their significant enrichment in the RARγ complex. RARγ significantly enhanced the AR cistrome, particularly in active enhancers and super-enhancers, and overlapped with the binding of bookmarking factors. Furthermore, RARγ expression led to nucleosome-free chromatin enriched with H3K27ac, and significantly enhanced the AR cistrome in G2/M cells. RARγ functions also antagonized the transcriptional actions of the lineage master regulator ONECUT2. Similarly, gene programs regulated by either miR-96 or antagonized by RARγ were enriched in alternative lineages and more aggressive PCa phenotypes. Together these findings reveal an under-investigated role for RARγ, modulated by miR-96, to bookmark enhancer sites during mitosis. These sites are required by the AR to promote transcriptional competence, and emphasize luminal differentiation, while antagonizing ONECUT2.",5.0927691421371e-46
38260419,"mRNA initiation and termination are spatially coordinated.","bioRxiv","The expression of a precise mRNA transcriptome is crucial for establishing cell identity and function, with dozens of alternative isoforms produced for a single gene sequence. The regulation of mRNA isoform usage occurs by the coordination of co-transcriptional mRNA processing mechanisms across a gene. Decisions involved in mRNA initiation and termination underlie the largest extent of mRNA isoform diversity, but little is known about any relationships between decisions at both ends of mRNA molecules. Here, we systematically profile the joint usage of mRNA transcription start sites (TSSs) and polyadenylation sites (PASs) across tissues and species. Using both short and long read RNA-seq data, we observe that mRNAs preferentially using upstream TSSs also tend to use upstream PASs, and congruently, the usage of downstream sites is similarly paired. This observation suggests that mRNA 5' end choice may directly influence mRNA 3' ends. Our results suggest a novel ""Positional Initiation-Termination Axis"" (PITA), in which the usage of alternative terminal sites are coupled based on the order in which they appear in the genome. PITA isoforms are more likely to encode alternative protein domains and use conserved sites. PITA is strongly associated with the length of genomic features, such that PITA is enriched in longer genes with more area devoted to regions that regulate alternative 5' or 3' ends. Strikingly, we found that PITA genes are more likely than non-PITA genes to have multiple, overlapping chromatin structural domains related to pairing of ordinally coupled start and end sites. In turn, PITA coupling is also associated with fast RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) trafficking across these long gene regions. Our findings indicate that a combination of spatial and kinetic mechanisms couple transcription initiation and mRNA 3' end decisions based on ordinal position to define the expression mRNA isoforms.",3.85315379751924e-46
38302732,"Human primordial germ cell-like cells specified from resetting precursors develop in human hindgut organoids.","Nat Protoc","Human primordial germ cells (hPGCs), the precursors of eggs and sperm, start their complex development shortly after specification and during their migration to the primitive gonads. Here, we describe protocols for specifying hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) from resetting precursors and progressing them with the support of human hindgut organoids. Resetting hPGCLCs (rhPGCLCs) are specified from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) transitioning from the primed into the naive state of pluripotency. Hindgut organoids are also derived from hESCs after a sequential differentiation into a posterior endoderm/hindgut fate. Both rhPGCLCs and hindgut organoids are combined and co-cultured for 25 d. The entire procedure takes ~1.5 months and can be successfully implemented by a doctoral or graduate student with basic skills and experience in hESC cultures. The co-culture system supports the progression of rhPGCLCs at a developmental timing analogous to that observed in vivo. Compared with previously developed hPGCLC progression protocols, which depend on co-cultures with mouse embryonic gonadal tissue, our co-culture system represents a developmentally relevant model closer to the environment that hPGCs first encounter after specification. Together with the potential for investigations of events during hPGC specification and early development, these protocols provide a practical approach to designing efficient models for in vitro gametogenesis. Notably, the rhPGCLC-hindgut co-culture system can also be adapted to study failings in hPGC migration, which are associated with the etiology of some forms of infertility and germ cell tumors.© 2024.

38286816,"Glial cells react to closed head injury in a distinct and spatiotemporally orchestrated manner.","Sci Rep","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Acute neuroinflammation is a prominent reaction after TBI and is mostly initiated by brain-resident glial cells such as microglia, NG2-glia and astrocytes. The magnitude of this reaction paves the way for long-lasting consequences such as chronic neurological pathologies, for which therapeutic options remain limited. The neuroinflammatory response to TBI is mostly studied with craniotomy-based animal models that are very robust but also rather artificial. Here, we aimed to analyze the reaction of glial cells in a highly translational but variable closed head injury (CHI) model and were able to correlate the severity of the trauma to the degree of glial response. Furthermore, we could show that the different glial cell types react in a temporally and spatially orchestrated manner in terms of morphological changes, proliferation, and cell numbers in the first 15 days after the lesion. Interestingly, NG2-glia, the only proliferating cells in the healthy brain parenchyma, divided at a rate that was correlated with the size of the injury. Our findings describe the previously uncharacterized posttraumatic response of the major brain glial cell types in CHI in order to gain a detailed understanding of the course of neuroinflammatory events; such knowledge may open novel avenues for future therapeutic approaches in TBI.© 2024.

This research investigated the association between L3MBTL3 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of GC cases, as well as its prognostic value and biological function based on large-scale databases and clinical samples. The results showed that L3MBTL3 expression was upregulated in malignant GC tissues, which was associated with a shortened survival time and poor clinicopathological characteristics, including TNM staging. A functional enrichment analysis including GO/KEGG and GSEA illustrated the enrichment of different L3MBTL3-associated pathways involved in carcinogenesis and immune response. In addition, the correlations between L3MBTL3 and tumor-infiltrating immune cells were determined based on the TIMER database; the results showed that L3MBTL3 was associated with the immune infiltration of macrophages and their polarization from M1 to M2. Furthermore, our findings suggested a possible function for L3MBTL3 in the regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment of GC.

38161582,"The Molecular Mechanisms Involved in the Hypertrophic Scars Post-Burn Injury.","Yale J Biol Med","Scar formation is a normal response to skin injuries. During the scar-remodeling phase, scar tissue is usually replaced with normal, functional tissue. However, after deep burn injuries, the scar tissue may persist and lead to contractures around joints, a condition known as hypertrophic scar tissue. Unfortunately, current treatment options for hypertrophic scars, such as surgery and pressure garments, often fail to prevent their reappearance. One of the primary challenges in treating hypertrophic scars is a lack of knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying their formation. In this review, we critically analyze studies that have attempted to uncover the molecular mechanisms behind hypertrophic scar formation after severe burn injuries, as well as clinical trials conducted to treat post-burn hypertrophic scars. We found that most clinical trials used pressure garments, laser treatments, steroids, and proliferative inhibitors for hypertrophic scars, with outcomes measured using subjective scar scales. However, fundamental research using human burn injury biopsies has shown that pathways such as Transforming Growth factor β (TGFβ), Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) could be potentially regulated to reduce scarring. Therefore, we conclude that more testing is necessary to determine the efficacy of these molecular targets in reducing hypertrophic scarring. Specifically, double-blinded clinical trials are needed, where the outcomes can be measured with more robust quantitative molecular parameters.Copyright ©2023, Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine.",2.19472394281272e-46

A novel tumor oncolytic virus, Ad-TD-nsIL-12, has manifested anti-tumor properties in preclinical studies. However, the genetic changes caused by Ad-TD-nsIL-12 after GBM treatment are unclear. Therefore, we collected cerebrospinal fluid and tumor tissues from patients injected with Ad-TD-nsIL-12 at different time points and analyzed the methylation and expression profiles of cerebrospinal fluid-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). The differential genes were screened using the least absolute selection and shrinkage operator (LASSO) and Cox regression analyses. The CIBERSORT algorithm was used to assess the abundance of glioma immune cell infiltration in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. The role of hub genes in the diagnosis, prognosis, and immune cell correlation was analyzed using R software, SPSS software, and GraphPad Prism. The results showed that after Ad-TD-nsIL-12 injection, 3631 differential methylation regions (DMRs) were up-regulated and 497 DMRs were down-regulated. The methylation levels of these DMRs recovered within 70 to 82 days. Combined with the TCGA dataset, 8 key genes were selected for the construction of diagnostic and prognostic models. There was a significant correlation between core genes and immune cells.

Increasingly research elucidated that BPA exposure to the environment would change the epigenetic modifications of transcriptome, but the mechanism by which BPA affects m6A methylation in interfering with female reproductive health remains uncertain. Therefore, this study preliminarily proposed and tested the hypothesis that BPA exposure alters the m6A modification level in transcripts in female ovarian granulosa cells. After BPA was exposed to granulosa cells for 24 h, RNA methylation related regulatory genes (such as METTL3, METTL14, ALKBH5, FTO) and the global m6A levels showed significant differences. Next, we applied MERIP-seq analysis to obtain information on the genome-wide m6A modification changes and identified 1595 differentially methylated mRNA transcripts, and 50 differentially methylated lncRNA transcripts. Further joint analysis of gene common expression showed that 33 genes were hypermethylated and up-regulated, 71 were hypermethylated and down-regulated, 49 were hypomethylated and up-regulated, and 20 were hypomethylated and down-regulated. Enriched Gene Ontology (GO) and biological pathway analysis revealed that these unique genes were mainly enriched in lipid metabolism, cell proliferation, and apoptosis related pathways. Six of these genes (mRNAs IMPA1, MCOLN1, DCTN3, BRCA2, and lncRNAs MALAT1, XIST) were validated using RT-qPCR and IGV software. Through comprehensive analysis of epitranscriptome and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, lncRNAs MALAT1 and XIST are expected to serve as new markers for BPA interfering with the female reproductive system. In brief, these data show a novel and necessary connection between the damage of BPA exposure on female ovarian granulosa cells and RNA methylation modification.Copyright © 2024.

Bisulfite amplicon sequencing was applied to detect the level of methylation of the sFRP5 gene; western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction were performed to detect DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), sFRP5, and other Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related mRNA and protein expression.The results showed that high-dosage YSG exerted an anti-tumor effect similar to that of decitabine, improved OS, and reduced long-term adverse effects in the long term. Mechanically, YSG reduced the expression of DNMT1 methyltransferase, decreased the methylation, and increased the expression of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway antagonist-sFRP5. Furthermore, components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, including Wnt3a, β-catenin, c-Myc, and cyclinD1, were down-regulated in response to YSG, suggesting that YSG could treat MDS by demethylating the sFRP5 gene and suppressing the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.Our findings demonstrated that YSG could be used alone or in combination with decitabine to improve outcomes in the MDS animal model, providing an alternative solution for treating MDS.",1.58462385089462e-46

Such a field is particularly heterogeneous, calling for regular analysis and summarizing of the data that constantly emerge in the scientific literature, often sparse and scant of integration. The aim of this study was to systematically identify and synthesize all new evidence that emerged in human and animal model studies published between 2020 and 2023. This was necessary because, to the best of our knowledge, articles published before 2019 (and partly 2020) had already been included in systematic reviews that allowed to identify the ones concerning the knee joint. The review was carried out in accordance with Preferential Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Only peer-reviewed articles were considered for inclusion. A total of 40 studies were identified, showing promising results in terms either of biomarker identification, new insight in mechanism of action or potential therapeutic targets for knee OA.

38371593,"NSD family proteins: Rising stars as therapeutic targets.","Cell Insight","Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications, intricately regulate gene expression patterns by influencing DNA accessibility and chromatin structure in higher organisms. These modifications are heritable, are independent of primary DNA sequences, undergo dynamic changes during development and differentiation, and are frequently disrupted in human diseases. The reversibility of epigenetic modifications makes them promising targets for therapeutic intervention and drugs targeting epigenetic regulators (e.g., tazemetostat, targeting the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2) have been applied in clinical therapy for multiple cancers. The NSD family of H3K36 methyltransferase enzymes-including NSD1 (KMT3B), NSD2 (MMSET/WHSC1), and NSD3 (WHSC1L1)-are now receiving drug development attention, with the exciting advent of an NSD2 inhibitor (KTX-1001) advancing to Phase I clinical trials for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. NSD proteins recognize and catalyze methylation of histone lysine marks, thereby regulating chromatin integrity and gene expression. Multiple studies have implicated NSD proteins in human disease, noting impacts from translocations, aberrant expression, and various dysfunctional somatic mutations. Here, we review the biological functions of NSD proteins, epigenetic cooperation related to NSD proteins, and the accumulating evidence linking these proteins to developmental disorders and tumorigenesis, while additionally considering prospects for the development of innovative epigenetic therapies.© 2024 The Authors.",7.9122723355388e-47

Compared to men, women are not only nearly twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's, but they also experience worse neuropathological burden and cognitive decline despite living longer with the disease. It remains unclear how and when sex differences in biological aging emerge and contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. We hypothesized that these differences lead to distinct pathological and molecular Alzheimer's disease signatures in males and females, which could be harnessed for therapeutic and biomarker development.We aged male and female, 3xTg-AD and B6129 (WT) control mice across their respective lifespans while longitudinally collecting brain, liver, spleen, and plasma samples (n=3-8 mice per sex, strain, and age group). We performed histological analyses on all tissues and assessed neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, markers of hepatic inflammation, as well as splenic mass and morphology. Additionally, we measured concentrations of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in the plasma. We conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis on bulk brain tissue and examined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between 3xTg-AD and WT samples and across ages in each sex. We also examined DEGs between clinical Alzheimer's and control parahippocampal gyrus brain tissue samples from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) study in each sex.3xTg-AD females significantly outlived 3xTg-AD males and exhibited progressive Alzheimer's neuropathology, while 3xTg-AD males demonstrated progressive hepatic inflammation, splenomegaly, circulating inflammatory proteins, and next to no Alzheimer's neuropathological hallmarks. Instead, 3xTg-AD males experienced an accelerated upregulation of immune-related gene expression in the brain relative to females, further suggesting distinct inflammatory disease trajectories between the sexes. Clinical investigations revealed that 3xTg-AD brain aging phenotypes are not an artifact of the animal model, and individuals with Alzheimer's disease develop similar sex-specific alterations in canonical pathways related to neuronal signaling and immune function. Interestingly, we observed greater upregulation of complement-related gene expression, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was predicted as the top upstream regulator of DEGs in diseased males of both species.Our data demonstrate that chronic inflammation and complement activation are associated with increased mortality, revealing that age-related changes in immune response act as a primary driver of sex differences in Alzheimer's disease trajectories. We propose a model of disease pathogenesis in 3xTg-AD males in which aging and transgene-driven disease progression trigger an inflammatory response, mimicking the effects of LPS stimulation despite the absence of infection.",7.13160134332171e-47
38322540,"[Research Progress in the Effect of Exercise Intervention on Sleep Disorders and the Mechanisms Involved].","Sichuan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban","Sleep disorders, a common concern in modern society, seriously affect people's physical and mental health. Reported findings suggest that both acute exercise intervention and long-term regular exercise intervention can improve the disrupted sleep structure and normalize the duration and proportion of the different phases of sleep. Moreover, exercise intervention has a positive effect on the endocrine functions, the metabolic functions, the immune response, the autonomic nervous system, and cardiac functions during sleep. It is a non-medicative therapeutic strategy for improving sleep disorders. The specific type of exercise intervention (aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or meditative movement) adopted is one of the moderating variables of exercise intervention programs. Different types of exercise improve sleep disorders by way of different mechanisms. Exercise volume and intensity are another moderating variable of exercise intervention programs. The optimal amount and intensity of exercise for different individuals to improve sleep disorders may vary. Exercise interventions implemented at the different times throughout a day can also have varying degrees of impact on sleep disorders and there is no consensus on the optimal exercise time for improving sleep quality at present. Herein, we summarized the mechanisms by which exercise intervention improves sleep disorders from four perspectives, including epigenetics, hyperarousal, human circadian rhythm, and body temperature regulation. In addition, we discussed the current gaps and prospects of research in this field, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the development of exercise prescriptions for sleep disorders.© 2024《四川大学学报（医学版）》编辑部 版权所有Copyright ©2024 Editorial Board of Journal of Sichuan University (Medical Sciences).",6.58923357883801e-47

The significance of calcyclin binding protein (CACYBP) in various neoplasms suggests that it may serve as a novel biomarker for numerous types of human tumors.Our research investigated the differences inCACYBPexpression between cancer tissues and normal tissues using a total of 18,787 samples from multiple centers. To explore the prognostic factor ofCACYBPin cancers, we utilized Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves. We also conducted Spearman's rank correlation analyses to determine the associations ofCACYBPexpression with the immune microenvironment, etc. Additionally, we applied gene set enrichment analysis to explore the underlying mechanisms ofCACYBPin cancers. A partial validation of CacyBP expression in cancer tissues was performed through lung adenocarcinoma samples using Western blotting and pairedt-test.Compared to normal tissues,CACYBPexhibited high expression levels in 14 cancer types, including breast invasive carcinoma, and low expression levels in six cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme (P< 0.05).CACYBPexpression was found to be significantly associated with the prognosis of 13 cancers, including adrenocortical carcinoma (P< 0.05).CACYBPdemonstrated a robust ability to distinguish 15 cancers, including cholangiocarcinoma, from their control samples (area under the curve > 0.8). Furthermore,CACYBPexpression was correlated with tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and immune infiltration levels, indicating its potential as an exciting target for cancer treatment.CACYBPmay exert its effects on several signaling pathways, including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, in various cancers. Compared with paired adjacent specimens, the expression level of CacyBP protein was up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma specimens (P< 0.05), partially validating the increased expression ofCACYBPin cancers.CACYBPhas the potential to serve as a novel prognostic and predictive marker for multiple human cancers.AJTR Copyright © 2024.",5.11514839959026e-47
38168182,"Cell-type specific molecular signatures of aging revealed in a brain-wide transcriptomic cell-type atlas.","bioRxiv","Biological aging can be defined as a gradual loss of homeostasis across various aspects of molecular and cellular function. Aging is a complex and dynamic process which influences distinct cell types in a myriad of ways. The cellular architecture of the mammalian brain is heterogeneous and diverse, making it challenging to identify precise areas and cell types of the brain that are more susceptible to aging than others. Here, we present a high-resolution single-cell RNA sequencing dataset containing ~1.2 million high-quality single-cell transcriptomic profiles of brain cells from young adult and aged mice across both sexes, including areas spanning the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. We find age-associated gene expression signatures across nearly all 130+ neuronal and non-neuronal cell subclasses we identified. We detect the greatest gene expression changes in non-neuronal cell types, suggesting that different cell types in the brain vary in their susceptibility to aging. We identify specific, age-enriched clusters within specific glial, vascular, and immune cell types from both cortical and subcortical regions of the brain, and specific gene expression changes associated with cell senescence, inflammation, decrease in new myelination, and decreased vasculature integrity. We also identify genes with expression changes across multiple cell subclasses, pointing to certain mechanisms of aging that may occur across wide regions or broad cell types of the brain. Finally, we discover the greatest gene expression changes in cell types localized to the third ventricle of the hypothalamus, including tanycytes, ependymal cells, andTbx3+ neurons found in the arcuate nucleus that are part of the neuronal circuits regulating food intake and energy homeostasis. These findings suggest that the area surrounding the third ventricle in the hypothalamus may be a hub for aging in the mouse brain. Overall, we reveal a dynamic landscape of cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in the brain associated with normal aging that will serve as a foundation for the investigation of functional changes in the aging process and the interaction of aging and diseases.",4.23321714595735e-47

Their common pathobiology raises the intriguing possibility that brain injury could create a tissue microenvironment permissive for tumor formation. Leveraging several murine models of the Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome and two experimental methods of brain injury, we demonstrate that both optic nerve crush and diffuse traumatic brain injury induce optic glioma (OPG) formation in mice harboring Nf1-deficient preneoplastic progenitors. We further elucidate the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms, whereby glutamate released from damaged neurons stimulates IL-1β release by oligodendrocytes to induce microglia expression of Ccl5, a growth factor critical for Nf1-OPG formation. Interruption of this cellular circuit using glutamate receptor, IL-1β or Ccl5 inhibitors abrogates injury-induced glioma progression, thus establishing a causative relationship between injury and tumorigenesis.© 2024.

The mRNA expression levels of ALB and Sox2 were detected by fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the Sox2 gene promoter methylation level was determined by Bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP).Sox mRNA expression level was significantly increased in experimental group compared to the control group at 0, 7, and 14 days, respectively (all P<0.05). The Sox2 promoter methylation level was gradually increased after 0, 7 and 14 days induction in both groups, accompanied by an increase in methylated loci (all P<0.05). Statistical significance was present in CpG methylated loci between groups (all P<0.05).The expression of Sox2 gene increased first and then decreased in the process of inducing rat BMSCs into stem cells, and the methylation level of CpG loci in the promoter region changed dynamically, with an increased overall methylation level. After 5-aza treatment, the Sox2 promoter was in a non-methylated state, and its mRNA expression increased, which hindered the cell differentiation.AJTR Copyright © 2023.",3.65465350570936e-47

To identify novel targets that can enhance DTE protein production, we performed genome-wide fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) knockout screening in bispecific antibody (bsAb)-producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The screen identified the two highest-scoring genes,Atf7ipandSetdb1, which are the binding partners for H3K9me3-mediated transcriptional repression. The ATF7IP-SETDB1 complex knockout in bsAb-producing CHO cells suppressed cell growth but enhanced productivity by up to 2.7-fold. Decreased H3K9me3 levels and an increased transcriptional expression level of the transgene were also observed. Furthermore, perturbation of the ATF7IP-SETDB1 complex in monoclonal antibody (mAb)-producing CHO cells led to substantial improvements in mAb production, increasing the productivity by up to 3.9-fold without affecting the product quality. Taken together, the genome-wide FACS-based CRISPR screen identified promising targets associated with histone methylation, whose perturbation enhanced the productivity by unlocking the transgene expression.",3.64183753840429e-47

However, accurately identifying mitotic cells poses a challenge due to their morphological and size diversity.Objective:We propose a novel end-to-end deep-learning method for identifying mitotic cells in breast cancer pathological images, with the aim of enhancing the performance of recognizing mitotic cells.Methods:We introduced the Dilated Cascading Network (DilCasNet) composed of detection and classification stages. To enhance the model's ability to capture distant feature dependencies in mitotic cells, we devised a novel Dilated Contextual Attention Module (DiCoA) that utilizes sparse global attention during the detection. For reclassifying mitotic cell areas localized in the detection stage, we integrate the EfficientNet-B7 and VGG16 pre-trained models (InPreMo) in the classification step.Results:Based on the canine mammary carcinoma (CMC) mitosis dataset, DilCasNet demonstrates superior overall performance compared to the benchmark model. The specific metrics of the model's performance are as follows: F1 score of 82.9%, Precision of 82.6%, and Recall of 83.2%. With the incorporation of the DiCoA attention module, the model exhibited an improvement of over 3.5% in the F1 during the detection stage.Conclusion:The DilCasNet achieved a favorable detection performance of mitotic cells in breast cancer and provides a solution for detecting mitotic cells in pathological images of other cancers.Copyright © 2024 Li, Li, Wu, Lyu, Tang, Zhou, Xu, Luo, Jiang, Liu and Xiang.",2.79240104153146e-47

Recent studies have unveiled PS-induced formation of several transcriptional factor (TF) condensates that are transcriptionally active, but how strongly PS promotes gene activation remains unclear. Here, we show that the oncogenic TF fusion Yes-associated protein 1-Mastermind like transcriptional coactivator 2 (YAP-MAML2) undergoes PS and forms liquid-like condensates that bear the hallmarks of transcriptional activity. Furthermore, we examined the contribution of PS to YAP-MAML2-mediated gene expression by developing a chemogenetic tool that dissolves TF condensates, allowing us to compare phase-separated and non-phase-separated conditions at identical YAP-MAML2 protein levels. We found that a small fraction of YAP-MAML2-regulated genes is further affected by PS, which include the canonical YAP target genesCTGFandCYR61, and other oncogenes. On the other hand, majority of YAP-MAML2-regulated genes are not affected by PS, highlighting that transcription can be activated effectively by diffuse complexes of TFs with the transcriptional machinery. Our work opens new directions in understanding the role of PS in selective modulation of gene expression, suggesting differential roles of PS in biological processes.",2.42601976193748e-47
38232730,"Neuronal MAPT expression is mediated by long-range interactions with cis-regulatory elements.","Am J Hum Genet","Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases defined by abnormal aggregates of tau, a microtubule-associated protein encoded by MAPT. MAPT expression is near absent in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and increases during differentiation. This temporally dynamic expression pattern suggests that MAPT expression could be controlled by transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements specific to differentiated cell types. Given the relevance of MAPT expression to neurodegeneration pathogenesis, identification of such elements is relevant to understanding disease risk and pathogenesis. Here, we performed chromatin conformation assays (HiC & Capture-C), single-nucleus multiomics (RNA-seq+ATAC-seq), bulk ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq for H3K27ac and CTCF in NPCs and differentiated neurons to nominate candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs). We assayed these cCREs using luciferase assays and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) experiments to measure their effects on MAPT expression. Finally, we integrated cCRE annotations into an analysis of genetic variation in neurodegeneration-affected individuals and control subjects. We identified both proximal and distal regulatory elements for MAPT and confirmed the regulatory function for several regions, including three regions centromeric to MAPT beyond the H1/H2 haplotype inversion breakpoint. We also found that rare and predicted damaging genetic variation in nominated CREs was nominally depleted in dementia-affected individuals relative to control subjects, consistent with the hypothesis that variants that disrupt MAPT enhancer activity, and thereby reduced MAPT expression, may be protective against neurodegenerative disease. Overall, this study provides compelling evidence for pursuing detailed knowledge of CREs for genes of interest to permit better understanding of disease risk.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

This study aimed to identify markers for predicting the response to decitabine.An intersection of in vitro experiments and bioinformatics was performed using a combination of epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis. A tumor-suppressor gene associated with methylation and the response to decitabine was screened. Then the sensitivity and specificity of this marker in predicting the response to decitabine was confirmed in 54 samples from newly diagnosed AML patients treated with decitabine plus IA regimen in a clinical trial (ChiCTR2000037928).In vitro experiments showed that decitabine caused hypomethylation and upregulation of BTG1, while downregulation of BTG1 attenuated the inhibitory effect of decitabine. In newly diagnosed AML patients who received decitabine plus IA regimen, the predictive value of BTG1 to predict complete remission (CR) was assigned with a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 100.0% when BTG1 expression was < 0.292 (determined using real-time quantitative PCR), with area under the curve (AUC) = 0.933, P = 0.021. The predictive value of BTG1 to predict measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity was assigned with a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 80.0% when BTG1 expression was < 0.292 (AUC = 0.892, P = 0.012). Patients were divided into low and high BTG1 expression groups according to a cutoff of 0.292, and the CR rate of the low-expression group was significantly higher than that of the high-expression group (97.5% vs. 50%, P < 0.001).Low expression of BTG1 was associated with CR and MRD negativity in newly diagnosed AML patients treated with a decitabine-containing regimen, suggesting that BTG1 is a potential marker for predicting the response to decitabine in newly diagnosed AML.ChiCTR2000037928.© 2024.

APOE4 mouse models have provided advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, but unaccounted variables like rodent housing status may hinder translational outcomes. Non-sterile aspects like food and bedding can be major sources of changes in rodent microflora. Alterations in intestinal microbial ecology can cause mucosal barrier impairment and increase pro-inflammatory signals. The present study examined the role of sterile and non-sterile food and housing on redox indicators and the immune status of humanized-APOE4 knock-in mice (hAPOe4). hAPOE4 mice were housed under sterile conditions until 22 months of age, followed by the transfer of a cohort of mice to non-sterile housing for 2 months. At 24 months of age, the redox/immunologic status was evaluated by flow cytometry/ELISA. hAPOE4 females housed under non-sterile conditions exhibited: (1) higher neuronal and microglial oxygen radical production and (2) lower CD68+microglia (brain) and CD8+T cells (periphery) compared to sterile-housed mice. In contrast, hAPOE4 males in non-sterile housing exhibited: (1) higher MHCII+microglia and CD11b+CD4+T cells (brain) and (2) higher CD11b+CD4+T cells and levels of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and inflammatory cytokines in the periphery relative to sterile-housed mice. This study demonstrated that sterile vs. non-sterile housing conditions are associated with the activation of redox and immune responses in the brain and periphery in a sex-dependent manner. Therefore, housing status may contribute to variable outcomes in both the brain and periphery.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.52682553483338e-47
38172915,"Identification of a Notch transcriptomic signature for breast cancer.","Breast Cancer Res","Dysregulated Notch signalling contributes to breast cancer development and progression, but validated tools to measure the level of Notch signalling in breast cancer subtypes and in response to systemic therapy are largely lacking. A transcriptomic signature of Notch signalling would be warranted, for example to monitor the effects of future Notch-targeting therapies and to learn whether altered Notch signalling is an off-target effect of current breast cancer therapies. In this report, we have established such a classifier.To generate the signature, we first identified Notch-regulated genes from six basal-like breast cancer cell lines subjected to elevated or reduced Notch signalling by culturing on immobilized Notch ligand Jagged1 or blockade of Notch by γ-secretase inhibitors, respectively. From this cadre of Notch-regulated genes, we developed candidate transcriptomic signatures that were trained on a breast cancer patient dataset (the TCGA-BRCA cohort) and a broader breast cancer cell line cohort and sought to validate in independent datasets.An optimal 20-gene transcriptomic signature was selected. We validated the signature on two independent patient datasets (METABRIC and Oslo2), and it showed an improved coherence score and tumour specificity compared with previously published signatures. Furthermore, the signature score was particularly high for basal-like breast cancer, indicating an enhanced level of Notch signalling in this subtype. The signature score was increased after neoadjuvant treatment in the PROMIX and BEAUTY patient cohorts, and a lower signature score generally correlated with better clinical outcome.The 20-gene transcriptional signature will be a valuable tool to evaluate the response of future Notch-targeting therapies for breast cancer, to learn about potential effects on Notch signalling from conventional breast cancer therapies and to better stratify patients for therapy considerations.© 2024.

However, heavy-metal pollution and frequent soil diseases, poses a significant threat to the production of green and healthy peanuts. Herein, we investigated the effects of heavy metal Cd2+toxicity to the peanuts, and screened out two peanut cultivars H108 and YZ 9102 with higher Cd2+-tolerance. RNA-seq revealed that Natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins (NRAMP)-like genes were involved in the Cd2+stress tolerance in H108. Genome-wide identification revealed that 28, 13 and 9 Nramp-like genes existing in the A. hypogaea, A. duranensis and A. ipaensis, respectively. The 50 peanut NRAMP genes share conserved architectural characters, and they were classified into two groups. Expressions of AhNramps, particularly AhNramp4, AhNramp12, AhNramp19, and AhNramp25 could be greatly induced by not only cadmium toxicity, but also copper and zinc stresses. The expression profiles of AhNramp14, AhNramp16 and AhNramp25 showed significant differences in the H108 (resistance) and H107 (susceptible) under the infection of bacterial wilt. In addition, we found that the expression profiles of AhNramp14, AhNramp16, and AhNramp25 were greatly up- or down-regulated by the application of exogenous salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, and abscisic acid. The AhNramp25, of which expression was affected by both heavy metal toxicity and bacterial wilt infection, were selected as strong candidate genes for peanut stress breeding.

However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyze the expression of SNORA51 in HCC and its clinical significance. A total of 136 patients with HCC who underwent surgery from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018 were included. The expression of SNORA51 in cancer tissues and adjacent tissues was compared using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and bioinformatics methods. Methylation of the SNORA51 promoter in cancer and adjacent tissues was compared using bioinformatics. The relationship between SNORA51 expression levels and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with HCC, in addition to prognosis, was analyzed. The expression of SNORA51 in HCC was significantly higher compared with that in adjacent tissues (P<0.05). starBase demonstrated that higher expression levels of SNORA51 were associated with a significantly worse prognosis of patients with HCC compared with those who had lower expression levels of SNORA51 (P<0.05). Bioinformatics analysis using The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Data Analysis Portal demonstrated that methylation of the SNORA51 promoter region in HCC was significantly decreased compared with adjacent tissues (P<0.05). A high expression of SNORA51 was significantly associated with portal vein tumor thrombus, vascular invasion and TNM stage (P<0.05). The median survival time of patients with high SNORA51 expression was significantly lower compared with those who had low SNORA51 expression (P<0.05). Both uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that SNORA51 expression was an independent risk factor that significantly worsened the prognosis of patients with HCC (P<0.05). The overexpression of SNORA51 in patients with HCC was significantly associated with a poor prognosis and may be related to the reduced methylation of the SNORA51 promoter region. Therefore, SNORA51 may be a promising biomarker for prediction of the prognosis of patients with HCC and may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC in future.Copyright © 2023, Spandidos Publications.",8.81687189108087e-48

This paper delves into the multifaceted relationships between the microbiome, its metabolites, and cancer development, emphasizing the human intestinal tract as the primary microbial habitat. Highlighting the potential causative associations between microbial disturbances and cancer progression, we underscore the role of specific bacterial strains in various cancers, such as stomach and colorectal cancer. Traditional causality assessment methods, like randomized controlled trials (RCTs), have limitations. Therefore, we advocate using Mendelian Randomization (MR) as a powerful alternative to study causal relationships, leveraging genetic variants as instrumental variables. With the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, MR harnesses genetic variations to infer causality, which is especially beneficial when addressing confounders like diet and lifestyle that can skew microbial research. We systematically review MR's application in understanding the microbiome-cancer nexus, emphasizing its strengths and challenges. While MR offers a unique perspective on causality, it faces hurdles like horizontal pleiotropy and weak instrumental variable bias. Integrating MR with multi-omics data, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, holds promise for future research, potentially heralding groundbreaking discoveries in microbiology and genetics.

38256371,NA,NA,"Allergic diseases are one of the most common chronic conditions and their prevalence is on the rise. Environmental exposure, primarily prenatal and early life influences, affect the risk for the development and specific phenotypes of allergic diseases via epigenetic mechanisms. Exposure to pollutants, microorganisms and parasites, tobacco smoke and certain aspects of diet are known to drive epigenetic changes that are essential for immune regulation (e.g., the shift toward T helper 2-Th2 cell polarization and decrease in regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation). DNA methylation and histone modifications can modify immune programming related to either pro-allergic interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 13 (IL-13) or counter-regulatory interferon γ (IFN-γ) production. Differential expression of small non-coding RNAs has also been linked to the risk for allergic diseases and associated with air pollution. Certain exposures and associated epigenetic mechanisms play a role in the susceptibility to allergic conditions and specific clinical manifestations of the disease, while others are thought to have a protective role against the development of allergic diseases, such as maternal and early postnatal microbial diversity, maternal helminth infections and dietary supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin D. Epigenetic mechanisms are also known to be involved in mediating the response to common treatment in allergic diseases, for example, changes in histone acetylation of proinflammatory genes and in the expression of certain microRNAs are associated with the response to inhaled corticosteroids in asthma. Gaining better insight into the epigenetic regulation of allergic diseases may ultimately lead to significant improvements in the management of these conditions, earlier and more precise diagnostics, optimization of current treatment regimes, and the implementation of novel therapeutic options and prevention strategies in the near future.",5.00532466248111e-48

However, not all individuals experience clinical benefits from this therapy. As a result, it is critical to investigate the factors that contribute to the inconsistent response of patients. Recent investigations have emphasized the importance of lipid metabolic reprogramming in the development and progression of NSCLC.The objective of this investigation was to examine the correlation between lipid variations and observed treatment outcomes in advanced NSCLC patients who were administered PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alongside anlotinib. A cohort composed of 30 individuals diagnosed with advanced NSCLC without any driver mutations was divided into three distinct groups based on the clinical response to the combination treatment, namely, a group exhibiting partial responses, a group manifesting progressive disease, and a group demonstrating stable disease. The lipid composition of patients in these groups was assessed both before and after treatment.Significant differences in lipid composition among the three groups were observed. Further analysis revealed 19 differential lipids, including 2 phosphatidylglycerols and 17 phosphoinositides.This preliminary study aimed to explore the specific impact of anlotinib in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors on lipid metabolism in patients with advanced NSCLC. By investigating the effects of using both anlotinib and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, this study enhances our understanding of lipid metabolism in lung cancer treatment. The findings from this research provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic approaches and the identification of new therapeutic biomarkers.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.4341878328011e-48
38266047,"Astrocytic TIMP-1 regulates production of Anastellin, an inhibitor of oligodendrocyte differentiation and FTY720 responses.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","Astrocyte activation is associated with neuropathology and the production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1). TIMP1 is a pleiotropic extracellular protein that functions both as a protease inhibitor and as a growth factor. Astrocytes that lack expression ofTimp1do not support rat oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (rOPC) differentiation, and adult globalTimp1knockout (Timp1KO) mice do not efficiently remyelinate following a demyelinating injury. Here, we performed an unbiased proteomic analysis and identified a fibronectin-derived peptide called Anastellin (Ana) that was unique to theTimp1KOastrocyte secretome. Ana was found to block rOPC differentiation in vitro and enhanced the inhibitory influence of fibronectin on rOPC differentiation. Ana is known to act upon the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1, and we determined that Ana also blocked the pro-myelinating effect of FTY720 (or fingolimod) on rOPC differentiationin vitro.Administration of FTY720 to wild-type C57BL/6 mice during MOG35-55-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ameliorated clinical disability while FTY720 administered to mice lacking expression ofTimp1(Timp1KO) had no effect. Analysis ofTimp1and fibronectin (FN1) transcripts from primary human astrocytes from healthy and multiple sclerosis (MS) donors revealed lowerTIMP1expression was coincident with elevatedFN1in MS astrocytes. Last, analyses of proteomic databases of MS samples identified Ana peptides to be more abundant in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of human MS patients with high disease activity. A role for Ana in MS as a consequence of a lack of astrocytic TIMP-1 production could influence both the efficacy of fingolimod responses and innate remyelination potential in the MS brain.",3.29303293941447e-48

In this study, we comprehensively analyzed molecular profiles and drug screening data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Unexpectedly, gene alterations in BRCA1/2 or homologous recombination-related genes, HRD scores, or mutational signature 3 were not positively correlated with sensitivity to platinum agents or PARP inhibitors. Rather, higher HRD scores and mutational signature 3 were significantly associated with resistance to these agents in multiple assays. These findings were consistent when analyzing exclusively breast and ovarian cancer cell lines and when using data from the COSMIC Cell Line Project. Collectively, the existing data from established cancer cell lines do not reflect the expected association between HRD status and drug response to platinum agents and PARP inhibitors in clinical tumors. This discrepancy may extend to other tumor characteristics, highlighting the importance of recognizing potential limitations in cell line data for researchers.© 2024.

This work describes ECM-encapsulating, stably-inverted apical-out human upper airway organoids (AORBs) that are large (~500 μm diameter), consistently spherical, recapitulatein vivo-like cellular heterogeneity, and maintain their inverted morphology for over 60 days. Treatment of AORBs with IL-13 skews differentiation towards goblet cells and the apical-out geometry allows extra-organoid mucus collection. AORB maturation for 14 days induces strong co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to allow high-yield infection with five SARS-CoV-2 variants. Dose-response analysis of three well-studied SARS-CoV-2 antiviral compounds [remdesivir, bemnifosbuvir (AT-511), and nirmatrelvir] shows AORB antiviral assays to be comparable to gold-standard air-liquid interface cultures, but with higher throughput (~10-fold) and fewer cells (~100-fold).

38386103,"Unlocking allelic variation in circadian clock genes to develop environmentally robust and productive crops.","Planta","Molecular mechanisms of biological rhythms provide opportunities to harness functional allelic diversity in core (and trait- or stress-responsive) oscillator networks to develop more climate-resilient and productive germplasm. The circadian clock senses light and temperature in day-night cycles to drive biological rhythms. The clock integrates endogenous signals and exogenous stimuli to coordinate diverse physiological processes. Advances in high-throughput non-invasive assays, use of forward- and inverse-genetic approaches, and powerful algorithms are allowing quantitation of variation and detection of genes associated with circadian dynamics. Circadian rhythms and phytohormone pathways in response to endogenous and exogenous cues have been well documented the model plant Arabidopsis. Novel allelic variation associated with circadian rhythms facilitates adaptation and range expansion, and may provide additional opportunity to tailor climate-resilient crops. The circadian phase and period can determine adaptation to environments, while the robustness in the circadian amplitude can enhance resilience to environmental changes. Circadian rhythms in plants are tightly controlled by multiple and interlocked transcriptional-translational feedback loops involving morning (CCA1, LHY), mid-day (PRR9, PRR7, PRR5), and evening (TOC1, ELF3, ELF4, LUX) genes that maintain the plant circadian clock ticking. Significant progress has been made to unravel the functions of circadian rhythms and clock genes that regulate traits, via interaction with phytohormones and trait-responsive genes, in diverse crops. Altered circadian rhythms and clock genes may contribute to hybrid vigor as shown in Arabidopsis, maize, and rice. Modifying circadian rhythms via transgenesis or genome-editing may provide additional opportunities to develop crops with better buffering capacity to environmental stresses. Models that involve clock gene‒phytohormone‒trait interactions can provide novel insights to orchestrate circadian rhythms and modulate clock genes to facilitate breeding of all season crops.© 2024.

Here, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics and bulk RNA sequencing to delineate specific cell subsets involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) relapse and response to immunotherapy. We identified POSTN+extracellular matrix cancer-associated fibroblasts (EM CAFs) as a prominent onco-fetal interacting hub, promoting tumor progression. Cell-cell communication and spatial transcriptomics analysis revealed crosstalk and co-localization of onco-fetal cells, including POSTN+CAFs, FOLR2+macrophages and PLVAP+endothelial cells. Further analyses suggest an association between onco-fetal reprogramming and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor cell proliferation and recruitment of Tregcells, ultimately influencing early relapse and response to immunotherapy. In summary, our study identifies POSTN+CAFs as part of the HCC onco-fetal niche and highlights its potential influence in EMT, relapse and immunotherapy response, paving the way for the use of onco-fetal signatures for therapeutic stratification.© 2024.

Alteration of systemic immune cell levels may increase cancer risk. However, the extent to which common genetic variation influences blood traits and cancer risk remains largely undetermined. Here, we identify pleiotropic variants and predict their underlying molecular and cellular alterations.Multivariate Cox regression was used to evaluate associations between blood traits and cancer diagnosis in cases in the UK Biobank. Shared genetic variants were identified from the summary statistics of the genome-wide association studies of 27 blood traits and 27 cancer types and subtypes, applying the conditional/conjunctional false-discovery rate approach. Analysis of genomic positions, expression quantitative trait loci, enhancers, regulatory marks, functionally defined gene sets, and bulk- and single-cell expression profiles predicted the biological impact of pleiotropic variants. Plasma small RNAs were sequenced to assess association with cancer diagnosis.The study identified 4093 common genetic variants, involving 1248 gene loci, that contributed to blood-cancer pleiotropism. Genomic hotspots of pleiotropism include chromosomal regions 5p15-TERT and 6p21-HLA. Genes whose products are involved in regulating telomere length are found to be enriched in pleiotropic variants. Pleiotropic gene candidates are frequently linked to transcriptional programs that regulate hematopoiesis and define progenitor cell states of immune system development. Perturbation of the myeloid lineage is indicated by pleiotropic associations with defined master regulators and cell alterations. Eosinophil count is inversely associated with cancer risk. A high frequency of pleiotropic associations is also centered on the regulation of small noncoding Y-RNAs. Predicted pleiotropic Y-RNAs show specific regulatory marks and are overabundant in the normal tissue and blood of cancer patients. Analysis of plasma small RNAs in women who developed breast cancer indicates there is an overabundance of Y-RNA preceding neoplasm diagnosis.This study reveals extensive pleiotropism between blood traits and cancer risk. Pleiotropism is linked to factors and processes involved in hematopoietic development and immune system function, including components of the major histocompatibility complexes, and regulators of telomere length and myeloid lineage. Deregulation of Y-RNAs is also associated with pleiotropism. Overexpression of these elements might indicate increased cancer risk.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.84295770614352e-48

While several genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of these disorders, emerging evidence suggests that transposable elements (TEs), once considered ""junk DNA,"" play a significant role in their development and progression. TEs are mobile genetic elements capable of moving within the genome, and their dysregulation has been associated with genomic instability, altered gene expression, and neuroinflammation. This review provides an overview of TEs, including long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), mechanisms of repression and derepression, and their potential impact on neurodegeneration. The evidence linking TEs to AD, PD, and ALS by shedding light on the complex interactions between TEs and neurodegeneration has been discussed. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of targeting TEs in neurodegenerative diseases has been explored. Understanding the role of TEs in neurodegeneration holds promise for developing novel therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating disease progression and preserving neuronal health.© 2024.

Unlike H3K4 methylation, the genome-wide distribution and functional roles of H3K4ac remain unclear. To understand the relationship of acetylation with methylation at H3K4 and to explore the roles of H3K4ac in the context of chromatin, we analyzed H3K4ac across the human genome and compared it with H3K4 methylation in K562 cells. H3K4ac was positively correlated with H3K4me1/2/3 in reciprocal analysis. A decrease in H3K4ac through the mutation of the histone acetyltransferase p300 reduced H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 at the H3K4ac peaks. H3K4ac was also impaired by H3K4me depletion in the histone methyltransferase MLL3/4-mutated cells. H3K4ac peaks were enriched at enhancers in addition to the transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes. H3K4ac of TSSs and enhancers was positively correlated with mRNA and eRNA transcription. A decrease in H3K4ac reduced H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 in TSSs and enhancers, respectively, and inhibited the eviction of histone H3 from them. The mRNA transcription of highly transcribed genes was affected by the reduced H3K4ac. Interestingly, H3K4ac played a redundant role with regard to H3K27ac in eRNA transcription. These results indicate that H3K4ac serves as a marker of both active TSSs and enhancers and plays a role in histone eviction and RNA transcription by leading to H3K4me1/3.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

It has been well documented that the low level of MHC class I is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to checkpoint blockade therapies. However, there is lmited approaches to specifically induce MHC class I to date. Here, we show an approach for robust and specific induction of MHC class I by targeting an MHC class I transactivator (CITA)/NLRC5, using a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-specific system, designated TRED-I (Targeted reactivation and demethylation for MHC-I). The TRED-I system specifically recruits a demethylating enzyme and transcriptional activators on theNLRC5promoter, driving increased MHC class I antigen presentation and accelerated CD8+ T cell activation. Introduction of the TRED-I system in an animal cancer model exhibited tumor-suppressive effects accompanied with increased infiltration and activation of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, this approach boosted the efficacy of checkpoint blockade therapy using anti-PD1 (programmed cell death protein) antibody. Therefore, targetingNLRC5by this strategy provides an attractive therapeutic approach for cancer.",5.81365420634369e-49

Yet, the life of RNA molecules is multifaceted and dynamic, requiring spatial profiling of different RNA species throughout the life cycle to delve into the intricate RNA biology in complex tissues. Human disease-relevant tissues are commonly preserved as formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, representing an important resource for human tissue specimens. The capability to spatially explore RNA biology in FFPE tissues holds transformative potential for human biology research and clinical histopathology.

38383483,"Distinct intestinal microbial signatures linked to accelerated systemic and intestinal biological aging.","Microbiome","People living with HIV (PLWH), even when viral replication is controlled through antiretroviral therapy (ART), experience persistent inflammation. This inflammation is partly attributed to intestinal microbial dysbiosis and translocation, which may lead to non-AIDS-related aging-associated comorbidities. The extent to which living with HIV - influenced by the infection itself, ART usage, sexual orientation, or other associated factors - affects the biological age of the intestines is unclear. Furthermore, the role of microbial dysbiosis and translocation in the biological aging of PLWH remains to be elucidated. To investigate these uncertainties, we used a systems biology approach, analyzing colon and ileal biopsies, blood samples, and stool specimens from PLWH on ART and people living without HIV (PLWoH) as controls.PLWH exhibit accelerated biological aging in the colon, ileum, and blood, as measured by various epigenetic aging clocks, compared to PLWoH. Investigating the relationship between microbial translocation and biological aging, PLWH had decreased levels of tight junction proteins in the intestines, along with increased microbial translocation. This intestinal permeability correlated with faster biological aging and increased inflammation. When investigating the relationship between microbial dysbiosis and biological aging, the intestines of PLWH had higher abundance of specific pro-inflammatory bacteria, such as Catenibacterium and Prevotella. These bacteria correlated with accelerated biological aging. Conversely, the intestines of PLWH had lower abundance of bacteria known for producing the anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids, such as Subdoligranulum and Erysipelotrichaceae, and these bacteria were associated with slower biological aging. Correlation networks revealed significant links between specific microbial genera in the colon and ileum (but not in feces), increased aging, a rise in pro-inflammatory microbe-related metabolites (e.g., those in the tryptophan metabolism pathway), and a decrease in anti-inflammatory metabolites like hippuric acid.We identified specific microbial compositions and microbiota-related metabolic pathways that are intertwined with intestinal and systemic biological aging. This microbial signature of biological aging is likely reflecting various factors including the HIV infection itself, ART usage, sexual orientation, and other aspects associated with living with HIV. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying these connections could offer potential strategies to mitigate accelerated aging and its associated health complications. Video Abstract.© 2024.

The development of drug resistance in cancer cells is a multifactor event, and its process involves numerous mechanisms that allow these cells to evade the effect of treatments. As a result, the need to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer drug sensitivity is imperative. Traditional 2D cell culture systems have been utilized to study drug resistance, but they often fail to mimic the 3D milieu and the architecture of real tissues and cell-cell interactions.

Despite its importance, the spatiotemporal codes underlying human spinal cord development have remained elusive. In this study, we have introduced an image-based single-cell transcription factor (TF) expression decoding spatial transcriptome method (TF-seqFISH) to investigate the spatial expression and regulation of TFs during human spinal cord development. By combining spatial transcriptomic data from TF-seqFISH and single-cell RNA-sequencing data, we uncovered the spatial distribution of neural progenitor cells characterized by combinatorial TFs along the dorsoventral axis, as well as the molecular and spatial features governing neuronal generation, migration, and differentiation along the mediolateral axis. Notably, we observed a sandwich-like organization of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons transiently appearing in the dorsal horns of the developing human spinal cord. In addition, we integrated data from 10× Visium to identify early and late waves of neurogenesis in the dorsal horn, revealing the formation of laminas in the dorsal horns. Our study also illuminated the spatial differences and molecular cues underlying motor neuron (MN) diversification, and the enrichment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) risk genes in MNs and microglia. Interestingly, we detected disease-associated microglia (DAM)-like microglia groups in the developing human spinal cord, which are predicted to be vulnerable to ALS and engaged in the TYROBP causal network and response to unfolded proteins. These findings provide spatiotemporal transcriptomic resources on the developing human spinal cord and potential strategies for spinal cord injury repair and ALS treatment.© 2023.

Most patients with metastatic disease are not eligible for surgical resection, and current therapeutic regimens have varying success rates, some with 5-year survival rates below 5%. Here we test the hypothesis that metastatic cancer can be genetically targeted by exploiting single base substitution mutations unique to individual cells that occur as part of normal aging prior to transformation. These mutations are targetable because ~10% of them form novel tumor-specific ""NGG"" protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sites targetable by CRISPR-Cas9.Whole genome sequencing was performed on five rapid autopsy cases of patient-matched primary tumor, normal and metastatic tissue from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma decedents. CRISPR-Cas9 PAM targets were determined by bioinformatic tumor-normal subtraction for each patient and verified in metastatic samples by high-depth capture-based sequencing.We found that 90% of PAM targets were maintained between primary carcinomas and metastases overall. We identified rules that predict PAM loss or retention, where PAMs located in heterozygous regions in the primary tumor can be lost in metastases (private LOH), but PAMs occurring in regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in the primary tumor were universally conserved in metastases.Regions of truncal LOH are strongly retained in the presence of genetic instability, and therefore represent genetic vulnerabilities in pancreatic adenocarcinomas. A CRISPR-based gene therapy approach targeting these regions may be a novel way to genetically target metastatic cancer.",2.06145354428613e-49

AKI affects the short-term prognosis of patients and may also induce chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the current treatment options for AKI mainly focus on symptom management. Specific therapeutic measures available for the prevention of transition from AKI to CKD are very limited in number. Histones are basic proteins that intricately bind the DNA in chromosomes. After translation, histones undergo various modifications on their amino-terminal tails, such as methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and lactylation, collectively forming the ""histone code"", which affects the expression of genes mainly by regulating the elastic structure of chromatin or recruiting specific proteins. Extensive research conducted in recent years on histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) has also sparked continuous interest in their association with the AKI-to-CKD transition.

In order to address this need, we assessed the feasibility of using tissue-specific gene expression to determine the origin of extracellular vesicle (EV) mRNAs in peripheral blood. Using the placenta as a model, we discovered that 26 messenger RNAs that are specifically expressed in the placenta are present in EVs circulating in maternal blood. Twenty-three of these transcripts were either exclusively or highly expressed in maternal blood during pregnancy only and not in the postpartum period, verifying the feasibility of using tissue-specific gene expression to infer the tissue of origin for EV mRNAs. Using the same bioinformatic approach, which provides better specificity than isolating L1 cell-adhesion molecule containing EVs, we discovered that 181 mRNAs that are specifically expressed in the female brain are also present in EVs circulating in maternal blood. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that these transcripts, which are involved in synaptic functions and myelination, are enriched for genes implicated in mood disorders, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders. The EV mRNA levels of 13 of these female brain-specific transcripts are associated with postpartum depression (adjusted p-vals = 3 × 10-5to 0.08), raising the possibility that they can be used to infer the state of the brain. In order to determine the extent to which EV mRNAs reflect transcription in the brain, we compared mRNAs isolated from cells and EVs in an iPSC-derived brain microphysiological system differentiated for 3 and 9 weeks. We discovered that, although cellular and extracellular mRNA levels are not identical, they do correlate, and it is possible to extrapolate cellular RNA expression changes in the brain via EV mRNA levels. Our findings bring EV mRNAs to the forefront of peripheral biomarker development efforts in psychiatric diseases by demonstrating the feasibility of inferring transcriptional changes in the brain via blood EV mRNA levels.© 2024.

38272911,"A zinc finger transcription factor enables social behaviors while controlling transposable elements and immune response in prefrontal cortex.","Transl Psychiatry","The neurobiological origins of social behaviors are incompletely understood. Here we utilized synthetic biology approaches to reprogram the function of ZFP189, a transcription factor whose expression and function in rodent prefrontal cortex was previously demonstrated to be protective against stress-induced social deficits. We created novel synthetic ZFP189 transcription factors including ZFP189VPR, which activates the transcription of target genes and therefore exerts opposite functional control from the endogenous, transcriptionally repressive ZFP189WT. Following viral delivery of these synthetic ZFP189 transcription factors to mouse prefrontal cortex, we observe that ZFP189-mediated transcriptional control promotes mature dendritic spine morphology on transduced pyramidal neurons. Interestingly, inversion of ZFP189-mediated transcription in this brain area, achieved by viral delivery of synthetic ZFP189VPR, precipitates social behavioral deficits in terms of social interaction, motivation, and the cognition necessary for the maintenance of social hierarchy, without other observable behavioral deficits. RNA sequencing of virally manipulated prefrontal cortex tissues reveals that ZFP189 transcription factors of opposing regulatory function (ZFP189WTversus ZFP189VPR) have opposite influence on the expression of genetic transposable elements as well as genes that participate in adaptive immune functions. Collectively, this work reveals that ZFP189 function in the prefrontal cortex coordinates structural and transcriptional neuroadaptations necessary for complex social behaviors while regulating transposable element-rich regions of DNA and the expression of immune-related genes. Given the evidence for a co-evolution of social behavior and the brain immune response, we posit that ZFP189 may have evolved to augment brain transposon-associated immune function as a way of enhancing an animal's capacity for functioning in social groups.© 2024.

Preclinical models available for understanding the disease pathophysiology have evolved significantly in recent years. Traditionally, commercially available 2-dimensional cell lines were developed to investigate mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance. However, these cells grow as monolayer cultures that lack heterogeneity and do not effectively represent tumor biology. Developing patient-derived xenografts and genetically engineered mouse models led to increased cellular heterogeneity, molecular diversity, and tissues that histologically represent the original patient tumors. However, these models are relatively expensive and very timing consuming. More recently, the advancement of fast and inexpensive in vitro models that better mimic disease conditions in vivo are on the rise. Three-dimensional cultures like organoids and spheroids have gained popularity and are considered to recapitulate complex disease characteristics. In addition, computational genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomic models are being developed to simulate pancreatic cancer progression and predict better treatment strategies. Herein, we review the challenges associated with pancreatic cancer research and available analytical models. We suggest that an integrated approach toward using these models may allow for developing new strategies for pancreatic cancer precision medicine.Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

38297314,"Malignant peritoneal mesotheliomas of rats induced by multiwalled carbon nanotubes and amosite asbestos: transcriptome and epigenetic profiles.","Part Fibre Toxicol","Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer that often originates in the pleural and peritoneal mesothelium. Exposure to asbestos is a frequent cause. However, studies in rodents have shown that certain multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) can also induce malignant mesothelioma. The exact mechanisms are still unclear. To gain further insights into molecular pathways leading to carcinogenesis, we analyzed tumors in Wistar rats induced by intraperitoneal application of MWCNTs and amosite asbestos. Using transcriptomic and epigenetic approaches, we compared the tumors by inducer (MWCNTs or amosite asbestos) or by tumor type (sarcomatoid, epithelioid, or biphasic).Genome-wide transcriptome datasets, whether grouped by inducer or tumor type, showed a high number of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) relative to control peritoneal tissues. Bioinformatic evaluations using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that while the transcriptome datasets shared commonalities, they also showed differences in DEGs, regulated canonical pathways, and affected molecular functions. In all datasets, among highly- scoring predicted canonical pathways were Phagosome Formation, IL8 Signaling, Integrin Signaling, RAC Signaling, and TREM1 Signaling. Top-scoring activated molecular functions included cell movement, invasion of cells, migration of cells, cell transformation, and metastasis. Notably, we found many genes associated with malignant mesothelioma in humans, which showed similar expression changes in the rat tumor transcriptome datasets. Furthermore, RT-qPCR revealed downregulation of Hrasls, Nr4a1, Fgfr4, and Ret or upregulation of Rnd3 and Gadd45b in all or most of the 36 tumors analyzed. Bisulfite sequencing of Hrasls, Nr4a1, Fgfr4, and Ret revealed heterogeneity in DNA methylation of promoter regions. However, higher methylation percentages were observed in some tumors compared to control tissues. Lastly, global 5mC DNA, m6A RNA and 5mC RNA methylation levels were also higher in tumors than in control tissues.Our findings may help better understand how exposure to MWCNTs can lead to carcinogenesis. This information is valuable for risk assessment and in the development of safe-by-design strategies.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.63957428113389e-50
38406555,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in MYBPC3 carriers in aging.","J Cardiovasc Aging","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by abnormal thickening of the myocardium, leading to arrhythmias, heart failure, and elevated risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly among the young. This inherited disease is predominantly caused by mutations in sarcomeric genes, among which those in the cardiac myosin binding protein-C3 (MYBPC3) gene are major contributors. HCM associated withMYBPC3mutations usually presents in the elderly and ranges from asymptomatic to symptomatic forms, affecting numerous cardiac functions and presenting significant health risks with a spectrum of clinical manifestations. Regulation ofMYBPC3expression involves various transcriptional and translational mechanisms, yet the destiny of mutantMYBPC3mRNA and protein in late-onset HCM remains unclear. Pathogenesis related toMYBPC3mutations includes nonsense-mediated decay, alternative splicing, and ubiquitin-proteasome system events, leading to allelic imbalance and haploinsufficiency. Aging further exacerbates the severity of HCM in carriers ofMYBPC3mutations. Advancements in high-throughput omics techniques have identified crucial molecular events and regulatory disruptions in cardiomyocytes expressingMYBPC3variants. This review assesses the pathogenic mechanisms that promote late-onset HCM through the lens of transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational modulation ofMYBPC3, underscoring its significance in HCM across carriers. The review also evaluates the influence of aging on these processes andMYBPC3levels during HCM pathogenesis in the elderly. While pinpointing targets for novel medical interventions to conserve cardiac function remains challenging, the emergence of personalized omics offers promising avenues for future HCM treatments, particularly for late-onset cases.",2.76658316518714e-50

Our study aims to explore the influence of Dnmt3b ablation in Gli1-positive stem cells in fracture healing mice and the underlying mechanism.We generated Gli1-CreERT2; Dnmt3bflox/flox (Dnmt3bGli1ER) mice to operated tibia fracture. Fracture callus tissues of Dnmt3bGli1ERmice and control mice were collected and analyzed by X-ray, micro-CT, biomechanical testing, histopathology and TUNEL assay.The cartilaginous callus significantly decrease in ablation of Dnmt3b in Gli1-positive stem cells during fracture repair. The chondrogenic and osteogenic indicators (Sox9 and Runx2) in the fracture healing tissues in Dnmt3bGli1ERmice much less than control mice. Dnmt3bGli1ERmice led to delayed bone callus remodeling and decreased biomechanical properties of the newly formed bone during fracture repair. Both the expressions of Caspase-3 and Caspase-8 were upregulated in Dnmt3bGli1ERmice as well as the expressions of BCL-2.Our study provides an evidence that Dnmt3b ablation Gli1-positive stem cells can affect fracture healing and lead to poor fracture healing by regulating apoptosis to decrease chondrocyte hypertrophic maturation.© 2024.

38409176,"Deciphering cancer cell state plasticity with single-cell genomics and artificial intelligence.","Genome Med","Cancer stem cell plasticity refers to the ability of tumour cells to dynamically switch between states-for example, from cancer stem cells to non-cancer stem cell states. Governed by regulatory processes, cells transition through a continuum, with this transition space often referred to as a cell state landscape. Plasticity in cancer cell states leads to divergent biological behaviours, with certain cell states, or state transitions, responsible for tumour progression and therapeutic response. The advent of single-cell assays means these features can now be measured for individual cancer cells and at scale. However, the high dimensionality of this data, complex relationships between genomic features, and a lack of precise knowledge of the genomic profiles defining cancer cell states have opened the door for artificial intelligence methods for depicting cancer cell state landscapes. The contribution of cell state plasticity to cancer phenotypes such as treatment resistance, metastasis, and dormancy has been masked by analysis of 'bulk' genomic data-constituted of the average signal from millions of cells. Single-cell technologies solve this problem by producing a high-dimensional cellular landscape of the tumour ecosystem, quantifying the genomic profiles of individual cells, and creating a more detailed model to investigate cancer plasticity (Genome Res 31:1719, 2021; Semin Cancer Biol 53: 48-58, 2018; Signal Transduct Target Ther 5:1-36, 2020). In conjunction, rapid development in artificial intelligence methods has led to numerous tools that can be employed to study cancer cell plasticity.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.49221588598537e-50
38188362,"Identification of prognostic risk score of disulfidptosis-related genes and molecular subtypes in glioma.","Biochem Biophys Rep","Programmed cell death is closely related to glioma. As a novel kind of cell death, the mechanism of disulfidptosis in glioma remains unclear. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the role of disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in glioma.We first investigated the genetic and transcriptional alterations of 15 DRGs. Two consensus cluster analyses were used to evaluate the association between DRGs and glioma subtypes. In addition, we constructed prognostic DRG risk scores to predict overall survival (OS) in glioma patients. Furthermore, we developed a nomogram to enhance the clinical utility of the DRG risk score. Finally, the expression levels of DRGs were verified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining.Most DRGs (14/15) were dysregulated in gliomas. The 15 DRGs were rarely mutated in gliomas, and only 50 of 987 samples (5.07 %) showed gene mutations. However, most of them had copy number variation (CNV) deletions or amplifications. Two distinct molecular subtypes were identified by cluster analysis, and DRG alterations were found to be related to the clinical characteristics, prognosis, and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). The DRG risk score model based on 12 genes was developed and showed good performance in predicting OS. The nomogram confirmed that the risk score had a particularly strong influence on the prognosis of glioma. Furthermore, we discovered that low DRG scores, low tumor mutation burden, and immunosuppression were features of patients with better prognoses.The DRG risk model can be used for the evaluation of clinical characteristics, prognosis prediction, and TIME estimation of glioma patients. These DRGs may be potential therapeutic targets in glioma.© 2023 The Authors.",2.08222063862866e-50
38360609,"Dissecting the sequence and structural determinants guiding m6A deposition and evolution via inter- and intra-species hybrids.","Genome Biol","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant mRNA modification, and controls mRNA stability. m6A distribution varies considerably between and within species. Yet, it is unclear to what extent this variability is driven by changes in genetic sequences ('cis') or cellular environments ('trans') and via which mechanisms.Here we dissect the determinants governing RNA methylation via interspecies and intraspecies hybrids in yeast and mammalian systems, coupled with massively parallel reporter assays and m6A-QTL reanalysis. We find that m6A evolution and variability is driven primarily in 'cis', via two mechanisms: (1) variations altering m6A consensus motifs, and (2) variation impacting mRNA secondary structure. We establish that mutations impacting RNA structure - even when distant from an m6A consensus motif - causally dictate methylation propensity. Finally, we demonstrate that allele-specific differences in m6A levels lead to allele-specific changes in gene expression.Our findings define the determinants governing m6A evolution and diversity and characterize the consequences thereof on gene expression regulation.© 2024.

38370553,"A conceptual framework for understanding stress-induced physiological and transgenerational effects on population responses to climate change.","Evol Lett","Organisms are experiencing higher average temperatures and greater temperature variability because of anthropogenic climate change. Some populations respond to changes in temperature by shifting their ranges or adjusting their phenotypes via plasticity and/or evolution, while others go extinct. Predicting how populations will respond to temperature changes is challenging because extreme and unpredictable climate changes will exert novel selective pressures. For this reason, there is a need to understand the physiological mechanisms that regulate organismal responses to temperature changes. In vertebrates, glucocorticoid hormones mediate physiological and behavioral responses to environmental stressors and thus are likely to play an important role in how vertebrates respond to global temperature changes. Glucocorticoids have cascading effects that influence the phenotype and fitness of individuals, and some of these effects can be transmitted to offspring via trans- or intergenerational effects. Consequently, glucocorticoid-mediated responses could affect populations and could even be a powerful driver of rapid evolutionary change. Here, we present a conceptual framework that outlines how temperature changes due to global climate change could affect population persistence via glucocorticoid responses within and across generations (via epigenetic modifications). We briefly review glucocorticoid physiology, the interactions between environmental temperatures and glucocorticoid responses, and the phenotypic consequences of glucocorticoid responses within and across generations. We then discuss possible hypotheses for how glucocorticoid-mediated phenotypic effects might impact fitness and population persistence via evolutionary change. Finally, we pose pressing questions to guide future research. Understanding the physiological mechanisms that underpin the responses of vertebrates to elevated temperatures will help predict population-level responses to the changing climates we are experiencing.© The Author(s) 2023.

38264122,"Characterization of prevalent tyrosine kinase inhibitors and their challenges in glioblastoma treatment.","Front Chem","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive malignant primary tumor in the central nervous system. Despite extensive efforts in radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and neurosurgery, there remains an inadequate level of improvement in treatment outcomes. The development of large-scale genomic and proteomic analysis suggests that GBMs are characterized by transcriptional heterogeneity, which is responsible for therapy resistance. Hence, knowledge about the genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity of GBM is crucial for developing effective treatments for this aggressive form of brain cancer. Tyrosine kinases (TKs) can act as signal transducers, regulate important cellular processes like differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism. Therefore, TK inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed to specifically target these kinases. TKIs are categorized into allosteric and non-allosteric inhibitors. Irreversible inhibitors form covalent bonds, which can lead to longer-lasting effects. However, this can also increase the risk of off-target effects and toxicity. The development of TKIs as therapeutics through computer-aided drug design (CADD) and bioinformatic techniques enhance the potential to improve patients' survival rates. Therefore, the continued exploration of TKIs as drug targets is expected to lead to even more effective and specific therapeutics in the future.Copyright © 2024 Rahban, Joushi, Bashiri, Saso and Sheibani.",1.63876964138196e-50
38225226,"Increased iron uptake by splenic hematopoietic stem cells promotes TET2-dependent erythroid regeneration.","Nat Commun","Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are capable of regenerating the blood system, but the instructive cues that direct HSCs to regenerate particular lineages lost to the injury remain elusive. Here, we show that iron is increasingly taken up by HSCs during anemia and induces erythroid gene expression and regeneration in a Tet2-dependent manner. Lineage tracing of HSCs reveals that HSCs respond to hemolytic anemia by increasing erythroid output. The number of HSCs in the spleen, but not bone marrow, increases upon anemia and these HSCs exhibit enhanced proliferation, erythroid differentiation, iron uptake, and TET2 protein expression. Increased iron in HSCs promotes DNA demethylation and expression of erythroid genes. Suppressing iron uptake or TET2 expression impairs erythroid genes expression and erythroid differentiation of HSCs; iron supplementation, however, augments these processes. These results establish that the physiological level of iron taken up by HSCs has an instructive role in promoting erythroid-biased differentiation of HSCs.© 2024.

Anoikis is a programmed cell death process associated with cancer. However, the correlation between anoikis-related genes and the tumor microenvironment (TME) features and immunotherapeutic outcome in NSCLC has not been fully explored.Methods:The bulk and single-cell transcriptome data of NSCLC were downloaded from TCGA and GEO databases. The distribution of anoikis-related genes on different cell types at the single-cell level was analyzed, and these genes specifically expressed by tumor cells and immunotherapy-related were further extracted. Next, the candidate gene CTNND1 was identified and its correlations with the TME features and immunotherapeutic outcome in NSCLC were explored in multiple public cohorts. Finally, an in-house cohort was used to determine the CTNND1 expression and immuno-correlation in NSCLC.Results:At single-cell atlas, we found that anoikis-related genes expressed specifically in tumor cells of NSCLC. By intersecting anoikis-related genes, immunotherapy-associated genes, and the genes expressed in tumor cells, we obtained a special biomarker CTNND1. In addition, cell-cell communication analysis revealed that CTNND1+ tumor cells communicated with immune subpopulations frequently. Moreover, we found that high expression of CTNND1 was related to immuno-suppressive status of NSCLC. The expression of CTNND1 and its immuno-correlation were also validated, and the results showed that CTNND1 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and tumors with high CTNND1 expression accompanied with low CD8+ T cells infiltration.Conclusions:Overall, our study reported that CTNND1 can be considered as a novel biomarker for the predication of immunotherapeutic responses and a potential target for NSCLC therapy.© The author(s).",5.7844875028604e-51

Treatment options are limited and there is an urgent need to develop models to further research. In the present study, we established two CPC cell lines and performed multi-omics analyses. These cell lines serve as valuable models to propose new treatments in these rare but deadly brain tumors.Multi-omic profiling including, (i) methylation array (EPIC 850 K), (ii) whole genome sequencing (WGS), (iii) CANCERPLEX cancer genome panel testing, (iv) RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and (v) proteomics analyses were performed in CCHE-45 and NGT131 cell lines.Both cell lines were classified as methylation class B. Both harbored pathogenic TP53 point mutations; CCHE-45 additionally displayed TP53 loss. Furthermore, alterations of the NOTCH and WNT pathways were also detected in both cell lines. Two protein-coding gene fusions, BZW2-URGCP, and CTTNBP2-ERBB4, mutations of two oncodrivers, GBP-4 and KRTAP-12-2, and several copy number alterations were observed in CCHE-45, but not NGT131. Transcriptome and proteome analysis identified shared and unique signatures, suggesting that variability in choroid plexus carcinoma tumors may exist. The discovered difference's importance and implications highlight the possible diversity of choroid plexus carcinoma and call for additional research to fully understand disease pathogenesis.Multi-omics analyses revealed that the two choroid plexus carcinoma cell lines shared TP53 mutations and other common pathway alterations and activation of NOTCH and WNT pathways. Noticeable differences were also observed. These cell lines can serve as valuable models to propose new treatments in these rare but deadly brain tumors.© 2024.

Piperazine ferulate (PF) has anti-platelet and anti-fibrotic effects, and its mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the protective effect of PF against CKD in rats and to determine its mechanism of action. Network pharmacology was used to predict potential PF action targets in the treatment of CKD and to further validate them. A rat model of CKD was established; blood was collected, etc., for the assessment of the renal function; renal pathologic damage was examined using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Masson staining; changes in the levels of TGF-β1 and α-SMA were determined with ELISA; EPOR, FN, and COL I expression were detected utilizing immunohistochemistry; and HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and EPO protein molecules were analyzed deploying western blotting. PF reduces Scr, BUN, and 24 h UP levels; decreases FN and COL I expression; and attenuates renal injury. Additionally, PF inhibited TGF-β1 and stimulated the production of HIF-1α and HIF-2α, which downregulated α-SMA and upregulated EPO. PF attenuated the progression of the CKD pathology, and the mechanism of its action is possibly associated with the promotion of HIF-1α/HIF-2α/EPO production and TGF-β1 reduction.© 2024.

We aimed to explore the causal impact of genetic immune dysregulation on the risk of PE or PE with FGR and to elucidate the role of specific transcriptomes in mediating this relationship.A two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to explore the link between immune dysregulation and PE or PE with FGR, as well as to identify potential inflammatory biomarkers that act as mediators. GWAS summary data for outcomes were obtained from the FinnGen dataset. The analyses encompassed five systemic immune-associated diseases, four chronic genital inflammatory diseases, and thirty-one inflammatory biomarkers. Summary-data-based MR (SMR) and HEIDI analysis were conducted to test whether the effect size of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on outcomes was mediated by the expression of immune-associated genes.The primary univariable analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with the risk of PE or PE with FGR. Surprisingly, a counterintuitive finding showed a significant negative association between endometriosis of pelvic peritoneum (EMoP) and the risk of PE with FGR. None of the inflammatory factors had a causal relationship with PE or PE with FGR. However, there was a significant association between lymphocyte count and the risk of PE with FGR. Within the lymphocyte subset, both the proportion of Natural Killer (NK) cells and absolute counts of naïve CD4+T cells demonstrated significant effects on the risk of PE with FGR. Two-step MR analysis underscored the genetically predicted lymphocyte count as a significant mediator between T1D and PE with FGR. Additionally, SMR analysis indicated the potential involvement of SH2B3 in the occurrence of PE with FGR.Our findings provided substantial evidence of the underlying causal relationship between immune dysregulation and PE or PE with FGR and some of these diseases proved to accelerate immune cells disorders and then contribute to the risk of incident PE or PE with FGR.© 2023 The Authors.

38352568,"Decoding the Epigenetics and Chromatin Loop Dynamics of Androgen Receptor-Mediated Transcription.","Res Sq","Androgen receptor (AR)-mediated transcription plays a critical role in normal prostate development and prostate cancer growth. AR drives gene expression by binding to thousands of cis-regulatory elements (CRE) that loop to hundreds of target promoters. With multiple CREs interacting with a single promoter, it remains unclear how individual AR bound CREs contribute to gene expression. To characterize the involvement of these CREs, we investigated the AR-driven epigenetic and chromosomal chromatin looping changes. We collected a kinetic multi-omic dataset comprised of steady-state mRNA, chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, histone modifications, chromatin looping, and nascent RNA. Using an integrated regulatory network, we found that AR binding induces sequential changes in the epigenetic features at CREs, independent of gene expression. Further, we showed that binding of AR does not result in a substantial rewiring of chromatin loops, but instead increases the contact frequency of pre-existing loops to target promoters. Our results show that gene expression strongly correlates to the changes in contact frequency. We then proposed and experimentally validated an unbalanced multi-enhancer model where the impact on gene expression of AR-bound enhancers is heterogeneous, and is proportional to their contact frequency with target gene promoters. Overall, these findings provide new insight into AR-mediated gene expression upon acute androgen simulation and develop a mechanistic framework to investigate nuclear receptor mediated perturbations.",2.34677166773938e-51

Drugs of abuse can activate intracellular signaling cascades that engender long-term molecular changes to brain reward circuitry, which can promote further drug use. However, gaps remain about how the activity of these signaling pathways, such as ERK1/2 signaling, can affect cocaine-induced neurochemical plasticity and cocaine-associated behaviors specifically within dopaminergic cells. To enable specific modulation of ERK1/2 signaling in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area, we utilize a viral construct that Cre dependently expresses Map kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3) to reduce the activity of ERK1/2, in combination with transgenic rats that express Cre in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells. Following viral transfection, we found an increase in the surface expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT), a protein associated with the regulation of dopamine signaling, dopamine transmission, and cocaine-associated behavior. We found that inactivation of ERK1/2 reduced post-translational phosphorylation of the DAT, attenuated the ability of cocaine to inhibit the DAT, and decreased motivation for cocaine without affecting associative learning as tested by conditioned place preference. Together, these results indicate that ERK1/2 signaling plays a critical role in shaping the dopamine response to cocaine and may provide additional insights into the function of dopaminergic neurons. Further, these findings lay important groundwork toward the assessment of how signaling pathways and their downstream effectors influence dopamine transmission and could ultimately provide therapeutic targets for treating cocaine use disorders.Copyright © 2024 the authors.",7.6279301484721e-52

DNA methylation profiling has become highly relevant in the diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) tumors including gliomas, and it has been incorporated into routine clinical diagnostics in some countries. In this study, we, therefore, examined the value of DNA methylation-based classification for prognostication of patients with IDH-mutant astrocytomas. We analyzed histopathological diagnoses, genome-wide DNA methylation array data, and chromosomal copy number alteration profiles from a cohort of 385 adult-type IDH-mutant astrocytomas, including a local cohort of 127 cases and 258 cases from public repositories. Prognosis based on WHO 2021 CNS criteria (histological grade and CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion status), other relevant chromosomal/gene alterations in IDH-mutant astrocytomas and DNA methylation-based subclassification according to the molecular neuropathology classifier were assessed. We demonstrate that DNA methylation-based classification of IDH-mutant astrocytomas can be used to predict outcome of the patients equally well as WHO 2021 CNS criteria. In addition, methylation-based subclassification enabled the identification of IDH-mutant astrocytoma patients with poor survival among patients with grade 3 tumors and patients with grade 4 tumors with a more favorable outcome. In conclusion, DNA methylation-based subclassification adds prognostic information for IDH-mutant astrocytomas that can further refine the current WHO 2021 grading scheme for these patients.© 2024 The Authors.

BMRGs of BRCA were selected from previous literature. Differences among BRCA molecular subtypes were compared using R 'limma' package. The impact of BM-related differentially expressed genes (BM_DEGs) on BRCA patients' outcomes was explored with a risk score model, after which the relationship between these risk scores and immune cell infiltration was examined. Risk scores were also used to judge the predicted efficacy of immunotherapeutic interventions. The utility of risk scores in combination with clinicopathological characteristics was evaluated as a predictor of patient's survival through univariate and multivariate analyses.The R limma package was used to explore differential gene expression, after which 12 BM_DEGs were incorporated into a risk scoring model. The resultant risk scores were able to predict immunotherapeutic treatment efficacy. In addition, a nomogram incorporating risk scores, stage, and age was established. The nomogram was able to reliably predict the overall survival (OS) of BRCA patients, yielding predictive outcomes that aligned well with actual observations.In summary, a predictive clinical model for BRCA patients was successfully established in this study, providing a valuable tool that may be particularly helpful for the assessment of patients facing a risk of BM development.2023 Translational Cancer Research.

Under heat stress (HS), the reduction of Sertoli cells (SCs) inhibits energy transport and nutrient supply to germ cells, leading to spermatogenesis failure. DNA methylation of genes is a central epigenetic regulatory mechanism in mammalian reproduction. However, it remains unclear how DNA methylation regulates gene expression in heat-stressed SCs. In this study, we investigated whether the decrease in SC levels during HS could be related to epigenetic DNA modifications. The cells exposed to HS showed changes in differential methylation cytosines and regions (DMCs/DMRs) and differential expression genes (DEGs), but not in global DNA methylations. One of the most important biological processes affected by HS is cell apoptosis induced by the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway (GO: 2,001,244, P < 0.05) by enrichment in the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The joint analysis showed that several gene expressions in RNA-seq and WGBS overlapped and the shortlisted genes BAX, HSPH1, HSF1B, and BAG were strongly correlated with stress response and apoptosis. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and flow cytometry (FCM) analyzes showed that reduced promoter methylation and enhanced gene expression of BAX with a consequence of apoptosis. The activity of BAX, as well as an increase in its expression, is likely to result in a reduction of SCs population which could further impair ATP supply and adversely affect membrane integrity.

The apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide like (APOBEC) enzyme that induces mutations during DNA replication has been identified here and we identified a replicative asymmetry, which was dominated by C > A mutations in left-replicating. Strand bias in different mutation classes at transcription factor binding sites and enhancer regions were also confirmed, which implies the important role of non-coding regulatory elements in the occurrence of mutations. This work systematically describes mutational strand asymmetries in specific genomic regions, shedding light on the DNA damage and repair mechanisms underlying somatic mutations in cohorts of GACA patients with gastric cancer.© 2023 The Authors.",1.99630561592793e-52
38352550,"Investigating low frequency somatic mutations in Arabidopsis with Duplex Sequencing.","bioRxiv","Mutations are the source of novel genetic diversity but can also lead to disease and maladaptation. The conventional view is that mutations occur randomly with respect to their environment-specific fitness consequences. However, intragenomic mutation rates can vary dramatically due to transcription coupled repair and based on local epigenomic modifications, which are non-uniformly distributed across genomes. One sequence feature associated with decreased mutation is higher expression level, which can vary depending on environmental cues. To understand whether the association between expression level and mutation rate creates a systematic relationship with environment-specific fitness effects, we perturbed expression through a heat treatment inArabidopsis thaliana. We quantified gene expression to identify differentially expressed genes, which we then targeted for mutation detection using Duplex Sequencing. This approach provided a highly accurate measurement of the frequency of rare somatic mutations in vegetative plant tissues, which has been a recent source of uncertainty in plant mutation research. We included mutant lines lacking mismatch repair (MMR) and base excision repair (BER) capabilities to understand how repair mechanisms may drive biased mutation accumulation. We found wild type (WT) and BER mutant mutation frequencies to be very low (mean variant frequency 1.8×10-8and 2.6×10-8, respectively), while MMR mutant frequencies were significantly elevated (1.13×10-6). These results show that somatic variant frequencies are extremely low in WT plants, indicating that larger datasets will be needed to address the fundamental evolutionary question as to whether environmental change leads to gene-specific changes in mutation rate.",1.32555842530132e-52
38201971,NA,NA,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy that, despite recent advances in therapy, continues to pose a major challenge to hematologists. Currently, different classes of drugs are applied to treat MM, among others, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and monoclonal antibodies. Most of them participate in an interplay with the immune system, hijacking its effector functions and redirecting them to anti-MM activity. Therefore, adjuvant therapies boosting the immune system may be potentially beneficial in MM therapy. Vitamin D (VD) and vitamin K (VK) have multiple so called ""non-classical"" actions. They exhibit various anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. In this paper, we investigated the influence of VD and VK on epigenetic alterations associated with the proliferative potential of MM cells and the development of BTZ resistance. Our results showed that the development of BTZ resistance is associated with a global decrease in DNA methylation. On the contrary, both control MM cells and BTZ-resistant MM cells exposed to VD alone and to the combination of VD and VK exhibit a global increase in methylation. In conclusion, VD and VK in vitro have the potential to induce epigenetic changes that reduce the proliferative potential of plasma cells and may at least partially prevent the development of resistance to BTZ. However, further ex vivo and in vivo studies are needed to confirm the results and introduce new supplementation recommendations as part of adjuvant therapy.",6.83556522568951e-53

Moreover, RM takes advantage of the body's innate ability to repair and replace pathologically affected tissues. On the other hand, despite its immense promise, RM faces challenges such as ethical concerns, host-related immune responses, and the need for additional scientific validation, among others. The primary aim of this review is to present a high-level overview of current strategies in the domain of RM (cell therapy, exosomes, scaffolds, in vivo reprogramming, organoids, and interspecies chimerism), centering around the field of ophthalmology. A search conducted on clinicaltrials.gov unveiled a total of at least 209 interventional trials related to RM within the ophthalmological field. Among these trials, there were numerous early-phase studies, including phase I, I/II, II, II/III, and III trials. Many of these studies demonstrate potential in addressing previously challenging and degenerative eye conditions, spanning from posterior segment pathologies like Age-related Macular Degeneration and Retinitis Pigmentosa to anterior structure diseases such as Dry Eye Disease and Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency. Notably, these therapeutic approaches offer tailored solutions specific to the underlying causes of each pathology, thus allowing for the hopeful possibility of bringing forth a treatment for ocular diseases that previously seemed incurable and significantly enhancing patients' quality of life.

The identification of novel markers is urgent for AML. Cytohesins are a subfamily of guanine nucleotide exchange factors activating the ADP-ribosylation factor family GTPases. While the important roles of cytohesins have been reported in various cancers, their function in AML remains unclear. The present study aimed to explore the prognostic impact of cytohesin-4 (CYTH4) and the underlying molecular functions. RNA sequencing and AML clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases to investigate gene expression and survival. Using the R software, differentially expressed genes were identified between the high- and the low-CYTH4 group. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted by Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses. The CIBERSORTx tool was used to explore the proportions of different immune cell types. The molecular function of CYTH4 was also validatedin vitroby examining cell growth, cell cycle, apoptosis and colony-forming ability. CYTH4 was significantly upregulated in AML compared with other cancers and normal tissues. High CYTH4 expression was associated with high white blood count (P=0.004) and higher risk status (P<0.001). Patients with high CYTH4 expression had poor overall survival (OS; HR=2.19; 95% CI, 1.40-3.44; P=0.0006; high vs. low) and event-free survival (EFS; HR=2.32; 95% CI, 1.43-3.75; P=0.0006; high vs. low), and these patients could benefit from transplantation (HR=0.29; 95% CI, 0.18-0.47; P<0.0001; transplantation vs. chemotherapy). Multivariate analysis showed that high CYTH4 expression was independently associated with inferior OS (HR=2.49; 95% CI, 1.28-4.83; P=0.007) and EFS (HR=2.56; 95% CI, 1.48-4.42; P=0.001). Functional analysis showed that CYTH4 was involved in immunoregulation.In vitrovalidation showed knockdown of CYTH4 adversely affected cell growth and induced cell apoptosis, while overexpression of CYTH4 enhanced cell growth. Taken together, CYTH4 is expressed at high levels in AML and can potentially function as a prognostic biomarker.Copyright: © Wang et al.",2.14526738900508e-53

The aim of this study is to analyze the characteristics of neurotoxic astrocytes and identify novel molecular targets for slowing down the progression of AD. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) data were analyzed from various AD cohorts comprising about 210,654 cells from 53 brain tissue. By integrating snRNA-seq data with bulk RNA-seq data, crucial astrocyte types and genes associated with the prognosis of patients with AD were identified. The expression of neurotoxic astrocyte markers was validated using 5 × FAD and wild-type (WT) mouse models, combined with experiments such as western blot, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and immunofluorescence. A group of neurotoxic astrocytes closely related to AD pathology was identified, which were involved in inflammatory responses and pathways related to neuron survival. Combining snRNA and bulk tissue data, ZEP36L, AEBP1, WWTR1, PHYHD1, DST and RASL12 were identified as toxic astrocyte markers closely related to disease severity, significantly elevated in brain tissues of 5 × FAD mice and primary astrocytes treated with Aβ. Among them, WWTR1 was significantly increased in astrocytes of 5 × FAD mice, driving astrocyte inflammatory responses, and has been identified as an important marker of neurotoxic astrocytes. snRNA-seq analysis reveals the biological functions of neurotoxic astrocytes.

By modulating various aspects of the RNA life cycle, it has been implicated in a wide range of pathological and physiological processes associated with human diseases. Ischemic stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide with few treatment options and a narrow therapeutic window, and accumulating evidence has indicated the involvement of m6A modifications in the development and progression of this type of stroke. In this review, which provides insights for the prevention and clinical treatment of stroke, we present an overview of the roles played by m6A modification in ischemic stroke from three main perspectives: (1) the association of m6A modification with established risk factors for stroke, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and heart disease; (2) the roles of m6A modification regulators and their functional regulation in the pathophysiological injury mechanisms of stroke, namely oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and cell death processes; and (3) the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of m6A regulators in the treatment of stroke.© 2024 The Author.",5.17148732452056e-54

We aimed to use methylation regulators to classify patients with gastric adenocarcinoma and build a model to predict prognosis, promoting the application of precision medicine.We obtained RNA sequencing data and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (n=335) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (n=865). Unsupervised consensus clustering was used to identify subtypes of gastric adenocarcinoma. We performed functional enrichment analysis, immune infiltration analysis, drug sensitivity analysis, and molecular feature analysis to determine the clinical application for different subtypes. The univariate Cox regression analysis and the LASSO regression analysis were subsequently used to identify prognosis-related methylation regulators and construct a risk model.Through unsupervised consensus clustering, patients were divided into two subtypes (cluster A and cluster B) with different clinical outcomes. Cluster B included patients with a better prognosis outcome and who were more likely to respond to immunotherapy. We then successfully built a predictive model and found five methylation-related genes (CHAF1A, CPNE8, PHLDA3, SPARC, andEHF) potentially significant to the prognosis of patients. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year areas under the curve of the risk model were 0.712, 0.696, and 0.759, respectively. The risk score was an independent prognostic factor and had the highest concordance index among common clinical indicators. Meanwhile, the tumor microenvironment, sensitivity of chemotherapeutic drugs, molecular features, and oncogenic dedifferentiation differed significantly across the risk groups and subtypes.We classified patients with gastric adenocarcinoma based on methylation regulators, which has positive implications for first-line clinical treatment.

It is important to identify potential risk factors for AF. Members of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family exert a variety of effects on various cell types in the context of the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, and previous population-based studies indicate associations between IGF family members and AF. However, the causal effects of IGF family members in AF have not been evaluated.In the current study two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) was used to assess genetic relationships between IGF family members and AF.MR was performed based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets, and concentration levels of 14 IGF family members were retrieved. An initial MR analysis was conducted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms potentially associated with IGF serum concentrations. A GWAS meta-analysis including 60620 AF cases and 970216 control participants of European ancestry was then conducted to identify AF causal effects. Two-sample MR packages were used to perform MR analysis in R. MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), and inverse variance weighted (IVW) methods were used.In two-sample MR assessments there were lower levels of circulating IGF binding protein 3 in both WM [odds ratio (OR) 0.964, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.940-0.960,P= 0.006] and IVW (OR 0.968, 95%CI: 0.947-0.987,P= 0.001) analyses. Higher serum levels of IGF2 receptor were associated with AF (OR 1.045, 95%CI: 1.016-1.076,P= 0.039). In reverse MR analysis conducted to investigate casual effects, elevated levels of circulating CYR61 were associated with AF (OR 1.060, 95%CI: 1.005-1.119,P= 0.031).The results of the present study provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of AF, and the implications of serum IGF family member concentrations when assessing the risk of AF.

Animal research models are available for a multitude of diseases and conditions affecting the central nervous system (CNS), and large-scale CNS gene expression data exist for many of these. Although there are several models specifically for AD, each recapitulates different aspects of the human disease. In this study we evaluate over 500 animal models to identify those with CNS gene expression patterns matching human AD datasets. Approaches included a hypergeometric based scoring system that rewards congruent gene expression patterns but penalizes discordant gene expression patterns. The top two models identified were APP/PS1 transgenic mice expressing mutant APP and PSEN1, and mice carrying a GFAP mutation that is causative of Alexander disease, a primary disorder of astrocytes in the CNS. The APP/PS1 and GFAP models both matched over 500 genes moving in the same direction as in human AD, and both had elevated GFAP expression and were highly congruent with one another. Also scoring highly were the 5XFAD model (with five mutations in APP and PSEN1) and mice carrying CK-p25, APP, and MAPT mutations. Animals with the APOE3 and 4 mutations combined with traumatic brain injury ranked highly. Bulbectomized rats scored high, suggesting anosmia could be causative of AD-like gene expression. Other matching models included the SOD1G93A strain and knockouts for SNORD116 (Prader-Willi mutation), GRID2, INSM1, XBP1, and CSTB. Many top models demonstrated increased expression of GFAP, and results were similar across multiple human AD datasets. Heatmap and Uniform Manifold Approximation Plot results were consistent with hypergeometric ranking. Finally, some gene manipulation models, including for TYROBP and ATG7, were identified with reversed AD patterns, suggesting possible neuroprotective effects.

The clinical utility of targeting histone H3 lysine trimethylation (H3K27me3) as an epigenetic hallmark has been demonstrated1-7. However, in actual therapeutic settings, the mechanism by which H3K27me3-targeting therapies exert their effects and the response of tumour cells remain unclear. Here we show the potency and mechanisms of action and resistance of the EZH1-EZH2 dual inhibitor valemetostat in clinical trials of patients with adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma. Administration of valemetostat reduced tumour size and demonstrated durable clinical response in aggressive lymphomas with multiple genetic mutations. Integrative single-cell analyses showed that valemetostat abolishes the highly condensed chromatin structure formed by the plastic H3K27me3 and neutralizes multiple gene loci, including tumour suppressor genes. Nevertheless, subsequent long-term treatment encounters the emergence of resistant clones with reconstructed aggregate chromatin that closely resemble the pre-dose state. Acquired mutations at the PRC2-compound interface result in the propagation of clones with increased H3K27me3 expression. In patients free of PRC2 mutations, TET2 mutation or elevated DNMT3A expression causes similar chromatin recondensation through de novo DNA methylation in the H3K27me3-associated regions. We identified subpopulations with distinct metabolic and gene translation characteristics implicated in primary susceptibility until the acquisition of the heritable (epi)mutations. Targeting epigenetic drivers and chromatin homeostasis may provide opportunities for further sustained epigenetic cancer therapies.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.87184852785018e-54

Although ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent lipid peroxidative cell death, has been associated with sepsis-induced ARDS, the specific mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we utilized WGCNA, PPI, friends analysis, and six machine learning techniques (Lasso, SVM, RFB, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and LightGBM) to pinpoint STAT3 as a potential diagnostic marker. A significant increase in monocyte and neutrophil levels was observed in patients with sepsis-induced ARDS, as revealed by immune infiltration analyses, when compared to controls. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between STAT3 expression and the level of infiltration. Single-cell analysis uncovered a notable disparity in B-cell expression between sepsis and sepsis-induced ARDS. Furthermore, in vitro experiments using LPS-treated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and THP1 cells demonstrated a significant increase in STAT3 phosphorylation expression. Additionally, the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation by Stattic effectively prevented LPS-induced ferroptosis in both BEAS-2B and THP1 cells. This indicates that the activation of STAT3 phosphorylation promotes ferroptosis in human bronchial epithelial cells in response to LPS. In summary, this research has discovered and confirmed STAT3 as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis-induced ARDS.© 2024.

The prognosis of the induced gene (TGFBI) in breast cancer was determined through bioinformatics analysis and validated using tissue microarray. The immune infiltrations of breast cancer were determined through ""ESTIMATE"" and ""TIMER"".TGFBI was up-regulated by TGFβ treatment and over-expressed in LM2-4175 cells. Through bioinformatics analysis, we found that higher expression of TGFBI was associated with shorted lung metastasis-free survival, relapse-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival of breast cancer. Moreover, the prognosis of TGFBI was validated in 139 Chinese breast cancer patients. Chinese breast cancer patients with higher TGFBI expression had lower overall survival. Correspondingly, breast cancer patients with higher TGFBI methylation had higher overall survival. TGFBI was correlated with the score of the TGFβ signaling pathway and multiple immune-related signaling pathways in breast cancer.

PRC1 is an E3 ubiquitin (ub) ligase that generates histone H2A ubiquitinated at lysine (K) 119 (H2AK119ub1), whereas PRC2 is a histone methyltransferase that specifically catalyzes tri-methylation of histone H3K27 (H3K27me3). Genome-wide analyses have confirmed that these two key epigenetic marks highly overlap across the genome and contribute to gene repression. We are now beginning to understand the molecular mechanisms that enable PRC1 and PRC2 to identify their target sites in the genome and communicate through feedback mechanisms to create Polycomb chromatin domains. Recently, it has become apparent that PRC1-induced H2AK119ub1 not only serves as a docking site for PRC2 but also affects the dynamics of the H3 tail, both of which enhance PRC2 activity, suggesting that trans-tail communication between H2A and H3 facilitates the formation of the Polycomb chromatin domain.

Relative to other cancer types, the glioma immune microenvironment harbors few infiltrating T cells, but abundant tumor-associated myeloid cells, possibly explaining disappointing responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapies in cohorts of patients with glioblastoma. Notably, unlike most extracranial tumors, STING expression is absent in the malignant compartment of gliomas, likely due to methylation of the STING promoter. Nonetheless, several preclinical studies suggest that inducing cGAS/STING signaling in the glioma immune microenvironment could be therapeutically beneficial, and cGAS/STING signaling has been shown to mediate inflammatory and antitumor effects of other modalities either in use or being developed for glioblastoma therapy, including radiation, tumor-treating fields, and oncolytic virotherapy.

However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR) family plays a role in renal fibrosis; however, the detailed mechanisms have not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the potential role of CXCR7 in mediating renal fibrosis. CXCR7 expression is decreased in unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (UIRI) and unilateral ureteral obstruction mouse models. Furthermore, CXCR7 was specifically expressed primarily in the Lotus Tetragonolobus Lectin-expressing segment of tubules, was slightly expressed in the peanut agglutinin-expressing segment, and was barely expressed in the Dolichos biflorus agglutinin-expressing segment. Administration of pFlag-CXCR7, an overexpression plasmid for CXCR7, significantly inhibited the activation of β-catenin signaling and protected against the progression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and renal fibrosis in a UIRI mouse model. Using cultured HKC-8 cells, we found that CXCR7 significantly downregulated the expression of active β-catenin and fibrosis-related markers, including fibronectin, Collagen I, and α-SMA. Furthermore, CXCR7 significantly attenuated TGF-β1-induced changes in β-catenin signaling, EMT and fibrosis. These results suggest that CXCR7 plays a crucial role in inhibiting the activation of β-catenin signaling and the progression of EMT and renal fibrosis.

We performed the inverse variance weighted, weighted median, and MR-Egger methods to assess causal effects between exposure and outcome in univariate MR analysis. To evaluate their heterogeneity, a series of sensitivity analyses were conducted, including the Cochrane Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-Presso, and leave-one-out analysis. We also applied mediation and multivariate MR analysis to explore the interactions between positive exposures on the same outcome. Additionally, we conducted the SMR, which utilizes instruments within or near relevant genes in blood or brain tissues, to elucidate the causal associations with CSVD markers.ABO Univariate MR of multiple cohorts revealed that the risk of small vessel stroke (SVS) increases with elevated levels of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, OR, 1.23, 95% CI, 1.08-1.39) and interleukin-1 receptor-like 2, (IL-1RL2, OR, 1.29, 95% CI, 1.04-1.61). IL-18 was a potential risk factor for extensive basal ganglia perivascular space burden (BGPVS, OR, 1.02, 95% CI, 1.00-1.05). Moreover, the risk of extensive white matter perivascular space burden (WMPVS) decreased with rising levels of E-selectin (OR, .98, 95% CI, .97-1.00), IL-1RL2 (OR, .97, 95% CI, .95-1.00), IL-3 receptor subunit alpha (IL-3Ra, OR, .98, 95% CI, .97-1.00), and IL-5 receptor subunit alpha (IL-5Ra, OR, .98, 95% CI, .97-1.00). Mediation and multivariate MR analysis indicated that E-selectin and IL-3Ra might interact during the pathogenesis of WMPVS. SMR estimates showed that TRAIL-related IVs rs5030044 and rs2304456 increased the risk of SVS by increasing the expression of gene Kininogen-1 (KNG1) in the cerebral cortex, particularly in the frontal cortex (βsmr = .10, Psmr = .003, FDR = .04). Instruments (rs507666 and rs2519093) related to E-selectin and IL-3Ra could increase the risk of WMPVS by enhancing DNA methylation of the gene ABO in blood tissue (βsmr = .01-.02, Psmr = .001, FDR = .01-.03).According to MR and SMR analysis, higher levels of TRAIL increased the risk of SVS by upregulating gene expression of KNG1 in brain cortex tissues. In addition, protective effects of E-selectin and IL-3a levels on WMPVS were regulated by increased DNA methylation of gene ABO in blood tissue.© 2024 The Authors.

The present study, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects mediated by C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 13 (CTRP13) on renal inflammation and fibrosis in addition to elucidating the underlying mechanism. To meet this aim, a mouse unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-mediated renal dysfunction model was established. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin staining (H&E) staining and immunofluorescence experiments as well as Western blotting and reverse transcription quantitative (RT q) PCR analyses were performed. Recombinant CTRP13 was used to investigate the role of CTRP13 in chronic renal inflammation and fibrosis. A decreased expression level of CTRP13 was identified in the plasma of patients with renal fibrosis and in UUO-model mice. The renal histopathological and functional analyses revealed that CTRP13 could both reverse UUO mediated renal dysfunction and ameliorate the conditions of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and tubular injury. Additionally, CTRP13 was found to inhibit the expression levels of extracellular matrix proteins and proinflammatory mediators. In terms of the underlying mechanism, the protective effects on inflammation and fibrosis of the kidneys of CTRP13-treated mice undergoing UUO were found to be associated with the inactivation of the TGF β/Smad and NF κB p65 signaling pathways. Taken together, these findings have suggested that CTRP13 fulfills a vital role in the progression of obstructive nephropathy, thereby uncovering brand new insights into possible leads for the therapeutic treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD).",2.06218812983867e-55
38314261,"Reduced DNMT1 levels induce cell apoptosis via upregulation of METTL3 in cardiac hypertrophy.","Heliyon","DNA methylation is also involved in the development and progression of cardiac diseases. Although studies have shown that DNA methylation and RNA m6A methylation play an important role in the development of myocardial hypertrophy, whether DNA methylation and RNA m6A methylation have a coordinated role in the development of myocardial hypertrophy and influence each other is still unknown. Here, we found that DNMT1 expression was downregulated in TAC mice and Ang II-treated NRCMs. Moreover, DNMT1 overexpression inhibited Ang II-induced apoptosis of NRCMs. Furthermore, we found that the expression of METTL3 was up-regulated after inhibiting the expression of DNMT1 by a DNMT1 inhibitor or small interfering RNA. In addition, ectopic expression DNMT1 inhibited METTL3 expression in NRCMs. Furthermore, METTL3 expression was elevated in NRCMs treated with Ang II, and suppression of METTL3 inhibited cell apoptosis induced by Ang II in NRCMs.In addition, this study revealed that the DNMT1/METTL3 pathway affected Ang II-induced apoptosis in NRCMs. Finally, this study found that DNMT1, but not METTL3, might directly regulated the ANP and BNP expression. Collectively, our findings revealed the role of the DNMT1/METTL3 pathway in cardiac hypertrophy and provided a novel molecular mechanism describing the physiological and pathological processes.© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",9.40379922207169e-56

Neuroinflammation mediated by microglia and brain-resident macrophages plays a crucial role in AD pathogenesis1-5, though the mechanisms by which age, genes, and other risk factors interact remain largely unknown. Somatic mutations accumulate with age and lead to clonal expansion of many cell types, contributing to cancer and many non-cancer diseases6,7. Here we studied somatic mutation in normal aged and AD brains by three orthogonal methods and in three independent AD cohorts. Analysis of bulk RNA sequencing data from 866 samples from different brain regions revealed significantly higher (~two-fold) overall burdens of somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs) in AD brains compared to age-matched controls. Molecular-barcoded deep (>1000X) gene panel sequencing of 311 prefrontal cortex samples showed enrichment of sSNVs and somatic insertions and deletions (sIndels) in cancer driver genes in AD brain compared to control, with recurrent, and often multiple, mutations in genes implicated in clonal hematopoiesis (CH)8,9. Pathogenic sSNVs were enriched in CSF1R+ microglia of AD brains, and the high proportion of microglia (up to 40%) carrying some sSNVs in cancer driver genes suggests mutation-driven microglial clonal expansion (MiCE). Analysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) from temporal neocortex of 62 additional AD cases and controls exhibited nominally increased mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) associated with CH10,11. Microglia carrying mCA showed upregulated pro-inflammatory genes, resembling the transcriptomic features of disease-associated microglia (DAM) in AD. Our results suggest that somatic driver mutations in microglia are common with normal aging but further enriched in AD brain, driving MiCE with inflammatory and DAM signatures. Our findings provide the first insights into microglial clonal dynamics in AD and identify potential new approaches to AD diagnosis and therapy.",2.87083380231141e-56

Despite this, little is known about the transcriptional responses to stress of astrocytes within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, and their influence on behavioral outcomes.We used whole cell sorting, RNA-sequencing, and bioinformatic analyses to investigate the NAc astrocyte transcriptome in male mice in response to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Immunohistochemistry was used to determine stress-induced changes in astrocytic CREB within the NAc. Finally, astrocytic regulation of depression-like behavior was investigated using viral-mediated manipulation of CREB in combination with CSDS.We found a robust transcriptional response in NAc astrocytes to CSDS in stressed mice, with changes seen in both stress-susceptible and stress-resilient animals. Bioinformatic analysis revealed CREB, a transcription factor widely studied in neurons, as one of the top-predicted upstream regulators of the NAc astrocyte transcriptome, with opposite activation states seen in resilient versus susceptible mice. This bioinformatic result was confirmed at the protein level with immunohistochemistry. Viral overexpression of CREB selectively in NAc astrocytes promoted susceptibility to chronic stress.Together, our data demonstrate that the astrocyte transcriptome responds robustly to CSDS and, for the first time, that transcriptional regulation in astrocytes contributes to depressive-like behaviors. A better understanding of transcriptional regulation in astrocytes may reveal unknown molecular mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.",1.7022548876268e-56
38240887,"miRNAs in pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis.","Clin Exp Metastasis","Small non-coding RNA or microRNA (miRNA) are critical regulators of eukaryotic cells. Dysregulation of miRNA expression and function has been linked to a variety of diseases including cancer. They play a complex role in cancers, having both tumour suppressor and promoter properties. In addition, a single miRNA can be involved in regulating several mRNAs or many miRNAs can regulate a single mRNA, therefore assessing these roles is essential to a better understanding in cancer initiation and development. Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, in part due to the lack of diagnostic tools and limited treatment options. The most common form of pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is characterised by major genetic mutations that drive cancer initiation and progression. The regulation or interaction of miRNAs with these cancer driving mutations suggests a strong link between the two. Understanding this link between miRNA and PDAC progression may give rise to novel treatments or diagnostic tools. This review summarises the role of miRNAs in PDAC, the downstream signalling pathways that they play a role in, how these are being used and studied as therapeutic targets as well as prognostic/diagnostic tools to improve the clinical outcome of PDAC.© 2024.

To gain deeper insights into molecular mechanisms of LUAD, we perform an integrative single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis of 377,574 cells from 117 LUAD patient samples. By linking scRNA-seq data with bulk gene expression data, we identify a cluster of prognostic-related UPP1hightumor cells. These cells, primarily situated at the invasive front of tumors, display a stronger association with the immunosuppressive components in the TME. Our cytokine array analysis reveals that the upregulation of UPP1 in tumor cells leads to the increased release of various immunosuppressive cytokines, with TGF-β1 being particularly prominent. Furthermore, this UPP1 upregulation also elevates the expression of PD-L1 through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which contributes to the suppression of CD8 + T cells. Cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) analysis provides additional evidence of the role of UPP1 in shaping the immunosuppressive nature of the TME. Using patient-derived organoids (PDOs), we discover that UPP1hightumors exhibit relatively increased sensitivity to Bosutinib and Dasatinib. Collectively, our study highlights the immunosuppressive role of UPP1 in LUAD, and these findings may provide insights into the molecular features of LUAD and facilitate the development of personalized treatment strategies.© 2024.

Recent studies have implicated that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) Musashi-2 (MSI2) regulates multiple critical biological metabolic and immunoregulatory functions. However, the precise role of MSI2 in regulating PTMs and tumor immunity in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. Here, we present data indicating that MSI2 potentiates CRC immunopathology in colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) mouse models, cell lines and clinical specimens, specifically via HMGB1-mediated dendritic cell (DC) maturation and migration, further contributes to the infiltration of CD4+and CD8+T cells and inflammatory responses. Under stress conditions, MSI2 can exacerbate the production, nucleocytoplasmic transport and extracellular release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)-HMGB1 in CRC cells. Mechanistically, MSI2 mainly enhances the disulfide HMGB1 production and protein translation via direct binding to nucleotides 1403-1409 in the HMGB1 3' UTR, and interacts with the cytoplasmic acetyltransferase P300 to upregulate its expression, further promoting the acetylation of K29 residue in HMGB1, thus leading to K29-HMGB1 nucleocytoplasmic translocation and extracellular release. Furthermore, blocking HMGB1 activity with glycyrrhizic acid (Gly) attenuates MSI2-mediated immunopathology and immune infiltration in CRC in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, this study suggests that MSI2 may ﻿improve the prognosis of CRC patients by reprogramming the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) through HMGB1-mediated PTMs, which ﻿might be a novel therapeutic option for CRC immunotherapy.© 2024.

38187728,"Chloroplast Methyltransferase Homolog RMT2 is Involved in Photosystem I Biogenesis.","bioRxiv","Oxygen (O2), a dominant element in the atmosphere and an essential molecule for most life on Earth, is produced by the photosynthetic oxidation of water. However, metabolic activity can cause the generation of reactive O2species (ROS) that can damage lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and threaten cell viability. To identify and characterize mechanisms that allow cells to cope with the potentially negative effects of O2reactivity, we performed a high-throughput O2sensitivity screen on a genome-wide insertional mutant library of the unicellular algaChlamydomonas reinhardtii. This screen led to the identification of several genes that, when disrupted, alter the cell's sensitivity to O2in the light. One of these genes encodes a protein designated Rubisco methyltransferase 2 (RMT2). Although this protein has homology to methyltransferases, it has not yet been demonstrated to catalyze methyltransferase reactions. Furthermore, thermt2mutant has not been observed to be compromised for the level of Rubisco (first enzyme of Calvin-Benson Cycle; CBC), although the mutant cells were light sensitive, which is reflected by a marked decrease in the level of photosystem I (PSI), with much less of an impact on the other photosynthetic complexes; this mutant also shows upregulation of genes encoding the Ycf3 and Ycf4 proteins, which are associated with the biogenesis of PSI. The RMT2 protein has a chloroplast targeting sequence predicted by PredAlgo and PB-Chlamy1,2, and rescue of the mutant with a wild-type (WT) copy of the gene fused to the mNeonGreen fluorophore indicates that the protein is within the chloroplast and appears to be enriched in/around the pyrenoid (an intrachloroplast compartment, potentially hypoxic, that is found in many algae that contain the CO2-fixing enzyme Rubisco), but we also observe it more dispersed throughout the stroma. These results suggest that RMT2 may serve an important role in the biogenesis of PSI and that PSI biogenesis may be enriched around or within the pyrenoid, which may reflect the impact of O2/reactive O2species on the efficiency with which PSI can assemble.",2.03053787888669e-57

Abnormally expressed TET2 and downstream genes in a high-glucose environment are associated with retinal capillary leakage and neovascularization. Here, we investigated the downstream genes of TET2 and its potential association with neovascularization in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).GSE60436, GSE57362, and GSE158333 datasets were analyzed to identify TET2-related hypomethylated and upregulated genes in PDR. Gene expression and promoter methylation of these genes under high glucose treatment were verified. Moreover, TET2 knockdown was used to assess its impact on tube formation and migration in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs), as well as its influence on downstream genes.Our analysis identified three key genes (PARVB, PTPRE, ECM1) that were closely associated with TET2 regulation. High glucose-treated HRMECs exhibited increased expression of TET2 and ECM1 while decreasing the promoter methylation level of ECM1. Subsequently, TET2 knockdown led to decreased migration ability and tube formation function of HRMECs. We further found a decreased expression of PARVB, PTPRE, and ECM1, accompanied by an increase in the promoter methylation of ECM1.Our findings indicate the involvement of dysregulated TET2 expression in neovascularization by regulating the promoter methylation and transcription of downstream genes (notably ECM1), eventually leading to PDR.

In this Review, we present an inflammatory paradigm for hypertension, emphasizing the crucial roles of immune cells, cytokines and chemokines in disease initiation and progression. T cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells and natural killer cells are all implicated in hypertension. Neoantigens, the NLRP3 inflammasome and increased sympathetic outflow, as well as cytokines (including IL-6, IL-7, IL-15, IL-18 and IL-21) and a high-salt environment, can contribute to immune activation in hypertension. The activated immune cells migrate to target organs such as arteries (especially the perivascular fat and adventitia), kidneys, the heart and the brain, where they release effector cytokines that elevate blood pressure and cause vascular remodelling, renal damage, cardiac hypertrophy, cognitive impairment and dementia. IL-17 secreted by CD4+T helper 17 cells and γδ T cells, and interferon-γ and tumour necrosis factor secreted by immunosenescent CD8+T cells, exert crucial effector roles in hypertension, whereas IL-10 and regulatory T cells are protective. Effector mediators impair nitric oxide bioavailability, leading to endothelial dysfunction and increased vascular contractility. Inflammatory effector mediators also alter renal sodium and water balance and promote renal fibrosis. These mechanisms link hypertension with obesity, autoimmunity, periodontitis and COVID-19. A comprehensive understanding of the immune and inflammatory mechanisms of hypertension is crucial for safely and effectively translating the findings to clinical practice.© 2024.

38234969,"Potential of melatonin to reverse epigenetic aberrations in oral cancer: new findings.","EXCLI J","It is now an accepted principle that epigenetic alterations cause cellular dyshomeostasis and functional changes, both of which are essential for the initiation and completion of the tumor cycle. Oral carcinogenesis is no exception in this regard, as most of the tumors in the different subsites of the oral cavity arise from the cross-reaction between (epi)genetic inheritance and the huge challenge of environmental stressors. Currently, the biochemical machinery is put at the service of the tumor program, halting the cell cycle, triggering uncontrolled proliferation, driving angiogenesis and resistance to apoptosis, until the archetypes of the tumor phenotype are reached. Melatonin has the ability to dynamically affect the epigenetic code. It has become accepted that melatonin can reverse (epi)genetic aberrations present in oral and other cancers, suggesting the possibility of enhancing the oncostatic capacity of standard multimodal treatments by incorporating this indolamine as an adjuvant. First steps in this direction confirm the potential of melatonin as a countermeasure to mitigate the detrimental side effects of conventional first-line radiochemotherapy. This single effect could produce synergies of extraordinary clinical importance, allowing doses to be increased and treatments not to be interrupted, ultimately improving patients' quality of life and prognosis. Motivated by the urgency of improving the medical management of oral cancer, many authors advocate moving fromin vitroand preclinical research, where the bulk of melatonin cancer research is concentrated, to systematic randomized clinical trials on large cohorts. Recognizing the challenge to improve the clinical management of cancer, our motivation is to encourage comprehensive and robust research to reveal the clinical potential of melatonin in oral cancer control. To improve the outcome and quality of life of patients with oral cancer, here we provide the latest evidence of the oncolytic activity that melatonin can achieve by manipulating epigenetic patterns in oronasopharyngeal tissue.Copyright © 2023 Gil-Martín et al.",1.02865977724348e-57

Here, we aimed to explore the role of ENO1 in bladder cancer (BLCA) and then construct a signature to predict the prognosis and treatment response of BLCA. Firstly, we found ENO1 was highly expressed in BLCA tissues, as verified by IHC, and was associated with poor prognosis. The analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment by bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq showed that ENO1 was associated with CD8+ T-cell exhaustion. Additionally, the results in vitro showed that ENO1 could promote the proliferation and invasion of BLCA cells. Then, the analysis of epithelial cells (ECs) revealed that ENO1 might promote BLCA progression by metabolism, the cell cycle and some carcinogenic pathways. A total of 249 hub genes were obtained from differentially expressed genes between ENO1-related ECs, and we used LASSO analysis to construct a novel signature that not only accurately predicted the prognosis of BLCA patients but also predicted the response to treatment for BLCA. Finally, we constructed a nomogram to better guide clinical application. In conclusion, through multi-omics analysis, we found that ENO1 was overexpressed in bladder cancer and associated with poor prognosis, CD8+ T-cell exhaustion and epithelial heterogeneity. Moreover, the prognosis and treatment of patients can be well predicted by constructing an epithelial-related prognostic signature.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.66928097175585e-58
38168374,"TET1 regulates responses to house dust mite by altering chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and gene expression in airway epithelial cells.","Res Sq","Previous studies have identified TET1 as a potential key regulator of genes linked to asthma. TET1 has been shown to transcriptionally respond to house dust mite extract, an allergen known to directly cause allergic asthma development, and regulate the expression of genes involved in asthma. How TET1 regulates expression of these genes, however, is unknown. TET1 is a DNA demethylase; therefore, most prior research on TET1-based gene regulation has focused on how TET1 affects methylation. However, TET1 can also interact directly with transcription factors and histone modifiers to regulate gene expression. Understanding how TET1 regulates expression to contribute to allergic responses and asthma development thus requires a comprehensive approach. To this end, we measured mRNA expression, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and histone modifications in control and TET1 knockdown human bronchial epithelial cells treated or untreated with house dust mite extract.Throughout our analyses, we detected strong similarities between the effects ofTET1knockdown alone and the effects of HDM treatment alone. One especially striking pattern was that bothTET1knockdown and HDM treatment generally led to decreased chromatin accessibility at largely the same genomic loci. Transcription factor enrichment analyses indicated that altered chromatin accessibility following the loss of TET1 may affect, or be affected by, CTCF and CEBP binding. TET1 loss also led to changes in DNA methylation, but these changes were generally in regions where accessibility was not changing.TET1 regulates gene expression through different mechanisms (DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility) in different parts of the genome in the airway epithelial cells, which mediates inflammatory responses to allergen. Collectively, our data suggest novel molecular mechanisms through which TET1 regulates critical pathways following allergen challenges and contributes to the development of asthma.",4.65641925674924e-58

Our preliminary analyses uncovered many nodes representing epigenetic modifiers that are altered in BAT in response to chronic thermogenic activation. Thus, we hypothesized that chronic thermogenic activation broadly alters epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones in BAT. Motivated to understand how BAT function is regulated epigenetically, we developed a novel method for the first-ever unbiased top-down proteomic quantitation of histone modifications in BAT and validated our results with a multi-omic approach. To test our hypothesis, wildtype male C57BL/6J mice were housed under chronic conditions of thermoneutral temperature (TN, 28.8°C), mild cold/room temperature (RT, 22°C), or severe cold (SC, 8°C) and BAT was analyzed for DNA methylation and histone modifications. Methylation of promoters and intragenic regions in genomic DNA decrease in response to chronic cold exposure. Integration of DNA methylation and RNA expression data suggest a role for epigenetic modification of DNA in gene regulation in response to cold. In response to cold housing, we observe increased bulk acetylation of histones H3.2 and H4, increased histone H3.2 proteoforms with di- and trimethylation of lysine 9 (K9me2 and K9me3), and increased histone H4 proteoforms with acetylation of lysine 16 (K16ac) in BAT. Taken together, our results reveal global epigenetically-regulated transcriptional ""on"" and ""off"" signals in murine BAT in response to varying degrees of chronic cold stimuli and establish a novel methodology to quantitatively study histones in BAT, allowing for direct comparisons to decipher mechanistic changes during the thermogenic response.

Many of the ASDs exhibiting varying degrees of autism-like phenotypes have chromosomal anomalies in the Chr15q11-q13 region. Numerous potential candidate genes linked with ASD reside in this chromosomal segment. However, several clinical, in vivo, and in vitro studies selected one gene more frequently than others randomly and unbiasedly. This gene codes for UBE3A or Ubiquitin protein ligase E3A [also known as E6AP ubiquitin-protein ligase (E6AP)], an enzyme involved in the cellular degradation of proteins. This gene has been listed as one of the several genes with a high potential of causing ASD in the Autism Database. The gain of function mutations, triplication, or duplication in the UBE3A gene is also associated with ASDs like Angelman Syndrome (AS) and Dup15q Syndrome. The genetic imprinting of UBE3A in the brain and a preference for neuronal maternal-specific expression are the key features of various ASDs. Since the UBE3A gene is involved in two main important diseases associated with autism-like symptoms, there has been widespread research going on in understanding the link between this gene and autism. Additionally, since no universal methodology or mechanism exists for identifying UBE3A-mediated ASD, it continues to be challenging for neurobiologists, neuroscientists, and clinicians to design therapies or diagnostic tools. In this review, we focus on the structure and functional aspects of the UBE3A protein, discuss the primary relevance of the 15q11-q13 region in the cause of ASDs, and highlight the link between UBE3A and ASD. We try to broaden the knowledge of our readers by elaborating on the possible mechanisms underlying UBE3A-mediated ASDs, emphasizing the usage of UBE3A as a prospective biomarker in the preclinical diagnosis of ASDs and discuss the positive outcomes, advanced developments, and the hurdles in the field of therapeutic strategies against UBE3A-mediated ASDs. This review is novel as it lays a very detailed and comprehensive platform for one of the most important genes associated with diseases showing autistic-like symptoms. Additionally, this review also attempts to lay optimistic feedback on the possible steps for the diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of these UBE3A-mediated ASDs in the upcoming years.",1.82101472989891e-58

However, whether the two compounds have the same or different efficacy against DNA damage is not clear. In the current study, we systematically compared the effects of NMN and NR on cisplatin-induced DNA damage in HeLa cells.To evaluate the protective effects of NMN or NR, HeLa cells were pretreated with different doses of NMN or NR followed with 10 μM of cisplatin treatment. Cell viability was examined by Trypan blue staining assay. For observing the DNA damage repair process, HeLa cells were treated with 10 μM of cisplatin for 12 h, followed with 10 mM NMN or NR treatment for another 8, 16, 24, or 32 h, DNA damage levels were assessed for each time point by immunofluorescent staining against phosphor-H2AX (γH2AX) and alkaline comet assay. The effects of NMN and NR on intracellular NAD+and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were also determined.NMN and NR treatment alone did not have any significant effects on cell viability, however, both can protect HeLa cells from cisplatin-induced decrease of cell viability with similar efficacy in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, while both can reduce the DNA damage levels in cisplatin-treated cells, NR exhibited better protective effect. However, both appeared to boost the DNA damage repair process with similar efficacy. NMN or NR treatment alone could increase cellular NAD+levels, and both can reverse cisplatin-induced decrease of NAD+levels. Finally, while neither NMN nor NR affected cellular ROS levels, both inhibited cisplatin-induced increase of ROS with no significant difference between them.NR have a better protective effect against cisplatin-induced DNA damage than NMN.© 2024 The Authors.",1.78739879978195e-58

Postoperative chemotherapy drug perfusion and chemotherapy are important means for the treatment of BLCA. However, once drug resistance occurs, BLCA develops rapidly after recurrence. BLCA cells rely on unique metabolic rewriting to maintain their growth and proliferation. However, the relationship between the metabolic pattern changes and drug resistance in BLCA is unclear. At present, this problem lacks systematic research. In our research, we identified and analyzed resistance- and metabolism-related differentially expressed genes (RM-DEGs) based on RNA sequencing of a gemcitabine-resistant BLCA cell line and metabolic-related genes (MRGs). Then, we established a drug resistance- and metabolism-related model (RM-RM) through regression analysis to predict the overall survival of BLCA. We also confirmed that RM-RM had a significant correlation with tumor metabolism, gene mutations, tumor microenvironment, and adverse drug reactions. Patients with a high drug resistance- and metabolism-related risk score (RM-RS) showed more active lipid synthesis than those with a low RM-RS.

Further research looked into the relationships between CRHBP and tumor survival prognosis, immune infiltration, immune checkpoint (ICP) indicators, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), mismatch repair (MMR), DNA methylation, tumor microenvironment (TME), and drug responsiveness. The anticancer effect of CRHBP in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) was shown by Western blotting, EdU staining, JC-1 staining, transwell test, and wound healing assays. CRHBP expression is significantly low in the majority of tumor types and is associated with survival prognosis, ICP markers, TMB, and microsatellite instability (MSI). The expression of CRHBP was found to be substantially related to the quantity of six immune cell types, as well as the interstitial and immunological scores, showing that CRHBP has a substantial impact in the TME. We also noticed a link between the IC50 of a number of anticancer medicines and the degree of CRHBP expression. CRHBP-related signaling pathways were discovered using functional enrichment. Cox regression analysis showed that CRHBP expression was an independent prognostic factor for LIHC. CRHBP has a tumor suppressor function in LIHC, according to cell and molecular biology trials.

ABT-751 is an orally bioavailable microtubule-binding agent capable of overcoming MDR and proposed as an alternative to taxane-based therapies.This study compares ABT-751 to taxanes in vitro, utilizing seven melanoma cell line models, publicly available gene expression and drug sensitivity databases, a lung cancer cell line model of MDR drug efflux transporter overexpression (DLKP-A), and drug efflux transporter ATPase assays.Melanoma cell lines exhibit a low but variable protein and RNA expression of drug efflux transporters P-gp, BCRP, and MDR3. Expression of P-gp and MDR3 correlates with sensitivity to taxanes, but not to ABT-751. The anti-proliferative IC50profile of ABT-751 was higher than the taxanes docetaxel and paclitaxel in the melanoma cell line panel, but fell within clinically achievable parameters. ABT-751 IC50was not impacted by P-gp-overexpression in DKLP-A cells, which display strong resistance to the P-gp substrate taxanes compared to DLKP parental controls. The addition of ABT-751 to paclitaxel treatment significantly decreased cell proliferation, suggesting some reversal of MDR. ATPase activity assays suggest that ABT-751 is a potential BCRP substrate, with the ability to inhibit P-gp ATPase activity.Our study confirms that ABT-751 is active against melanoma cell lines and models of MDR at physiologically relevant concentrations, it inhibits P-gp ATPase activity, and it may be a BCRP and/or MDR3 substrate. ABT-751 warrants further investigation alone or in tandem with other drug efflux transporter inhibitors for hard-to-treat MDR melanoma.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.6659542871287e-59
38322947,"Keratin gene signature expression drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition through enhanced TGF-Î² signaling pathway activation and correlates with adverse prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.","Heliyon","Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) stands as the foremost histological subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer, accounting for approximately 40% of all lung cancer diagnoses. However, there remains a critical unmet need to enhance the prediction of clinical outcomes and therapy responses in LUAD patients. Keratins (KRTs), serving as the structural components of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton in epithelial cells, play a crucial role in the advancement of tumor progression. This study investigated the prognostic significance of the KRT family gene and developed a KRT gene signature (KGS) for prognostic assessment and treatment guidance in LUAD.Transcriptome profiles and associated clinical details of LUAD patients were meticulously gathered from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The KGS score was developed based on the expression of five prognostic KRT genes (KRT7,KRT8,KRT17,KRT18,andKRT80), and the upper quartile of the KGS score was chosen as the cutoff. The Kaplan-Meier method was evaluated to compare survival outcomes between KGS-high and KGS-low groups. The underlying mechanism was further investigated by GSEA, GSVA, and other bioinformatic algorithms.High expression of the KGS signature exhibited a robust association with poorer overall survival (OS) in the TCGA-LUAD dataset (HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.35-2.42,P = 0.00011). The association was further corroborated in three external GEO cohorts, including GSE31210 (HR: 3.31; 95% CI: 1.7-6.47,P = 0.00017), GSE72094 (HR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.34-2.85,P = 0.00057) and GSE26939 (HR: 3.19; 95% CI: 1.74-5.84,P < 0.0001). Interestingly, KGS-high tumors revealed enrichments in TGF-β and WNT-β catenin signaling pathways, exhibited heightened activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway and proved intensified tumor stemness compared to their KGS-low counterparts. Additionally, KGS-high tumor cells exhibited increased sensitivity to several targeted agents, including gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, and trametinib, in comparison to KGS-low cells.This study developed a KGS score that independently predicts the prognosis in LUAD. High expression of KGS score, accompanied by upregulation of TGF-β and WNT-β catenin signaling pathways, confers more aggressive EMT and tumor progression.© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",4.06970408660974e-59
38360887,"Transactivation of Met signaling by oncogenic Gnaq drives the evolution of melanoma in Hgf-Cdk4 mice.","Cancer Gene Ther","Recent pan-cancer genomic analyses have identified numerous oncogenic driver mutations that occur in a cell-type and tissue-specific distribution. For example, oncogenic mutations in Braf and Nras genes arise predominantly in melanocytic neoplasms of the epidermis, while oncogenic mutations in Gnaq/11 genes arise mostly in melanocytic lesions of the dermis or the uvea. The mechanisms promoting cell-type and tissue-specific oncogenic events currently remain poorly understood. Here, we report that Gnaq/11 hotspot mutations occur as early oncogenic drivers during the evolution of primary melanomas in Hgf-Cdk4 mice. Additional single base substitutions in the Trp53 gene and structural chromosomal aberrations favoring amplifications of the chromosomal region containing the Met receptor gene accumulate during serial tumor transplantation and in cell lines established in vitro. Mechanistically, we found that the GnaqQ209Lmutation transactivates the Met receptor. Overexpression of oncogenic GnaqQ209Lin the immortalized melanocyte cell line promoted in vivo growth that was enhanced by transgenic Hgf expression in the tumor microenvironment. This cross-signaling mechanism explains the selection of oncogenic Gnaq/11 in primary Hgf-Cdk4 melanomas and provides an example of how oncogenic driver mutations, intracellular signaling cascades, and microenvironmental cues cooperate to drive cancer development in a tissue-specific fashion.© 2024.

Recently, maladjusted N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification and its modifiers METTL1/WDR4 have been confirmed an oncogene role in multiple cancers. However, the functions and molecular mechanisms of METTL1/WDR4 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain to be determined.METTL1/WDR4 expression levels were quantified using qRT-PCR, western blot analysis on AML clinical samples, and bioinformatics analysis on publicly available AML datasets. CCK-8 assays and cell count assays were performed to determine cell proliferation. Flow cytometry assays were conducted to assess cell cycle and apoptosis rates. Multiple techniques were used for mechanism studies in vitro assays, such as northern blotting, liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), tRNA stability analysis, transcriptome sequencing, small non-coding RNA sequencing, quantitative proteomics, and protein synthesis measurements.METTL1/WDR4 are significantly elevated in AML patients and associated with poor prognosis. METTL1 knockdown resulted in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in AML cells. Mechanically, METTL1 knockdown leads to significant decrease of m7G modification abundance on tRNA, which further destabilizes tRNAs and facilitates the biogenesis of tsRNAs in AML cells. In addition, profiling of nascent proteins revealed that METTL1 knockdown and transfection of total tRNAs that were isolated from METTL1 knockdown AML cells decreased global translation efficiency in AML cells.Taken together, our study demonstrates the important role of METTL1/WDR4 in AML leukaemogenesis, which provides a promising target candidate for AML therapy.© 2024.

The underlying mechanisms of OA are diverse and are becoming increasingly understood at the systemic, tissue, cellular and gene levels. However, the pharmacological therapies available remain limited, owing to drug delivery barriers, and consist mainly of broadly immunosuppressive regimens, such as corticosteroids, that provide only short-term palliative benefits and do not alter disease progression. Engineered RNA-based and cell-based therapies developed with synthetic chemistry and biology tools provide promise for future OA treatments with durable, efficacious mechanisms of action that can specifically target the underlying drivers of pathology. This Review highlights emerging classes of RNA-based technologies that hold potential for OA therapies, including small interfering RNA for gene silencing, microRNA and anti-microRNA for multi-gene regulation, mRNA for gene supplementation, and RNA-guided gene-editing platforms such as CRISPR-Cas9. Various cell-engineering strategies are also examined that potentiate disease-dependent, spatiotemporally regulated production of therapeutic molecules, and a conceptual framework is presented for their application as OA treatments. In summary, this Review highlights modern genetic medicines that have been clinically approved for other diseases, in addition to emerging genome and cellular engineering approaches, with the goal of emphasizing their potential as transformative OA treatments.© 2024.

38378674,"Characterizing hub biomarkers for post-transplant renal fibrosis and unveiling their immunological functions through RNA sequencing and advanced machine learning techniques.","J Transl Med","Kidney transplantation stands out as the most effective renal replacement therapy for patients grappling with end-stage renal disease. However, post-transplant renal fibrosis is a prevalent and irreversible consequence, imposing a substantial clinical burden. Unfortunately, the clinical landscape remains devoid of reliable biological markers for diagnosing post-transplant renal interstitial fibrosis.We obtained transcriptome and single-cell sequencing datasets of patients with renal fibrosis from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Subsequently, we employed Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify potential genes by integrating core modules and differential genes. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted to unveil the involvement of potential pathways. To identify key biomarkers for renal fibrosis, we utilized logistic analysis, a LASSO-based tenfold cross-validation approach, and gene topological analysis within Cytoscape. Furthermore, histological staining, Western blotting (WB), and quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiments were performed in a murine model of renal fibrosis to verify the identified hub genes. Moreover, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to explore possible effective drugs.Through WGCNA, the intersection of core modules and differential genes yielded a compendium of 92 potential genes. Logistic analysis, LASSO-based tenfold cross-validation, and gene topological analysis within Cytoscape identified four core genes (CD3G, CORO1A, FCGR2A, and GZMH) associated with renal fibrosis. The expression of these core genes was confirmed through single-cell data analysis and validated using various machine learning methods. Wet experiments also verified the upregulation of these core genes in the murine model of renal fibrosis. A positive correlation was observed between the core genes and immune cells, suggesting their potential role in bolstering immune system activity. Moreover, four potentially effective small molecules (ZINC000003830276-Tessalon, ZINC000003944422-Norvir, ZINC000008214629-Nonoxynol-9, and ZINC000085537014-Cobicistat) were identified through molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations.Four potential hub biomarkers most associated with post-transplant renal fibrosis, as well as four potentially effective small molecules, were identified, providing valuable insights for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying post-transplant renal fibrosis and exploring new targets.© 2024.

38390236,"Hub genes, a diagnostic model, and immune infiltration based on ferroptosis-linked genes in schizophrenia.","IBRO Neurosci Rep","Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a prevalent and serious mental disorder, and the exact pathophysiology of this condition is not fully understood. In previous studies, it has been proven that ferroprotein levels are high in SCZ. It has also been shown that this inflammatory response may modify fibromodulin. Accumulating evidence indicates a strong link between metabolism and ferroptosis. Therefore, the present study aims to identify ferroptosis-linked hub genes to further investigate the role that ferroptosis plays in the development of SCZ.From the GEO database, four microarray data sets on SCZ (GSE53987, GSE38481, GSE18312, and GSE38484) and ferroptosis-linked genes were extracted. Using the prefrontal cortex expression matrix of SCZ patients and healthy individuals as the control group from GSE53987, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to discover SCZ-linked module genes. From the feed, genes associated with ferroptosis were retrieved. The intersection of the module and ferroptosis-linked genes was done to obtain the hub genes. Then, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were conducted. The SCZ diagnostic model was established using logistic regression, and the GSE38481, GSE18312, and GSE38484 data sets were used to validate the model. Finally, hub genes linked to immune infiltration were examined.A total of 13 SCZ module genes and 7 hub genes linked to ferroptosis were obtained:DECR1,GJA1,EFN2L2,PSAT1,SLC7A11,SOX2, andYAP1. The GO/KEGG/GSEA study indicated that these hub genes were predominantly enriched in mitochondria and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, immunological inflammation, ferroptosis, Hippo signaling pathway, AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, and other associated biological processes. The diagnostic model created using these hub genes was further confirmed using the data sets of three blood samples from patients with SCZ. The immune infiltration data showed that immune cell dysfunction enhanced ferroptosis and triggered SCZ.In this study, seven critical genes that are strongly associated with ferroptosis in patients with SCZ were discovered, a valid clinical diagnostic model was built, and a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of SCZ was identified by the investigation of immune infiltration.© 2024 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of International Brain Research Organization.",1.02331157522832e-60

Studying the relationship between different traits of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and MM is critical for the management and treatment of MM patients with COVID-19. But all the studies on the relationship so far were observational and the results were also contradictory. Using the latest publicly available COVID-19 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data, we performed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of the causality between MM and different traits of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization, and severe COVID-19) and use multi-trait analysis of GWAS(MTAG) to identify new associated SNPs in MM. We performed co-localization analysis to reveal potential causal pathways between diseases and over-representation enrichment analysis to find involved biological pathways. IVW results showed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization increased risk of MM. In the reverse analysis, the causal relationship was not found between MM for each of the different symptoms of COVID-19. Co-localization analysis identified LZTFL1, MUC4, OAS1, HLA-C, SLC22A31, FDX2, and MAPT as genes involved in COVID-19-mediated causation of MM. These genes were mainly related to immune function, glycosylation modifications and virus defense. Three novel MM-related SNPs were found through MTAG, which may regulate the expression of B3GNT6. This is the first study to use MR to explore the causality between different traits of COVID-19 and MM. The results of our two-way MR analysis found that SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 hospitalization increased the susceptibility of MM.© 2024. The Author(s).",7.24167873436302e-61

We sought to explore the characteristics of mitophagy-related gene (MRG) and mitophagy-related lncRNAs (MRL) to facilitate treatment and prognosis of OC.The processed data were extracted from public databases (TCGA, GTEx, GEO and GeneCards). The highly synergistic lncRNA modules and MRLs were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Using LASSO Cox regression analysis, the MRL-model was first established based on TCGA and then validated with four external GEO datasets. The independent prognostic value of the MRL-model was evaluated by Multivariate Cox regression analysis. Characteristics of functional pathways, somatic mutations, immunity features, and anti-tumor therapy related to the MRL-model were evaluated using abundant algorithms, such as GSEA, ssGSEA, GSVA, maftools, CIBERSORT, xCELL, MCPcounter, ESTIMATE, TIDE, pRRophetic and so on.We found 52 differentially expressed MRGs and 22 prognostic MRGs in OC. Enrichment analysis revealed that MRGs were involved in mitophagy. Nine prognostic MRLs were identified and eight optimal MRLs combinations were screened to establish the MRL-model. The MRL-model stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups and remained a prognostic factor (P < 0.05) with independent value (P < 0.05) in TCGA and GEO. We observed that OC patients in the high-risk group also had the unfavorable survival in consideration of clinicopathological parameters. The Nomogram was plotted to make the prediction results more intuitive and readable. The two risk groups were enriched in discrepant functional pathways (such as Wnt signaling pathway) and immunity features. Besides, patients in the low-risk group may be more sensitive to immunotherapy (P = 0.01). Several chemotherapeutic drugs (Paclitaxel, Veliparib, Rucaparib, Axitinib, Linsitinib, Saracatinib, Motesanib, Ponatinib, Imatinib and so on) were found with variant sensitivity between the two risk groups. The established ceRNA network indicated the underlying mechanisms of MRLs.Our study revealed the roles of MRLs and MRL-model in expression, prognosis, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and molecular mechanism of OC. Our findings were able to stratify OC patients with high risk, unfavorable prognosis and variant treatment sensitivity, thus improving clinical outcomes for OC patients.© 2024.

Techniques used to elucidate gene function during early development have encountered technical challenges, especially when targeting embryonic lethal genes. The introduction of CRISPRoff by Nuñez and collaborators provides an opportunity to heritably silence genes during long-term differentiation. We modified CRISPRoff and sgRNA Sleeping Beauty transposon vectors that depend on tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation to silence the expression of embryonic lethal genes at different stages of differentiation in a stable manner. We provide instructions on how to generate sgRNA transposon vectors that can be used in combination with our CRISPRoff transposon vector and a stable hPSC line. We validate the use of this tool by silencing MCL-1, an anti-apoptotic protein, which results in pre-implantation embryonic lethality in mice; this protein is necessary for oligodendrocyte and hematopoietic stem cell development and is required for the in vitro survival of hPSCs. In this protocol, we use an adapted version of the differentiation protocol published by Douvaras and Fossati (2015) to generate oligodendrocyte lineage cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). After introduction of the CRISPRoff and sgRNAs transposon vectors in hESCs, we silenceMCL-1 in committed oligodendrocyte neural precursor cells and describe methods to measure its expression. With the methods described here, users can design sgRNA transposon vectors targetingMCL-1 or other essential genes of interest to study human oligodendrocyte development or other differentiation protocols that use hPSC model systems.

However, its clinical application is limited due to severe side effects such as cardiotoxicity. In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated that cellular aging has become a therapeutic target for DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. However, the underlying mechanism and specific molecular targets of DOX-induced cardiomyocyte aging remain unclear. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a family of protein post-translational modification enzymes in eukaryotic cells, including 18 members. PARP-1, the most well-studied member of this family, has become a potential molecular target for the prevention and treatment of various cardiovascular diseases, such as DOX cardiomyopathy and heart failure. PARP-1 and PARP-2 share 69% homology in the catalytic regions. However, they do not entirely overlap in function. The role of PARP-2 in cardiovascular diseases, especially in DOX-induced cardiomyocyte aging, is less studied. In this study, we found for the first time that down-regulation of PARP-2 can inhibit DOX-induced cellular aging in cardiomyocytes. On the contrary, overexpression of PARP-2 can aggravate DOX-induced cardiomyocyte aging and injury. Further research showed that PARP-2 inhibited the expression and activity of SIRT1, which in turn was involved in the development of DOX-induced cardiomyocyte aging and injury. Our findings provide a preliminary experimental basis for establishing PARP-2 as a new target for preventing and treating DOX cardiomyopathy and related drug development.© 2024.

However, owing to the high heterogeneity of these tumors, it is unclear which patient population most likely benefit from NAC. Multi-omics offer an improved approach to uncovering genomic and transcriptomic changes before and after NAC in BC and to identifying molecular features associated with NAC sensitivity.We performed whole-exome and RNA sequencing on 233 samples (including matched pre- and post-treatment tumors) from 50 BC patients with rigorously defined responses to NAC and analyzed changes in the multi-omics landscape. Molecular features associated with NAC response were identified and validated in a larger internal, and two external validation cohorts, as well as in vitro experiments.The most frequently altered genes were TP53, TTN, and MUC16 in both pre- and post-treatment tumors. In comparison with pre-treatment tumors, there was a significant decrease in C > A transversion mutations in post-treatment tumors (P = 0.020). NAC significantly decreased the mutation rate (P = 0.006) of the DNA repair pathway and gene expression levels (FDR = 0.007) in this pathway. NAC also significantly changed the expression level of immune checkpoint genes and the abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune and stroma cells, including B cells, activated dendritic cells, γδT cells, M2 macrophages and endothelial cells. Furthermore, there was a higher rate of C > T substitutions in NAC nonresponsive tumors than responsive ones, especially when the substitution site was flanked by C and G. Importantly, there was a unique amplified region at 8p11.23 (containing ADGRA2 and ADRB3) and a deleted region at 3p13 (harboring FOXP1) in NAC nonresponsive and responsive tumors, respectively. Particularly, the CDKAL1 missense variant P409L (p.Pro409Leu, c.1226C > T) decreased BC cell sensitivity to docetaxel, and ADGRA2 or ADRB3 gene amplifications were associated with worse NAC response and poor prognosis in BC patients.Our study has revealed genomic and transcriptomic landscape changes following NAC in BC, and identified novel biomarkers (CDKAL1P409L, ADGRA2 and ADRB3) underlying chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis, which could guide the development of personalized treatments for BC.© 2024.

Additionally, these cells exhibit an apoptotic resistance phenotype. Cellular senescence serves a pivotal role not only in embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and tumor suppression but also in the pathogenesis of age-related degenerative diseases, malignancies, metabolic diseases, and kidney diseases. The senescence of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEC) constitutes a critical cellular event in the progression of acute kidney injury (AKI). RTEC senescence inhibits renal regeneration and repair processes and, concurrently, promotes the transition of AKI to chronic kidney disease via the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. The mechanisms underlying cellular senescence are multifaceted and include telomere shortening or damage, DNA damage, mitochondrial autophagy deficiency, cellular metabolic disorders, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and epigenetic regulation. Strategies aimed at inhibiting RTEC senescence, targeting the clearance of senescent RTEC, or promoting the apoptosis of senescent RTEC hold promise for enhancing the renal prognosis of AKI. This review primarily focuses on the characteristics and mechanisms of RTEC senescence, and the impact of intervening RTEC senescence on the prognosis of AKI, aiming to provide a foundation for understanding the pathogenesis and providing potentially effective approaches for AKI treatment.© 2024.

Epigenetic regulations play critical roles in HNSC tumorigenesis, progression, and activation of functional immune cells. This study aims to identify an epigenetic signature as an immunophenotype indicator of durable clinical immunotherapeutic benefits in HNSC patients.Unsupervised consensus clustering approach was applied to distinguish immunophenotypes based on five immune signatures in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) HNSC cohort. Two immunophenotypes (immune 'Hot' and immune 'Cold') that had different TME features, diverse prognosis, and distinct DNA methylation patterns were recognized. Immunophenotype-related methylated signatures (IPMS) were identified by the least absolute shrinkage and selector operation algorithm. Additionally, the IPMS score by deconvolution algorithm was constructed as an immunophenotype classifier to predict clinical outcomes and immunotherapeutic response.The 'Hot' HNSC immunophenotype had higher immunoactivity and better overall survival (p = 0.00055) compared to the 'Cold' tumors. The immunophenotypes had distinct DNA methylation patterns, which was closely associated with HNSC tumorigenesis and functional immune cell infiltration. 311 immunophenotype-related methylated CpG sites (IRMCs) was identified from TCGA-HNSC dataset. IPMS score model achieved a strong clinical predictive performance for classifying immunophenotypes. The area under the curve value (AUC) of the IPMS score model reached 85.9% and 89.8% in TCGA train and test datasets, respectively, and robustness was verified in five HNSC validation datasets. It was also validated as an immunophenotype classifier for predicting durable clinical benefits (DCB) in lung cancer patients who received anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy (p = 0.017) and TCGA-SKCM patients who received distinct immunotherapy (p = 0.033).This study systematically analyzed DNA methylation patterns in distinct immunophenotypes to identify IPMS with clinical prognostic potential for personalized epigenetic anticancer approaches in HNSC patients.

Human leukocyte antigen class I molecules (HLA-I), which present intracellular immunopeptides to T cells, provide an ideal source for identifying neoantigens. However, solely relying on a mutation database generated through commonly used whole exome sequencing (WES) for the identification of HLA-I immunopeptides, may result in potential neoantigens being missed due to limitations in sequencing depth and sample quality.In this study, we constructed and evaluated an extended database for neoantigen identification, based on COSMIC mutation database. This study utilized mass spectrometry-based proteogenomic profiling to identify the HLA-I immunopeptidome enriched from HepG2 cell. HepG2 WES-based and the COSMIC-based mutation database were generated and utilized to identify HepG2-specific mutant immunopeptides.The results demonstrated that COSMIC-based database identified 5 immunopeptides compared to only 1 mutant peptide identified by HepG2 WES-based database, indicating its effectiveness in identifying mutant immunopeptides. Furthermore, HLA-I affinity of the mutant immunopeptides was evaluated through NetMHCpan and peptide-docking modeling to validate their binding to HLA-I molecules, demonstrating the potential of mutant peptides identified by the COSMIC-based database as neoantigens.Utilizing the COSMIC-based mutation database is a more efficient strategy for identifying mutant peptides from HLA-I immunopeptidome without significantly increasing the false positive rate. HepG2 specific WES-based database may exclude certain mutant peptides due to WES sequencing depth or sample heterogeneity.

Currently, there is no effective treatment for SCI. Mitophagy plays a vital role in mitochondrial quality control during various physiological and pathological processes. The study aimed to elucidate the role of mitophagy and identify potential mitophagy-related hub genes in SCI pathophysiology. Two datasets (GSE15878 and GSE138637) were analyzed. Firstly, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and mitophagy-related genes were obtained from GeneCards, then the intersection between SCI and mitophagy-related genes was determined. Next, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interaction network (PPI network), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and cluster analysis to identify and define the hub genes in SCI. Finally, the link between hub genes and infiltrating immune cells was investigated and the potential transcriptional regulation/small molecular compounds to target hub genes were predicted. In total, SKP1 and BAP1 were identified as hub genes of mitophagy-related DEGs during SCI development and regulatory T cells (Tregs)/resting NK cells/activated mast cells may play an essential role in the progression of SCI. LINC00324 and SNHG16 may regulate SKP1 and BAP1, respectively, through miRNAs. Eleven and eight transcriptional factors (TFs) regulate SKP1 and BAP1, respectively, and six small molecular compounds target BAP1.

38168352,"Transposable elements may enhance antiviral resistance in HIV-1 elite controllers.","bioRxiv","Less than 0.5% of people living with HIV-1 are elite controllers (ECs) - individuals who have a replication-competent viral reservoir in their CD4+T cells but maintain undetectable plasma viremia without the help of antiretroviral therapy. While the EC CD4+T cell transcriptome has been investigated for gene expression signatures associated with disease progression (or, in this case, a lack thereof), the expression and regulatory activity of transposable elements (TEs) in ECs has not been explored. Yet previous studies have established that TEs can directly impact the immune response to pathogens, including HIV-1. Thus, we hypothesize that the regulatory activities of TEs could contribute to the natural resistance of ECs against HIV-1. We perform a TE-centric analysis of previously published multi-omics data derived from EC individuals and other populations. We find that the CD4+T cell transcriptome and retrotranscriptome of ECs are distinct from healthy controls, treated patients, and viremic progressors. However, there is a substantial level of transcriptomic heterogeneity among ECs. We categorize individuals with distinct chromatin accessibility and expression profiles into four clusters within the EC group, each possessing unique repertoires of TEs and antiviral factors. Notably, several TE families with known immuno-regulatory activity are differentially expressed among ECs. Their transcript levels in ECs positively correlate with their chromatin accessibility and negatively correlate with the expression of their KRAB zinc-finger (KZNF) repressors. This coordinated variation is seen at the level of individual TE loci likely acting or, in some cases, known to act ascis-regulatory elements for nearby genes involved in the immune response and HIV-1 restriction. Based on these results, we propose that the EC phenotype is driven in part by the reduced availability of specific KZNF proteins to repress TE-derivedcis-regulatory elements for antiviral genes, thereby heightening their basal level of resistance to HIV-1 infection. Our study reveals considerable heterogeneity in the CD4+T cell transcriptome of ECs, including variable expression of TEs and their KZNF controllers, that must be taken into consideration to decipher the mechanisms enabling HIV-1 control.",1.43628131723287e-62
38212307,"Clinical applications of stem cell-derived exosomes.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Although stem cell-based therapy has demonstrated considerable potential to manage certain diseases more successfully than conventional surgery, it nevertheless comes with inescapable drawbacks that might limit its clinical translation. Compared to stem cells, stem cell-derived exosomes possess numerous advantages, such as non-immunogenicity, non-infusion toxicity, easy access, effortless preservation, and freedom from tumorigenic potential and ethical issues. Exosomes can inherit similar therapeutic effects from their parental cells such as embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells through vertical delivery of their pluripotency or multipotency. After a thorough search and meticulous dissection of relevant literature from the last five years, we present this comprehensive, up-to-date, specialty-specific and disease-oriented review to highlight the surgical application and potential of stem cell-derived exosomes. Exosomes derived from stem cells (e.g., embryonic, induced pluripotent, hematopoietic, mesenchymal, neural, and endothelial stem cells) are capable of treating numerous diseases encountered in orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, general surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, urology, head and neck surgery, ophthalmology, and obstetrics and gynecology. The diverse therapeutic effects of stem cells-derived exosomes are a hierarchical translation through tissue-specific responses, and cell-specific molecular signaling pathways. In this review, we highlight stem cell-derived exosomes as a viable and potent alternative to stem cell-based therapy in managing various surgical conditions. We recommend that future research combines wisdoms from surgeons, nanomedicine practitioners, and stem cell researchers in this relevant and intriguing research area.© 2023.

38178234,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and MPNST-like entities are defined by a specific DNA methylation profile in pediatric and juvenile population.","Clin Epigenetics","Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) account for 3-10% of pediatric sarcomas, 50% of which occur in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Sporadic MPNSTs diagnosis may be challenging due to the absence of specific markers, apart from immunohistochemical H3K27me3 loss. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiling is a useful tool for brain and mesenchymal neoplasms categorization, and MPNSTs exhibit a specific DNAm signature. An MPNST-like group has recently been recognized, including pediatric tumors with retained H3K27me3 mark and clinical/histological features not yet well explored. This study aims to characterize the DNAm profile of pediatric/juvenile MPNSTs/MPNST-like entities and its diagnostic/prognostic relevance.We studied 42 tumors from two groups. Group 1 included 32 tumors histologically diagnosed as atypical neurofibroma (ANF) (N = 5) or MPNST (N = 27); group 2 comprised 10 tumors classified as MPNST-like according to Heidelberg sarcoma classifier. We performed further immunohistochemical and molecular tests to reach an integrated diagnosis. In group 1, DNAm profiling was inconclusive for ANF; while, it confirmed the original diagnosis in 12/27 MPNSTs, all occurring in NF1 patients. Five/27 MPNSTs were classified as MPNST-like: Integrated diagnosis confirmed MPNST identity for 3 cases; while, the immunophenotype supported the change to high-grade undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma in 2 samples. The remaining 10/27 MPNSTs variably classified as schwannoma, osteosarcoma, BCOR-altered sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)-MYOD1 mutant, RMS-like, and embryonal RMS or did not match with any defined entity. Molecular analysis and histologic review confirmed the diagnoses of BCOR, RMS-MYOD1 mutant, DICER1-syndrome and ERMS. Group 2 samples included 5 high-grade undifferentiated sarcomas/MPNSTs and 5 low-grade mesenchymal neoplasms. Two high-grade and 4 low-grade lesions harbored tyrosine kinase (TRK) gene fusions. By HDBSCAN clustering analysis of the whole cohort we identified two clusters mainly distinguished by H3K27me3 epigenetic signature. Exploring the copy number variation, high-grade tumors showed frequent chromosomal aberrations and CDKN2A/B loss significantly impacted on survival in the MPNSTs cohort.DNAm profiling is a useful tool in diagnostic work-up of MPNSTs. Its application in a retrospective series collected during pre-molecular era contributed to classify morphologic mimics. The methylation group MPNST-like is a 'hybrid' category in pediatrics including high-grade and low-grade tumors mainly characterized by TRK alterations.© 2024. The Author(s).",8.06908270081054e-63
38317092,"The impact of selective HDAC inhibitors on the transcriptome of early mouse embryos.","BMC Genomics","Histone acetylation, which is regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), plays a crucial role in the control of gene expression. HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) have shown potential in cancer therapy; however, the specific roles of HDACs in early embryos remain unclear. Moreover, although some pan-HDACi have been used to maintain cellular undifferentiated states in early embryos, the specific mechanisms underlying their effects remain unknown. Thus, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the application of selective HDACi in early embryos.To address this gap, we treated early embryos with two selective HDACi (MGCD0103 and T247). Subsequently, we collected and analyzed their transcriptome data at different developmental stages. Our findings unveiled a significant effect of HDACi treatment during the crucial 2-cell stage of zygotes, leading to a delay in embryonic development after T247 and an arrest at 2-cell stage after MGCD0103 administration. Furthermore, we elucidated the regulatory targets underlying this arrested embryonic development, which pinpointed the G2/M phase as the potential period of embryonic development arrest caused by MGCD0103. Moreover, our investigation provided a comprehensive profile of the biological processes that are affected by HDACi, with their main effects being predominantly localized in four aspects of zygotic gene activation (ZGA): RNA splicing, cell cycle regulation, autophagy, and transcription factor regulation. By exploring the transcriptional regulation and epigenetic features of the genes affected by HDACi, we made inferences regarding the potential main pathways via which HDACs affect gene expression in early embryos. Notably, Hdac7 exhibited a distinct response, highlighting its potential as a key player in early embryonic development.Our study conducted a comprehensive analysis of the effects of HDACi on early embryonic development at the transcriptional level. The results demonstrated that HDACi significantly affected ZGA in embryos, elucidated the distinct actions of various selective HDACi, and identified specific biological pathways and mechanisms via which these inhibitors modulated early embryonic development.© 2024.

38374592,"[Application of multiomics mass spectrometry in the research of chemical exposome].","Se Pu","Environmental factors, such as environmental pollutants, behaviors, and lifestyles, are the leading causes of chronic noncommunicable diseases. Estimates indicate that approximately 50% of all deaths worldwide can be attributed to environmental factors. The exposome is defined as the totality of human environmental (i.e., all nongenetic) exposures from conception, including general external exposure (e.g., climate, education, and urban environment), specific external exposure (e.g., pollution, physical activity, and diet), and internal exposure (e.g., metabolic factors, oxidative stress, inflammation, and protein modification). As a new paradigm, this concept aims to comprehensively understand the link between human health and environmental factors. Therefore, a comprehensive measurement of the exposome, including accurate and reliable measurements of exposure to the external environment and a wide range of biological responses to the internal environment, is of great significance. The measurement of the general external exposome depends on advances in environmental sensors, personal-sensing technologies, and geographical information systems. The determination of exogenous chemicals to which individuals are exposed and endogenous chemicals that are produced or modified by external stressors relies on improvements in methodology and the development of instrumental approaches, including colorimetric, chromatographic, spectral, and mass-spectrometric methods. This article reviews the research strategies for chemical exposomes and summarizes existing exposome-measurement methods, focusing on mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods. The top-down and bottom-up approaches are commonly used in exposome studies. The bottom-up approach focuses on the identification of chemicals in the external environment (e.g., soil, water, diet, and air), whereas the top-down approach focuses on the evaluation of endogenous chemicals and biological processes in biological samples (e.g., blood, urine, and serum). Low- and high-resolution MS (LRMS and HRMS, respectively) have become the most popular methods for the direct measurement of exogenous and endogenous chemicals owing to their superior sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range. LRMS has been widely applied in the targeted analysis of expected chemicals, whereas HRMS is a promising technique for the suspect and unknown screening of unexpected chemicals. The development of MS-based multiomics, including proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, and spatial omics, provides new opportunities to understand the effects of environmental exposure on human health. Metabolomics involves the sum of all low-molecular-weight metabolites in a living system. Nontargeted metabolomics can measure both endogenous and exogenous chemicals, which would directly link exposure to biological effects, internal dose, and disease pathobiology, whereas proteomics could play an important role in predicting potential adverse health outcomes and uncovering molecular mechanisms. MS imaging (MSI) is an emerging technique that provides unlabeled in-depth measurements of endogenous and exogenous molecules directly from tissue and cell sections without changing their spatial information. MSI-based spatial omics, which has been widely applied in biomarker discovery for clinical diagnosis, as well as drug and pollutant monitoring, is expected to become an effective method for exposome measurement. Integrating these response measurements from metabolomics, proteomics, spatial omics, and epigenomics will enable the generation of new hypotheses to discover the etiology of diseases caused by chemical exposure. Finally, we highlight the major challenges in achieving chemical exposome measurements.",4.25115422203157e-63

This study comprehensively analyzed SLC10A3 in CRC, evaluating its prognostic significance and influence on the tumor's immune microenvironment.Transcriptomic data from TCGA were obtained to compare SLC10A3 expression in both colorectal cancer (CRC) and normal tissues. Prognostic value was assessed for overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and progression-free interval (PFI). DNA methylation patterns of SLC10A3 and correlation with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) were explored. Genetic alterations in SLC10A3 were scrutinized. The study also delved into the influence of SLC10A3 on the immune microenvironment of CRC, including immune cell infiltration and chemokines. Involvement of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was explored. Methylation status of specific CpG islands in the SLC10A3 gene correlated with CRC patient prognosis. CRC tissue microarray was performed to verify the expression of SLC10A3 and its relationship with prognosis.The research revealed that SLC10A3 is significantly upregulated in CRC and holds promise as a potential diagnostic marker. Elevated SLC10A3 expression was linked to poorer OS, DSS, and PFI. Methylation patterns of SLC10A3 displayed prognostic relevance, and genetic alterations in the gene were identified. SLC10A3 was shown to impact the immune microenvironment, with significant correlations observed between its expression and various immune cell types, chemokines, and markers associated with CAFs. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between SLC10A3 and MMR molecules was established. Methylation status of specific CpG islands within the SLC10A3 gene was associated with CRC patient prognosis. Tissue microarray showed that SLC10A3 was highly expressed in CRC and significantly correlated with poor prognosis.The study underscores the importance of elevated SLC10A3 in CRC, associating it with decreased survival and immune infiltration, proposing it as a diagnostic biomarker and appealing immunotherapy target, given its significant overexpression and influence on the immune microenvironment and prognosis through methylation patterns.© 2024.

Despite advances in therapeutic management and immunotherapy, the 5-year survival rate for head and neck cancer remains at ~66% of all diagnosed cases. A better definition of drivers of HPV-negative HNSCC that are targetable points of tumor vulnerability could lead to significant clinical advances. NSD1 is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes histone H3 lysine 36 di-methylation (H3K36me2); mutations inactivating NSD1 have been linked to improved outcomes in HNSCC. In this study, we show that NSD1 induces H3K36me2levels in HNSCC and that the depletion of NSD1 reduces HNSCC of cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We also find that NSD1 strongly promotes activation of the Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway. NSD1 depletion in HNSCC induces an autophagic gene program activation, causes accumulation of the p62 and LC3B-II proteins, and decreases the autophagic signaling protein ULK1 at both protein and mRNA levels. Reflecting these signaling defects, the knockdown of NSD1 disrupts autophagic flux in HNSCC cells. Taken together, these data identify positive regulation of Akt/mTORC1 signaling and autophagy as novel NSD1 functions in HNSCC, suggesting that NSD1 may be of value as a therapeutic target in this cancer.© 2024.

Bromodomain containing 9 (BRD9) is a more recently identified protein coding gene, which can encode SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complexes subunits. Although initial evaluations of the potential of BRD9-based targeted therapy have been explored in the clinical application of a small number of cancer types, more detailed study of the diagnostic and prognostic potential, as well as the detailed biological mechanism of BRD9 remains unreported.We used various bioinformatics tools to generate a comprehensive, pan-cancer analyses of BRD9 expression in multiple disease types described in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Experimental validation was conducted in tissue microarrays and cell lines derived from lung and colon cancers.Our study revealed that BRD9 exhibited elevated expression in a wide range of tumours. Analysis of survival data and DNA methylation for BRD9 indicated distinct conclusions for multiple tumours. mRNA splicing and molecular binding were involved in the functional mechanism of BRD9. BRD9 may affect cancer progression through different phosphorylation sites or N6-methyladenosine site modifications. BRD9 could potentially serve as a novel biomarker for diagnosing different cancer types, especially could accurately forecast the prognosis of melanoma patients receiving anti-programmed cell death 1 immunotherapy. BRD9 has the potential to serve as a therapeutic target, when pairing with etoposide in patients with melanoma. The BRD9/SMARCD1 axis exhibited promising discriminative performance in forecasting the prognosis of patients afflicted with liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) and mesothelioma. Additionally, this axis appears to potentially influence the immune response in LIHC by regulating the programmed death-ligand 1 immune checkpoint. For experimental validation, high expression levels of BRD9 were observed in tumour tissue samples from both lung and colon cancer patients. Knocking down BRD9 led to the inhibition of lung and colon cancer development, likely via the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.These pan-cancer study revealed the diagnostic and prognostic potential, along with the biological mechanism of BRD9 as a novel therapeutic target in human tumours.© 2024 The Authors.

However, its advances are restricted by heritability, the extended period required to produce a strain with desirable traits, and the necessity to target multiple characteristics simultaneously in the breeding programs. Genome editing tools like zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) are promising for faster genetic improvement in fishes. CRISPR/Cas9 technology is the least expensive, most precise, and well compatible with multiplexing of all genome editing approaches, making it a productive and highly targeted approach for developing customized fish strains with specified characteristics. As a result, the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in aquaculture is rapidly growing, with the main traits researched being reproduction and development, growth, pigmentation, disease resistance, trans-GFP utilization, and omega-3 metabolism. However, technological obstacles, such as off-target effects, ancestral genome duplication, and mosaicism in founder population, need to be addressed to achieve sustainable fish production. Furthermore, present regulatory and risk assessment frameworks are inadequate to address the technical hurdles of CRISPR/Cas9, even though public and regulatory approval is critical to commercializing novel technology products. In this review, we examine the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for the genetic improvement of edible fish, the technical, ethical, and socio-economic challenges to using it in fish species, and its future scope for sustainable fish production.",2.17006895334661e-64

Recent studies have identified the critical role of ICD in glioma treatment. This study aimed to use ICD-associated differentially expressed genes (ICD-DEGs) to predict survival of glioma patients. We investigated the relationship between clinical prognosis and the date-to-clinical prognosis of 1,721 glioma patients by examining the expression, methylation, and mutation status of ICD-related genes (IRGs) in these patients. Our prediction of survival in glioma patients was based on three risk genes, and we explored the association between these genes and clinical outcomes. Additionally, IRG expression was used to stratify glioma patients. We further examined the relationship among the three subgroups in terms of immune microenvironment heterogeneity and immunotherapy response. In addition, this study also included analyses of histograms and sensitivity to antitumor drugs. The expression of these genes was externally validated by RT-qPCR, Western blot (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in glioma and normal brain tissue. Our findings reveal that most IRGs are overexpressed in glioma tumor tissues, and this high expression was confirmed through histological validation. We successfully developed predictive models for three prognostic genes associated with ICD. These models not only predict survival in glioma but also correlate with the tumor's immune microenvironment. Finally, using consensus clustering, we identified three ICD-associated subtypes. Notably, patients with the C3 subtype showed high levels of immune cell infiltration, whereas those with the C1 subtype exhibited lower levels of immune cell infiltration. We successfully developed an innovative IRG-based systematic approach for evaluating glioma patients. This stratification in experimental studies opens new avenues for prognosis and assessing immunotherapy responses in glioma patients. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in treating glioma, potentially paving the way for more promising and effective therapeutic strategies in the future.AJCR Copyright © 2024.",6.06177917273452e-65

Although alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is an established model organism for forage development, the understanding of YTH proteins in alfalfa is still limited. In the present investigation, 53 putative YTH genes, each encoding a YT521 domain-containing protein, were identified within the alfalfa genome. These genes were categorized into two subfamilies: YTHDF (49 members) and YTHDC (four members). Each subfamily demonstrates analogous motif distributions and domain architectures. Specifically, proteins encoded by MsYTHDF genes incorporate a single domain structure, while those corresponding to MsYTH5, 8, 12, 16 who are identified as members of the MsYTHDC subfamily, exhibit CCCH-type zinc finger repeats at their N-termini. It is also observed that the predicted aromatic cage pocket that binds the m6A residue of MsYTHDC consists of a sequence of two tryptophan residues and one tyrosine residue (WWY). Conversely, in MsYTHDF, the binding pocket comprises two highly conserved tryptophan residues and either one tryptophan residue (WWW) or tyrosine residue (WWY) in MsYTHDF.Through comparative analysis of qRT-PCR data, we observed distinct expression patterns in specific genes under abiotic stress, indicating their potential regulatory roles. Notably, five genes (MsYTH2, 14, 26, 27, 48) consistently exhibit upregulation, and two genes (MsYTH33, 35) are downregulated in response to both cold and salt stress. This suggests a common mechanism among these YTH proteins in response to various abiotic stressors in alfalfa. Further, integrating qRT-PCR with RNA-seq data revealed that MsYTH2, MsYTH14, and MsYTH16 are highly expressed in leaves at various development stages, underscoring their potential roles in regulating the growth of these plant parts. The obtained findings shed further light on the biological functions of MsYTH genes and may aid in the selection of suitable candidate genes for future genetic enhancement endeavors aimed at improving salt and cold tolerance in alfalfa.© 2023.

Collagen is the main component in extracellular matrix. Rising studies have determined the oncogenic effect of collagen in cancer progression, which is intriguing to be further explored. Collagen type XXVI alpha 1 chain (COL26A1) is a newly discovered collagen subtype, functions of which still remain poorly demonstrated in THCA.Based on the transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other public databases, we conducted investigations of COL26A1 in THCA with respects to diagnostic/prognostic prediction, functional characterization, immune infiltration, chemical drug target and non-coding RNA regulatory network. Furthermore, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot were used to verify the expression of COL26A1 in THCA.COL26A1 was significantly upregulated in THCA, and the high COL26A1 expression inferred poor prognosis [hazard ratio (HR) =4.76; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.36-16.73; P=0.015]. The diagnostic area under the curve (AUC) of COL26A1 achieved 0.736 (95% CI: 0.669-0.802). COL26A1 was also identified as an independent prognostic predictor for THCA (HR =3.928; 95% CI: 3.716-4.151; P<0.001).

Functional characterizations implied that COL26A1 was associated with immunological processes and oncogenic signaling pathways. High COL26A1 expression was accompanied by more abundant infiltration of immune cells and higher stromal/immune score. In addition, most immune checkpoints were significantly positively co-expressed with COL26A1, including PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA4.

SMAD4 is a classical mutated gene in pancreatic cancer and is lost in up to 60%-90 % of PAAD patients, and its mutation often predicts a poor prognosis and treatment resistance. In this study, based on the expression profile data in The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we identified a ceRNA network composed of 2 lncRNAs, 1 miRNA, and 4 mRNAs through differential expression analysis and survival prognosis analysis. Among them, high expression of KLK10/LIPH/PARD6B/SLC52A3 influenced the prognosis and overall survival of PAAD patients. We confirmed the high expression of these target genes in pancreatic tissue of pancreatic-specific SMAD4-deficient mice. In addition, immune infiltration analysis showed that the high expression of these target genes affects the tumor immune environment and contributes to the progression of PAAD. Abnormal overexpression of these target genes may be caused by hypermethylation. In conclusion, we found that KLK10/LIPH/PARD6B/SLC52A3 is a potential prognostic marker for PAAD based on a competing endogenous RNA-mediated mechanism and revealed the potential pathogenic mechanism by which deficient expression of SMAD4 promotes pancreatic cancer progression, which provides a new pathway and theoretical basis for targeted therapy or improved prognosis of pancreatic cancer. These data will help reveal potential therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer and improve the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients.© 2024 The Authors.

Mounting evidence suggests that their dysregulation is intricately linked to numerous diseases. However, the role of m6A-associated genes in carotid atherosclerosis and their relationship with aging and immune cells remain unclear. Analyze the expression profiles of m6A-related genes in carotid atherosclerosis-related datasets. Based on the expression patterns of m6A-related genes, perform consistent clustering analysis of carotid atherosclerosis samples and investigate associated immune cell infiltration patterns and aging characteristics. Develop an m6A prediction model specific to carotid atherosclerosis and analyze the relationships between immune cells infiltration and aging features. The m6A methylation modification level exhibited a substantial decrease in early-stage carotid atherosclerosis samples compared to late-stage carotid atherosclerosis samples. Subsequently, two distinct m6A subtypes were defined through consensus clustering analysis, with the lower m6A modification level group showing associations with heightened immune cell infiltration and increased expression of aging-related genes. A model composed of five m6A-related genes was formulated, and the results indicated that this model possesses effective predictive and therapeutic capabilities for carotid atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the downregulation of YTHDC1 expression resulted in elevated expression of inflammatory factors and a decrease in the expression of the aging-related gene RGN. Single-cell data analysis suggests that the reduced expression of YTHDC1 may decrease the degradation of inflammation-related factors in macrophages, leading to a highly inflammatory state in the carotid artery wall. Furthermore, the sustained release of inflammatory factors may increase the expression of the aging-related gene RGN in vascular smooth muscle cells, further exacerbating the progression of atherosclerosis.

38242891,"CHEK2 knockout is a therapeutic target for TP53-mutated hepatocellular carcinoma.","Cell Death Discov","Currently, there is still a lack of novel and effective drug targets to improve the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, the role of CHEK2 in HCC has not been reported yet. The eQTLgen database and two HCC Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) datasets (ieu-b-4953, ICD10 C22.0) were used to find the drug target: CHEK2. Next, Colony, Edu, β-gal, and cell cycle analysis were facilitated to evaluate the role of CHEK2 knockout in HCC. In addition, Nultin-3 was added to evaluate the apoptosis of TP53-mutated HCC cells with CHEK2 knockout. Furthermore, MitoSox, electron microscopy, mitochondrial ATP, and NADH+/NADH levels were assessed in the CHEK2 knockout HCC cells with or without Metformin. Finally, cell-derived tumor xenograft was used to evaluate the role of CHEK2 knockout in vivo. We initially identified a potential drug target, CHEK2, through GWAS data analysis. Furthermore, we observed a significant upregulation of CHEK2 expression in HCC, which was found to be correlated with a poor prognosis. Subsequently, the results indicated that knocking out CHEK2 selectively affects the proliferation, cell cycle, senescence, and apoptosis of TP53-mutant HCC cells. Additionally, the introduction of Nultin-3 further intensified the functional impact on TP53-mutant cells. Then ClusterProfiler results showed high CHEK2 and TP53 mutation group was positively enriched in the mitochondrial ATP pathway. Then we used MitoSox, electron microscopy, mitochondrial ATP, and NADH + /NADH assay and found knockout of CHECK could induce the ATP pathway to inhibit the growth of HCC. Our research introduces a novel drug target for TP53-mutant HCC cells via mitochondrial ATP, addressing the limitation of Nultin-3 as a standalone treatment that does not induce tumor cell death.© 2024.

38424499,"Genome-wide profiling of histone (H3) lysine 4 (K4) tri-methylation (me3) under drought, heat, and combined stresses in switchgrass.","BMC Genomics","Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a warm-season perennial (C4) grass identified as an important biofuel crop in the United States. It is well adapted to the marginal environment where heat and moisture stresses predominantly affect crop growth. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with heat and drought stress tolerance still need to be fully understood in switchgrass. The methylation of H3K4 is often associated with transcriptional activation of genes, including stress-responsive. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze genome-wide histone H3K4-tri-methylation in switchgrass under heat, drought, and combined stress.In total, ~ 1.3 million H3K4me3 peaks were identified in this study using SICER. Among them, 7,342; 6,510; and 8,536 peaks responded under drought (DT), drought and heat (DTHT), and heat (HT) stresses, respectively. Most DT and DTHT peaks spanned 0 to + 2000 bases from the transcription start site [TSS]. By comparing differentially marked peaks with RNA-Seq data, we identified peaks associated with genes: 155 DT-responsive peaks with 118 DT-responsive genes, 121 DTHT-responsive peaks with 110 DTHT-responsive genes, and 175 HT-responsive peaks with 136 HT-responsive genes. We have identified various transcription factors involved in DT, DTHT, and HT stresses. Gene Ontology analysis using the AgriGO revealed that most genes belonged to biological processes. Most annotated peaks belonged to metabolite interconversion, RNA metabolism, transporter, protein modifying, defense/immunity, membrane traffic protein, transmembrane signal receptor, and transcriptional regulator protein families. Further, we identified significant peaks associated with TFs, hormones, signaling, fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism, and secondary metabolites. qRT-PCR analysis revealed the relative expressions of six abiotic stress-responsive genes (transketolase, chromatin remodeling factor-CDH3, fatty-acid desaturase A, transmembrane protein 14C, beta-amylase 1, and integrase-type DNA binding protein genes) that were significantly (P < 0.05) marked during drought, heat, and combined stresses by comparing stress-induced against un-stressed and input controls.Our study provides a comprehensive and reproducible epigenomic analysis of drought, heat, and combined stress responses in switchgrass. Significant enrichment of H3K4me3 peaks downstream of the TSS of protein-coding genes was observed. In addition, the cost-effective experimental design, modified ChIP-Seq approach, and analyses presented here can serve as a prototype for other non-model plant species for conducting stress studies.© 2024.

38229153,"Pancreatic cancer acquires resistance to MAPK pathway inhibition by clonal expansion and adaptive DNA hypermethylation.","Clin Epigenetics","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with poor prognosis. It is marked by extraordinary resistance to conventional therapies including chemotherapy and radiation, as well as to essentially all targeted therapies evaluated so far. More than 90% of PDAC cases harbor an activating KRAS mutation. As the most common KRAS variants in PDAC remain undruggable so far, it seemed promising to inhibit a downstream target in the MAPK pathway such as MEK1/2, but up to now preclinical and clinical evaluation of MEK inhibitors (MEKi) failed due to inherent and acquired resistance mechanisms. To gain insights into molecular changes during the formation of resistance to oncogenic MAPK pathway inhibition, we utilized short-term passaged primary tumor cells from ten PDACs of genetically engineered mice. We followed gain and loss of resistance upon MEKiexposure and withdrawal by longitudinal integrative analysis of whole genome sequencing, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry data.We found that resistant cell populations under increasing MEKitreatment evolved by the expansion of a single clone but were not a direct consequence of known resistance-conferring mutations. Rather, resistant cells showed adaptive DNA hypermethylation of 209 and hypomethylation of 8 genomic sites, most of which overlap with regulatory elements known to be active in murine PDAC cells. Both DNA methylation changes and MEKiresistance were transient and reversible upon drug withdrawal. Furthermore, MEKiresistance could be reversed by DNA methyltransferase inhibition with remarkable sensitivity exclusively in the resistant cells.Overall, the concept of acquired therapy resistance as a result of the expansion of a single cell clone with epigenetic plasticity sheds light on genetic, epigenetic and phenotypic patterns during evolvement of treatment resistance in a tumor with high adaptive capabilities and provides potential for reversion through epigenetic targeting.© 2024.

38374595,"[Application advances of mass spectrometry imaging technology in environmental pollutants analysis and their toxicity research].","Se Pu","Environmental exposures have significant impacts on human health and can contribute to the occurrence and development of diseases. Pollutants can enter the body through ingestion, inhalation, dermal absorption, or mother-to-child transmission, and can metabolize and/or accumulate in different tissues and organs. These pollutants can recognize and interact with various biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites, disrupting biological processes and leading to adverse effects in living organisms. Thus, it is crucial to analysis the exogenous pollutants in the body, identify potential biomarkers and investigate their toxic effects. Numerous studies have shown that the metabolism rate of environmental pollutants greatly differs in various tissues and organs, their accumulation is also heterogeneous and dynamically changing. Moreover, the synthesis and accumulation of endogenous metabolites exhibit precise spatial distributions in tissues and cells. Mapping the spatial distributions of both pollutants and endogenous metabolites can discover relevant exposure biomarkers and provide a better understanding of their toxic effects and molecular mechanisms. Mass spectrometry is currently the preferred method for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of various compounds, and has been extensively utilized in pollutant and metabolomics analyses. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is an emerging technology for molecular imaging that combines the information obtained by mass spectrometry with the visualization of the two- and three-dimensional spatial distributions of various molecular species in thin sample sections. Unlike other molecular imaging techniques, MSI can perform the label-free and untargeted analysis of thousands of molecules, such as elements, metabolites, lipids, peptides, proteins, pollutants, and drugs, in a single experiment with high sensitivity and throughput. Different MSI technologies, such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging, secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging, desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging, and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry imaging, have been introduced for the mapping of compounds and elements in biological, medical, and clinical research. MSI technologies have recently been utilized to characterize the spatial distribution of pollutants in the whole body and specific tissues of organisms, assess the toxic effects of pollutants at the molecular level, and identify exposure biomarkers. Such developments have brought new perspectives to investigate the toxicity of environmental pollutants. In this review, we provide an overview of the principles, characteristics, mass analyzers, and workflows of different MSI techniques and introduce their latest application advances in the analysis of environmental pollutants and their toxic effects.",1.64134718691585e-69
38214013,"Role of oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disorders: a review of reactive oxygen species and prevention by antioxidants.","Brain Commun","Neurological disorders include a variety of conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, motor neuron disease and Parkinson's disease, affecting longevity and quality of life, and their pathogenesis is associated with oxidative stress. Several of the chronic neurodegenerative pathologies of the CNS share some common features, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, synapse dysfunctions, protein misfolding and defective autophagia. Neuroinflammation can involve the activation of mast cells, contributing to oxidative stress, in addition to other sources of reactive oxygen species. Antioxidants can powerfully neutralize reactive oxygen species and free radicals, decreasing oxidative damage. Antioxidant genes, like the manganese superoxide dismutase enzyme, can undergo epigenetic changes that reduce their expression, thus increasing oxidative stress in tissue. Alternatively, DNA can be altered by free radical damage. The epigenetic landscape of these genes can change antioxidant function and may result in neurodegenerative disease. This imbalance of free radical production and antioxidant function increases the reactive oxygen species that cause cell damage in neurons and is often observed as an age-related event. Increased antioxidant expression in mice is protective against reactive oxygen species in neurons as is the exogenous supplementation of antioxidants. Manganese superoxide dismutase requires manganese for its enzymic function. Antioxidant therapy is considered for age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and a new mimetic of a manganese superoxide dismutase, avasopasem manganese, is described and suggested as a putative treatment to reduce the oxidative stress that causes neurodegenerative disease. The aim of this narrative review is to explore the evidence that oxidative stress causes neurodegenerative damage and the role of antioxidant genes in inhibiting reactive oxygen species damage.

To uncover the unique markers predicting prognosis and immune therapy response, the accurate quantification of pathway mutations are required to evaluate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune escape. Yet, there is a lack of score to accurately quantify pathway mutations.Firstly, we proposed Individualized Weighted Hallmark Gene Set Mutation Burden (IWHMB, https://github.com/YuHongHuang-lab/IWHMB ) which integrated pathway structure information and eliminated the interference of global Tumor Mutation Burden to accurately quantify pathway mutations. Subsequently, to further elucidate the association of IWHMB with EMT and immune escape, support vector machine regression model was used to identify IWHMB-related transcriptomic features (IRG), while Adversarially Regularized Graph Autoencoder (ARVGA) was used to further resolve IRG network features. Finally, Random walk with restart algorithm was used to identify biomarkers for predicting ICI response.We quantified the HNSCC pathway mutation signatures and identified pathway mutation subtypes using IWHMB. The IWHMB-related transcriptomic features (IRG) identified by support vector machine regression were divided into 5 communities by ARVGA, among which the Community 1 enriching malignant mesenchymal components promoted EMT dynamically and regulated immune patterns associated with ICI responses. Bridge Hub Gene (BHG) identified by random walk with restart was key to IWHMB in EMT and immune escape, thus, more predictive for ICI response than other 70 public signatures.In summary, the novel pathway mutation scoring-IWHMB suggested that the elevated malignancy mediated by pathway mutations is a major cause of poor prognosis and immunotherapy failure in HNSCC, and is capable of identifying novel biomarkers to predict immunotherapy response.© 2024.

Several studies have demonstrated the involvement of pro-inflammatory glial subsets in the pathogenesis and propagation of inflammatory events in MS and its animal models. However, it has only recently become clear that the underlying heterogeneity of astrocytes and microglia can not only drive inflammation, but also lead to its resolution through direct and indirect mechanisms. Failure of these tissue-protective mechanisms may potentiate disease and increase the risk of conversion to progressive stages of MS, for which currently available therapies are limited. Using proteomic analyses of cerebrospinal fluid specimens from patients with MS in combination with experimental studies, we here identify Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) as a central mediator of tissue-protective and anti-inflammatory effects important for the recovery from acute inflammatory lesions in CNS autoimmunity. Hypoxic conditions drive the rapid upregulation of HB-EGF by astrocytes during early CNS inflammation, while pro-inflammatory conditions suppress trophic HB-EGF signaling through epigenetic modifications. Finally, we demonstrate both anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective effects of HB-EGF in a broad variety of cell types in vitro and use intranasal administration of HB-EGF in acute and post-acute stages of autoimmune neuroinflammation to attenuate disease in a preclinical mouse model of MS. Altogether, we identify astrocyte-derived HB-EGF and its epigenetic regulation as a modulator of autoimmune CNS inflammation and potential therapeutic target in MS.© 2024.

38349551,"Stromal Signals Dominate Gene Expression Signature Scores That Aim to Describe Cancer Cell-intrinsic Stemness or Mesenchymality Characteristics.","Cancer Res Commun","Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells confers migratory abilities, a crucial aspect in the metastasis of tumors that frequently leads to death. In multiple studies, authors proposed gene expression signatures for EMT, stemness, or mesenchymality of tumors based on bulk tumor expression profiling. However, recent studies suggested that noncancerous cells from the microenvironment or macroenvironment heavily influence such signature profiles. Here, we strengthen these findings by investigating 11 published and frequently referenced gene expression signatures that were proposed to describe EMT-related (EMT, mesenchymal, or stemness) characteristics in various cancer types. By analyses of bulk, single-cell, and pseudobulk expression data, we show that the cell type composition of a tumor sample frequently dominates scores of these EMT-related signatures. A comprehensive, integrated analysis of bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA-seq data shows that stromal cells, most often fibroblasts, are the main drivers of EMT-related signature scores. We call attention to the risk of false conclusions about tumor properties when interpreting EMT-related signatures, especially in a clinical setting: high patient scores of EMT-related signatures or calls of ""stemness subtypes"" often result from low cancer cell content in tumor biopsies rather than cancer cell-specific stemness or mesenchymal/EMT characteristics.Cancer self-renewal and migratory abilities are often characterized via gene module expression profiles, also called EMT or stemness gene expression signatures. Using published clinical tumor samples, cancer cell lines, and single cancer cells, we highlight the dominating influence of noncancer cells in low cancer cell content biopsies on their scores. We caution on their application for low cancer cell content clinical cancer samples with the intent to assign such characteristics or subtypes.© 2024 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.",4.26002943358991e-71

The vast genetic and metabolic potential of the gut microbiome underpins its ubiquity in nearly every aspect of human biology, including health maintenance, development, aging, and disease. The advent of new sequencing technologies and culture-independent methods has allowed researchers to move beyond correlative studies toward mechanistic explorations to shed light on microbiome-host interactions. Evidence has unveiled the bidirectional communication between the gut microbiome and the central nervous system, referred to as the ""microbiota-gut-brain axis"". The microbiota-gut-brain axis represents an important regulator of glial functions, making it an actionable target to ameliorate the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in neurodegenerative diseases. As the gut microbiome provides essential cues to microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, we examine the communications between gut microbiota and these glial cells during healthy states and neurodegenerative diseases. Subsequently, we discuss the mechanisms of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in neurodegenerative diseases using a metabolite-centric approach, while also examining the role of gut microbiota-related neurotransmitters and gut hormones. Next, we examine the potential of targeting the intestinal barrier, blood-brain barrier, meninges, and peripheral immune system to counteract glial dysfunction in neurodegeneration. Finally, we conclude by assessing the pre-clinical and clinical evidence of probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation in neurodegenerative diseases. A thorough comprehension of the microbiota-gut-brain axis will foster the development of effective therapeutic interventions for the management of neurodegenerative diseases.© 2024.

This study aimed to construct immune-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) signature and radiomics signature to probe the prognosis and immune infiltration of GBM patients.We downloaded GBM RNA-seq data and clinical information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project database, and MRI data were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Then, we conducted a cox regression analysis to establish the immune-related lncRNAs signature and radiomics signature. Afterward, we employed a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to explore the biological processes and pathways. Besides, we used CIBERSORT to estimate the abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs). Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between the immune-related lncRNAs signature, radiomics signature and immune checkpoint genes. Finally, we constructed a multifactors prognostic model and compared it with the clinical prognostic model.We identified four immune-related lncRNAs and two radiomics features, which show the ability to stratify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different survival rates. The risk score curves and Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed that the immune-related lncRNAs signature and radiomics signature were a novel independent prognostic factor in GBM patients. The GSEA suggested that the immune-related lncRNAs signature were involved in L1 cell adhesion molecular (L1CAM) interactions and the radiomics signature were involved signaling by Robo receptors. Besides, the two signatures was associated with the infiltration of immune cells. Furthermore, they were linked with the expression of critical immune genes and could predict immunotherapy's clinical response. Finally, the area under the curve (AUC) (0.890,0.887) and C-index (0.737,0.817) of the multifactors prognostic model were greater than those of the clinical prognostic model in both the training and validation sets, indicated significantly improved discrimination.We identified the immune-related lncRNAs signature and tradiomics signature that can predict the outcomes, immune cell infiltration, and immunotherapy response in patients with GBM.© 2024.

38157378,"Recurrence risk stratification of hepatocellular carcinomas based on immune gene expression and features extracted from pathological images.","PLoS Comput Biol","Immune-based therapy is a promising type of treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but has only been partially successful due to the high heterogeneity in HCC tumor. The differences in the degree of tumor cell progression and in the activity of tumor immune microenvironment could lead to varied clinical outcome. Accurate subgrouping for recurrence risk is an approach to address the issue of such heterogeneity. It remains under investigation as whether integrating quantitative whole slide image (WSI) features with the expression profile of immune marker genes can improve the risk stratification, and whether clinical outcome prediction can assist in understanding molecular biology that drives the outcome.We included a total of 231 patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) project. For each patient, we extracted 18 statistical metrics corresponding to a global region of interest and 135 features regarding nucleus shape from WSI. A risk score was developed using these image features with high-dimensional survival modeling. We also introduced into the model the expression profile of 66 representative marker genes relevant to currently available immunotherapies. We stratified all patients into higher and lower-risk subgroup based on the final risk score selected from multiple models generated, and further investigated underlying molecular mechanisms associated with the risk stratification.One WSI feature and three immune marker genes were selected into the final recurrence-free survival (RFS) prediction model following the best integrated modeling framework. The resultant score showed a significantly improved prediction performance on the test dataset (mean time-dependent AUCs = 0.707) as compared to those of other types (e.g: mean time-dependent AUCs of AJCC tumor stage = 0.525) of input data integration. To assess that the risk score could provide a higher-resolution risk stratification, a lower-risk subgroup (or a higher-risk subgroup) was arbitrarily assigned according to score falling below (or above) the median score. The lower risk subgroup had significantly longer median RFS time than that of the higher-risk patients (median RFS = 903 vs. 265 days, log-rank test p-value< 0.0001). Additionally, the higher-risk subgroup, in contrast to the lower-risk patients were characterized with a significant downregulation of immune checkpoint genes, suppressive signal in tumor immune response pathways, and depletion of CD8 T cells. These observations for the higher-risk subgroup suggest that new targets for adoptive or checkpoint-based combined systemic therapies may be useful.We developed a novel prognostic model to predict RFS for HCC patients, using one feature that can be automatically extracted from routine histopathological images, as well as the expression profiles of three immune marker genes. The methodology used in this paper demonstrates the feasibility of developing prognostic models that provide both useful risk stratification along with valuable biological insights into the underlying characteristics of the subgroups identified.Copyright: © 2023 Ding et al.

Interestingly, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators of lipid metabolism, exerting notable impacts on tumor proliferation. Nevertheless, the involvement of RPARP-AS1, a novel lipid metabolism-associated lncRNA, remains unexplored in the context of OS. This study aims to identify functionally relevant lncRNAs impacting OS proliferation and lipid metabolism and seeks to shed light on the upstream regulatory mechanisms governing lipogenic enzyme activity. Based on comprehensive bioinformatic analysis and the establishment of a risk model, we identified seven lncRNAs significantly associated with clinical characteristics and lipid metabolism-related genes in patients with OS. Among these, RPARP-AS1 was selected for in-depth investigation regarding its roles in OS proliferation and lipid metabolism. Experimental techniques including RT-qPCR, Western blot, cell viability assay, assessment, and quantification of free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglycerides (TGs) were utilized to elucidate the functional significance of RPARP-AS1 in OS cells and validate its effects on lipid metabolism. Manipulation of RPARP-AS1 expression via ectopic expression or siRNA-mediated knockdown led to alterations in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and expression of apoptosis-associated proteins, thereby influencing OS cell proliferation and apoptosis. Mechanistically, RPARP-AS1 was found to augment the expression of key lipogenic enzymes (FABP4, MAGL, and SCD1) and potentially modulate the Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby contributing to lipid metabolism (involving alterations in FFA and TG levels) in OS cells. Collectively, our findings establish RPARP-AS1 as a novel oncogene in OS cells and suggest its role in fostering tumor growth through the enhancement of lipid metabolism.© 2024.

Currently, the lack of advanced stratification models makes personalized therapy difficult. This study aims to identify novel biomarkers to stratify high-risk OSA patients and guide treatment.We combined 10 machine-learning algorithms into 101 combinations, from which the optimal model was established for predicting overall survival based on transcriptomic profiles for 254 samples. Alterations in transcriptomic, genomic and epigenomic landscapes were assessed to elucidate mechanisms driving poor prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) unveiled genes overexpressed in OSA cells as potential therapeutic targets, one of which was validated via tissue staining, knockdown and pharmacological inhibition. We characterized changes in multiple phenotypes, including proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, chemosensitivity and in vivo tumourigenicity. RNA-seq and Western blotting elucidated the impact of squalene epoxidase (SQLE) suppression on signalling pathways.The artificial intelligence-derived prognostic index (AIDPI), generated by our model, was an independent prognostic biomarker, outperforming clinicopathological factors and previously published signatures. Incorporating the AIDPI with clinical factors into a nomogram improved predictive accuracy. For user convenience, both the model and nomogram are accessible online. Patients in the high-AIDPI group exhibited chemoresistance, coupled with overexpression of MYC and SQLE, increased mTORC1 signalling, disrupted PI3K-Akt signalling, and diminished immune infiltration. ScRNA-seq revealed high expression of MYC and SQLE in OSA cells. Elevated SQLE expression correlated with chemoresistance and worse outcomes in OSA patients. Therapeutically, silencing SQLE suppressed OSA malignancy and enhanced chemosensitivity, mediated by cholesterol depletion and suppression of the FAK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, the SQLE-specific inhibitor FR194738 demonstrated anti-OSA effects in vivo and exhibited synergistic effects with chemotherapeutic agents.AIDPI is a robust biomarker for identifying the high-risk subset of OSA patients.

38397950,"Cutaneous Redox Senescence.","Biomedicines","Our current understanding of skin cell senescence involves the role of environmental stressors (UV, O3, cigarette smoke, particulate matter, etc.), lifestyle (diet, exercise, etc.) as well as genetic factors (metabolic changes, hormonal, etc.). The common mechanism of action of these stressors is the disturbance of cellular redox balance characterized by increased free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and when these overload the intrinsic antioxidant defense system, it can lead to an oxidative stress cellular condition. The main redox mechanisms that activate cellular senescence in the skin involve (1) the oxidative damage of telomeres causing their shortening; (2) the oxidation of proteomes and DNA damage; (3) an a in lysosomal mass through the increased activity of resident enzymes such as senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) as well as other proteins that are products of lysosomal activity; (4) and the increased expression of SASP, in particular pro-inflammatory cytokines transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB. However, the main targets of ROS on the skin are the proteome (oxi-proteome), followed by telomeres, nucleic acids (DNAs), lipids, proteins, and cytoplasmic organelles. As a result, cell cycle arrest pathways, lipid peroxidation, increased lysosomal content and dysfunctional mitochondria, and SASP synthesis occur. Furthermore, oxidative stress in skin cells increases the activity of p16INK4Aand p53 as inhibitors of Rb and CDks, which are important for maintaining the cell cycle. p53 also promotes the inactivation of mTOR-mediated autophagic and apoptotic pathways, leading to senescence. However, these markers alone cannot establish the state of cellular senescence, and multiple analyses are encouraged for confirmation. An updated and more comprehensive approach to investigating skin senescence should include further assays of ox-inflammatory molecular pathways that can consolidate the understanding of cutaneous redox senescence.",7.69003509535346e-76
38326859,"DNA hypomethylation promotes the expression of CASPASE-4 which exacerbates inflammation and amyloid-Î² deposition in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimers Res Ther","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the USA. It is established that neuroinflammation contributes to the synaptic loss, neuronal death, and symptomatic decline of AD patients. Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role for microglia, innate immune phagocytes of the brain. For instance, microglia release pro-inflammatory products such as IL-1β which is highly implicated in AD pathobiology. The mechanisms underlying the transition of microglia to proinflammatory promoters of AD remain largely unknown. To address this gap, we performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to profile global DNA methylation changes in human AD brains compared to no disease controls. We identified differential DNA methylation of CASPASE-4 (CASP4), which when expressed promotes the generation of IL-1β and is predominantly expressed in immune cells. DNA upstream of the CASP4 transcription start site was hypomethylated in human AD brains, which was correlated with increased expression of CASP4. Furthermore, microglia from a mouse model of AD (5xFAD) express increased levels of CASP4 compared to wild-type (WT) mice. To study the role of CASP4 in AD, we developed a novel mouse model of AD lacking the mouse ortholog of CASP4 and CASP11, which is encoded by mouse Caspase-4 (5xFAD/Casp4-/-). The expression of CASP11 was associated with increased accumulation of pathologic protein aggregate amyloid-β (Aβ) and increased microglial production of IL-1β in 5xFAD mice. Utilizing RNA-sequencing, we determined that CASP11 promotes unique transcriptomic phenotypes in 5xFAD mouse brains, including alterations of neuroinflammatory and chemokine signaling pathways. Notably, in vitro, CASP11 promoted generation of IL-1β from macrophages in response to cytosolic Aβ through cleavage of downstream effector Gasdermin D (GSDMD). Therefore, here we unravel the role for CASP11 and GSDMD in the generation of IL-1β in response to Aβ and the progression of pathologic inflammation in AD. Overall, our results demonstrate that overexpression of CASP4 due to differential DNA methylation in AD microglia contributes to the progression of AD pathobiology. Thus, we identify CASP4 as a potential target for immunotherapies for the treatment and prevention of AD.© 2024. The Author(s).",6.63292395664373e-76

38238834,"MTFR2-dependent mitochondrial fission promotes HCC progression.","J Transl Med","The role of mitochondrial dynamics, encompassing fission, fusion, and mitophagy, in cancer progression has been extensively studied. However, the specific impact of mitochondrial dynamics on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still under investigation.In this study, mitochondrial dynamic genes were obtained from the MitoCarta 3.0 database, and gene expression data were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Based on the expression of these dynamic genes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), patients were stratified into two clusters. Subsequently, a prognostic model was constructed using univariate COX regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, and the prognostic signature was evaluated. We analyzed the interaction between these model genes and dynamic genes to identify hub genes and reveal mitochondrial status. Furthermore, we assessed immune infiltration, tumor mutational burden (TMB), tumor stemness indices (TSI), and the response to immune checkpoint block (ICB) therapy using the TIDE algorithm and risk scores. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting (WB), and immunofluorescence (IF) were conducted to afford detailed visualization of the morphology of the mitochondria and the expression patterns of fission-associated proteins.Patients in Cluster 2 exhibited heightened mitochondrial fission and had a worse prognosis. The up-regulated dynamic genes in Cluster 2 were identified as fission genes. GO/KEGG analyses reconfirmed the connection of Cluster 2 to augmented mitochondrial fission activities. Subsequently, a ten-gene prognostic signature based on the differentially expressed genes between the two clusters was generated, with all ten genes being up-regulated in the high-risk group. Moreover, the potential links between these ten signature genes and mitochondrial dynamics were explored, suggesting their involvement in mediating mitochondrial fission through interaction with MTFR2. Further investigation revealed that the high-risk group had an unfavorable prognosis, with a higher mutation frequency of TP53, increased immune checkpoint expression, a higher TIS score, and a lower TIDE score. The mitochondrial imbalance characterized by increased fission and upregulated MTFR2 and DNM1L expression was substantiated in both HCC specimens and cell lines.In conclusion, we developed a novel MTFR2-related prognostic signature comprising ten mitochondrial dynamics genes. These genes play crucial roles in mitochondrial fission and have the potential to serve as important predictors and therapeutic targets for HCC.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.25934827982484e-76
38196528,"Identification of potential prognostic biomarkers among gene models for coiled-coil domain-containing family members in hepatocellular carcinoma elucidates their influence on the hypoxia pathway and immune microenvironment.","J Gastrointest Oncol","The family of coiled-coil domain-containing (CCDC) proteins participates in a wide range of physiological functions and plays a pivotal role in governing the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumor cells. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism governing the interaction among the immune microenvironment, hypoxia pathway, and proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains elusive. In this study, our objective was to identify the prognostic significance of CCDC family genes in HCC.We conducted an analysis of RNA-seq data from HCC patients sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Our analysis involved comparing the expression profiles of 168 CCDC family genes between tumor and normal tissues to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The prognostic value of these genes was verified using overall survival (OS) data from TCGA-LIHC patients, employing Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier plots. Subsequently, we constructed a prognostic signature known as the CCDC score and validated it using additional datasets (ICGC-LIRI-JP and GSE14520). Additionally, we performed functional enrichment analysis and conducted an assessment of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME).We identified 34 DEGs of the CCDC family. Among them, six DEGs (CCDC6/22/51/59/132/134) were upregulated and associated with poor prognosis. Higher CCDC score was an independent predictor of poor OS in TCGA-HCC patients (P<0.001, HR =2.37), which was validated in the ICGC-LIRI-JP (P=0.021, HR =2.15) and GSE14520 (P=0.002, HR =2.23) datasets. Functional enrichment analysis showed that hypoxia pathway genes were enriched in the high CCDC score group. Furthermore, immune microenvironment analysis demonstrated that high CCDC score was associated with a suppressed TIME caused by the extrinsic immune escape.The CCDC score, derived from six CCDC genes, exhibits remarkable expression levels in liver cancer and holds promise as an independent prognostic indicator. Our bioinformatics analysis revealed a high CCDC score is strongly associated with activation of the hypoxia pathway and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in HCC. This profound finding may serve as a cornerstone for innovative targeted drug therapies and pave the way for further investigations into the underlying mechanisms of CCDC-related carcinogenesis in liver cancer.2023 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

38292838,"Analysis of the potential biological value of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit Î² in human cancer.","World J Gastrointest Oncol","The pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 subunit β (PDHB) gene which regulates energy metabolism is located in mitochondria. However, few studies have elucidated the role and mechanism of PDHB in different cancers.To comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of PDHB was performed based on bioinformatics approaches to explore its tumor diagnostic and prognostic value and tumor immune relevance in cancer.In vitroexperiments were performed to examine the biological regulation of PDHB in liver cancer.Pan-cancer data related to PDHB were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Analysis of the gene expression profiles of PDHB was based on TCGA and Genotype Tissue Expression Dataset databases. Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to assess the correlation between PDHB expression and survival prognosis in cancer patients. The correlation between PDHB and receiver operating characteristic diagnostic curve, clinicopathological staging, somatic mutation, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA methylation, and drug susceptibility in pan-cancer was also analyzed. Various algorithms were used to analyze the correlation between PDHB and immune cell infiltration and tumor chemotaxis environment, as well as the co-expression analysis of PDHB and immune checkpoint (ICP) genes. The expression and functional phenotype of PDHB in single tumor cells were studied by single-cell sequencing, and the functional enrichment analysis of PDHB-related genes was performed. The study also validated the level of mRNA or protein expression of PDHB in several cancers. Finally,in vitroexperiments verified the regulatory effect of PDHB on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of liver cancer.PDHB was significantly and differently expressed in most cancers. PDHB was significantly associated with prognosis in patients with a wide range of cancers, including kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma, and brain lower grade glioma. In some cancers, PDHB expression was clearly associated with gene mutations, clinicopathological stages, and expression of TMB, MSI, and ICP genes. The expression of PDHB was closely related to the infiltration of multiple immune cells in the immune microenvironment and the regulation of tumor chemotaxis environment. In addition, single-cell sequencing results showed that PDHB correlated with different biological phenotypes of multiple cancer single cells. This study further demonstrated that down-regulation of PDHB expression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion functions of hepatoma cells.As a member of pan-cancer, PDHB may be a novel cancer marker with potential value in diagnosing cancer, predicting prognosis, and in targeted therapy.©The Author(s) 2024.

This study verified NAFLD pathogenesis via mitochondrial functions in hepatic pathological abnormalities, liver index and weight, body weight, serum biochemical indexes, oxidative stress indicators, mitochondrial function indexes, and related signaling pathways. The effect of fenofibrate intervention was investigated in NAFLD model mice. In vitro, four groups based on HepG2 cells were generated, including controls, the FFA model (1.5 mmol/L FFA incubation for 24 h), LV-PGC-1α intervention (similar to the FFA model one after PPARGC1A lentivirus transfection), and LV control intervention (similar to the FFA model one after negative control lentivirus transfection) groups. The study investigated the mechanism of PGC-1α related to lipid decomposition and mitochondrial biosynthesis by Oil red O staining, colorimetry and western blot.In vivo experiments, a high-fat diet achieved remarkable changes regarding liver weight, liver index, serum biochemical indicators, oxidative stress indicators, liver pathological changes, mitochondrial function indicators, and body weight of the NAFLD model mice while fenofibrate improved the objective indicators. In the HepG2 cells model, the lipid accumulation increased significantly within the FFA model group, together with aggravated hepatocytic damage and boosted oxidative stress levels. Moreover, FFA induced excessive mitosis into fragmented in mitochondrial morphology, ATP content in cells decreased, mtDNA replication fold decreased, the expression of lipid decomposition protein PPARα reduced, mitochondrial biosynthesis related protein PGC-1α, NRF-1 and TFAM decreased. PGC-1α overexpression inhibited lipid deposition by improving mitochondrial biosynthesis and lipid decomposition.Fenofibrate up-regulated PPARα/PGC-1α signaling pathway, promoted mitochondrial β-oxidation, reduced oxidative stress damage and lipid accumulation of liver. PGC-1α overexpression enhanced mitochondrial biosynthesis and ATP production, and reduced HepG2 intracellular accumulation of lipids and oxidative stress.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.99450211480545e-79

Herein, we aimed to determine the effects of Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) combined with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) on the intestinal barrier function of antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis neonatal mice.An antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis neonatal mouse model was created using antibiotic cocktails, and the model mice were randomized into the control, AI-2, LGG, and LGG + AI-2 groups. Intestinal short-chain fatty acids and AI-2 concentrations were detected by mass spectrometry and chemiluminescence, respectively. The community composition of the gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rDNA sequencing, and biofilm thickness and bacterial adhesion in the colon were assessed using scanning electron microscopy. Transcriptome RNA sequencing of intestinal tissues was performed, and the mRNA and protein levels of HCAR2 (hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2), claudin3, and claudin4 in intestinal tissues were determined using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR and western blotting. The levels of inflammatory factors in intestinal tissues were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). D-ribose, an inhibitor of AI-2, was used to treat Caco-2 cells in vitro.Compared with the control, AI-2, and LGG groups, the LGG + AI-2 group showed increased levels of intestinal AI-2 and proportions of Firmicutes and Lacticaseibacillus, but a reduced fraction of Proteobacteria. Specifically, the LGG + AI-2 group had considerably more biofilms and LGG on the colon surface than those of other three groups. Meanwhile, the combination of AI-2 and LGG markedly increased the concentration of butyric acid and promoted Hcar2, claudin3 and claudin4 expression levels compared with supplementation with LGG or AI-2 alone. The ELISAs revealed a significantly higher tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) level in the control group than in the LGG and LGG + AI-2 groups, whereas the interleukin 10 (IL-10) level was significantly higher in the LGG + AI-2 group than in the other three groups. In vitro, D-ribose treatment dramatically suppressed the increased levels of Hcar2, claudin3, and claudin4 in Caco-2 cells induced by AI-2 + LGG.AI-2 promotes the colonization of LGG and biofilm formation to improve intestinal barrier function in an antibiotic-induced intestinal dysbiosis neonatal mouse model.© 2024.

Yet, the functional roles of most lncRNAs remain enigmatic. To address the need to identify new druggable lncRNAs, we developed a comprehensive approach integrating transcription factor binding data with other genetic features to generate a machine learning model, which we have called INFLAMeR (Identifying Novel Functional LncRNAs with Advanced Machine Learning Resources).INFLAMeR was trained on high-throughput CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens across seven cell lines, and the algorithm was based on 71 genetic features. To validate the predictions, we selected candidate lncRNAs in the human K562 leukemia cell line and determined the impact of their knockdown (KD) on cell proliferation and chemotherapeutic drug response. We further performed transcriptomic analysis for candidate genes. Based on these findings, we assessed the lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 6 (SNHG6) for its role in myeloid differentiation. Finally, we established a mouse K562 leukemia xenograft model to determine whether SNHG6 KD attenuates tumor growth in vivo.The INFLAMeR model successfully reconstituted CRISPRi screening data and predicted functional lncRNAs that were previously overlooked. Intensive cell-based and transcriptomic validation of nearly fifty genes in K562 revealed cell type-specific functionality for 85% of the predicted lncRNAs. In this respect, our cell-based and transcriptomic analyses predicted a role for SNHG6 in hematopoiesis and leukemia. Consistent with its predicted role in hematopoietic differentiation, SNHG6 transcription is regulated by hematopoiesis-associated transcription factors. SNHG6 KD reduced the proliferation of leukemia cells and sensitized them to differentiation. Treatment of K562 leukemic cells with hemin and PMA, respectively, demonstrated that SNHG6 inhibits red blood cell differentiation but strongly promotes megakaryocyte differentiation. Using a xenograft mouse model, we demonstrate that SNHG6 KD attenuated tumor growth in vivo.Our approach not only improved the identification and characterization of functional lncRNAs through genomic approaches in a cell type-specific manner, but also identified new lncRNAs with roles in hematopoiesis and leukemia. Such approaches can be readily applied to identify novel targets for precision medicine.© 2024. The Author(s).",8.20814656137756e-80
38290592,"Transcriptome-wide N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation profiling of long non-coding RNAs in ovarian endometriosis.","Genomics","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is the most prevalent internal epigenetic posttranscriptional mechanism for regulating mammalian RNA. Despite recent advances in determining the biological functions of m6A methylation, its association with the pathology of ovarian endometriosis remains uncertain. Herein, we performed m6A transcriptome-wide profiling to identify key lncRNAs with m6A modification involved in ovarian endometriosis development by bioinformatics analysis. We found the total m6A level was lower in ovarian endometriosis than in normal endometrium samples, with 9663 m6A peaks associated with 8989 lncRNAs detected in ovarian endometriosis and 9902 m6A peaks associated with 9210 lncRNAs detected in normal endometrium samples. These m6A peaks were primarily enriched within AAACU motifs. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that pathways involving the regulation of adhesion and development were significantly enriched in these differentially methylated lncRNAs. The regulatory relationships among lncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and mRNAs were identified by competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) analysis and determination of the network regulating lncRNA-mRNA expression. Several specific lncRNA, including LINC00665, LINC00937, FZD10-AS1, DIO3OS and GATA2-AS1 which were differently expressed and modified by m6A, were validated using qRT-PCR and its interaction with infiltrating immune cells was explored. Furthermore, we found LncRNA DIO3OS promotes the invasion and migration of Human endometrial stromal cells (THESCs) and ALKBH5 regulates the expression of the lncRNA DIO3OS through m6A modification in vitro. Our study firstly revealed the transcriptome-wide map of m6A modification in lncRNAs of ovarian endometriosis. These findings may enable the determination of the underlying mechanism governing the pathogenesis of ovarian endometriosis and provide theoretical basis for further deeper research on the role of m6A in the development of ovarian endometriosis.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

Over the last two decades, advances in molecular diagnostic techniques, particularly the integration of next-generation sequencing in clinical laboratories, have revolutionized the diagnosis, classification, and clinical decision making of myelofibrosis. Driver mutations involvingJAK2,CALR, andMPLinduce hyperactivity in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, which plays a central role in cell survival and proliferation. Approximately 80% of myelofibrosis cases harbor additional mutations, frequently in the genes responsible for epigenetic regulation and RNA splicing. Detecting these mutations is crucial for diagnosing myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), especially in cases where no mutations are present in the three driver genes (triple-negative MPNs). While fibrosis in the bone marrow results from the disturbance of inflammatory cytokines, it is fundamentally associated with mutation-driven hematopoiesis. The mutation profile and order of acquiring diverse mutations influence the MPN phenotype. Mutation profiling reveals clonal diversity in MF, offering insights into the clonal evolution of neoplastic progression. Prognostic prediction plays a pivotal role in guiding the treatment of myelofibrosis. Mutation profiles and cytogenetic abnormalities have been integrated into advanced prognostic scoring systems and personalized risk stratification for MF. Presently, JAK inhibitors are part of the standard of care for MF, with newer generations developed for enhanced efficacy and reduced adverse effects. However, only a minority of patients have achieved a significant molecular-level response. Clinical trials exploring innovative approaches, such as combining hypomethylation agents that target epigenetic regulators, drugs proven effective in myelodysplastic syndrome, or immune and inflammatory modulators with JAK inhibitors, have demonstrated promising results. These combinations may be more effective in patients with high-risk mutations and complex mutation profiles. Expanding mutation profiling studies with more sensitive and specific molecular methods, as well as sequencing a broader spectrum of genes in clinical patients, may reveal molecular mechanisms in cases currently lacking detectable driver mutations, provide a better understanding of the association between genetic alterations and clinical phenotypes, and offer valuable information to advance personalized treatment protocols to improve long-term survival and eradicate mutant clones with the hope of curing MF.",1.84870265469445e-87
38373903,"A genome-wide study of the lipoxygenase gene families in Medicago truncatula and Medicago sativa reveals that MtLOX24 participates in the methyl jasmonate response.","BMC Genomics","Lipoxygenase (LOX) is a multifunctional enzyme that is primarily related to plant organ growth and development, biotic and abiotic stress responses, and production of flavor-associated metabolites. In higher plants, the LOX family encompasses several isozymes with varying expression patterns between tissues and developmental stages. These affect processes including seed germination, seed storage, seedling growth, fruit ripening, and leaf senescence. LOX family genes have multiple functions in response to hormones such as methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid.In this study, we identified 30 and 95 LOX homologs in Medicago truncatula and Medicago sativa, respectively. These genes were characterized with analyses of their basic physical and chemical properties, structures, chromosomal distributions, and phylogenetic relationships to understand structural variations and their physical locations. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted for members of the three LOX subfamilies (9-LOX, type I 13-LOX, and type II 13-LOX) in Arabidopsis thaliana, Glycine max, M. truncatula, and M. sativa. Analysis of predicted promoter elements revealed several relevant cis-acting elements in MtLOX and MsLOX genes, including abscisic acid (ABA) response elements (ABREs), MeJA response elements (CGTCA-motifs), and antioxidant response elements (AREs). Cis-element data combined with transcriptomic data demonstrated that LOX gene family members in these species were most likely related to abiotic stress responses, hormone responses, and plant development. Gene expression patterns were confirmed via quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Several MtLOX genes (namely MtLOX15, MtLOX16, MtLOX20, and MtLOX24) belonging to the type I 13-LOX subfamily and other LOX genes (MtLOX7, MtLOX11, MsLOX23, MsLOX87, MsLOX90, and MsLOX94) showed significantly different expression levels in the flower tissue, suggesting roles in reproductive growth. Type I 13-LOXs (MtLOX16, MtLOX20, MtLOX21, MtLOX24, MsLOX57, MsLOX84, MsLOX85, and MsLOX94) and type II 13-LOXs (MtLOX5, MtLOX6, MtLOX9, MtLOX10, MsLOX18, MsLOX23, and MsLOX30) were MeJA-inducible and were predicted to function in the jasmonic acid signaling pathway. Furthermore, exogenous MtLOX24 expression in Arabidopsis verified that MtLOX24 was involved in MeJA responses, which may be related to insect-induced abiotic stress.We identified six and four LOX genes specifically expressed in the flowers of M. truncatula and M. sativa, respectively. Eight and seven LOX genes were induced by MeJA in M. truncatula and M. sativa, and the LOX genes identified were mainly distributed in the type I and type II 13-LOX subfamilies. MtLOX24 was up-regulated at 8 h after MeJA induction, and exogenous expression in Arabidopsis demonstrated that MtLOX24 promoted resistance to MeJA-induced stress.

Aberrant SGOL1 expression was reported to be closely correlated with the malignant progression of various tumors. However, the expression pattern and biological function of SGOL1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) are unclear.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases provide mRNA expression data and outcome information for ccRCC patients. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of ccRCC tissue chips verified SGOL1 protein expression in ccRCC patients. Data processing and visualization were performed with the UALCAN, TISIDB, TIMER, GSCA, LinkedOmics, and starBase databases. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were used to identify SGOL1-related biological functions and signaling pathways. Immune infiltration analysis was performed using the TISIDB database, ssGSEA algorithm, and TCGA-KIRC cohort. The biological role of SGOL1 in ccRCC was investigated using a series of in vitro cytological assays, including the MTT assay, EdU staining assay, flow cytometry analysis, Transwell assay, and wound healing assay.SGOL1 was highly expressed in ccRCC and linked to adverse clinicopathological parameters and unfavorable prognosis. Multivariate logistic regression and nomogram calibration suggested that SGOL1 might serve as an independent and reliable prognostic predictor of ccRCC. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that SGOL1 may be involved in the cell cycle, the p53 pathway, DNA replication, and T-cell activation. Furthermore, tumor microenvironment (TME) analysis suggested that SGOL1 was positively associated with Treg infiltration and immune checkpoint upregulation. In addition, we identified a potential SNHG17/PVT1/ZMIZ1-AS1-miR-23b-3p-SGOL1 axis correlated with ccRCC carcinogenesis and progression. Finally, we demonstrated that SGOL1 promoted ccRCC cell proliferation, migratory capacity, and invasion in vitro.SGOL1 potentially functions as an oncogene in ccRCC progression and might contribute to the immunosuppressive TME by increasing Treg infiltration and checkpoint expression, suggesting that targeting SGOL1 could be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ccRCC patients.© 2024.

38321173,"Systematic pan-cancer analyses of the potential function of the Golgi scaffold protein PAQR3.","Sci Rep","Progesterone and AdipoQ Receptor 3 (PAQR3) is a member of the AdipoQ receptor. Our previous studies have found that PAQR3 plays a role as a candidate inhibitor in cardiac adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer, but the systematic analysis of PAQR3 in tumors is currently lacking. The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic and therapeutic value of PAQR3 in 31 tumors. Through the analysis of TCGA, UALCAN, GEO, GEPIA2, TIMER, Kaplan-Meier plotter, TISIDB and other databases, it was found that the expression level of PAQR3 changed significantly in different tumor types, and the expression level of Neuroblastoma was very high. And the level of Prostate adenocarcinoma is low. In addition, the expression level of PAQR3 in Cholangiocarcinoma, Esophageal carcinoma, Head and neck squamous carcinoma, Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Lung Adenocarcinoma and Lung squamous cell carcinoma was significantly higher than that in normal tissues. However, the expression level of PAQR3 in Breast Cancer, Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma, Kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, Prostate Adenocarcinoma, Rectum Adenocarcinoma, Thyroid Cancer and Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma was lower than that in normal tissues. Subsequently, we explored the value of PAQR3 as a prognostic indicator of cancer. In Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Lower-grade Glioma and Glioblastoma, Pediatric Low-grade Gliomas, Kidney Chromophobe, and Thyroid Cancer, PAQR3 expression was positively correlated with OS and DSS, while in Rectum Adenocarcinoma, PAQR3 expression was negatively correlated with OS. PAQR3 high expression group Lower-grade Glioma and Glioblastoma, Pediatric Low-grade Gliomas, Uveal Melanoma, Kidney Chromophobe and DFI were positively correlated. PAQR3 can be used as a risk factor for the prognosis of multiple tumors. Then, we discussed the correlation between PAQR3 and immunology, and found that PAQR3 has a wide range of mutations in various tumor types, the most common mutation type is missense mutation, and common mutation types also include amplification, depth deletion, splicing, truncation and structural variation. Among the tumor samples with PAQR3 alterations, mutation occurred in all tumor samples except prostate adenocarcinoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, brain low-grade glioma, and kidney clear cell carcinoma, while esophageal adenocarcinoma had the highest total alteration frequency. PAQR3 was strongly associated with CNV in 18 tumors, particularly in Ovarian cancer, Lung squamous cell carcinoma, and Adenoid cystic carcinoma. On the other hand, PAQR3 has a higher SNV frequency in Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma, Skin Cutaneous Melanoma and Lung Adenocarcinoma, among which Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma has the highest SNV frequency. These results showed that PAQR3 expression levels were significantly correlated with tumor mutation load, microsatellite instability, neoantigens, and purity. In summary, PAQR3 can affect the tumor microenvironment and has potential for chemotherapy. Finally, we investigated the role of PAQR3 in tumor resistance and found that the expression of PAQR3 affects the efficacy of multiple chemotherapy drugs. Based on these studies, we found that PAQR3 plays an important role in cancer and has potential in tumor diagnosis and prognosis.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.243549408441e-121
