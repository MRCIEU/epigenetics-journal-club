Matt,No,20230629,methods,37369639,E-value: a superior alternative to P-value and its adjustments in DNA methylation studies.,Brief Bioinform,"DNA methylation plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is a technique of increasing use for analyzing genome-wide methylation profiles. Many computational tools such as Metilene, MethylKit, BiSeq and DMRfinder have been developed to use RRBS data for the detection of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) potentially involved in epigenetic regulations of gene expression. For DMR detection tools, as for countless other medical applications, P-values and their adjustments are among the most standard reporting statistics used to assess the statistical significance of biological findings. However, P-values are coming under increasing criticism relating to their questionable accuracy and relatively high levels of false positive or negative indications. Here, we propose a method to calculate E-values, as likelihood ratios falling into the null hypothesis over the entire parameter space, for DMR detection in RRBS data. We also provide the R package 'metevalue' as a user-friendly interface to implement E-value calculations into various DMR detection tools. To evaluate the performance of E-values, we generated various RRBS benchmarking datasets using our simulator 'RRBSsim' with eight samples in each experimental group. Our comprehensive benchmarking analyses showed that using E-values not only significantly improved accuracy, area under ROC curve and power, over that of P-values or adjusted P-values, but also reduced false discovery rates and type I errors. In applications using real RRBS data of CRL rats and a clinical trial on low-salt diet, the use of E-values detected biologically more relevant DMRs and also improved the negative association between DNA methylation and gene expression.© The Author(s) 2023.

Sarah,No,20230629,transgenerational,37365578,Associations between DNA methylation and gene regulation depend on chromatin accessibility during transgenerational plasticity.,BMC Biol,"Epigenetic processes are proposed to be a mechanism regulating gene expression during phenotypic plasticity. However, environmentally induced changes in DNA methylation exhibit little-to-no association with differential gene expression in metazoans at a transcriptome-wide level. It remains unexplored whether associations between environmentally induced differential methylation and expression are contingent upon other epigenomic processes such as chromatin accessibility. We quantified methylation and gene expression in larvae of the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus exposed to different ecologically relevant conditions during gametogenesis (maternal conditioning) and modeled changes in gene expression and splicing resulting from maternal conditioning as functions of differential methylation, incorporating covariates for genomic features and chromatin accessibility. We detected significant interactions between differential methylation, chromatin accessibility, and genic feature type associated with differential expression and splicing.Differential gene body methylation had significantly stronger effects on expression among genes with poorly accessible transcriptional start sites while baseline transcript abundance influenced the direction of this effect. Transcriptional responses to maternal conditioning were 4-13 × more likely when accounting for interactions between methylation and chromatin accessibility, demonstrating that the relationship between differential methylation and gene regulation is partially explained by chromatin state.DNA methylation likely possesses multiple associations with gene regulation during transgenerational plasticity in S. purpuratus and potentially other metazoans, but its effects are dependent on chromatin accessibility and underlying genic features.© 2023.

,Yes,20230629,ewas,37341931,NSAIDs use history: impact on the genome-wide DNA methylation profile and possible mechanisms of action.,Clin Exp Med,"NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase, but their role in aging and other diseases is not well understood. Our group previously showed the potential benefit of NSAIDs in decreasing the risk of delirium and mortality. Concurrently, epigenetics signals have also been associated with delirium. Therefore, we sought to find differentially methylated genes and biological pathways related to exposure with NSAIDs by comparing the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of patients with and without a history of NSAIDs use.Whole blood samples were collected from 171 patients at the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics from November 2017 to March 2020. History of NSAIDs use was assessed through a word-search function in the subjects' electronic medical records. DNA was extracted from the blood samples, processed with bisulfite conversion, and analyzed using Illumina's EPIC array. The analysis of top differentially methylated CpG sites and subsequent enrichment analysis were conducted using an established pipeline using R statistical software.Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) showed several biological pathways relevant to NSAIDs' function. The identified GO terms included ""arachidonic acid metabolic process,"" while KEGG results included ""linoleic acid metabolism,"" ""cellular senescence,"" and ""circadian rhythm."" Nonetheless, none of the top GO and KEGG pathways and the top differentially methylated CpG sites reached statistical significance.Our results suggest a potential role of epigenetics in the mechanisms of the action of NSAIDs. However, the results should be viewed with caution as exploratory and hypothesis-generating given the lack of statistically significant findings.© 2023.

,No,20230629,methods,37337720,Calculating detection limits and uncertainty of reference-based deconvolution of whole-blood DNA methylation data.,Epigenomics,"DNA methylation (DNAm)-based cell mixture deconvolution (CMD) has become a quintessential part of epigenome-wide association studies where DNAm is profiled in heterogeneous tissue types. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, detection limits, which represent the smallest fraction of a cell type in a mixed biospecimen that can be reliably detected, have yet to be determined in the context of DNAm-based CMD. Moreover, there has been little attention given to approaches for quantifying the uncertainty associated with DNAm-based CMD. Here, analytical frameworks for determining both cell-specific limits of detection and quantification of uncertainty associated with DNAm-based CMD are described. This work may contribute to improved rigor, reproducibility and replicability of epigenome-wide association studies involving CMD."
Sarah,Yes,20230629,ewas,37330044,Epigenetic Intergenerational Transmission: Mothers' Adverse Childhood Experiences and DNA Methylation.,J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry,"Individual differences in risk for mental disorders over the lifespan are shaped by forces acting before the individual is born-in utero, but likely even earlier, during the mother's own childhood. The environmental epigenetics hypothesis proposes that sustained effects of environmental conditions on gene expression are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. Recent human studies have shown that adversities in childhood are correlated with DNA methylation (DNAm) in adulthood. In the current study, we tested the following pre-registered hypotheses: Mothers' adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are correlated with DNAm in peripheral blood during pregnancy (hypothesis 1) and in cord blood samples from newborn infants (hypothesis 2), and women's depression and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy mediate the association between mothers' ACE exposure and prenatal/neonatal DNA methylation (hypothesis 3).Data were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomic Studies substudy. Women provided retrospective self-reports during pregnancy of ACE exposure. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study testing whether mothers' ACE exposure, cumulative score (0-10), was associated with DNAm in maternal antenatal blood and infant cord blood in more than 450,000 CpG (point on DNA sequence where Cytosine and Guanine base pairs are linked by a phosphate, where methylation usually occurs) sites on the Illumina 450K BeadChip. Analyses for cord blood were separated by infant sex, a pre-registered analysis.Hypothesis 1: In 896 mother-infant pairs with available methylation and ACE exposure data, there were no significant associations between mothers' ACE score and DNAm from antenatal peripheral blood, after controlling for covariates. Hypothesis 2: In infant cord blood, there were 5 CpG sites significantly differentially methylated in relation to mothers' ACEs (false discovery rate [FDR] < .05), but only in male offspring. Effect sizes were medium, with partial eta squared values ranging from 0.060 to 0.078. CpG sites were in genes related to mitochondrial function and neuronal development in the cerebellum. Hypothesis 3: There was no mediation by maternal anxiety/depression symptoms found between mothers' ACEs score and DNAm in the significant CpG sites in male cord blood. Mediation was not tested in antenatal peripheral blood, because no direct association between mothers' ACE score and antenatal peripheral blood was found.Our results show that mothers' ACE exposure is associated with DNAm in male offspring, supporting the notion that DNAm could be a marker of intergenerational biological embedding of mothers' childhood adversity.Epigenetic Intergenerational Transmission: Mothers' Adverse Childhood Experiences and DNA Methylation; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.03.008.Copyright © 2023.

,Yes,20230629,ewas,37327798,Association between the timing of childhood adversity and epigenetic patterns across childhood and adolescence: findings from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) prospective cohort.,Lancet Child Adolesc Health,"Childhood adversity is a potent determinant of health across development and is associated with altered DNA methylation signatures, which might be more common in children exposed during sensitive periods in development. However, it remains unclear whether adversity has persistent epigenetic associations across childhood and adolescence. We aimed to examine the relationship between time-varying adversity (defined through sensitive period, accumulation of risk, and recency life course hypotheses) and genome-wide DNA methylation, measured three times from birth to adolescence, using data from a prospective, longitudinal cohort study.We first investigated the relationship between the timing of exposure to childhood adversity between birth and 11 years and blood DNA methylation at age 15 years in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) prospective cohort study. Our analytic sample included ALSPAC participants with DNA methylation data and complete childhood adversity data between birth and 11 years. We analysed seven types of adversity (caregiver physical or emotional abuse, sexual or physical abuse [by anyone], maternal psychopathology, one-adult households, family instability, financial hardship, and neighbourhood disadvantage) reported by mothers five to eight times between birth and 11 years. We used the structured life course modelling approach (SLCMA) to identify time-varying associations between childhood adversity and adolescent DNA methylation. Top loci were identified using an R2threshold of 0·035 (ie, ≥3·5% of DNA methylation variance explained by adversity). We attempted to replicate these associations using data from the Raine Study and Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS). We also assessed the persistence of adversity-DNA methylation associations we previously identified from age 7 blood DNA methylation into adolescence and the influence of adversity on DNA methylation trajectories from ages 0-15 years.Of 13 988 children in the ALSPAC cohort, 609-665 children (311-337 [50-51%] boys and 298-332 [49-50%] girls) had complete data available for at least one of the seven childhood adversities and DNA methylation at 15 years. Exposure to adversity was associated with differences in DNA methylation at 15 years for 41 loci (R2≥0·035). Sensitive periods were the most often selected life course hypothesis by the SLCMA. 20 (49%) of 41 loci were associated with adversities occurring between age 3 and 5 years. Exposure to one-adult households was associated with differences in DNA methylation at 20 [49%] of 41 loci, exposure to financial hardship was associated with changes at nine (22%) loci, and physical or sexual abuse was associated with changes at four (10%) loci. We replicated the direction of associations for 18 (90%) of 20 loci associated with exposure to one-adult household using adolescent blood DNA methylation from the Raine Study and 18 (64%) of 28 loci using saliva DNA methylation from the FFCWS. The directions of effects for 11 one-adult household loci were replicated in both cohorts. Differences in DNA methylation at 15 years were not present at 7 years and differences identified at 7 years were no longer apparent by 15 years. We also identified six distinct DNA methylation trajectories from these patterns of stability and persistence.These findings highlight the time-varying effect of childhood adversity on DNA methylation profiles across development, which might link exposure to adversity to potential adverse health outcomes in children and adolescents. If replicated, these epigenetic signatures could ultimately serve as biological indicators or early warning signs of initiated disease processes, helping identify people at greater risk for the adverse health consequences of childhood adversity.Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Cohort and Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources, EU's Horizon 2020, US National Institute of Mental Health.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Sarah,No,20230629,dnamage,37306997,Association of Adverse Childhood Experiences With Accelerated Epigenetic Aging in Midlife.,JAMA Netw Open,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with the risk of poorer health, and identifying molecular mechanisms may lay the foundation for health promotion in people with ACEs.To investigate the associations of ACEs with changes in epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), a biomarker associated with various health outcomes in middle-aged adults, in a population with balanced race and sex demographics.Data for this cohort study were from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Participants in CARDIA underwent 8 follow-up exams from baseline (year 0 [Y0]; 1985-1986) to Y30 (2015-2016), and participant blood DNA methylation information was obtained at Y15 (2000-2001) and Y20 (2005-2006). Individuals from Y15 and Y20 with available DNA methylation data and complete variables for ACEs and covariates were included. Data were analyzed from September 2021 to August 2022.Participant ACEs (general negligence, emotional negligence, physical violence, physical negligence, household substance abuse, verbal and emotional abuse, and household dysfunction) were obtained at Y15.The primary outcome consisted of results from 5 DNA methylation-based EAA measurements known to be associated with biological aging and long-term health: intrinsic EAA (IEAA), extrinsic EAA (EEAA), PhenoAge acceleration (PhenoAA), GrimAge acceleration (GrimAA), and Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated From the Epigenome (DunedinPACE), measured at Y15 and Y20. Linear regression and generalized estimating equations were used to assess associations of the burden of ACEs (≥4 vs <4 ACEs) with EAA adjusting for demographics, health-related behaviors, and early life and adult socioeconomic status.A total of 895 participants for Y15 (mean [SD] age, 40.4 [3.5] years; 450 males [50.3%] and 445 females [49.7%]; 319 Black [35.6%] and 576 White [64.4%]) and 867 participants for Y20 (mean [SD] age, 45.4 [3.5] years; 432 males [49.8%] and 435 females [50.2%]; 306 Black [35.3%] and 561 White [64.7%]) were included after excluding participants with missing data. There were 185 participants with (20.7%) vs 710 participants without (79.3%) 4 or more ACEs at Y15 and 179 participants with (20.6%) vs 688 participants without (79.4%) 4 or more ACEs at Y20. Having 4 or more ACEs was positively associated with EAA in years at Y15 (EEAA: β = 0.60 years; 95% CI, 0.18-1.02 years; PhenoAA: β = 0.62 years; 95% CI = 0.13-1.11 years; GrimAA: β = 0.71 years; 95% CI, 0.42-1.00 years; DunedinPACE: β = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.01-0.02) and Y20 (IEAA: β = 0.41 years; 95% CI, 0.05-0.77 years; EEAA: β = 1.05 years; 95% CI, 0.66-1.44 years; PhenoAA: β = 0.57 years; 95% CI, 0.08-1.05 years; GrimAA: β = 0.57 years; 95% CI, 0.28-0.87 years; DunedinPACE: β = 0.01; 95% CI, 0.01-0.02) after adjusting for demographics, health-related behaviors, and socioeconomic status.In this cohort study, ACEs were associated with EAA among middle-aged adults after controlling for demographics, behavior, and socioeconomic status. These findings of the associations between early life experience and the biological aging process in midlife may contribute to health promotion in a life course perspective."
,Yes,20230629,EWAS,37300821,Prenatal maternal stress is associated with site-specific and age acceleration changes in maternal and newborn DNA methylation.,Epigenetics,"Prenatal maternal stress has a negative impact on child health but the mechanisms through which maternal stress affects child health are unclear. Epigenetic variation, such as DNA methylation, is a likely mechanistic candidate as DNA methylation is sensitive to environmental insults and can regulate long-term changes in gene expression. We recruited 155 mother-newborn dyads in the Democratic Republic of Congo to investigate the effects of maternal stress on DNA methylation in mothers and newborns. We used four measures of maternal stress to capture a range of stressful experiences: general trauma, sexual trauma, war trauma, and chronic stress. We identified differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with general trauma, sexual trauma, and war trauma in both mothers and newborns. No DMPs were associated with chronic stress. Sexual trauma was positively associated with epigenetic age acceleration across several epigenetic clocks in mothers. General trauma and war trauma were positively associated with newborn epigenetic age acceleration using the extrinsic epigenetic age clock. We tested the top DMPs for enrichment of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) and found no enrichment in mothers. In newborns, top DMPs associated with war trauma were enriched for DHS in embryonic and foetal cell types. Finally, one of the top DMPs associated with war trauma in newborns also predicted birthweight, completing the cycle from maternal stress to DNA methylation to newborn health outcome. Our results indicate that maternal stress is associated with site-specific changes in DNAm and epigenetic age acceleration in both mothers and newborns."
,No,20230629,omics,37326626,Predicting mechanisms of action at genetic loci associated with discordant effects on type 2 diabetes and abdominal fat accumulation.,Elife,"Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Excessive accumulation of fat in the abdomen further increases T2D risk. Abdominal obesity is measured by calculating the ratio of waist-to-hip circumference adjusted for the body-mass index (WHRadjBMI), a trait with a significant genetic inheritance. Genetic loci associated with WHRadjBMI identified in genome-wide association studies are predicted to act through adipose tissues, but many of the exact molecular mechanisms underlying fat distribution and its consequences for T2D risk are poorly understood. Further, mechanisms that uncouple the genetic inheritance of abdominal obesity from T2D risk have not yet been described. Here we utilize multi-omic data to predict mechanisms of action at loci associated with discordant effects on abdominal obesity and T2D risk. We find six genetic signals in five loci associated with protection from T2D but also with increased abdominal obesity. We predict the tissues of action at these discordant loci and the likely effector Genes (eGenes) at three discordant loci, from which we predict significant involvement of adipose biology. We then evaluate the relationship between adipose gene expression of eGenes with adipogenesis, obesity, and diabetic physiological phenotypes. By integrating these analyses with prior literature, we propose models that resolve the discordant associations at two of the five loci. While experimental validation is required to validate predictions, these hypotheses provide potential mechanisms underlying T2D risk stratification within abdominal obesity.© 2023, Aberra et al."
Sam,No,20230629,omics,37365616,Transcriptome- and proteome-wide association studies nominate determinants of kidney function and damage.,Genome Biol,"The pathophysiological causes of kidney disease are not fully understood. Here we show that the integration of genome-wide genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic association studies can nominate causal determinants of kidney function and damage.Through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in kidney cortex, kidney tubule, liver, and whole blood and proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) in plasma, we assess for effects of 12,893 genes and 1342 proteins on kidney filtration (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by creatinine; GFR estimated by cystatin C; and blood urea nitrogen) and kidney damage (albuminuria). We find 1561 associations distributed among 260 genomic regions that are supported as putatively causal. We then prioritize 153 of these genomic regions using additional colocalization analyses. Our genome-wide findings are supported by existing knowledge (animal models for MANBA, DACH1, SH3YL1, INHBB), exceed the underlying GWAS signals (28 region-trait combinations without significant GWAS hit), identify independent gene/protein-trait associations within the same genomic region (INHBC, SPRYD4), nominate tissues underlying the associations (tubule expression of NRBP1), and distinguish markers of kidney filtration from those with a role in creatinine and cystatin C metabolism. Furthermore, we follow up on members of the TGF-beta superfamily of proteins and find a prognostic value of INHBC for kidney disease progression even after adjustment for measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR).In summary, this study combines multimodal, genome-wide association studies to generate a catalog of putatively causal target genes and proteins relevant to kidney function and damage which can guide follow-up studies in physiology, basic science, and clinical medicine.© 2023.

,No,20230629,cancer,37344596,Y chromosome loss in cancer drives growth by evasion of adaptive immunity.,Nature,"Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) is observed in multiple cancer types, including 10-40% of bladder cancers1-6, but its clinical and biological significance is unknown. Here, using genomic and transcriptomic studies, we report that LOY correlates with poor prognoses in patients with bladder cancer. We performed in-depth studies of naturally occurring LOY mutant bladder cancer cells as well as those with targeted deletion of Y chromosome by CRISPR-Cas9. Y-positive (Y+) and Y-negative (Y-) tumours grew similarly in vitro, whereas Y-tumours were more aggressive than Y+tumours in immune-competent hosts in a T cell-dependent manner. High-dimensional flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that Y-tumours promote striking dysfunction or exhaustion of CD8+T cells in the tumour microenvironment. These findings were validated using single-nuclei RNA sequencing and spatial proteomic evaluation of human bladder cancers. Of note, compared with Y+tumours, Y-tumours exhibited an increased response to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy in both mice and patients with cancer. Together, these results demonstrate that cancer cells with LOY mutations alter T cell function, promoting T cell exhaustion and sensitizing them to PD-1-targeted immunotherapy. This work provides insights into the basic biology of LOY mutation and potential biomarkers for improving cancer immunotherapy.© 2023.

Ryan,No,20230629,ctdna,37330511,Early detection and stratification of lung cancer aided by a cost-effective assay targeting circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation.,Respir Res,"Detection of lung cancer at earlier stage can greatly improve patient survival. We aim to develop, validate, and implement a cost-effective ctDNA-methylation-based plasma test to aid lung cancer early detection.Case-control studies were designed to select the most relevant markers to lung cancer. Patients with lung cancer or benign lung disease and healthy individuals were recruited from different clinical centers. A multi-locus qPCR assay, LunaCAM, was developed for lung cancer alertness by ctDNA methylation. Two LunaCAM models were built for screening (-S) or diagnostic aid (-D) to favor sensitivity or specificity, respectively. The performance of the models was validated for different intended uses in clinics.Profiling DNA methylation on 429 plasma samples including 209 lung cancer, 123 benign diseases and 97 healthy participants identified the top markers that detected lung cancer from benign diseases and healthy with an AUC of 0.85 and 0.95, respectively. The most effective methylation markers were verified individually in 40 tissues and 169 plasma samples to develop LunaCAM assay. Two models corresponding to different intended uses were trained with 513 plasma samples, and validated with an independent collection of 172 plasma samples. In validation, LunaCAM-S model achieved an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.88-0.94) between lung cancer and healthy individuals, whereas LunaCAM-D model stratified lung cancer from benign pulmonary diseases with an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.86). When implemented sequentially in the validation set, LunaCAM-S enables to identify 58 patients of lung cancer (90.6% sensitivity), followed by LunaCAM-D to remove 20 patients with no evidence of cancer (83.3% specificity). LunaCAM-D significantly outperformed the blood test of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and the combined model can further improve the predictive power for lung cancer to an overall AUC of 0.86.We developed two different models by ctDNA methylation assay to sensitively detect early-stage lung cancer or specifically classify lung benign diseases. Implemented at different clinical settings, LunaCAM models has a potential to provide a facile and inexpensive avenue for early screening and diagnostic aids for lung cancer.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,No,20230629,tandem repeats,37307504,Genome-wide identification of tandem repeats associated with splicing variation across 49 tissues in humans.,Genome Res,"Tandem repeats (TRs) are one of the largest sources of polymorphism, and their length is associated with gene regulation. Although previous studies reported several tandem repeats regulating gene splicing incis(spl-TRs), no large-scale study has been conducted. In this study, we established a genome-wide catalog of 9537 spl-TRs with a total of 58,290 significant TR-splicing associations across 49 tissues (false discovery rate 5%) by using Genotype-Tissue expression (GTex) Project data. Regression models explaining splicing variation by using spl-TRs and other flanking variants suggest that at least some of the spl-TRs directly modulate splicing. In our catalog, two spl-TRs are known loci for repeat expansion diseases, spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6) and 12 (SCA12). Splicing alterations by these spl-TRs were compatible with those observed in SCA6 and SCA12. Thus, our comprehensive spl-TR catalog may help elucidate the pathomechanism of genetic diseases.© 2023 Hamanaka et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."
Rebecca,No,20230629,circadian rhythm,37262074,The circadian clock is disrupted in pancreatic cancer.,PLoS Genet,"Disruption of the circadian clock is linked to cancer development and progression. Establishing this connection has proven beneficial for understanding cancer pathogenesis, determining prognosis, and uncovering novel therapeutic targets. However, barriers to characterizing the circadian clock in human pancreas and human pancreatic cancer-one of the deadliest malignancies-have hindered an appreciation of its role in this cancer. Here, we employed normalized coefficient of variation (nCV) and clock correlation analysis in human population-level data to determine the functioning of the circadian clock in pancreas cancer and adjacent normal tissue. We found a substantially attenuated clock in the pancreatic cancer tissue. Then we exploited our existing mouse pancreatic transcriptome data to perform an analysis of the human normal and pancreas cancer samples using a machine learning method, cyclic ordering by periodic structure (CYCLOPS). Through CYCLOPS ordering, we confirmed the nCV and clock correlation findings of an intact circadian clock in normal pancreas with robust cycling of several core clock genes. However, in pancreas cancer, there was a loss of rhythmicity of many core clock genes with an inability to effectively order the cancer samples, providing substantive evidence of a dysregulated clock. The implications of clock disruption were further assessed with a Bmal1 knockout pancreas cancer model, which revealed that an arrhythmic clock caused accelerated cancer growth and worse survival, accompanied by chemoresistance and enrichment of key cancer-related pathways. These findings provide strong evidence for clock disruption in human pancreas cancer and demonstrate a link between circadian disruption and pancreas cancer progression.Copyright: © 2023 Schwartz et al.
