"37377752","Whole-genome and Epigenomic Landscapes of Malignant Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Harboring KIT Exon 11 557-558 Deletion Mutations.","Cancer Res Commun","Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) withKITexon 11 deletions involving in codons 557-558 (KITΔ557-558) exhibit higher proliferation rates and shorter disease-free survival times compared with GISTs with otherKITexon 11 mutations. We analyzed 30 GIST cases and observed genomic instability and global DNA hypomethylation only in high-risk malignant GISTs withKITΔ557-558. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the high-risk malignant GISTs withKITΔ557-558 (12 cases) had more structural variations (SV), single-nucleotide variants, and insertions and deletions compared with the low-risk, less malignant GISTs withKITΔ557-558 (six cases) and the high-risk (six cases) or low-risk (6 cases) GISTs with otherKITexon 11 mutations. The malignant GISTs withKITΔ557-558 showed higher frequency and significance in copy number (CN) reduction on chromosome arms 9p and 22q, and 50% of them had LOH or CN-dependent expression reduction inCDKN2A. In addition, SVs with driver potential were detected in 75% of them, in whichAKT3andMGMTwere recurrently identified. Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression analyses showed global intergenic DNA hypomethylation,SNAI2upregulation, and higher expression signatures, including p53 inactivation and chromosomal instability, as characteristics of malignant GISTs withKITΔ557-558 that distinguished them from other GISTs. These genomic and epigenomic profiling results revealed thatKITΔ557-558 mutations are associated with increased genomic instability in malignant GISTs.We present genomic and epigenomic insights into the malignant progression of GISTs withKITexon 11 deletions involving in 557-558, demonstrating their unique chromosomal instability and global intergenic DNA hypomethylation.© 2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research."
"37375998","The Global Changes of N6-methyldeoxyadenosine in Response to Low Temperature in Arabidopsis thaliana and Rice.","Plants (Basel)","N6-methyldeoxyadenosine (6mA) is a recently discovered DNA modification involved in regulating plant adaptation to abiotic stresses. However, the mechanisms and changes of 6mA under cold stress in plants are not yet fully understood. Here, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of 6mA and observed that 6mA peaks were predominantly present within the gene body regions under both normal and cold conditions. In addition, the global level of 6mA increased both inArabidopsisand rice after the cold treatment. The genes that exhibited an up-methylation showed enrichment in various biological processes, whereas there was no significant enrichment observed among the down-methylated genes. The association analysis revealed a positive correlation between the 6mA level and the gene expression level. Joint analysis of the 6mA methylome and transcriptome ofArabidopsisand rice unraveled that fluctuations in 6mA levels caused by cold exposure were not correlated to changes in transcript levels. Furthermore, we discovered that orthologous genes modified by 6mA showed high expression levels; however, only a minor amount of differentially 6mA-methylated orthologous genes were shared betweenArabidopsisand rice under low-temperature conditions. In conclusion, our study provides information on the role of 6mA in response to cold stress and reveals its potential for regulating the expression of stress-related genes."

This study investigated the potential involvement of DNA methylation in subclinical mastitis caused by SC. The whole-genome DNA methylation patterns and transcriptome profiles of milk somatic cells from four cows with naturally occurring SC subclinical mastitis (SCM) and four healthy cows were characterized by next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics, and integration analyses. Comparisons revealed abundant DNA methylation changes related to SCM, including differentially methylated cytosine sites (DMCs,n= 2,163,976), regions (DMRs,n= 58,965), and methylation haplotype blocks (dMHBs,n= 53,098). Integration of methylome and transcriptome data indicated a negative global association between DNA methylation at regulatory regions (promoters, first exons, and first introns) and gene expression. A total of 1486 genes with significant changes in the methylation levels of their regulatory regions and corresponding gene expression showed significant enrichment in biological processes and pathways related to immune functions. Sixteen dMHBs were identified as candidate discriminant signatures, and validation of two signatures in more samples further revealed the association of dMHBs with mammary gland health and production. This study demonstrated abundant DNA methylation changes with possible involvement in regulating host responses and potential as biomarkers for SCM."
"37373311","Genome-Wide Identification of the YABBY Gene Family in Dendrobium Orchids and Its Expression Patterns in Dendrobium chrysotoxum.","Int J Mol Sci","The small plant-specific YABBY gene family plays key roles in diverse developmental processes in plants.Dendrobium chrysotoxum,D. huoshanense, andD. nobileare perennial herbaceous plants belonging to Orchidaceae with a high ornamental value. However, the relationships and specific functions of the YABBY genes in theDendrobiumspecies remain unknown. In this study, sixDchYABBYs, nineDhuYABBYs, and nineDnoYABBYs were identified from the genome databases of the threeDendrobiumspecies, which were unevenly distributed on five, eight, and nine chromosomes, respectively. The 24 YABBY genes were classified into four subfamilies (CRC/DL, INO, YAB2, and FIL/YAB3) based on their phylogenetic analysis. A sequence analysis showed that most of the YABBY proteins contained conserved C2C2 zinc-finger and YABBY domains, while a gene structure analysis revealed that 46% of the total YABBY genes contained seven exons and six introns. All the YABBY genes harbored a large number of Methyl Jasmonate responsive elements, as well as anaerobic inductioncis-acting elements in the promoter regions. Through a collinearity analysis, one, two, and two segmental duplicated gene pairs were identified in theD. chrysotoxum,D. huoshanense, andD. nobilegenomes, respectively. TheKa/Ksvalues of these five gene pairs were lower than 0.5, indicating that theDendrobiumYABBY genes underwent negative selection. In addition, an expression analysis revealed thatDchYABBY2plays a role in ovary and early-stage petal development, whileDchYABBY5is essential for lip development andDchYABBY6is crucial for early sepal formation.DchYABBY1primarily regulates sepals during blooming. Furthermore, there is the potential involvement ofDchYABBY2andDchYABBY5in gynostemium development. The results of a comprehensive genome-wide study would provide significant clues for future functional investigations and pattern analyses of YABBY genes in different flower parts during flower development in theDendrobiumspecies."
"37372311","Genome-Wide Integrative Transcriptional Profiling Identifies Age-Associated Signatures in Dogs.","Genes (Basel)","Mammals experience similar stages of embryonic development, birth, infancy, youth, adolescence, maturity, and senescence. While embryonic developmental processes have been extensively researched, many molecular mechanisms regulating the different life stages after birth, such as aging, remain unresolved. We investigated the conserved and global molecular transitions in transcriptional remodeling with age in dogs of 15 breeds, which revealed that genes underlying hormone level regulation and developmental programs were differentially regulated during aging. Subsequently, we show that the candidate genes associated with tumorigenesis also exhibit age-dependent DNA methylation patterns, which might have contributed to the tumor state through inhibiting the plasticity of cell differentiation processes during aging, and ultimately suggesting the molecular events that link the processes of aging and cancer. These results highlight that the rate of age-related transcriptional remodeling is influenced not only by the lifespan, but also by the timing of critical physiological milestones."

Here we aimed to identify differentially methylated genes that play a functional role in ischemic stroke in a Chinese population.Genome-wide DNA methylation assessed with the Illumina Methylation EPIC Array in a discovery sample including 80 Chinese adults (40 cases vs. 40 controls) found that patients with ischemic stroke were characterized by increased DNA methylation at six CpG loci (individually located at TRIM6, FLRT2, SOX1, SOX17, AGBL4, and FAM84A, respectively) and decreased DNA methylation at one additional locus (located at TLN2). Targeted bisulfite sequencing confirmed six of these differentially methylated probes in an independent Chinese population (853 cases vs. 918 controls), and one probe (located at TRIM6) was further verified in an external European cohort (207 cases vs. 83 controls). Experimental manipulation of DNA methylation in engineered human umbilical vein endothelial cells indicated that the identified differentially methylated probes located at TRIM6, TLN2, and FLRT2 genes may play a role in endothelial cell adhesion and atherosclerosis.Altered DNA methylation of the TRIM6, TLN2, and FLRT2 genes may play a functional role in ischemic stroke in Chinese populations.© 2023.

"37369639","E-value: a superior alternative to P-value and its adjustments in DNA methylation studies.","Brief Bioinform","DNA methylation plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is a technique of increasing use for analyzing genome-wide methylation profiles. Many computational tools such as Metilene, MethylKit, BiSeq and DMRfinder have been developed to use RRBS data for the detection of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) potentially involved in epigenetic regulations of gene expression. For DMR detection tools, as for countless other medical applications, P-values and their adjustments are among the most standard reporting statistics used to assess the statistical significance of biological findings. However, P-values are coming under increasing criticism relating to their questionable accuracy and relatively high levels of false positive or negative indications. Here, we propose a method to calculate E-values, as likelihood ratios falling into the null hypothesis over the entire parameter space, for DMR detection in RRBS data. We also provide the R package 'metevalue' as a user-friendly interface to implement E-value calculations into various DMR detection tools. To evaluate the performance of E-values, we generated various RRBS benchmarking datasets using our simulator 'RRBSsim' with eight samples in each experimental group. Our comprehensive benchmarking analyses showed that using E-values not only significantly improved accuracy, area under ROC curve and power, over that of P-values or adjusted P-values, but also reduced false discovery rates and type I errors. In applications using real RRBS data of CRL rats and a clinical trial on low-salt diet, the use of E-values detected biologically more relevant DMRs and also improved the negative association between DNA methylation and gene expression.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37368308","The Effect of Nanomaterials on DNA Methylation: A Review.","Nanomaterials (Basel)","DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that involves the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine residue in CpG dinucleotides, which are particularly abundant in gene promoter regions. Several studies have highlighted the role that modifications of DNA methylation may have on the adverse health effects caused by exposure to environmental toxicants. One group of xenobiotics that is increasingly present in our daily lives are nanomaterials, whose unique physicochemical properties make them interesting for a large number of industrial and biomedical applications. Their widespread use has raised concerns about human exposure, and several toxicological studies have been performed, although the studies focusing on nanomaterials' effect on DNA methylation are still limited. The aim of this review is to investigate the possible impact of nanomaterials on DNA methylation. From the 70 studies found eligible for data analysis, the majority were in vitro, with about half using cell models related to the lungs. Among the in vivo studies, several animal models were used, but most were mice models. Only two studies were performed on human exposed populations. Global DNA methylation analyses was the most frequently applied approach. Although no trend towards hypo- or hyper-methylation could be observed, the importance of this epigenetic mechanism in the molecular response to nanomaterials is evident. Furthermore, methylation analysis of target genes and, particularly, the application of comprehensive DNA methylation analysis techniques, such as genome-wide sequencing, allowed identifying differentially methylated genes after nanomaterial exposure and affected molecular pathways, contributing to the understanding of their possible adverse health effects."
"37365578","Associations between DNA methylation and gene regulation depend on chromatin accessibility during transgenerational plasticity.","BMC Biol","Epigenetic processes are proposed to be a mechanism regulating gene expression during phenotypic plasticity. However, environmentally induced changes in DNA methylation exhibit little-to-no association with differential gene expression in metazoans at a transcriptome-wide level. It remains unexplored whether associations between environmentally induced differential methylation and expression are contingent upon other epigenomic processes such as chromatin accessibility. We quantified methylation and gene expression in larvae of the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus exposed to different ecologically relevant conditions during gametogenesis (maternal conditioning) and modeled changes in gene expression and splicing resulting from maternal conditioning as functions of differential methylation, incorporating covariates for genomic features and chromatin accessibility. We detected significant interactions between differential methylation, chromatin accessibility, and genic feature type associated with differential expression and splicing.Differential gene body methylation had significantly stronger effects on expression among genes with poorly accessible transcriptional start sites while baseline transcript abundance influenced the direction of this effect. Transcriptional responses to maternal conditioning were 4-13 × more likely when accounting for interactions between methylation and chromatin accessibility, demonstrating that the relationship between differential methylation and gene regulation is partially explained by chromatin state.DNA methylation likely possesses multiple associations with gene regulation during transgenerational plasticity in S. purpuratus and potentially other metazoans, but its effects are dependent on chromatin accessibility and underlying genic features.© 2023.

"37365312","Globally reduced N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD dysregulates RNA metabolism and contributes to neurodegeneration.","Nat Neurosci","Repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Here we show that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent internal mRNA modification, is downregulated in C9ORF72-ALS/FTD patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-differentiated neurons and postmortem brain tissues. The global m6A hypomethylation leads to transcriptome-wide mRNA stabilization and upregulated gene expression, particularly for genes involved in synaptic activity and neuronal function. Moreover, the m6A modification in the C9ORF72 intron sequence upstream of the expanded repeats enhances RNA decay via the nuclear reader YTHDC1, and the antisense RNA repeats can also be regulated through m6A modification. The m6A reduction increases the accumulation of repeat RNAs and the encoded poly-dipeptides, contributing to disease pathogenesis. We further demonstrate that, by elevating m6A methylation, we could significantly reduce repeat RNA levels from both strands and the derived poly-dipeptides, rescue global mRNA homeostasis and improve survival of C9ORF72-ALS/FTD patient iPSC-derived neurons.© 2023.

"37364644","Exogenous glutathione can alleviate chromium toxicity in kenaf by activating antioxidant system and regulating DNA methylation.","Chemosphere","Glutathione (GSH) participates in plant response to heavy metals (HMs) stress, however, the epigenetic regulating mechanisms of GSH in HMs detoxification remains unclear. In this study, to reveal the potential epigenetic regulating mechanisms, kenaf seedlings were treated with/without GSH under chromium (Cr) stress. A comprehensive physiological, genome-wide DNA methylation and gene functional analysis were performed. Results showed that external GSH obviously recovered Cr-induced growth inhibition, significantly decreased H2O2, O2.-and MDA accumulation, increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GR and APX) in kenaf exposed to Cr. In addition, the expression level of the main DNA methyltransferase (MET1, CMT3 and DRM1) and demethylase (ROS1, DEM, DML2, DML3 and DDM1) genes were investigated by qRT-PCR. The result indicated that Cr stress decreased DNA methyltransferase genes expression while increased demethylase genes expression; however, apply exogenous GSH led to the recovery trend. These indicating exogenous GSH alleviation Cr stress on kenaf seedlings by increasing DNA methylation level. At the same time, the MethylRAD-seq genome-wide DNA methylation analysis showed the DNA methylation level was significantly increased after GSH treatment compared with Cr treatment alone. The differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were uniquely enriched in DNA repair, flavin adenine dinucleotide binding and oxidoreductase activity. Furthermore, a ROS homeostasis-associated DMG, HcTrx, was selected for further functional analysis. Results showed that the knock-down of HcTrx kenaf seedlings displayed yellow-green phenotype and impaired antioxidant enzyme activity; in contrast, the overexpression lines of HcTrx improved chlorophyll levels and enhanced Cr tolerance in Arabidopsis. Taken together, our results illustrate the novel role of GSH-mediated Cr detoxification in kenaf by modulating the DNA methylation, and thus further affect the activation of antioxidant defense systems. The present characterized Cr tolerant gene resource could be further used for kenaf Cr tolerant breeding via genetic improvement.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Ltd."

A metabolome GWAS (mGWAS), which relies on phenotypic information based on metabolite accumulation, can identify genes that contribute to primary and secondary metabolite contents. In this study, we carried out a mGWAS using seed metabolomic data fromArabidopsis thalianaaccessions obtained by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify SNPs highly associated with the contents of metabolites such as glucosinolates. These SNPs were present in genes known to be involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis, thus confirming the effectiveness of our analysis. We subsequently focused on SNPs detected in an unknown methyltransferase gene associated withN-methylhistidine content. Knockout and overexpression ofA. thalianalines of this gene had significantly decreased and increasedN-methylhistidine contents, respectively. We confirmed that the overexpressing line exclusively accumulated histidine methylated at the pi position, not at the tau position. Our findings suggest that the identified methyltransferase gene encodes a key enzyme forN-methylhistidine biosynthesis inA. thaliana.Copyright © 2023 Uchida, Kim, Sato, Tabeta, Mochida and Hirai."
"37357634","Utility of Comprehensive Genomic Profiling for Precise Diagnosis of Pediatric-Type Diffuse High-Grade Glioma.","Acta Med Okayama","In the current World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors, comprehensive genetic and epigenetic analyses are considered essential for precise diagnosis. A 14-year-old male patient who presented with a cerebellar tumor was initially diagnosed with glioblastoma and treated with radiation and concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy after resection. During maintenance temozolomide therapy, a new contrast-enhanced lesion developed in the bottom of the cavity formed by the resection. A second surgery was performed, but the histological findings in specimens from the second surgery were different from those of the first surgery. Although genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was conducted using frozen tissue for a precise diagnosis, the proportion of tumor cells was insufficient and only normal cerebellum was observed. We then performed comprehensive genetic analysis using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections, which revealed MYCN amplification without alteration of IDH1, IDH2, or Histone H3. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with pediatric-type diffuse high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype. In conclusion, comprehensive genetic and epigenetic analysis should be considered in pediatric brain tumor cases."
"37357610","Multi-omic integration of DNA methylation and gene expression data reveals molecular vulnerabilities in glioblastoma.","Mol Oncol","Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive types of cancer and exhibits profound genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity, making the development of an effective treatment a major challenge. The recent incorporation of molecular features into the diagnosis of GBM patients has led to an improved categorisation into various tumour subtypes with different prognoses and disease management. In this work, we have exploited the benefits of genome-wide multi-omic approaches to identify potential molecular vulnerabilities existing in GBM patients. Integration of gene expression and DNA methylation data from both bulk GBM and patient-derived GBM stem cell lines has revealed the presence of major sources of GBM variability, pinpointing subtype-specific tumour vulnerabilities amenable to pharmacological interventions. In this sense, inhibition of the AP-1, SMAD3 and RUNX1 / RUNX2 pathways, in combination or not with the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide, led to the subtype-specific impairment of tumour growth, particularly in the context of the aggressive, mesenchymal-like subtype. These results emphasize the involvement of these molecular pathways in the development of GBM and have potential implications for the development of personalized therapeutic approaches.© 2023 The Authors.

"37356384","Genome-wide characterization of the PLATZ gene family in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus L.) with putative functions in biotic and abiotic stress response.","Plant Physiol Biochem","Plant AT-rich sequence and zinc-binding (PLATZ) proteins are plant-specific transcription factors involved in growth, development, and stress responses. Here, we conducted a genome-wide characterization of the watermelon ClPLATZ family and examined its expression responsiveness to defense hormones and pathogen infection along with putative functions in biotic and abiotic stress responses. The watermelon genome contains 12 putative ClPLATZ genes, encoding proteins with a characteristic PLATZ domain, and their promoters contain various cis-elements related to plant growth, development, phytohormones and stress response. The ClPLATZ genes, except ClPLATZ6, are differentially expressed in response to defense hormones (e.g., salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate) and fungal infections caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum and Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum. Most ClPLATZ proteins interact with other proteins (viz., ClDP, ClRPT2a, and ClRPC53). Among ClPLATZ proteins, ClPLATZ8, 9, 10, and 11 are predominately localized in the nucleus. ClPLATZ3 and 8 positively, but ClPLATZ11 negatively regulate resistance against Pseudomonas syringe pv. tomato DC3000 in transgenic Arabidopsis lines. ClPLATZ8 and 11 positively regulate stress tolerance to NaCl and mannitol during seed germination in transgenic Arabidopsis. In conclusion, the characterization of the ClPLATZ family provides insights into the biological functions of ClPLATZ genes in growth, development, and stress response in watermelon. Further, the involvement of certain ClPLATZ genes in biotic and abiotic stress response in transgenic Arabidopsis suggests their potential application in engineering stress-tolerant crops.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"37355545","DNA Methylation Analysis.","Methods Mol Biol","DNA methylation of promoter CpG islands silences their downstream genes, and enhancer methylation can be associated with decreased or increased gene expression. DNA methylation alterations in normal and diseased cells provide rich information, such as tissue origin, disease risk, patient response, and prognosis. DNA methylation status is detected by bisulfite conversion, which converts unmethylated cytosines into uracils but methylated cytosines very inefficiently. A genome-wide DNA methylation analysis is conducted by a BeadChip microarray or next-generation sequencing (NGS) of bisulfite-treated DNA. A region-specific DNA methylation analysis can be conducted by various methods, such as methylation-specific PCR (MSP), quantitative MSP, and bisulfite sequencing.

We analyzed the association between TP53 mutation functional subtypes and genome-wide DNA methylation status (GWMS) as combined prognostic markers.Patient clinical data were obtained from the TRICOLORE study, a randomized phase III trial. The TP53 mutations were classified into wild-type, gain-of-function (GOF) mutations, and non-gain-of-function (non-GOF) mutations. GWMS of the tumor tissues classified them into high-methylated colorectal cancer (HMCC) and low-methylated colorectal cancer (LMCC). Overall survival (OS) was compared based on these subgroups.Of the 209 patients, 60 (28.7%) were HMCC and 149 (71.3%) were LMCC, 35 (16.7%) were TP53 wild-type and 174 (83.3%) were TP53 mutants including 79 (45.4%) GOF mutations and 95 (54.6%) non-GOF mutations. The OS of the HMCC group was shorter than that of the LMCC group (median 25.3 vs. 40.3 months, P < .001, hazard ratio 1.87) in the total cohort. The combined subgroup analyses of GWMS and TP53 mutation subtypes showed that the HMCC/GOF group had significantly shorter OS than the HMCC/non-GOF group, the LMCC/GOF group, and the LMCC/non-GOF group (median 17.7; 35.3, 40.3, and 41.2 months, P = .007, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively), regardless of the primary tumor location. By the multivariate analysis, only HMCC (P = .009) was a poor prognostic factor in the GOF mutation group.TP53 GOF with HMCC is a newly identified poorest prognostic molecular subset in metastatic colorectal cancer.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

"37353738","A pipeline for sample tagging of whole genome bisulfite sequencing data using genotypes of whole genome sequencing.","BMC Genomics","In large-scale high-throughput sequencing projects and biobank construction, sample tagging is essential to prevent sample mix-ups. Despite the availability of fingerprint panels for DNA data, little research has been conducted on sample tagging of whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data. This study aims to construct a pipeline and identify applicable fingerprint panels to address this problem.Using autosome-wide A/T polymorphic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) obtained from whole genome sequencing (WGS) and WGBS of individuals from the Third China National Stroke Registry, we designed a fingerprint panel and constructed an optimized pipeline for tagging WGBS data. This pipeline used Bis-SNP to call genotypes from the WGBS data, and optimized genotype comparison by eliminating wildtype homozygous and missing genotypes, and retaining variants with identical genomic coordinates and reference/alternative alleles. WGS-based and WGBS-based genotypes called from identical or different samples were extensively compared using hap.py. In the first batch of 94 samples, the genotype consistency rates were between 71.01%-84.23% and 51.43%-60.50% for the matched and mismatched WGS and WGBS data using the autosome-wide A/T polymorphic SNV panel. This capability to tag WGBS data was validated among the second batch of 240 samples, with genotype consistency rates ranging from 70.61%-84.65% to 49.58%-61.42% for the matched and mismatched data, respectively. We also determined that the number of genetic variants required to correctly tag WGBS data was on the order of thousands through testing six fingerprint panels with different orders for the number of variants. Additionally, we affirmed this result with two self-designed panels of 1351 and 1278 SNVs, respectively. Furthermore, this study confirmed that using the number of genetic variants with identical coordinates and ref/alt alleles, or identical genotypes could not correctly tag WGBS data.This study proposed an optimized pipeline, applicable fingerprint panels, and a lower boundary for the number of fingerprint genetic variants needed for correct sample tagging of WGBS data, which are valuable for tagging WGBS data and integrating multi-omics data for biobanks.© 2023.

Both tumours have similar morphological and immunohistochemical pattern and share multiple driver mutations. We hypothesised that DNA methylation-based machine-learning algorithms may help perform this task.We assembled genome-wide DNA methylation data for iCCA (n = 259), PAAD (n = 431), and normal bile duct (n = 70) from publicly available sources. We split this cohort into a reference (n = 399) and a validation set (n = 361). Using the reference cohort, we trained three machine learning models to differentiate between these entities. Furthermore, we validated the classifiers on the technical validation set and used an internal cohort (n = 72) to test our classifier.On the validation cohort, the neural network, support vector machine, and the random forest classifiers reached accuracies of 97.68%, 95.62%, and 96.5%, respectively. Filtering by anomaly detection and thresholds improved the accuracy to 99.07% (37 samples excluded by filtering), 96.22% (17 samples excluded), and 100% (44 samples excluded) for the neural network, support vector machine and random forest, respectively. Because of best balance between accuracy and number of predictable cases we tested the neural network with applied filters on the in-house cohort, obtaining an accuracy of 95.45%.We developed a classifier that can differentiate between iCCAs, intrahepatic metastases of a PAAD, and normal bile duct tissue with high accuracy.

"37345659","H2Bub1 loss is an early contributor to clear cell ovarian cancer progression.","JCI Insight","Epigenetic aberrations, including posttranslational modifications of core histones, are major contributors to cancer. Here, we define the status of histone H2B monoubiquitylation (H2Bub1) in clear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCOC), low-grade serous carcinoma, and endometrioid carcinomas. We report that clear cell carcinomas exhibited profound loss, with nearly all cases showing low or negative H2Bub1 expression. Moreover, we found that H2Bub1 loss occurred in endometriosis and atypical endometriosis, which are established precursors to CCOCs. To examine whether dysregulation of a specific E3 ligase contributes to the loss of H2Bub1, we explored expression of ring finger protein 40 (RNF40), ARID1A, and UBR7 in the same case cohort. Loss of RNF40 was significantly and profoundly correlated with loss of H2Bub1. Using genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of 230 patients with CCOC, we identified hypermethylation of RNF40 in CCOC as a likely mechanism underlying the loss of H2Bub1. Finally, we demonstrated that H2Bub1 depletion promoted cell proliferation and clonogenicity in an endometriosis cell line. Collectively, our results indicate that H2Bub1 plays a tumor-suppressive role in CCOCs and that its loss contributes to disease progression."

Genes with upward methylation trend were enriched for T-cell activity, while those with a downward trend were enriched for solute transport and cell structure organization functions.Conclusion:Consistent trends of DNA methylation in maternal peripheral blood point to the sentinel function of T cells in the maintenance of pregnancy, and the importance of coordinated cellular remodeling to facilitate term delivery."

Although HSC activation in liver disease is associated with changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and remodeling, it remains unclear how ECM regulates the phenotypic state transitions of HSCs. Using high-throughput cellular microarrays, coupled with genome-wide ATAC and RNA sequencing within engineered ECM microenvironments, we investigated the effect of ECM and substrate stiffness on chromatin accessibility and resulting gene expression in activated primary human HSCs. Cell microarrays demonstrated the cooperative effects of stiffness and ECM composition on H3K4 and H3K9 methylation/acetylation. ATAC sequencing revealed higher chromatin accessibility in HSCs on 1kPa compared to 25kPa substrates for all ECM conditions. Gene set enrichment analysis using RNA sequencing data of HSCs in defined ECM microenvironments demonstrated higher enrichment of NAFLD and fibrosis-related genes in pre-activated HSCs on 1kPa relative to 25kPa. Overall, these findings are indicative of a microenvironmental adaptation response in HSCs, and the acquisition of a persistent activation state. Combined ATAC/RNA sequencing analyses enabled identification of candidate regulatory factors, including HSD11B1 and CEBPb. siRNA-mediated knockdown of HSD11b1 and CEBPb demonstrated microenvironmental controlled reduction in fibrogenic markers in HSCs.

"37343754","Genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing identifies epigenetic perturbations in the upper airways under long-term exposure to moderate levels of ambient air pollution.","Environ Res","While the link between exposure to high levels of ambient particulate matter (PM) and increased incidences of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases is widely recognized, recent epidemiological studies have shown that low PM concentrations are equally associated with adverse health effects. As DNA methylation is one of the main mechanisms by which cells regulate and stabilize gene expression, changes in the methylome could constitute early indicators of dysregulated signaling pathways. So far, little is known about PM-associated DNA methylation changes in the upper airways, the first point of contact between airborne pollutants and the human body. Here, we focused on cells of the upper respiratory tract and assessed their genome-wide DNA methylation pattern to explore exposure-associated early regulatory changes. Using a mobile epidemiological laboratory, nasal lavage samples were collected from a cohort of 60 adults that lived in districts with records of low (Simmerath) or moderate (Stuttgart) PM10levels in Germany. PM10concentrations were verified by particle measurements on the days of the sample collection and genome-wide DNA methylation was determined by enzymatic methyl sequencing at single-base resolution. We identified 231 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between moderately and lowly PM10exposed individuals. A high proportion of DMRs overlapped with regulatory elements, and DMR target genes were involved in pathways regulating cellular redox homeostasis and immune response. In addition, we found distinct changes in DNA methylation of the HOXA gene cluster whose methylation levels have previously been linked to air pollution exposure but also to carcinogenesis in several instances. The findings of this study suggest that regulatory changes in upper airway cells occur at PM10levels below current European thresholds, some of which may be involved in the development of air pollution-related diseases.Copyright © 2023.

Our group previously showed the potential benefit of NSAIDs in decreasing the risk of delirium and mortality. Concurrently, epigenetics signals have also been associated with delirium. Therefore, we sought to find differentially methylated genes and biological pathways related to exposure with NSAIDs by comparing the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of patients with and without a history of NSAIDs use.Whole blood samples were collected from 171 patients at the University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics from November 2017 to March 2020. History of NSAIDs use was assessed through a word-search function in the subjects' electronic medical records. DNA was extracted from the blood samples, processed with bisulfite conversion, and analyzed using Illumina's EPIC array. The analysis of top differentially methylated CpG sites and subsequent enrichment analysis were conducted using an established pipeline using R statistical software.Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) showed several biological pathways relevant to NSAIDs' function. The identified GO terms included ""arachidonic acid metabolic process,"" while KEGG results included ""linoleic acid metabolism,"" ""cellular senescence,"" and ""circadian rhythm."" Nonetheless, none of the top GO and KEGG pathways and the top differentially methylated CpG sites reached statistical significance.Our results suggest a potential role of epigenetics in the mechanisms of the action of NSAIDs. However, the results should be viewed with caution as exploratory and hypothesis-generating given the lack of statistically significant findings.© 2023.

These proteins are involved in the development of various plant organs such as seeds, hypocotyls, flowers, leaves and also play a role in response to salt, drought and cold stresses. Despite their importance, there is limited information available on the evolutionary and structural characteristics of VQ family genes in Coix lacryma-jobi.In this study, a total of 31 VQ genes were identified from the coix genome and classified into seven subgroups (I-VII) based on phylogenetic analysis. These genes were found to be unevenly distributed on 10 chromosomes. Gene structure analysis revealed that these genes had a similar type of structure within each subfamily. Moreover, 27 of ClVQ genes were found to have no introns. Conserved domain and multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed the presence of a highly conserved sequences in the ClVQ protein. This research utilized quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and promoter analysis to investigate the expression of ClVQ genes under different stress conditions. Results showed that most ClVQ genes responded to polyethylene glycol, heat treatment, salt, abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate treatment with varying degrees of expression. Furthermore, some ClVQ genes exhibited significant correlation in expression changes under abiotic stress, indicating that these genes may act synergistically in response to adversarial stress. Additionally, yeast dihybrid verification revealed an interaction between ClVQ4, ClVQ12, and ClVQ26.This study conducted a genome-wide analysis of the VQ gene family in coix, including an examination of phylogenetic relationships, conserved domains, cis-elements and expression patterns. The goal of the study was to identify potential drought resistance candidate genes, providing a theoretical foundation for molecular resistance breeding.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Hypermethylated genes, including LIF, HLA-DRB1, HLA-G, MTOR, FADD, TGFB3, MALAT1, and CCL28; hypomethylated genes, including NCSTN, SMAD3, IGF1R, IL1F9, NOD2, NOD1, YY1, DLL1, and BCL2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of HS. These genes were enriched in the 117 different pathways (FDR P-values ≤0.05), including IL-4/IL-13 pathways, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling.The lack of wound healing, microbiome dysbiosis, and increased tumor susceptibility are all sustained by these dysfunctional methylomes, hopefully, capable to be targeted in the next future. Since methylome describes and summarizes genetic and environmental contributions, these data may represent a further step toward a feasible precision medicine also for HS patients.This article is protected by copyright.

"37334360","A synthetic glycodendropeptide induces methylation changes on regulatory T cells linked to tolerant responses in anaphylactic-mice.","Front Immunol","Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are allergens found in a wide range of plant-foods. Specifically, Pru p 3, the major allergen of peach, is commonly responsible for severe allergic reactions. The need for new alternatives to conventional food allergy treatments, like restrictive diets, suggests allergen immunotherapy as a promising option. It has been demonstrated that sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with synthetic glycodendropeptides, such as D1ManPrup3, containing mannose and Pru p 3 peptides induced tolerance in mice and that the persistence of this effect depends on treatment dose (2nM or 5nM). Moreover, it produces changes associated with differential gene expression and methylation profile of dendritic cells, as well as phenotypical changes in regulatory T cells (Treg). However, there are no works addressing the study of epigenetic changes in terms of methylation in the cell subsets that sustain tolerant responses, Treg. Therefore, in this work, DNA methylation changes in splenic-Treg from Pru p 3 anaphylactic mice were evaluated.It was performed by whole genome bisulphite sequencing comparing SLIT-D1ManPrup3 treated mice: tolerant (2nM D1ManPrup3), desensitized (5nM D1ManPrup3), and sensitized but not treated (antigen-only), with anaphylactic mice.Most of the methylation changes were found in the gene promoters from both SLIT-treated groups, desensitized (1,580) and tolerant (1,576), followed by the antigen-only (1,151) group. Although tolerant and desensitized mice showed a similar number of methylation changes, only 445 genes were shared in both. Remarkably, interesting methylation changes were observed on the promoter regions of critical transcription factors for Treg function likeStat4,Stat5a,Stat5b,Foxp3, andGata3. In fact,Foxp3was observed exclusively as hypomethylated in tolerant group, whereasGata3was only hypomethylated in the desensitized mice.In conclusion, diverse D1ManPrup3 doses induce different responses (tolerance or desensitization) in mice, which are reflected by differential methylation changes in Tregs.Copyright © 2023 Núñez, Rodríguez, Lebrón-Martín, Martín-Astorga, Ramos-Soriano, Rojo, Torres, Cañas and Mayorga."
"37333260","A first-generation genome-wide map of correlated DNA methylation demonstrates highly coordinated and tissue-independent clustering across regulatory regions.","Res Sq","Genome-wide DNA methylation studies have typically focused on quantitative assessments of CpG methylation at individual loci. Although methylation states at nearby CpG sites are known to be highly correlated, suggestive of an underlying coordinated regulatory network, the extent and consistency of inter-CpG methylation correlation across the genome, including variation between individuals, disease states, and tissues, remains unknown. Here, we leverage image conversion of correlation matrices to identify correlated methylation units (CMUs) across the genome, describe their variation across tissues, and annotate their regulatory potential using 35 public Illumina BeadChip datasets spanning more than 12,000 individuals and 26 different tissues. We identified a median of 18,125 CMUs genome-wide, occurring on all chromosomes and spanning a median of ~1 kb. Notably, 50% of CMUs had evidence of long-range correlation with other proximal CMUs. Although the size and number of CMUs varied across datasets, we observed strong intra-tissue consistency among CMUs, with those in testis encompassing those seen in most other tissues. Approximately 20% of CMUs were highly conserved across normal tissues (i.e. tissue independent), with 73 loci demonstrating strong correlation with non-adjacent CMUs on the same chromosome. These loci were enriched for CTCF and transcription factor binding sites, always found within putative TADs, and associated with the B compartment of chromosome folding. Finally, we observed significantly different, but highly consistent, patterns of CMU correlation between diseased and non-diseased states. Our first-generation, genome-wide, DNA methylation map suggests a highly coordinated CMU regulatory network that is sensitive to disruptions in its architecture."
"37333181","H2A.X promotes endosperm-specific DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana.","Res Sq","Background H2A.X is an H2A variant histone in eukaryotes, unique for its ability to respond to DNA damage, initiating the DNA repair pathway. H2A.X replacement within the histone octamer is mediated by the FAcilitates Chromatin Transactions (FACT) complex, a key chromatin remodeler. FACT is required for DEMETER (DME)-mediated DNA demethylation at certain loci inArabidopsis thalianafemale gametophytes during reproduction. Here, we sought to investigate whether H2A.X is involved in DME- and FACT-mediated DNA demethylation during reproduction. Results H2A.X is encoded by two genes in Arabidopsis genome,HTA3andHTA5. We generatedh2a.xdouble mutants, which displayed a normal growth profile, whereby flowering time, seed development, and root tip organization, S-phase progression and proliferation were all normal. However,h2a.xmutants were more sensitive to genotoxic stress, consistent with previous reports. H2A.X fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) under theH2A.Xpromoter was highly expressed especially in newly developing Arabidopsis tissues, including in male and female gametophytes, where DME is also expressed. We examined DNA methylation inh2a.xdeveloping seeds and seedlings using whole genome bisulfite sequencing, and found that CG DNA methylation is decreased genome-wide inh2a.xmutant seeds. Hypomethylation was most striking in transposon bodies, and occurred on both parental alleles in the developing endosperm, but not the embryo or seedling.h2a.x-mediated hypomethylated sites overlapped DME targets, but also included other loci, predominately located in heterochromatic transposons and intergenic DNA. Conclusions Our genome-wide methylation analyses suggest that H2A.X could function in preventing access of the DME demethylase to non-canonical sites. Alternatively, H2A.X may be involved in recruiting methyltransferases to those sites. Overall, our data suggest that H2A.X is required to maintain DNA methylation homeostasis in the unique chromatin environment of the Arabidopsis endosperm."

Here, we report the regulation of microRNA-219a-2 (mir-219a-2) by DNA methylation in fibrotic kidneys, unveiling the crosstalk between these epigenetic mechanisms. Through genome-wide DNA methylation analysis and pyro-sequencing, we detected the hypermethylation of mir-219a-2 in renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO) or renal ischemia/reperfusion, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in mir-219a-5p expression. Functionally, overexpression of mir-219a-2 enhanced fibronectin induction during hypoxia or TGF-β1 treatment of cultured renal cells. In mice, inhibition of mir-219a-5p suppressed fibronectin accumulation in UUO kidneys. ALDH1L2 was identified to be the direct target gene of mir-219a-5p in renal fibrosis. Mir-219a-5p suppressed ALDH1L2 expression in cultured renal cells, while inhibition of mir-219a-5p prevented the decrease of ALDH1L2 in UUO kidneys. Knockdown of ALDH1L2 enhanced PAI-1 induction during TGF-β1 treatment of renal cells, which was associated with fibronectin expression. In conclusion, the hypermethylation of mir-219a-2 in response to fibrotic stress attenuates mir-219a-5p expression and induces the up-regulation of its target gene ALDH1L2, which may reduce fibronectin deposition by suppressing PAI-1."

We assembled the genome of a female hihi (Notiomysits cincta), a threatened passerine bird endemic to Aotearoa New Zealand. The assembled genome is 1.06 Gb, and is of high quality and highly contiguous, with a contig N50 of 7.0 Mb, estimated QV of 44 and a BUSCO completeness of 96.8%. A male assembly of comparable quality was generated in parallel. A population linkage map was used to scaffold the autosomal contigs into chromosomes. Female and male sequence coverage and comparative genomics analyses were used to identify Z-, and W-linked contigs. In total, 94.6% of the assembly length was assigned to putative nuclear chromosome scaffolds. Native DNA methylation was highly correlated between sexes, with the W chromosome contigs more highly methylated than autosomal chromosomes and Z contigs. 43 differentially methylated regions were identified, and these may represent interesting candidates for the establishment or maintenance of sex differences. By generating a high-quality reference assembly of the heterogametic sex, we have created a resource that enables characterization of genome-wide diversity and facilitates the investigation of female-specific evolutionary processes. The reference genomes will form the basis for fine-scale assessment of the impacts of low genetic diversity and inbreeding on the adaptive potential of the species and will therefore enable tailored and informed conservation management of this threatened taonga (treasured) species.© 2023 The Authors.

We aim firstly to determine whether the circulating DNA methylome in patients requiring surgery may predict Crohn's disease (CD) recurrence following intestinal resection; and secondly to compare the circulating methylome seen in patients with established CD with that we had reported in a series of inception cohorts.TOPPIC was a placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial of 6-mecaptopurine at 29 UK centres in CD patients undergoing ileocolic resection between 2008 and 2012. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood samples from 229 of the 240 patients taken prior to intestinal surgery and analysed using 450KHuman Methylation and Infinium Omni Express Exome arrays (Illumina, San Diego). Co-primary objectives were to determine whether methylation alterations may predict clinical disease recurrence; and to assess whether the epigenetic alterations previously reported in newly diagnosed IBD were present in the CD patients recruited into the TOPPIC study. Differential methylation (DMP) and variance (DVP) analysis was performed comparing patients with and without clinical evidence of recurrence. Secondary analyses included investigation of methylation associations with smoking, genotype (MeQTLs), and chronological age. Validation of our previously published case-control observation of the methylome was performed using historical control data (CD n = 123, Control n=198).Crohn's disease recurrence in patients following surgery is associated with five differentially methylated positions (DMPs, Holm p <0.05), including probes mapping to WHSC1 (p=4.1 × 10-9, Holm p = 0.002) and EFNA3 (p=4.9 × 10-8, Holm p = 0.02). Five differentially variable positions (DVPs) are demonstrated in the group of patients with evidence of disease recurrence including a probe mapping to MAD1L1 (p = 6.4 × 10-5). DNA methylation clock analyses demonstrated significant age acceleration in Crohn's disease compared with controls (GrimAge + 2 years (95% Confidence intervals 1.2 to 2.7 years)); with some evidence for accelerated aging in Crohn's patients with disease recurrence following surgery (GrimAge +1.04 years (95% CI -0.04 to 2.22)). Significant methylation differences between CD cases and controls were seen by comparing this cohort in conjunction with previously published control data, including validation of our previously described differentially methylated positions (RPS6KA2 p=1.2×10-19, SBNO2=1.2×10-11) and regions (TXK [FDR p = 3.6 ×10-14], WRAP73 [FDR p = 1.9 ×10-9], VMP1 [FDR p = 1.7 ×10-7] and ITGB2 [FDR p=1.4×10-7]).We demonstrate differential methylation and differentially variable methylation in patients developing clinical recurrence within 3 years of surgery. Moreover, we report replication of the CD-associated methylome, previously characterised only in adult and paediatric inception cohorts, in patients with medically refractory disease needing surgery.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

The environmental epigenetics hypothesis proposes that sustained effects of environmental conditions on gene expression are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. Recent human studies have shown that adversities in childhood are correlated with DNA methylation (DNAm) in adulthood. In the current study, we tested the following pre-registered hypotheses: Mothers' adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are correlated with DNAm in peripheral blood during pregnancy (hypothesis 1) and in cord blood samples from newborn infants (hypothesis 2), and women's depression and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy mediate the association between mothers' ACE exposure and prenatal/neonatal DNA methylation (hypothesis 3).Data were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children Accessible Resource for Integrated Epigenomic Studies substudy. Women provided retrospective self-reports during pregnancy of ACE exposure. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study testing whether mothers' ACE exposure, cumulative score (0-10), was associated with DNAm in maternal antenatal blood and infant cord blood in more than 450,000 CpG (point on DNA sequence where Cytosine and Guanine base pairs are linked by a phosphate, where methylation usually occurs) sites on the Illumina 450K BeadChip. Analyses for cord blood were separated by infant sex, a pre-registered analysis.Hypothesis 1: In 896 mother-infant pairs with available methylation and ACE exposure data, there were no significant associations between mothers' ACE score and DNAm from antenatal peripheral blood, after controlling for covariates. Hypothesis 2: In infant cord blood, there were 5 CpG sites significantly differentially methylated in relation to mothers' ACEs (false discovery rate [FDR] < .05), but only in male offspring. Effect sizes were medium, with partial eta squared values ranging from 0.060 to 0.078. CpG sites were in genes related to mitochondrial function and neuronal development in the cerebellum. Hypothesis 3: There was no mediation by maternal anxiety/depression symptoms found between mothers' ACEs score and DNAm in the significant CpG sites in male cord blood. Mediation was not tested in antenatal peripheral blood, because no direct association between mothers' ACE score and antenatal peripheral blood was found.Our results show that mothers' ACE exposure is associated with DNAm in male offspring, supporting the notion that DNAm could be a marker of intergenerational biological embedding of mothers' childhood adversity.Epigenetic Intergenerational Transmission: Mothers' Adverse Childhood Experiences and DNA Methylation; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.03.008.Copyright © 2023.

"37327798","Association between the timing of childhood adversity and epigenetic patterns across childhood and adolescence: findings from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) prospective cohort.","Lancet Child Adolesc Health","Childhood adversity is a potent determinant of health across development and is associated with altered DNA methylation signatures, which might be more common in children exposed during sensitive periods in development. However, it remains unclear whether adversity has persistent epigenetic associations across childhood and adolescence. We aimed to examine the relationship between time-varying adversity (defined through sensitive period, accumulation of risk, and recency life course hypotheses) and genome-wide DNA methylation, measured three times from birth to adolescence, using data from a prospective, longitudinal cohort study.We first investigated the relationship between the timing of exposure to childhood adversity between birth and 11 years and blood DNA methylation at age 15 years in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) prospective cohort study. Our analytic sample included ALSPAC participants with DNA methylation data and complete childhood adversity data between birth and 11 years. We analysed seven types of adversity (caregiver physical or emotional abuse, sexual or physical abuse [by anyone], maternal psychopathology, one-adult households, family instability, financial hardship, and neighbourhood disadvantage) reported by mothers five to eight times between birth and 11 years. We used the structured life course modelling approach (SLCMA) to identify time-varying associations between childhood adversity and adolescent DNA methylation. Top loci were identified using an R2threshold of 0·035 (ie, ≥3·5% of DNA methylation variance explained by adversity). We attempted to replicate these associations using data from the Raine Study and Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS). We also assessed the persistence of adversity-DNA methylation associations we previously identified from age 7 blood DNA methylation into adolescence and the influence of adversity on DNA methylation trajectories from ages 0-15 years.Of 13 988 children in the ALSPAC cohort, 609-665 children (311-337 [50-51%] boys and 298-332 [49-50%] girls) had complete data available for at least one of the seven childhood adversities and DNA methylation at 15 years. Exposure to adversity was associated with differences in DNA methylation at 15 years for 41 loci (R2≥0·035). Sensitive periods were the most often selected life course hypothesis by the SLCMA. 20 (49%) of 41 loci were associated with adversities occurring between age 3 and 5 years. Exposure to one-adult households was associated with differences in DNA methylation at 20 [49%] of 41 loci, exposure to financial hardship was associated with changes at nine (22%) loci, and physical or sexual abuse was associated with changes at four (10%) loci. We replicated the direction of associations for 18 (90%) of 20 loci associated with exposure to one-adult household using adolescent blood DNA methylation from the Raine Study and 18 (64%) of 28 loci using saliva DNA methylation from the FFCWS. The directions of effects for 11 one-adult household loci were replicated in both cohorts. Differences in DNA methylation at 15 years were not present at 7 years and differences identified at 7 years were no longer apparent by 15 years. We also identified six distinct DNA methylation trajectories from these patterns of stability and persistence.These findings highlight the time-varying effect of childhood adversity on DNA methylation profiles across development, which might link exposure to adversity to potential adverse health outcomes in children and adolescents. If replicated, these epigenetic signatures could ultimately serve as biological indicators or early warning signs of initiated disease processes, helping identify people at greater risk for the adverse health consequences of childhood adversity.Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Cohort and Longitudinal Studies Enhancement Resources, EU's Horizon 2020, US National Institute of Mental Health.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

"37327786","DNA hypomethylation silences anti-tumor immune genes in early prostate cancer and CTCs.","Cell","Cancer is characterized by hypomethylation-associated silencing of large chromatin domains, whose contribution to tumorigenesis is uncertain. Through high-resolution genome-wide single-cell DNA methylation sequencing, we identify 40 core domains that are uniformly hypomethylated from the earliest detectable stages of prostate malignancy through metastatic circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Nested among these repressive domains are smaller loci with preserved methylation that escape silencing and are enriched for cell proliferation genes. Transcriptionally silenced genes within the core hypomethylated domains are enriched for immune-related genes; prominent among these is a single gene cluster harboring all five CD1 genes that present lipid antigens to NKT cells and four IFI16-related interferon-inducible genes implicated in innate immunity. The re-expression of CD1 or IFI16 murine orthologs in immuno-competent mice abrogates tumorigenesis, accompanied by the activation of anti-tumor immunity. Thus, early epigenetic changes may shape tumorigenesis, targeting co-located genes within defined chromosomal loci. Hypomethylation domains are detectable in blood specimens enriched for CTCs.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

During the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have emerged as a powerful tool to identify genetic risk factors for DKD. In recent years, the GWASs have acquired larger number of participants, leading to increased statistical power to detect more genetic risk factors. In addition, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing studies are emerging, aiming to identify rare genetic risk factors for DKD, as well as epigenome-wide association studies, investigating DNA methylation in relation to DKD. This article aims to review the identified genetic and epigenetic risk factors for DKD.Copyright © 2023 Sandholm, Dahlström and Groop."

The alteration of DNA methylation in the blood was examined to investigate epigenetic modification by GM1 treatment.After a 28-day continuous intravenous infusion of GM1 (100mg), the motor and non-motor symptoms were evaluated by UPDRS III, Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, FS-14, SCOPA-AUT, and PDQ-8. Moreover, blood samples were collected and PBMC was isolated. Genome-wide DNA methylation was performed by an 850K BeadChip. RNA levels and apoptosis were examined by RT-PCR and flow cytometry in rotenone-based cell models. The CREB5 plasmid was transfected by electroporation into SH-SY5Y cells. We also identified 235 methylation variable positions achieving genome-wide significance in 717558 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) (P= 0.0003) in comparison of pre-treatment with post-treatment measurements (statistical analysis paired-samplest-test).By searching the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset and GWAS, 23 methylation variable positions were screened. Moreover, there are 7 hypomethylated methylation variable positions correlated with the scores of motor symptoms (UPDRS III scale). According to KEGG pathways enrichment analysis, the methylated genes CACNA1B (hypomethylated), CREB5 (hypermethylated), GNB4 (hypomethylated), and PPP2R5A (hypomethylated) were enriched in the dopaminergic synapse pathway. Pretreated with GM1 (80 μM) for 1 h, cell apoptosis and impaired neurite outgrowth were inhibited in rotenone-induced PD cell models. The RNA expression of CREB5 was increased in rotenone-treated SH-SY5Y cells. GM1 treatment decreased rotenone-induced CREB5 gene expression. The enhancement of CREB5 gene expression suppressed the protective role of GM1 in rotenone-induced cell apoptosis.The application of GM1 improves the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD associated with the decreased CREB5 expression and the hypermethylation of CREB5.https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=120582t, identifier ChiCTR2100042537.Copyright © 2023 Wang, Tong, Wang, Zou, Wang, Sun, Zhou, Chen and Wang."

Early diagnosis is crucial to improve the prognosis of patients with lung cancer. Plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) contains comprehensive genetic and epigenetic information from tissues throughout the body, suggesting that early detection of lung cancer can be done non-invasively, conveniently, and cost-effectively using high-sensitivity techniques such as sequencing.In this review, we summarize the latest technological innovations, coupled with next-generation sequencing (NGS), regarding genomic alterations, methylation, and fragmentomic features of cfDNA for the early detection of lung cancer, as well as their clinical advances. Additionally, we discuss the suitability of study designs for diagnostic accuracy evaluation for different target populations and clinical questions.Currently, cfDNA-based early screening and diagnosis of lung cancer faces many challenges, such as unsatisfactory performance, lack of quality control standards, and poor repeatability. However, the progress of several large prospective studies employing epigenetic features has shown promising predictive performance, which has inspired cfDNA sequencing for future clinical applications. Furthermore, the development of multi-omics markers for lung cancer, including genome-wide methylation and fragmentomics, is expected to play an increasingly important role in the future."

We have identified the transforming event in this AML and possible ways of treatment. Retroviral expression of MNX1 was able to induce AML in mice, with similar gene expression and pathway enrichment to t(7;12) AML patient data. Importantly, this leukemia was only induced in immune incompetent mice using fetal but not adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. The restriction in transforming capacity to cells from fetal liver is in alignment with t(7;12)(q36;p13) AML being mostly seen in infants. Expression of MNX1 led to increased histone 3 lysine 4 mono-, di- and trimethylation, reduction in H3K27me3, accompanied with changes in genome-wide chromatin accessibility and genome expression, likely mediated through MNX1 interaction with the methionine cycle and methyltransferases. MNX1 expression increased DNA damage, depletion of the Lin- /Sca1+/c-Kit+ population and skewing toward the myeloid lineage. These effects, together with leukemia development, was prevented by pretreatment with the S-adenosylmethionine analog Sinefungin. In conclusion, we have shown the importance of MNX1 in development of AML with t(7;12), supporting a rationale for targeting MNX1 and downstream pathways."

To identify factors involved in the switch from HBG to HBB expression, we performed Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq)2on sorted erythroid lineage cells derived from bone marrow (BM) or cord blood (CB), representing adult and fetal states, respectively. BM to CB cell ATAC-seq profile comparisons revealed genome-wide enrichment of NFI DNA binding motifs and increased NFIX promoter chromatin accessibility, suggesting that NFIX may repress HBG. NFIX knockdown in BM cells increased HBG mRNA and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) protein levels, coincident with increased chromatin accessibility and decreased DNA methylation at the HBG promoter. Conversely, overexpression of NFIX in CB cells reduced HbF levels.

However, research on strain optimization utilizing DNA methylation for breakthroughs is rare. Based on DNA methylome analysis and KEGG pathway assignment in Streptomyces roseosporus, we discovered an environmental stress resistance regulator, TagR. A series ofin vivoandin vitroexperiments identified TagR as a negative regulator, and it is the first reported regulator of the wall teichoic acid (WTA) ABC transport system. Further study showed that TagR had a positive self-regulatory loop and m4C methylation in the promoter improved its expression. The ΔtagRmutant exhibited better hyperosmotic resistance and higher decanoic acid tolerance than the wild type, which led to a 100% increase in the yield of daptomycin. Moreover, enhancing the expression of the WTA transporter resulted in better osmotic stress resistance in Streptomyces lividans TK24, indicating the potential for wide application of the TagR-WTA transporter regulatory pathway. This research confirmed the feasibility and effectiveness of mining regulators of environmental stress resistance based on the DNA methylome, characterized the mechanism of TagR, and improved the resistance and daptomycin yield of strains. Furthermore, this research provides a new perspective on the optimization of industrial actinomycetes.IMPORTANCEThis study established a novel strategy for screening regulators of environmental stress resistance based on the DNA methylome and discovered a new regulator, TagR.

"37333730","Epigenetics and the Exposome: DNA Methylation as a Proxy for Health Impacts of Prenatal Environmental Exposures.","Exposome","The accumulation of every day exposures can impact health across the life course, but our understanding of such exposures is impeded by our ability to delineate the relationship between an individual's early life exposome and later life health effects. Measuring the exposome is challenging. Exposure assessed at a given time point captures a snapshot of the exposome but does not represent the full spectrum of exposures across the life course. In addition, the assessment of early life exposures and their effects is often further challenged by lack of relevant samples and the time gap between exposures and related health outcomes in later life. Epigenetics, specifically DNA methylation, has the potential to overcome these barriers as environmental epigenetic perturbances can be retained through time. In this review, we describe how DNA methylation can be framed in the world of the exposome. We offer three compelling examples of common environmental exposures, including cigarette smoke, the endocrine active compound bisphenol A (BPA), and the metal lead (Pb), to illustrate the application of DNA methylation as a proxy to measure the exposome. We discuss areas for future explorations and current limitations of this approach. Epigenetic profiling is a promising and rapidly developing tool and field of study, offering us a unique and powerful way to assess the early life exposome and its effects across different life stages."

While it is recognized that DNA methylation is tissue-specific, a limitation for many studies is the ability to sample the tissue of interest, which is why there is a need for a proxy tissue such as blood, that is reflective of the methylation state of the target tissue. In the last decade, DNA methylation has been utilized in the design of epigenetic clocks, which aim to predict an individual's biological age based on an algorithmically defined set of CpGs. A number of studies have found associations between disease and/or disease risk with increased biological age, adding weight to the theory of increased biological age being linked with disease processes.

Participants in CARDIA underwent 8 follow-up exams from baseline (year 0 [Y0]; 1985-1986) to Y30 (2015-2016), and participant blood DNA methylation information was obtained at Y15 (2000-2001) and Y20 (2005-2006). Individuals from Y15 and Y20 with available DNA methylation data and complete variables for ACEs and covariates were included. Data were analyzed from September 2021 to August 2022.Participant ACEs (general negligence, emotional negligence, physical violence, physical negligence, household substance abuse, verbal and emotional abuse, and household dysfunction) were obtained at Y15.The primary outcome consisted of results from 5 DNA methylation-based EAA measurements known to be associated with biological aging and long-term health: intrinsic EAA (IEAA), extrinsic EAA (EEAA), PhenoAge acceleration (PhenoAA), GrimAge acceleration (GrimAA), and Dunedin Pace of Aging Calculated From the Epigenome (DunedinPACE), measured at Y15 and Y20. Linear regression and generalized estimating equations were used to assess associations of the burden of ACEs (≥4 vs <4 ACEs) with EAA adjusting for demographics, health-related behaviors, and early life and adult socioeconomic status.A total of 895 participants for Y15 (mean [SD] age, 40.4 [3.5] years; 450 males [50.3%] and 445 females [49.7%]; 319 Black [35.6%] and 576 White [64.4%]) and 867 participants for Y20 (mean [SD] age, 45.4 [3.5] years; 432 males [49.8%] and 435 females [50.2%]; 306 Black [35.3%] and 561 White [64.7%]) were included after excluding participants with missing data.

"37300821","Prenatal maternal stress is associated with site-specific and age acceleration changes in maternal and newborn DNA methylation.","Epigenetics","Prenatal maternal stress has a negative impact on child health but the mechanisms through which maternal stress affects child health are unclear. Epigenetic variation, such as DNA methylation, is a likely mechanistic candidate as DNA methylation is sensitive to environmental insults and can regulate long-term changes in gene expression. We recruited 155 mother-newborn dyads in the Democratic Republic of Congo to investigate the effects of maternal stress on DNA methylation in mothers and newborns. We used four measures of maternal stress to capture a range of stressful experiences: general trauma, sexual trauma, war trauma, and chronic stress. We identified differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with general trauma, sexual trauma, and war trauma in both mothers and newborns. No DMPs were associated with chronic stress. Sexual trauma was positively associated with epigenetic age acceleration across several epigenetic clocks in mothers. General trauma and war trauma were positively associated with newborn epigenetic age acceleration using the extrinsic epigenetic age clock. We tested the top DMPs for enrichment of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) and found no enrichment in mothers. In newborns, top DMPs associated with war trauma were enriched for DHS in embryonic and foetal cell types. Finally, one of the top DMPs associated with war trauma in newborns also predicted birthweight, completing the cycle from maternal stress to DNA methylation to newborn health outcome. Our results indicate that maternal stress is associated with site-specific changes in DNAm and epigenetic age acceleration in both mothers and newborns."
"37311745","Immune resilience despite inflammatory stress promotes longevity and favorable health outcomes including resistance to infection.","Nat Commun","Some people remain healthier throughout life than others but the underlying reasons are poorly understood. Here we hypothesize this advantage is attributable in part to optimal immune resilience (IR), defined as the capacity to preserve and/or rapidly restore immune functions that promote disease resistance (immunocompetence) and control inflammation in infectious diseases as well as other causes of inflammatory stress. We gauge IR levels with two distinct peripheral blood metrics that quantify the balance between (i) CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell levels and (ii) gene expression signatures tracking longevity-associated immunocompetence and mortality-associated inflammation. Profiles of IR metrics in ~48,500 individuals collectively indicate that some persons resist degradation of IR both during aging and when challenged with varied inflammatory stressors. With this resistance, preservation of optimal IR tracked (i) a lower risk of HIV acquisition, AIDS development, symptomatic influenza infection, and recurrent skin cancer; (ii) survival during COVID-19 and sepsis; and (iii) longevity. IR degradation is potentially reversible by decreasing inflammatory stress. Overall, we show that optimal IR is a trait observed across the age spectrum, more common in females, and aligned with a specific immunocompetence-inflammation balance linked to favorable immunity-dependent health outcomes. IR metrics and mechanisms have utility both as biomarkers for measuring immune health and for improving health outcomes.© 2023.

Here, we undertake single-variant and gene-based association analyses upon 6 neurocognitive phenotypes across 6 cognition domains in whole-exome sequencing data from 157,160 individuals of the UK Biobank cohort to expound the genetic architecture of human cognition. We report 20 independent loci associated with 5 cognitive domains while controlling forAPOEisoform-carrier status and metabolic risk factors; 18 of which were not previously reported, and implicated genes relating to oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity and connectivity, and neuroinflammation. A subset of significant hits for cognition indicates mediating effects via metabolic traits. Some of these variants also exhibit pleiotropic effects on metabolic traits. We further identify previously unknown interactions ofAPOEvariants withLRP1(rs34949484 and others, suggestively significant),AMIGO1(rs146766120; pAla25Thr, significant), andITPR3(rs111522866, significant), controlling for lipid and glycemic risks. Our gene-based analysis also suggests thatAPOC1andLRP1have plausible roles along shared pathways of amyloid beta (Aβ) and lipid and/or glucose metabolism in affecting complex processing speed and visual attention. In addition, we report pairwise suggestive interactions of variants harbored in these genes withAPOEaffecting visual attention. Our report based on this large-scale exome-wide study highlights the effects of neuronal genes, such asLRP1,AMIGO1, and other genomic loci, thus providing further evidence of the genetic underpinnings for cognition during aging.© 2023 The Authors."

This is also true for the hematopoietic system, where it has been demonstrated that hematopoietic stem cells alter a variety of features, such as their metabolism, and accumulate DNA damage, which can lead to clonal outgrowth over time. In addition, profound changes in the bone marrow microenvironment upon aging lead to senescence in certain cell types such as mesenchymal stem cells and result in increased inflammation. This heterogeneity makes it difficult to pinpoint the molecular drivers of organismal aging gained from bulk approaches, such as RNA sequencing. A better understanding of the heterogeneity underlying the aging process in the hematopoietic compartment is, therefore, needed. With the advances of single-cell technologies in recent years, it is now possible to address fundamental questions of aging. In this review, we discuss how single-cell approaches can and indeed are already being used to understand changes observed during aging in the hematopoietic compartment.

These findings offer promising applications in cancer detection, subtyping, and treatment monitoring. However, much of the current evidence is based on findings in retrospective studies and may reflect epigenetic patterns that have already been influenced by the onset of the disease.Studying breast cancer, we established genome-scale DNA methylation profiles of prospectively collected buffy coat samples (n = 702) from a case-control study nested within the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS).We observed cancer-specific DNA methylation events in buffy coat samples. Increased DNA methylation in genomic regions associated with SURF6 and REXO1/CTB31O20.3 was linked to the length of time to diagnosis in the prospectively collected buffy coat DNA from individuals who subsequently developed breast cancer. Using machine learning methods, we piloted a DNA methylation-based classifier that predicted case-control status in a held-out validation set with 76.5% accuracy, in some cases up to 15 years before clinical diagnosis of the disease.Taken together, our findings suggest a model of gradual accumulation of cancer-associated DNA methylation patterns in peripheral blood, which may be detected long before clinical manifestation of cancer. Such changes may provide useful markers for risk stratification and, ultimately, personalized cancer prevention.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The contribution of these targets to fragile X syndrome (FXS) and related autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains unclear. Here, we show that FMRP deficiency leads to elevated microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) in developing human and non-human primate cortical neurons. Targeted MAP1B gene activation in healthy human neurons or MAP1B gene triplication in ASD patient-derived neurons inhibit morphological and physiological maturation. Activation of Map1b in adult male mouse prefrontal cortex excitatory neurons impairs social behaviors. We show that elevated MAP1B sequesters components of autophagy and reduces autophagosome formation. Both MAP1B knockdown and autophagy activation rescue deficits of both ASD and FXS patients' neurons and FMRP-deficient neurons in ex vivo human brain tissue.

"37323535","G-quadruplexes and associated proteins in aging and Alzheimer's disease.","Front Aging","Aging is a prominent risk factor for many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alzheimer's disease is characterized by progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, and neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms, accounting for most of the reported dementia cases. This disease is now becoming a major challenge and burden on modern society, especially with the aging population. Over the last few decades, a significant understanding of the pathophysiology of AD has been gained by studying amyloid deposition, hyperphosphorylated tau, synaptic dysfunction, oxidative stress, calcium dysregulation, and neuroinflammation. This review focuses on the role of non-canonical secondary structures of DNA/RNA G-quadruplexes (G4s, G4-DNA, and G4-RNA), G4-binding proteins (G4BPs), and helicases, and their roles in aging and AD. Being critically important for cellular function, G4s are involved in the regulation of DNA and RNA processes, such as replication, transcription, translation, RNA localization, and degradation. Recent studies have also highlighted G4-DNA's roles in inducing DNA double-strand breaks that cause genomic instability and G4-RNA's participation in regulating stress granule formation. This review emphasizes the significance of G4s in aging processes and how their homeostatic imbalance may contribute to the pathophysiology of AD.Copyright © 2023 Vijay Kumar, Morales and Tsvetkov."
"37293101","Cell type deconvolution of bulk blood RNA-Seq to reveal biological insights of neuropsychiatric disorders.","bioRxiv","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered susceptibility loci associated with psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder (BP) and schizophrenia (SCZ). However, most of these loci are in non-coding regions of the genome with unknown causal mechanisms of the link between genetic variation and disease risk. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis of bulk tissue is a common approach to decipher underlying mechanisms, though this can obscure cell-type specific signals thus masking trait-relevant mechanisms. While single-cell sequencing can be prohibitively expensive in large cohorts, computationally inferred cell type proportions and cell type gene expression estimates have the potential to overcome these problems and advance mechanistic studies. Using bulk RNA-Seq from 1,730 samples derived from whole blood in a cohort ascertained for individuals with BP and SCZ this study estimated cell type proportions and their relation with disease status and medication. We found between 2,875 and 4,629 eGenes for each cell type, including 1,211 eGenes that are not found using bulk expression alone. We performed a colocalization test between cell type eQTLs and various traits and identified hundreds of associations between cell type eQTLs and GWAS loci that are not detected in bulk eQTLs. Finally, we investigated the effects of lithium use on cell type expression regulation and found examples of genes that are differentially regulated dependent on lithium use.

We observed the heritability estimates of some phenotypes varied substantially across populations and 53.3% of trans-ethnic genetic correlations were significantly smaller than one. Next, we examined whether EUR-associated SNPs of these phenotypes could be identified in EAS using the trans-ethnic false discovery rate method while accounting for winner's curse for SNP effect in EUR and difference of sample sizes in EAS. We found on average 54.5% of EUR-associated SNPs were also significant in EAS. Furthermore, we discovered non-significant SNPs had higher effect heterogeneity, and significant SNPs showed more consistent linkage disequilibrium and allele frequency patterns between the two populations. We also demonstrated non-significant SNPs were more likely to undergo natural selection.Our study revealed the extent to which EUR-associated SNPs could be significant in the EAS population and offered deep insights into the similarity and diversity of genetic architectures underlying phenotypes in distinct ancestral groups.© 2023.

"37308816","Similarity and diversity of genetic architecture for complex traits between East Asian and European populations.","BMC Genomics","Genome-wide association studies have detected a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex traits in diverse ancestral groups. However, the trans-ethnic similarity and diversity of genetic architecture is not well understood currently.By leveraging summary statistics of 37 traits from East Asian (Nmax=254,373) or European (Nmax=693,529) populations, we first evaluated the trans-ethnic genetic correlation (ρg) and found substantial evidence of shared genetic overlap underlying these traits between the two populations, with [Formula: see text] ranging from 0.53 (se = 0.11) for adult-onset asthma to 0.98 (se = 0.17) for hemoglobin A1c. However, 88.9% of the genetic correlation estimates were significantly less than one, indicating potential heterogeneity in genetic effect across populations. We next identified common associated SNPs using the conjunction conditional false discovery rate method and observed 21.7% of trait-associated SNPs can be identified simultaneously in both populations. Among these shared associated SNPs, 20.8% showed heterogeneous influence on traits between the two ancestral populations. Moreover, we demonstrated that population-common associated SNPs often exhibited more consistent linkage disequilibrium and allele frequency pattern across ancestral groups compared to population-specific or null ones. We also revealed population-specific associated SNPs were much likely to undergo natural selection compared to population-common associated SNPs.Our study provides an in-depth understanding of similarity and diversity regarding genetic architecture for complex traits across diverse populations, and can assist in trans-ethnic association analysis, genetic risk prediction, and causal variant fine mapping.© 2023.

"37349475","Advancing preclinical chronic stress models to promote therapeutic discovery for human stress disorders.","Neuropsychopharmacology","There is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments for stress-related illnesses, which include depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety. We view animal models as playing an essential role in this effort, but to date, such approaches have generally not succeeded in developing therapeutics with new mechanisms of action. This is partly due to the complexity of the brain and its disorders, but also to inherent difficulties in modeling human disorders in rodents and to the incorrect use of animal models: namely, trying to recapitulate a human syndrome in a rodent which is likely not possible as opposed to using animals to understand underlying mechanisms and evaluating potential therapeutic paths. Recent transcriptomic research has established the ability of several different chronic stress procedures in rodents to recapitulate large portions of the molecular pathology seen in postmortem brain tissue of individuals with depression. These findings provide crucial validation for the clear relevance of rodent stress models to better understand the pathophysiology of human stress disorders and help guide therapeutic discovery. In this review, we first discuss the current limitations of preclinical chronic stress models as well as traditional behavioral phenotyping approaches. We then explore opportunities to dramatically enhance the translational use of rodent stress models through the application of new experimental technologies. The goal of this review is to promote the synthesis of these novel approaches in rodents with human cell-based approaches and ultimately with early-phase proof-of-concept studies in humans to develop more effective treatments for human stress disorders.© 2023.

"37340466","Sex specific molecular networks and key drivers of Alzheimer's disease.","Mol Neurodegener","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and age-associated neurodegenerative disorder that affects women disproportionally. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly characterized. Moreover, while the interplay between sex and ApoE genotype in AD has been investigated, multi-omics studies to understand this interaction are limited. Therefore, we applied systems biology approaches to investigate sex-specific molecular networks of AD.We integrated large-scale human postmortem brain transcriptomic data of AD from two cohorts (MSBB and ROSMAP) via multiscale network analysis and identified key drivers with sexually dimorphic expression patterns and/or different responses to APOE genotypes between sexes. The expression patterns and functional relevance of the top sex-specific network driver of AD were further investigated using postmortem human brain samples and gene perturbation experiments in AD mouse models.Gene expression changes in AD versus control were identified for each sex. Gene co-expression networks were constructed for each sex to identify AD-associated co-expressed gene modules shared by males and females or specific to each sex. Key network regulators were further identified as potential drivers of sex differences in AD development. LRP10 was identified as a top driver of the sex differences in AD pathogenesis and manifestation. Changes of LRP10 expression at the mRNA and protein levels were further validated in human AD brain samples. Gene perturbation experiments in EFAD mouse models demonstrated that LRP10 differentially affected cognitive function and AD pathology in sex- and APOE genotype-specific manners. A comprehensive mapping of brain cells in LRP10 over-expressed (OE) female E4FAD mice suggested neurons and microglia as the most affected cell populations. The female-specific targets of LRP10 identified from the single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of the LRP10 OE E4FAD mouse brains were significantly enriched in the LRP10-centered subnetworks in female AD subjects, validating LRP10 as a key network regulator of AD in females. Eight LRP10 binding partners were identified by the yeast two-hybrid system screening, and LRP10 over-expression reduced the association of LRP10 with one binding partner CD34.These findings provide insights into key mechanisms mediating sex differences in AD pathogenesis and will facilitate the development of sex- and APOE genotype-specific therapies for AD.© 2023.

Moreover, hepatic DNA methylation may be altered in the state of NAFLD. Using a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) intervention, we aimed to investigate whether a change in gut microbiota composition relates to altered liver DNA methylation in NAFLD. Moreover, we assessed whether plasma metabolite profiles altered by FMT relate to changes in liver DNA methylation. Twenty-one individuals with NAFLD underwent three 8-weekly vegan allogenic donor (n = 10) or autologous (n = 11) FMTs. We obtained hepatic DNA methylation profiles from paired liver biopsies of study participants before and after FMTs. We applied a multi-omics machine learning approach to identify changes in the gut microbiome, peripheral blood metabolome and liver DNA methylome, and analyzed cross-omics correlations. Vegan allogenic donor FMT compared to autologous FMT induced distinct differential changes in I) gut microbiota profiles, including increased abundance ofEubacterium siraeumand potential probioticBlautia wexlerae; II) plasma metabolites, including altered levels of phenylacetylcarnitine (PAC) and phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) both from gut-derived phenylacetic acid, and of several choline-derived long-chain acylcholines; and III) hepatic DNA methylation profiles, most importantly in Threonyl-TRNA Synthetase 1 (TARS)and Zinc finger protein 57 (ZFP57). Multi-omics analysis showed thatGemmiger formicillisandFirmicutes bacterium_CAG_170 positively correlated with both PAC and PAG.E siraeumnegatively correlated with DNA methylation of cg16885113 inZFP57. Alterations in gut microbiota composition by FMT caused widespread changes in plasma metabolites (e.g. PAC, PAG, and choline-derived metabolites) and liver DNA methylation profiles in individuals with NAFLD. These results indicate that FMTs might induce metaorganismal pathway changes, from the gut bacteria to the liver."

While chromatin modifications such as DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications are well known to carry regulatory information, histone variants have received less attention in this context. Histone variants alter the stability, structure and function of nucleosomes and, as such, contribute to chromatin organization in germ cells. Here, we review histone variants expression dynamics during the production of male and female germ cells, and what is currently known about their parent-of-origin effects during reproduction. Finally, we discuss the apparent conundrum behind these important functions and their recent evolutionary diversification.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37334001","Sex differences in multilayer functional network topology over the course of aging in 37543 UK Biobank participants.","Netw Neurosci","Aging is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders, with considerable societal and economic implications. Healthy aging is accompanied by changes in functional connectivity between and within resting-state functional networks, which have been associated with cognitive decline. However, there is no consensus on the impact of sex on these age-related functional trajectories. Here, we show that multilayer measures provide crucial information on the interaction between sex and age on network topology, allowing for better assessment of cognitive, structural, and cardiovascular risk factors that have been shown to differ between men and women, as well as providing additional insights into the genetic influences on changes in functional connectivity that occur during aging. In a large cross-sectional sample of 37,543 individuals from the UK Biobank cohort, we demonstrate that such multilayer measures that capture the relationship between positive and negative connections are more sensitive to sex-related changes in the whole-brain connectivity patterns and their topological architecture throughout aging, when compared to standard connectivity and topological measures. Our findings indicate that multilayer measures contain previously unknown information on the relationship between sex and age, which opens up new avenues for research into functional brain connectivity in aging.© 2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
"37325708","Hidden Genetic Regulation of Human Complex Traits via Brain Isoforms.","Phenomics","Alternative splicing exists in most multi-exonic genes, and exploring these complex alternative splicing events and their resultant isoform expressions is essential. However, it has become conventional that RNA sequencing results have often been summarized into gene-level expression counts mainly due to the multiple ambiguous mapping of reads at highly similar regions. Transcript-level quantification and interpretation are often overlooked, and biological interpretations are often deduced based on combined transcript information at the gene level. Here, for the most variable tissue of alternative splicing, the brain, we estimate isoform expressions in 1,191 samples collected by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium using a powerful method that we previously developed. We perform genome-wide association scans on the isoform ratios per gene and identify isoform-ratio quantitative trait loci (irQTL), which could not be detected by studying gene-level expressions alone. By analyzing the genetic architecture of the irQTL, we show that isoform ratios regulate educational attainment via multiple tissues including the frontal cortex (BA9), cortex, cervical spinal cord, and hippocampus. These tissues are also associated with different neuro-related traits, including Alzheimer's or dementia, mood swings, sleep duration, alcohol intake, intelligence, anxiety or depression, etc. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis revealed 1,139 pairs of isoforms and neuro-related traits with plausible causal relationships, showing much stronger causal effects than on general diseases measured in the UK Biobank (UKB). Our results highlight essential transcript-level biomarkers in the human brain for neuro-related complex traits and diseases, which could be missed by merely investigating overall gene expressions.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s43657-023-00100-6.© The Author(s) 2023."

Here, we test (1) whether these scores contribute to prediction over-and-above family history, (2) the extent to which PGS prediction reflects inherited genetic variationv.demography (population stratification and assortative mating) and indirect genetic effects of parents (genetic nurture), and (3) whether PGS prediction is mediated by behavioral disinhibition prior to substance use onset.PGSs for alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine use/use disorder were calculated for Minnesota Twin Family Study participants (N= 2483, 1565 monozygotic/918 dizygotic). Twins' parents were assessed for histories of substance use disorder. Twins were assessed for behavioral disinhibition at age 11 and substance use from ages 14 to 24. PGS prediction of substance use was examined using linear mixed-effects, within-twin pair, and structural equation models.Nearly all PGS measures were associated with multiple types of substance use independently of family history. However, most within-pair PGS prediction estimates were substantially smaller than the corresponding between-pair estimates, suggesting that prediction is driven in part by demography and indirect genetic effects of parents. Path analyses indicated the effects of both PGSs and family history on substance use were mediated via disinhibition in preadolescence.PGSs capturing risk of substance use and use disorder can be combined with family history measures to augment prediction of substance use outcomes. Results highlight indirect sources of genetic associations and preadolescent elevations in behavioral disinhibition as two routes through which these scores may relate to substance use."
"37365211","A novel computational method enables RNA editome profiling during human hematopoiesis from scRNA-seq data.","Sci Rep","RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification with a cell-specific manner and important biological implications. Although single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is an effective method for studying cellular heterogeneity, it is difficult to detect and study RNA editing events from scRNA-seq data because of the low sequencing coverage. To overcome this, we develop a computational method to systematically identify RNA editing sites of cell types from scRNA-seq data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply it to scRNA-seq data of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) with an annotated lineage differentiation relationship according to previous research and study the impacts of RNA editing on hematopoiesis. The dynamic editing patterns reveal the relevance of RNA editing on different HSPCs. For example, four microRNA (miRNA) target sites on 3' UTR of EIF2AK2 are edited across all HSPC populations, which may abolish the miRNA-mediated inhibition of EIF2AK2. Elevated EIF2AK2 may thus activate the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway to initiate global translational attenuation as a protective mechanism to maintain cellular homeostasis during HSPCs' differentiation. Besides, our findings also indicate that RNA editing plays an essential role in the coordination of lineage commitment and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Taken together, we demonstrate the capacity of scRNA-seq data to exploit RNA editing events of cell types, and find that RNA editing may exert multiple modules of regulation in hematopoietic processes.© 2023.

"37294383","Distinct mononuclear diploid cardiac subpopulation with minimal cell-cell communications persists in embryonic and adult mammalian heart.","Front Med","A small proportion of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes (MNDCMs), with regeneration potential, could persist in adult mammalian heart. However, the heterogeneity of MNDCMs and changes during development remains to be illuminated. To this end, 12 645 cardiac cells were generated from embryonic day 17.5 and postnatal days 2 and 8 mice by single-cell RNA sequencing. Three cardiac developmental paths were identified: two switching to cardiomyocytes (CM) maturation with close CM-fibroblast (FB) communications and one maintaining MNDCM status with least CM-FB communications. Proliferative MNDCMs having interactions with macrophages and non-proliferative MNDCMs (non-pMNDCMs) with minimal cell-cell communications were identified in the third path. The non-pMNDCMs possessed distinct properties: the lowest mitochondrial metabolisms, the highest glycolysis, and high expression of Myl4 and Tnni1. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical staining further proved that the Myl4+Tnni1+MNDCMs persisted in embryonic and adult hearts. These MNDCMs were mapped to the heart by integrating the spatial and single-cell transcriptomic data. In conclusion, a novel non-pMNDCM subpopulation with minimal cell-cell communications was unveiled, highlighting the importance of microenvironment contribution to CM fate during maturation. These findings could improve the understanding of MNDCM heterogeneity and cardiac development, thus providing new clues for approaches to effective cardiac regeneration.© 2023.

This has raised the possibility that the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) may be a biomarker of its activity. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the evidence of NLR as a potential biomarker for GBS.We systematically searched databases (PubMed, Ovid-Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, SciELO Citation Index, LILACS, and Google Scholar) until October 2021 for studies evaluating pre-treatment NLR values in GBS patients. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model to estimate pooled effects was realized for each outcome and a narrative synthesis when this was not possible. Subgroup and sensitivity analysis were realized. GRADE criteria were used to identify the certainty of evidence for each result.Ten studies from 745 originally included were selected. Regarding GBS patients versus healthy controls, a meta-analysis of six studies (968 patients) demonstrated a significant increase in NLR values in GBS patients (MD: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.29, 2.24; I2 = 86%) with moderate certainty due to heterogeneity of GBS diagnosis criteria used. Regarding GBS prognosis, assessed by Hughes Score ≥ 3, NLR had a sensitivity between 67.3 and 81.5 and a specificity between 67.3 and 87.5 with low certainty due to imprecision, and heterogeneity. In relation to respiratory failure, NLR had a sensitivity of 86.5 and specificity of 68.2 with high and moderate certainty, respectively.With moderate certainty, mean NLR is higher in GBS patients compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we found that NLR could be a prognostic factor for disability and respiratory failure with low and moderate certainty, respectively. These results may prove useful for NLR in GBS patients; however, further research is needed.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier: CRD42021285212.Copyright © 2023 Cabanillas-Lazo, Quispe-Vicuña, Cruzalegui-Bazán, Pascual-Guevara, Mori-Quispe and Alva-Diaz."

Since then, nearly seven million deaths have occurred worldwide due to COVID-19. Mexicans are especially vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic as Mexico has nearly the worst observed case-fatality ratio (4.5%). As Mexican Latinos represent a vulnerable population, this study aimed to determine significant predictors of mortality in Mexicans with COVID-19 who were admitted to a large acute care hospital.In this observational, cross-sectional study, 247 adult patients participated. These patients were consecutively admitted to a third-level referral center in Yucatan, Mexico, from March 1st, 2020, to August 31st, 2020, with COVID-19-related symptoms. Lasso logistic and binary logistic regression were used to identify clinical predictors of death.After a hospital stay of about eight days, 146 (60%) patients were discharged; however, 40% died by the twelfth day (on average) after hospital admission. Out of 22 possible predictors, five crucial predictors of death were found, ranked by the most to least important: (1) needing to be placed on a mechanical ventilator, (2) reduced platelet concentration at admission, (3) increased derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, (4) increased age, and (5) reduced pulse oximetry saturation at admission. The model revealed that these five variables shared ~83% variance in outcome.Of the 247 Mexican Latinos patients admitted with COVID-19, 40% died 12  days after admission. The patients' need for mechanical ventilation (due to severe illness) was the most important predictor of mortality, as it increased the odds of death by nearly 200-fold.Copyright © 2023 Cortes-Telles, Figueroa-Hurtado, Ortiz-Farias and Zavorsky."

The immune system is a critical component of the OC tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune cells such as T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells (DC) play a key role in anti-tumor immunity. However, OC tumor cells are well known for evading immune surveillance by modulating the immune response through various mechanisms. Recruiting immune-suppressive cells such as regulatory T cells (Treg cells), macrophages, or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) inhibit the anti-tumor immune response and promote the development and progression of OC. Platelets are also involved in immune evasion by interaction with tumor cells or through the secretion of a variety of growth factors and cytokines to promote tumor growth and angiogenesis. In this review, we discuss the role and contribution of immune cells and platelets in TME.

This is due to several factors, including pre-existing conditions such as viral hepatitis and cirrhosis, which are commonly associated with HCC.We conducted an analysis of epigenomics in SARS-CoV-2 infection and HCC patients, and identified common pathogenic mechanisms using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and other analyses. Hub genes were identified and analyzed using LASSO regression. Additionally, drug candidates and their binding modes to key macromolecular targets of COVID-19 were identified using molecular docking.The epigenomic analysis of the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and HCC patients revealed that the co-pathogenesis was closely linked to immune response, particularly T cell differentiation, regulation of T cell activation and monocyte differentiation. Further analysis indicated that CD4+T cells and monocytes play essential roles in the immunoreaction triggered by both conditions. The expression levels of hub genes MYLK2, FAM83D, STC2, CCDC112, EPHX4 and MMP1 were strongly correlated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the prognosis of HCC patients.

DNA methylation data from whole blood was used to estimate proportions of six subtypes of WBCs in SCZ patients (n = 333) and healthy controls (n = 396). We tested the association of case-control status with estimated cell-type proportions and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in 4 models: with/without adjusting for time of blood draw, and then compared results from blood samples drawn during a 12-h (07:00-19:00) or 7-h (07:00-14:00) period. We also investigated WBC proportions in a subgroup of medication-free patients (n = 51). Neutrophil proportions were significantly higher in SCZ cases (mean=54.1%) vs. controls (mean=51.1%; p = <0.001), and CD8+T lymphocyte proportions were lower in SCZ cases (mean=12.1%) vs. controls (mean=13.2%; p = 0.001). The effect sizes in the 12-h sample (07:00-19:00) showed a significant difference between SCZ vs. controls for neutrophils, CD4+T, CD8+T, and B-cells, which remained significant after adjusting for time of blood draw. In the samples matched for time of blood draw during 07.00-14.00, we also observed an association with neutrophils, CD4+T, CD8+T, and B-cells that was unaffected by further adjustment for time of blood draw. In the medication-free patients, we observed differences that remained significant in neutrophils (p = 0.01) and CD4+T (p = 0.01) after adjusting for time of day. The association of SCZ with NLR was significant in all models (range: p < 0.001 to p = 0.03) in both medicated and unmedicated patients. In conclusion, controlling for pharmacological treatment and circadian cycling of WBC is necessary for unbiased estimates in case-control studies. Nevertheless, the association of WBC with SCZ remains, even after adjusting for the time of day.© 2023. The Author(s)."

With the rise in life expectancy, characterizing the brain ageing process becomes fundamental for developing therapeutic interventions against the increased incidence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases and to aim for an increase in human life span and, more importantly, health span. In this review, we start by introducing the molecular/cellular hallmarks associated with brain ageing and their impact on brain cell populations. Subsequently, we assess emerging evidence on how systemic ageing translates into brain ageing. Finally, we revisit the mainstream and the novel rejuvenating strategies, discussing the most successful ones in delaying brain ageing and related diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37326626","Predicting mechanisms of action at genetic loci associated with discordant effects on type 2 diabetes and abdominal fat accumulation.","Elife","Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Excessive accumulation of fat in the abdomen further increases T2D risk. Abdominal obesity is measured by calculating the ratio of waist-to-hip circumference adjusted for the body-mass index (WHRadjBMI), a trait with a significant genetic inheritance. Genetic loci associated with WHRadjBMI identified in genome-wide association studies are predicted to act through adipose tissues, but many of the exact molecular mechanisms underlying fat distribution and its consequences for T2D risk are poorly understood. Further, mechanisms that uncouple the genetic inheritance of abdominal obesity from T2D risk have not yet been described. Here we utilize multi-omic data to predict mechanisms of action at loci associated with discordant effects on abdominal obesity and T2D risk. We find six genetic signals in five loci associated with protection from T2D but also with increased abdominal obesity. We predict the tissues of action at these discordant loci and the likely effector Genes (eGenes) at three discordant loci, from which we predict significant involvement of adipose biology. We then evaluate the relationship between adipose gene expression of eGenes with adipogenesis, obesity, and diabetic physiological phenotypes. By integrating these analyses with prior literature, we propose models that resolve the discordant associations at two of the five loci. While experimental validation is required to validate predictions, these hypotheses provide potential mechanisms underlying T2D risk stratification within abdominal obesity.© 2023, Aberra et al."

Here we show that the integration of genome-wide genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic association studies can nominate causal determinants of kidney function and damage.Through transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) in kidney cortex, kidney tubule, liver, and whole blood and proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) in plasma, we assess for effects of 12,893 genes and 1342 proteins on kidney filtration (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by creatinine; GFR estimated by cystatin C; and blood urea nitrogen) and kidney damage (albuminuria). We find 1561 associations distributed among 260 genomic regions that are supported as putatively causal. We then prioritize 153 of these genomic regions using additional colocalization analyses. Our genome-wide findings are supported by existing knowledge (animal models for MANBA, DACH1, SH3YL1, INHBB), exceed the underlying GWAS signals (28 region-trait combinations without significant GWAS hit), identify independent gene/protein-trait associations within the same genomic region (INHBC, SPRYD4), nominate tissues underlying the associations (tubule expression of NRBP1), and distinguish markers of kidney filtration from those with a role in creatinine and cystatin C metabolism. Furthermore, we follow up on members of the TGF-beta superfamily of proteins and find a prognostic value of INHBC for kidney disease progression even after adjustment for measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR).In summary, this study combines multimodal, genome-wide association studies to generate a catalog of putatively causal target genes and proteins relevant to kidney function and damage which can guide follow-up studies in physiology, basic science, and clinical medicine.© 2023.

These metabolites are then selected for further metabolite genome-wide association study and metabolite transcriptome-wide association study. Combined with weighted correlation network analysis, we construct a triple relationship network, which includes 21,000 edges and 4384 nodes among metabolites, metabolite quantitative trait loci, genes, and co-expression modules. We validate the function of BnaA03.TT4, BnaC02.TT4, and BnaC05.UK, three candidate genes predicted by multi-omics analysis, which show significant impacts on seed oil content through regulating flavonoid metabolism in B. napus.This study demonstrates the advantage of utilizing marker metabolites integrated with multi-omics analysis to dissect the genetic basis of agronomic traits in crops.© 2023.

Identifying gene expression patterns underlying cross-disorder risk also stands to propel drug discovery and repurposing in the face of rising levels of polypharmacy.To identify gene expression patterns underlying genetic convergence and divergence across psychiatric disorders along with existing pharmacological interventions that target these genes.This genomic study applied a multivariate transcriptomic method, transcriptome-wide structural equation modeling (T-SEM), to investigate gene expression patterns associated with 5 genomic factors indexing shared risk across 13 major psychiatric disorders. Follow-up tests, including overlap with gene sets for other outcomes and phenome-wide association studies, were conducted to better characterize T-SEM results. The Broad Institute Connectivity Map Drug Repurposing Database and Drug-Gene Interaction Database public databases of drug-gene pairs were used to identify drugs that could be repurposed to target genes found to be associated with cross-disorder risk. Data were collected from database inception up to February 20, 2023.Gene expression patterns associated with genomic factors or disorder-specific risk and existing drugs that target these genes.In total, T-SEM identified 466 genes whose expression was significantly associated (z ≥ 5.02) with genomic factors and 36 genes with disorder-specific effects. Most associated genes were found for a thought disorders factor, defined by bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Several existing pharmacological interventions were identified that could be repurposed to target genes whose expression was associated with the thought disorders factor or a transdiagnostic p factor defined by all 13 disorders.The findings from this study shed light on patterns of gene expression associated with genetic overlap and uniqueness across psychiatric disorders. Future versions of the multivariate drug repurposing framework outlined here have the potential to identify novel pharmacological interventions for increasingly common, comorbid psychiatric presentations."
"37312749","The elite variations in germplasms for soybean breeding.","Mol Breed","The genetic base of soybean cultivars (Glycine max(L.) Merr.) has been narrowed through selective domestication and specific breeding improvement, similar to other crops. This presents challenges in breeding new cultivars with improved yield and quality, reduced adaptability to climate change, and increased susceptibility to diseases. On the other hand, the vast collection of soybean germplasms offers a potential source of genetic variations to address those challenges, but it has yet to be fully leveraged. In recent decades, rapidly improved high-throughput genotyping technologies have accelerated the harness of elite variations in soybean germplasm and provided the important information for solving the problem of a narrowed genetic base in breeding. In this review, we will overview the situation of maintenance and utilization of soybean germplasms, various solutions provided for different needs in terms of the number of molecular markers, and the omics-based high-throughput strategies that have been used or can be used to identify elite alleles. We will also provide an overall genetic information generated from soybean germplasms in yield, quality traits, and pest resistance for molecular breeding.© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

"37279739","MTM: a multi-task learning framework to predict individualized tissue gene expression profiles.","Bioinformatics","Transcriptional profiles of diverse tissues provide significant insights in both fundamental and translational researches, while transcriptome information is not always available for tissues that require invasive biopsies. Alternatively, predicting tissue expression profiles from more accessible ""surrogate"" samples, especially blood transcriptome, has become a promising strategy when invasive procedures are not practical. However, existing approaches ignore tissue-shared intrinsic relevance, inevitably limiting predictive performance.We propose a unified deep learning-based multi-task learning framework, multi-tissue transcriptome mapping (MTM), enabling the prediction of individualized expression profiles from any available tissue of an individual. By jointly leveraging individualized cross-tissue information from reference samples through multi-task learning, MTM achieves superior sample-level and gene-level performance on unseen individuals. With the high prediction accuracy and the ability to preserve individualized biological variations, MTM could facilitate both fundamental and clinical biomedical research.MTM's code and documentation are available upon publication on GitHub (https://github.com/yangence/MTM).© The Author(s) 2023.

"37294757","Transcriptional signatures of heroin intake and relapse throughout the brain reward circuitry in male mice.","Sci Adv","Opioid use disorder (OUD) looms as one of the most severe medical crises facing society. More effective therapeutics will require a deeper understanding of molecular changes supporting drug-taking and relapse. Here, we develop a brain reward circuit-wide atlas of opioid-induced transcriptional regulation by combining RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and heroin self-administration in male mice modeling multiple OUD-relevant conditions: acute heroin exposure, chronic heroin intake, context-induced drug-seeking following abstinence, and relapse. Bioinformatics analysis of this rich dataset identified numerous patterns of transcriptional regulation, with both region-specific and pan-circuit biological domains affected by heroin. Integration of RNA-seq data with OUD-relevant behavioral outcomes uncovered region-specific molecular changes and biological processes that predispose to OUD vulnerability. Comparisons with human OUD RNA-seq and genome-wide association study data revealed convergent molecular abnormalities and gene candidates with high therapeutic potential. These studies outline molecular reprogramming underlying OUD and provide a foundational resource for future investigations into mechanisms and treatment strategies."
"37293013","Uncovering genetic associations in the human diseasome using an endophenotype-augmented disease network.","medRxiv","Many diseases exhibit complex multimorbidities with one another. An intuitive way to model the connections between phenotypes is with a disease-disease network (DDN), where nodes represent diseases and edges represent associations, such as shared single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), between pairs of diseases. To gain further genetic understanding of molecular contributors to disease associations, we propose a novel version of the shared-SNP DDN (ssDDN), denoted as ssDDN+, which includes connections between diseases derived from genetic correlations with endophenotypes. We hypothesize that a ssDDN+ can provide complementary information to the disease connections in a ssDDN, yielding insight into the role of clinical laboratory measurements in disease interactions. Using PheWAS summary statistics from the UK Biobank, we constructed a ssDDN+ revealing hundreds of genetic correlations between disease phenotypes and quantitative traits. Our augmented network uncovers genetic associations across different disease categories, connects relevant cardiometabolic diseases, and highlights specific biomarkers that are associated with cross-phenotype associations. Out of the 31 clinical measurements under consideration, HDL-C connects the greatest number of diseases and is strongly associated with both type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy. Triglycerides, another blood lipid with known genetics causes in non-mendelian diseases, also adds a substantial number of edges to the ssDDN. Our study can facilitate future network-based investigations of cross-phenotype associations involving pleiotropy and genetic heterogeneity, potentially uncovering sources of missing heritability in multimorbidities."

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used in eye care and allows the non-invasive, rapid capture of retinal measurements in exquisite detail. We conducted genome- and phenome-wide analyses of retinal layer thicknesses using macular OCT images from 44,823 UK Biobank participants. We performed phenome-wide association analyses, associating retinal thicknesses with 1,866 incident ICD-based conditions (median 10-year follow-up) and 88 quantitative traits and blood biomarkers. We performed genome-wide association analyses, identifying inherited genetic markers which influence the retina, and replicated our associations among 6,313 individuals from the LIFE-Adult Study. And lastly, we performed comparative association of phenome- and genome-wide associations to identify putative causal links between systemic conditions, retinal layer thicknesses, and ocular disease. Independent associations with incident mortality were detected for photoreceptor thinning and ganglion cell complex thinning. Significant phenotypic associations were detected between retinal layer thinning and ocular, neuropsychiatric, cardiometabolic and pulmonary conditions. Genome-wide association of retinal layer thicknesses yielded 259 loci. Consistency between epidemiologic and genetic associations suggested putative causal links between thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer with glaucoma, photoreceptor segment with AMD, as well as poor cardiometabolic and pulmonary function with PS thinning, among other findings. In conclusion, retinal layer thinning predicts risk of future ocular and systemic disease. Furthermore, systemic cardio-metabolic-pulmonary conditions promote retinal thinning. Retinal imaging biomarkers, integrated into electronic health records, may inform risk prediction and potential therapeutic strategies.Phenome- and genome-wide associations of retinal OCT images across nearly 50,000 individuals identifies ocular and systemic phenotypes linked to retinal layer thinning, inherited genetic variants linked to retinal layer thickness, and putative causal links between systemic conditions, retinal layer thickness, and ocular disease."

Previous studies have typically treated these complex mental traits as distinct constructs. We applied the 'pleiotropy-informed' multivariate omnibus statistical test to genome-wide association studies of 35 measures of neuroticism and cognitive function from the UK Biobank (n = 336,993). We identified 431 significantly associated genetic loci with evidence of abundant shared genetic associations, across personality and cognitive function domains. Functional characterization implicated genes with significant tissue-specific expression in all tested brain tissues and brain-specific gene sets. We conditioned independent genome-wide association studies of the Big 5 personality traits and cognitive function on our multivariate findings, boosting genetic discovery in other personality traits and improving polygenic prediction. These findings advance our understanding of the polygenic architecture of these complex mental traits, indicating a prominence of pleiotropic genetic effects across higher order domains of mental function such as personality and cognitive function.© 2023.

"37353630","Resting heart rate and antisocial behaviour: a Mendelian randomisation study.","Sci Rep","Observational studies frequently report phenotypic associations between low resting heart rate (RHR) and higher levels of antisocial behaviour (ASB), although it remains unclear whether this relationship reflects causality. To triangulate evidence, we conducted two-sample univariable Mendelian randomisation (MR), multivariable MR and linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) analyses. Genetic data were accessed from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for RHR (n = 458,835) and ASB (n = 85,359) for the univariable analyses, along with a third GWAS for heart rate variability (HRV; n = 53,174) for all other analyses. Genome-wide significant (p < 5 × 10-8) single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with RHR (n = 278) were selected as instrumental variables and the outcome was a composite measure of ASB. No causal association was observed between RHR and ASB (BIVW =  - 0.0004, p = 0.841). The multivariable MR analyses including RHR and HRV also suggested no causal associations (BIVW = 0.016, p = 0.914) and no genetic correlations between the heart rate measures and ASB were observed using LDSC (rg = 0.057, p = 0.169). Sensitivity analyses suggested that our results are not likely to be affected by heterogeneity, pleiotropic effects, or reverse causation. These findings suggest that individual differences in autonomic nervous system functioning indexed by RHR are not likely to directly contribute to the development of ASB. Therefore, previously observed associations between RHR and ASB may arise from confounding, reverse causation, and/or additional study characteristics. Further causally informative longitudinal research is required to confirm our findings, and caution should be applied when using measures of RHR in interventions targeting ASB.© 2023. The Author(s)."

A more complete understanding of the genetic basis of AD can be deduced by exploring associations with AD-related endophenotypes.We conducted genome-wide scans for cognitive domain performance using harmonized and co-calibrated scores derived by confirmatory factor analyses for executive function, language, and memory. We analyzed 103,796 longitudinal observations from 23,066 members of community-based (FHS, ACT, and ROSMAP) and clinic-based (ADRCs and ADNI) cohorts using generalized linear mixed models including terms for SNP, age, SNP × age interaction, sex, education, and five ancestry principal components. Significance was determined based on a joint test of the SNP's main effect and interaction with age. Results across datasets were combined using inverse-variance meta-analysis. Genome-wide tests of pleiotropy for each domain pair as the outcome were performed using PLACO software.Individual domain and pleiotropy analyses revealed genome-wide significant (GWS) associations with five established loci for AD and AD-related disorders (BIN1, CR1, GRN, MS4A6A, and APOE) and eight novel loci. ULK2 was associated with executive function in the community-based cohorts (rs157405, P = 2.19 × 10-9). GWS associations for language were identified with CDK14 in the clinic-based cohorts (rs705353, P = 1.73 × 10-8) and LINC02712 in the total sample (rs145012974, P = 3.66 × 10-8). GRN (rs5848, P = 4.21 × 10-8) and PURG (rs117523305, P = 1.73 × 10-8) were associated with memory in the total and community-based cohorts, respectively.

Functional studies have previously linked AD to ULK2, NCALD, and PTPRD.Our results provide some insight into biological pathways underlying processes leading to domain-specific cognitive impairment and AD, as well as a conduit toward a syndrome-specific precision medicine approach to AD. Increasing the number of participants with harmonized cognitive domain scores will enhance the discovery of additional genetic factors of cognitive decline leading to AD and related dementias.© 2023.

However, the sex differences in genetic basis, causality, and underlying mechanisms of the two diseases are still unclear. Using sex-stratified and ethnic-based GWAS summary, we explored the genetic correlation and causal relationship between T2D and PAD in both ethnicities and sexes by linkage disequilibrium score regression, LAVA and six Mendelian Randomization approaches. We observed stronger genetic correlations between T2D and PAD in females than males in East Asians and Europeans. East Asian females exhibit higher causal effects of T2D on PAD than males. The gene-level analysis found KCNJ11 and ANK1 genes associated with the cross-trait of T2D and PAD in both sexes.

However, the patterns of correlation and causation between them are still not clear due to psychiatric confounding. To investigate their cross-phenotype relationship, we utilized raw phenotypes and genotypes from >150,000 UK Biobank samples, and genome-wide association summary statistics from >600,000 individuals with European ancestry. Pairwise association and a potential bidirectional relationship between OUD and SA were evaluated with and without controlling for major psychiatric disease status (e.g., schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and alcohol use disorder). Multiple statistical and genetics tools were used to perform epidemiological association, genetic correlation, polygenic risk score prediction, and Mendelian randomizations (MR) analyses. Strong associations between OUD and SA were observed at both the phenotypic level (overall samples [OR = 2.94, P = 1.59 ×10-14]; non-psychiatric subgroup [OR = 2.15, P = 1.07 ×10-3]) and the genetic level (genetic correlation rg = 0.38 and 0.5 with or without conditioning on psychiatric traits, respectively). Consistently, increasing polygenic susceptibility to SA is associated with increasing risk of OUD (OR = 1.08, false discovery rate [FDR] =1.71 ×10-3), and similarly, increasing polygenic susceptibility to OUD is associated with increasing risk of SA (OR = 1.09, FDR = 1.73 ×10-6). However, these polygenic associations were much attenuated after controlling for comorbid psychiatric diseases. A combination of MR analyses suggested a possible causal association from genetic liability for SA to OUD risk (2-sample univariable MR: OR = 1.14, P = 0.001; multivariable MR: OR = 1.08, P = 0.001). This study provided new genetic evidence to explain the observed OUD-SA comorbidity.

We identify 339 variant-trait associations at P < 1.13 × 10-9for 44 hippocampal traits, including 23 new associations. Common genetic variants have similar effects on hippocampal traits across ancestries, although ancestry-specific associations exist. Cross-ancestry analysis improves the fine-mapping precision and the prediction performance of polygenic scores in under-represented populations. These genetic variants are enriched for Wnt signaling and neuron differentiation and affect cognition, emotion and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Despite the wide recognition of the sample overlap problem, its potential impact on the results from PRS studies has not yet been quantified, and no analytical solution has been provided.Here, we first conduct a comprehensive investigation into the scale of the sample overlap problem, finding that PRS results can be substantially inflated even in the presence of minimal overlap.

"37308478",NA,NA,"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex disorder that typically arises in late adolescence or early adulthood. Age at onset (AAO) of SCZ is associated with long-term outcomes of the disease. We explored the genetic architecture of AAO with a genome-wide association study (GWAS), heritability, polygenic risk score (PRS), and copy number variant (CNV) analyses in 4 740 subjects of European ancestry. Although no genome-wide significant locus was identified, SNP-based heritability of AAO was estimated to be between 17 and 21%, indicating a moderate contribution of common variants. We also performed cross-trait PRS analyses with a set of mental disorders and identified a negative association between AAO and common variants for SCZ, childhood maltreatment and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. We also investigated the role of copy number variants (CNVs) in AAO and found an association with the length and number of deletions (P-value = 0.03), whereas the presence of CNVs previously reported in SCZ was not associated with earlier onset. To our knowledge, this is the largest GWAS of AAO of SCZ to date in individuals from European ancestry, and the first study to determine the involvement of common variants in the heritability of AAO. Finally, we evidenced the role played by higher SCZ load in determining AAO but discarded the role of pathogenic CNVs. Altogether, these results shed light on the genetic architecture of AAO, which needs to be confirmed with larger studies.© 2023. The Author(s)."

While arrhythmic disorders play an important role in this, the nature of the relation between schizophrenia and arrhythmia is not fully understood.We leveraged summary-level data of large-scale genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia (53,386 cases 77,258 controls), arrhythmic disorders (atrial fibrillation, 55,114 cases 482,295 controls; Brugada syndrome, 2,820 cases 10,001 controls) and electrocardiogram traits (heart rate (variability), PR interval, QT interval, JT interval, and QRS duration, n=46,952-293,051). First, we examined shared genetic liability by assessing global and local genetic correlations and conducting functional annotation. Next, we explored bidirectional causal relations between schizophrenia and arrhythmic disorders and electrocardiogram traits using Mendelian randomization.There was no evidence for global genetic correlations, except between schizophrenia and Brugada (rg=0·14,p=4·0E-04). In contrast, strong positive and negative local genetic correlations between schizophrenia and all cardiac traits were found across the genome. In the strongest associated regions, genes related to immune system and viral response mechanisms were overrepresented. Mendelian randomization indicated a causal, increasing effect of liability to schizophrenia on Brugada syndrome (OR=1·15,p=0·009) and heart rate during activity (beta=0·25,p=0·015).While there was little evidence for global genetic correlations, specific genomic regions and biological pathways important for both schizophrenia and arrhythmic disorders and electrocardiogram traits emerged. The putative causal effect of liability to schizophrenia on Brugada warrants increased cardiac monitoring and potentially early medical intervention in patients with schizophrenia.European Research Council Starting Grant."
"37339987","Imputation of ancient human genomes.","Nat Commun","Due to postmortem DNA degradation and microbial colonization, most ancient genomes have low depth of coverage, hindering genotype calling. Genotype imputation can improve genotyping accuracy for low-coverage genomes. However, it is unknown how accurate ancient DNA imputation is and whether imputation introduces bias to downstream analyses. Here we re-sequence an ancient trio (mother, father, son) and downsample and impute a total of 43 ancient genomes, including 42 high-coverage (above 10x) genomes. We assess imputation accuracy across ancestries, time, depth of coverage, and sequencing technology. We find that ancient and modern DNA imputation accuracies are comparable. When downsampled at 1x, 36 of the 42 genomes are imputed with low error rates (below 5%) while African genomes have higher error rates. We validate imputation and phasing results using the ancient trio data and an orthogonal approach based on Mendel's rules of inheritance. We further compare the downstream analysis results between imputed and high-coverage genomes, notably principal component analysis, genetic clustering, and runs of homozygosity, observing similar results starting from 0.5x coverage, except for the African genomes. These results suggest that, for most populations and depths of coverage as low as 0.5x, imputation is a reliable method that can improve ancient DNA studies.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Chromosome conformation capture outlined genome segregation into large scale A and B compartments corresponding mainly to transcriptionally active and repressive chromatin. It remains unknown how the compartmentalization of the genome changes in growing oocytes of animals with hypertranscriptional type of oogenesis. Such oocytes are characterized by highly elongated chromosomes, called lampbrush chromosomes, which acquire a typical chromomere-loop appearance, representing one of the classical model systems for exploring the structural and functional organization of chromatin domains.Here, we compared the distribution of A/B compartments in chicken somatic cells with chromatin domains in lampbrush chromosomes. We found that in lampbrush chromosomes, the extended chromatin domains, restricted by compartment boundaries in somatic cells, disintegrate into individual chromomeres. Next, we performed FISH-mapping of the genomic loci, which belong to A or B chromatin compartments as well as to A/B compartment transition regions in embryonic fibroblasts on isolated lampbrush chromosomes. We found, that in chicken lampbrush chromosomes, clusters of dense compact chromomeres bearing short lateral loops and enriched with repressive epigenetic modifications generally correspond to constitutive B compartments in somatic cells. A compartments align with lampbrush chromosome segments with smaller, less compact chromomeres, longer lateral loops, and a higher transcriptional status. Clusters of small loose chromomeres with relatively long lateral loops show no obvious correspondence with either A or B compartment identity. Some genes belonging to facultative B (sub-) compartments can be tissue-specifically transcribed during oogenesis, forming distinct lateral loops.Here, we established a correspondence between the A/B compartments in somatic interphase nucleus and chromatin segments in giant lampbrush chromosomes from diplotene stage oocytes. The chromomere-loop structure of the genomic regions corresponding to interphase A and B compartments reveals the difference in how they are organized at the level of chromatin domains. The results obtained also suggest that gene-poor regions tend to be packed into chromomeres.© 2023. The Author(s)."

In this article, we aim to outline the current understanding of the impact of male health and environmental exposure on offspring development, health, and disease and explore the mechanisms underlying the paternal programming of offspring health. The available evidence suggests that poor paternal pre-conceptional nutrition and lifestyle, and advanced age can increase the risk of negative outcomes in offspring, via both direct (genetic/epigenetic) and indirect (maternal uterine environment) effects. Beginning at preconception, and during utero and the early life after birth, cells acquire an epigenetic memory of the early exposure which can be influential across the entire lifespan and program a child's health. Potentially not only mothers but also fathers should be advised that maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle is important to improve offspring health as well as the parental health status. However, the evidence is mostly based on animal studies, and well-designed human studies are urgently needed to verify findings from animal data.© 2023 Chinese Medical Association.

"37325470","Long non-coding RNA lncMGC mediates the expression of TGF-Î²-induced genes in renal cells via nucleosome remodelers.","Front Mol Biosci","Background:MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The miR-379 megacluster of miRNAs and its host transcript lnc-megacluster (lncMGC) are regulated by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), increased in the glomeruli of diabetic mice, and promote features of early DKD. However, biochemical functions of lncMGC are unknown. Here, we identified lncMGC-interacting proteins byin vitro-transcribed lncMGC RNA pull down followed by mass spectrometry. We also created lncMGC-knockout (KO) mice by CRISPR-Cas9 editing and used primary mouse mesangial cells (MMCs) from the KO mice to examine the effects of lncMGC on the gene expression related to DKD, changes in promoter histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling.Methods:In vitro-transcribed lncMGC RNA was mixed with lysates from HK2 cells (human kidney cell line). lncMGC-interacting proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Candidate proteins were confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation followed by qPCR. Cas9 and guide RNAs were injected into mouse eggs to create lncMGC-KO mice. Wild-type (WT) and lncMGC-KO MMCs were treated with TGF-β, and RNA expression (by RNA-seq and qPCR) and histone modifications (by chromatin immunoprecipitation) and chromatin remodeling/open chromatin (by Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing, ATAC-seq) were examined.Results:Several nucleosome remodeling factors including SMARCA5 and SMARCC2 were identified as lncMGC-interacting proteins by mass spectrometry, and confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation-qPCR. MMCs from lncMGC-KO mice showed no basal or TGF-β-induced expression of lncMGC. Enrichment of histone H3K27 acetylation and SMARCA5 at the lncMGC promoter was increased in TGF-β-treated WT MMCs but significantly reduced in lncMGC-KO MMCs. ATAC peaks at the lncMGC promoter region and many other DKD-related loci includingCol4a3andCol4a4were significantly lower in lncMGC-KO MMCs compared to WT MMCs in the TGF-β-treated condition. Zinc finger (ZF), ARID, and SMAD motifs were enriched in ATAC peaks. ZF and ARID sites were also found in the lncMGC gene.Conclusion:lncMGC RNA interacts with several nucleosome remodeling factors to promote chromatin relaxation and enhance the expression of lncMGC itself and other genes including pro-fibrotic genes. The lncMGC/nucleosome remodeler complex promotes site-specific chromatin accessibility to enhance DKD-related genes in target kidney cells.Copyright © 2023 Kato, Chen, Das, Wu, Wang, Li, Chen, Tsark, Tunduguru, Lanting, Wang, Moore, Kalkum, Abdollahi and Natarajan."
"37305558","Challenges in screening for de novo noncoding variants contributing to genetically complex phenotypes.","HGG Adv","Understanding the genetic basis for complex, heterogeneous disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a persistent challenge in human medicine. Owing to their phenotypic complexity, the genetic mechanisms underlying these disorders may be highly variable across individual patients. Furthermore, much of their heritability is unexplained by known regulatory or coding variants. Indeed, there is evidence that much of the causal genetic variation stems from rare andde novovariants arising from ongoing mutation. These variants occur mostly in noncoding regions, likely affecting regulatory processes for genes linked to the phenotype of interest. However, because there is no uniform code for assessing regulatory function, it is difficult to separate these mutations into likely functional and nonfunctional subsets. This makes finding associations between complex diseases and potentially causalde novosingle-nucleotide variants (dnSNVs) a difficult task. To date, most published studies have struggled to find any significant associations between dnSNVs from ASD patients and any class of known regulatory elements. We sought to identify the underlying reasons for this and present strategies for overcoming these challenges. We show that, contrary to previous claims, the main reason for failure to find robust statistical enrichments is not only the number of families sampled, but also the quality and relevance to ASD of the annotations used to prioritize dnSNVs, and the reliability of the set of dnSNVs itself. We present a list of recommendations for designing future studies of this sort that will help researchers avoid common pitfalls.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37128143","Association of adverse childhood experiences with adulthood multiple sclerosis: A systematic review of observational studies.","Brain Behav","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are proposed to increase the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) later in life. This systematic review aimed to explore the correlation between ACEs and MS development, age of onset, quality of life in MS patients and MS relapse rates.We searched a total of six databases in June 2022 and retrieved the relevant studies. The population included adult (18+) individuals who either had been diagnosed or were at risk for developing MS and also had exposure to ACEs. Our primary outcomes include the risks of MS development, age of MS onset, and MS relapse rate in patients who were exposed to different types of ACEs.A total of 11 studies were included in our review. A study reported that among 300 women diagnosed with MS, 71 (24%) reported a history of childhood abuse; moreover, with further research, it was concluded that ACEs were associated with the development of MS. Abuse that occurred 2-3 times per week was associated with an 18.81-fold increased risk of having MS when compared to the unexposed sample. The relapse rate of MS was found to be substantially greater in severe cases of ACEs compared to individuals who did not report any ACEs.Results support a significant association between ACEs and the development of MS; individuals with a positive history of ACEs develop MS symptoms earlier. Moreover, the severity of ACEs is also linked with increased relapse rates of MS.© 2023 The Authors. Brain and Behavior published by Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"37322288","ABCA7-Associated Clinical Features and Molecular Mechanisms in Alzheimer's Disease.","Mol Neurobiol","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease and its pathogenesis is still unclear. Genetic factors are thought to account for a large proportion of the overall AD phenotypes. ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) is one of the most important risk gene for AD. Multiple forms of ABCA7 variants significantly increase the risk of AD, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms, premature termination codon variants, missense variants, variable number tandem repeat, mutations, and alternative splicing. AD patients with ABCA7 variants usually exhibit typical clinical and pathological features of traditional AD with a wide age of onset range. ABCA7 variants can alter ABCA7 protein expression levels and protein structure to affect protein functions such as abnormal lipid metabolism, amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, and immune cell function. Specifically, ABCA7 deficiency can cause neuronal apoptosis by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress through the PERK/eIF2α pathway. Second, ABCA7 deficiency can increase Aβ production by upregulating the SREBP2/BACE1 pathway and promoting APP endocytosis. In addition, the ability of microglia to phagocytose and degrade Aβ is destroyed by ABCA7 deficiency, leading to reduced clearance of Aβ. Finally, disturbance of lipid metabolism may also be an important method by which ABCA7 variants influence the incidence rate of AD. In the future, more attention should be given to different ABCA7 variants and ABCA7 targeted therapies for AD.© 2023.

It remains unknown whether effects of prenatal adversity on PTSD susceptibility are modulated by genetic variations in neurobiological pathways implicated in PTSD susceptibility.Objective:We investigated whether genetic variation in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulated effects of prenatal famine exposure on late adulthood PTSD symptom severity after trauma exposure in childhood and mid-to-late adulthood.Method:We includedN= 439 term-born singleton adults (mean age: 72 years, 54.2% women) from the Dutch Famine Birth Cohort, born around the time of the Dutch Famine of 1944/1945, divided into exposure and control groups based on timing of the famine during gestation. Participants filled out self-report questionnaires on childhood (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) and mid-to-late adulthood (Life Events Checklist for DSM-5) trauma, and current PTSD symptom severity (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5). GR haplotypes were determined from four functional GR single nucleotide polymorphisms (ER22/23EK, N363S,BclI and exon 9β) in previously collected DNA. Linear regression analyses were performed to investigate associations of GR haplotype and prenatal famine exposure in conjunction with later life trauma on PTSD symptom severity.Results:We observed a significant three-way interaction between the GR Bcll haplotype, famine exposure during early gestation, and adulthood trauma exposure on PTSD symptom severity in late adulthood. Only participants exposed to famine during early gestation without the GR Bcll haplotype showed a significantly stronger positive association between adulthood trauma and PTSD symptom severity than non-exposed participants, indicating increased PTSD susceptibility.Conclusions:Our results illustrate the importance of integrated approaches considering genetics and environmental contexts throughout various life periods, including the rarely investigated prenatal environment, to elucidate how PTSD susceptibility evolves throughout life.HIGHLIGHTSAdversity during pregnancy is thought to increase offspring's PTSD risk following later life trauma, but exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown.We found that effects of prenatal famine exposure on PTSD symptom severity were influenced by genetic variation in the glucocorticoid receptor, which signals effects of the stress hormone cortisol.Integrated approaches considering genetics and environmental contexts throughout both early and later life are important to understand how PTSD risk evolves throughout life."
"37274256","The association between CTSZ methylation in peripheral blood and breast cancer in Chinese women.","Front Oncol","Previous studies have shown that DNA methylation in peripheral blood may be associated with breast cancer (BC). To explore the association between the methylation level of the Cathepsin Z(CTSZ)gene in peripheral blood and BC, we conducted a case-control study in the Chinese population.Peripheral blood samples were collected from 567 BC cases, 635 healthy controls, and 303 benign breast disease (BBD) cases. DNA extraction and bisulfite-specific PCR amplification were performed for all samples. The methylation levels of seven sites of theCTSZgene were quantitatively determined by Mass spectrometry. The odds ratios (ORs) of CpG sites were evaluated for BC risk using per 10% reduction and quartiles analyses by logistic regression.Our analysis showed that five out of the seven CpG sites exhibited significant associations with hypomethylation ofCTSZand BC, compared to healthy controls. The highest OR was for Q2 ofCTSZ_CpG_1 (OR: 1.62,P=0.006), particularly for early-stage breast cancer in the case of per 10% reduction ofCTSZ_CpG_1 (OR: 1.20,P=0.003). We also found that per 10% reduction ofCTSZ_CpG_5 (OR: 1.39,P=0.004) and CTSZ_CpG_7,8 (OR: 1.35,P=0.005) were associated with increased BC risk. Our study also revealed that four out of seven CpG sites were linked to increased BC risk in women under 50 years of age, compared to healthy controls. The highest OR was for per 10% reduction ofCTSZ_CpG_1 (OR: 1.47,P<0.001). Additionally, we found that BC exhibited lower methylation levels than BBD atCTSZ_CpG_4 (OR for Q1: 2.18,P<0.001) andCTSZ_CpG_7,8 (OR for Q1: 2.01,P=0.001). Furthermore, we observed a correlation between methylation levels and tumor stage, ER, and HER2 status in BC patients.Overall, our findings suggest that alteredCTSZmethylation levels in peripheral blood may be associated with breast cancer, particularly in young women, and may serve as a potential biomarker for early-stage BC.Copyright © 2023 Li, Zhou, Li, Ji, Li, Qu, Wang, Zhao, Zhang, Liang, Liu, Gu, Yang, Ma and Dai."
"37341899","Integrated analyses delineate distinctive immunological pathways and diagnostic signatures for Behcet's disease by leveraging gene microarray data.","Immunol Res","Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic inflammatory vasculitis and clinically heterogeneous disorder caused by immunocyte aberrations. Comprehensive research on gene expression patterns in BD illuminating its aetiology is lacking. E-MTAB-2713 downloaded from ArrayExpress was analysed to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using limma. Random forest (RF) and neural network (NN) classification models composed of gene signatures were established using the E-MTAB-2713 training set and subsequently verified using GSE17114. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis was used to assess immunocyte infiltration. After identifying DEGs in E-MTAB-2713, pathogen-triggered, lymphocyte-mediated and angiogenesis- and glycosylation-related inflammatory pathways were discovered to be predominant in BD episodes. Gene signatures from the RF and NN diagnostic models, together with genes enriched in angiogenesis and glycosylation pathways, well discriminated the clinical subtypes of BD manifesting as mucocutaneous, ocular and large vein thrombosis involvement in GSE17114. Moreover, a distinctive immunocyte profile revealed T, NK and dendritic cell activation in BD compared to the findings in healthy controls. Our findings suggested that EPHX1, PKP2, EIF4B and HORMAD1 expression in CD14+ monocytes and CSTF3 and TCEANC2 expression in CD16+ neutrophils could serve as combined gene signatures for BD phenotype differentiation. Pathway genes comprising ATP2B4, MYOF and NRP1 for angiogenesis and GXYLT1, ENG, CD69, GAA, SIGLEC7, SIGLEC9 and SIGLEC16 for glycosylation also might be applicable diagnostic markers for subtype identification.© 2023.

The objectives of this study were to examine the sex-specific associations between prenatal maternal stress and child internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and to assess the moderating effects of parenting behaviors on these associations.This study is based on 15 963 mother-child dyads from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). A broad measure of prenatal maternal stress was constructed using 41 self-reported items measured during pregnancy. Three parenting behaviors (positive parenting, inconsistent discipline, and positive involvement) were assessed by maternal report at child age 5 years. Child symptoms of internalizing and externalizing disorders (depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and oppositional-defiant disorder) were assessed by maternal report at age 8. Analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling techniques.Prenatal maternal stress was associated with child internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 8; associations with externalizing symptoms differed by sex. Associations between prenatal maternal stress and child depression, and conduct disorder and oppositional-defiant disorder in males, became stronger as levels of inconsistent discipline increased. Associations between prenatal maternal stress and symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in females were attenuated as levels of parental involvement increased.This study confirms associations between prenatal maternal stress and children's mental health outcomes, and demonstrates that these associations may be modified by parenting behaviors. Parenting may represent an important intervention target for improving mental health outcomes in children exposed to prenatal stress."

This study aims to review the studies on the mentioned association and create a brighter view of this topic.A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline database (PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science up to the end of November 2020. Original articles which reported the effect of epigenetic alteration-methylation level or its changes-of genes involved in vitamin D regulation on the vitamin D metabolites serum level or its changes were included. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) checklist was used to assess the quality of included articles.Among 2566 records, nine reports were included in the systematic review according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies discussed the contribution of methylation status of members of the cytochrome P450 family (CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1), and Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) genes to vitamin D level variance. CYP2R1 methylation status could regulate the contributing factors affecting the vitamin D serum level and predict response to vitamin D supplementation. Studies revealed that impaired methylation of CYP24A1 occurs in response to an increase in serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). It is reported that the association between methylation levels of CYP2R1, CYP24A1, and VDR genes and 25(OH)D level is not affected by the methyl-donors bioavailability.The epigenetic modification of the vitamin D-related genes could explain the vitamin D levels variation among populations. Large-scale clinical trials in various ethnicities are suggested to find the effect of epigenetics on vitamin D response variation.The systematic review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42022306327).© 2023.

Disruption of the gut-brain axis (GBA) has been implicated in ASD although with limited reproducibility across studies. In this study, we developed a Bayesian differential ranking algorithm to identify ASD-associated molecular and taxa profiles across 10 cross-sectional microbiome datasets and 15 other datasets, including dietary patterns, metabolomics, cytokine profiles and human brain gene expression profiles. We found a functional architecture along the GBA that correlates with heterogeneity of ASD phenotypes, and it is characterized by ASD-associated amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid profiles predominantly encoded by microbial species in the genera Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Desulfovibrio and Bacteroides and correlates with brain gene expression changes, restrictive dietary patterns and pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles. The functional architecture revealed in age-matched and sex-matched cohorts is not present in sibling-matched cohorts. We also show a strong association between temporal changes in microbiome composition and ASD phenotypes. In summary, we propose a framework to leverage multi-omic datasets from well-defined cohorts and investigate how the GBA influences ASD.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The 33P signature is associated with metabolic differences and other adaptations following hypoxia. We observe that mRNA values for 33P predict patient survival independently of molecular subtypes and basic prognostic factors, also among low-grade luminal-like tumors.

However, the role of m6A regulators in respiratory allergic diseases remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of key m6A regulators in mediating respiratory allergic diseases and immune microenvironment infiltration characteristics.We downloaded gene expression profiles of respiratory allergies from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and we performed hierarchical clustering, difference analysis, and construction of predictive models to identify hub m6A regulators that affect respiratory allergies. Next, we investigate the underlying biological mechanisms of key m6A regulators by performing PPI network analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and immune microenvironment infiltration analysis. In addition, we performed a drug sensitivity analysis on the key m6A regulator, hoping to be able to provide some implications for clinical medication.In this study, we identified four hub m6A regulators that affect the respiratory allergy and investigated the underlying biological mechanisms. In addition, studies on the characteristics of immune microenvironment infiltration revealed that the expression of METTL14, METTL16, and RBM15B correlated with the infiltration of the mast and Th2 cells in respiratory allergy, and METTL16 expression was found to be significantly negatively correlated with macrophages for the first time (R = -0.53, P < 0.01). Finally, a key m6A regulator, METTL14, was screened by combining multiple algorithms. In addition, by performing a drug sensitivity analysis on METTL14, we hypothesized that it may play an important role in the improvement of allergic symptoms in the upper and lower airways with topical nasal glucocorticoids.Our findings suggest that m6A regulators, particularly METTL14, play a crucial role in the development of respiratory allergic diseases and the infiltration of immune cells. These results may provide insight into the mechanism of action of methylprednisolone in treating respiratory allergic diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37328455","Cancer genomes tolerate deleterious coding mutations through somatic copy number amplifications of wild-type regions.","Nat Commun","Cancers evolve under the accumulation of thousands of somatic mutations and chromosomal aberrations. While most coding mutations are deleterious, almost all protein-coding genes lack detectable signals of negative selection. This raises the question of how tumors tolerate such large amounts of deleterious mutations. Using 8,690 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we demonstrate that copy number amplifications frequently cover haploinsufficient genes in mutation-prone regions. This could increase tolerance towards the deleterious impact of mutations by creating safe copies of wild-type regions and, hence, protecting the genes therein. Our findings demonstrate that these potential buffering events are highly influenced by gene functions, essentiality, and mutation impact and that they occur early during tumor evolution. We show how cancer type-specific mutation landscapes drive copy number alteration patterns across cancer types. Ultimately, our work paves the way for the detection of novel cancer vulnerabilities by revealing genes that fall within amplifications likely selected during evolution to mitigate the effect of mutations.© 2023.

"37316673","A mutation-induced drug resistance database (MdrDB).","Commun Chem","Mutation-induced drug resistance is a significant challenge to the clinical treatment of many diseases, as structural changes in proteins can diminish drug efficacy. Understanding how mutations affect protein-ligand binding affinities is crucial for developing new drugs and therapies. However, the lack of a large-scale and high-quality database has hindered the research progresses in this area. To address this issue, we have developed MdrDB, a database that integrates data from seven publicly available datasets, which is the largest database of its kind. By integrating information on drug sensitivity and cell line mutations from Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and DepMap, MdrDB has substantially expanded the existing drug resistance data. MdrDB is comprised of 100,537 samples of 240 proteins (which encompass 5119 total PDB structures), 2503 mutations, and 440 drugs. Each sample brings together 3D structures of wild type and mutant protein-ligand complexes, binding affinity changes upon mutation (ΔΔG), and biochemical features. Experimental results with MdrDB demonstrate its effectiveness in significantly enhancing the performance of commonly used machine learning models when predicting ΔΔG in three standard benchmarking scenarios. In conclusion, MdrDB is a comprehensive database that can advance the understanding of mutation-induced drug resistance, and accelerate the discovery of novel chemicals.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Prognostic and tumor status-related markers for various tumors should be identified.Based on 19,515 samples from multiple sources, for the first time, this study provided an overview of gene S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (SKP2) in pan-cancer. Differential SKP2 expression in multiple comparison groups was identified by the Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The prognosis significance of SKP2 in individuals with neoplasm was evaluated through univariate Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves. The area under the curve was utilized to detect the accuracy of SKP2 in predicting cancer status. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated in all correlation analyses. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to identify essential signaling pathways of SKP2 in human neoplasms.The study disclosed the upregulated SKP2 expression in 15 neoplasms and decreased SKP2 expression in three cancers (p < 0.05). The transcription factor Forkhead Box M1 may contribute to the increased expression levels of SKP2 in certain tumors. Over-expressed SKP2 represented a risk factor for the prognosis of most cancer patients (hazard ratio > 1, p < 0.05). SKP2 expression made it feasible to distinguish neoplasm and control tissues of 21 neoplasms (sensitivity = 0.79, specificity = 0.87, area under the curve = 0.90), implying its potential in screening a series of neoplasms. Further, the research revealed the close association of SKP2 expression with DNA methyltransferases, mismatch repair genes, microsatellite instability, tumor mutational burden, neoantigen count, and immunity.SKP2 plays an essential role in multiple neoplasms and may serve as a marker for treating and identifying these neoplasms.© 2023.

Due to genetic and clinical overlaps between different types of dementia, whole-exome sequencing (WES) has emerged as an appropriate screening method for diagnostic testing and novel gene-finding approaches. We performed WES and C9orf72 repeat testing in 60 well-defined Austrian EOD patients. Seven patients (12%) carried likely disease-causing variants in monogenic genes, PSEN1, MAPT, APP, and GRN. Five patients (8%) were APOE4 homozygote carriers. Definite and possible risk variants were detected in the genes TREM2, SORL1, ABCA7 and TBK1. In an explorative approach, we cross-checked rare gene variants in our cohort with a curated neurodegeneration candidate gene list and identified DCTN1, MAPK8IP3, LRRK2, VPS13C and BACE1 as promising candidate genes. Conclusively, 12 cases (20%) carried variants relevant to patient counseling, comparable to previously reported studies, and can thus be considered genetically resolved. Reduced penetrance, oligogenic inheritance and not yet identified high-risk genes might explain the high number of unresolved cases. To address this issue, we provide complete genetic and phenotypic information (uploaded to the European Genome-phenome Archive), enabling other researchers to cross-check variants. Thereby, we hope to increase the chance of independently finding the same gene/variant-hit in other well-defined EOD patient cohorts, thus confirming new genetic risk variants or variant combinations.© 2023.

The aim of this review is to summarize the important epigenetic changes implicated in the disease risks, pathogenesis, complications and the evolution of therapeutics in our current understanding of T2DM. Studies published in the past 15 years, from 2007 to 2022, from three primary platforms namely PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct were included. Studies were searched using the primary term 'type 2 diabetes and epigenetics' with additional terms such as 'risks', 'pathogenesis', 'complications of diabetes' and 'therapeutics'. Epigenetics plays an important role in the transmission of T2DM from one generation to another. Epigenetic changes are also implicated in the two basic pathogenic components of T2DM, namely insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Hyperglycaemia-i nduced permanent epigenetic modifications of the expression of DNA are responsible for the phenomenon of metabolic memory. Epigenetics influences the development of micro-and macrovascular complications of T2DM. They can also be used as biomarkers in the prediction of these complications. Epigenetics has expanded our understanding of the action of existing drugs such as metformin, and has led to the development of newer targets to prevent vascular complications. Epigenetic changes are involved in almost all aspects of T2DM, from risks, pathogenesis and complications, to the development of newer therapeutic targets.© Touch Medical Media 2023."

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of FA supplementation in CAG patients without Helicobacter pylori infection and the MTHFR C677T (rs 1801133) genotype as a potential CAG predictor.A total of 96 CAG patients, aged 21 to 72 years old, were enrolled in this study. After 6 months of treatment, histopathological outcomes were compared among patients treated with weifuchun (WFC) (1.44 g 3 times per os per day), those treated with WFC and FA (5 mg once daily), and those treated with WFC, FA, and vitamin B12 (VB12) (0.5 mg 3 times per day) based on the Operative Link on Gastritis/Intestinal Metaplasia assessment staging systems.Atrophic lesions in patients treated with WFC and FA improved more than in patients treated only with WFC therapy (78.1% vs 53.3%, P = .04). Atrophic or intestinal metaplasia (IM) lesions in the incisura of patients with the TT genotype were better than those in patients with the CC/CT genotype (P = .02).The treatment of CAG patients with 5 mg of FA supplements daily for 6 months improved their gastric atrophy status, especially for the Operative Link on Gastritis/Intestinal Metaplasia assessment stages I/II.

It was assumed that the GPe consisted of a homogeneous neuron population primarily serving as a 'relay station' for information flowing through the indirect basal ganglia pathway. However, the advent of advanced tools in rodent models has sparked a resurgence in interest in the GPe. Here, we review recent data that have unveiled the cell and circuit complexity of the GPe. These discoveries have revealed that the GPe does not conform to traditional views of the basal ganglia. In particular, recent evidence confirms that the afferent and efferent connections of the GPe span both the direct and the indirect pathways. Furthermore, the GPe displays broad interconnectivity beyond the basal ganglia, consistent with its emerging multifaceted roles in both motor and non-motor functions. In summary, recent data prompt new proposals for computational rules of the basal ganglia.© 2023. Springer Nature America, Inc."

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the key inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, working primarily via GABAAreceptors, with an important role in virtually all physiologic functions in the brain. Some neuroactive steroids (NASs) are positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GABAAreceptors and potentiate phasic and tonic inhibitory responses via activation of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAAreceptors, respectively. This review first discusses preclinical and clinical data that support the association of depression with diverse defects in the GABAergic system of neurotransmission. Decreased levels of GABA and NASs have been observed in adults with depression compared with healthy controls, while treatment with antidepressants normalized the altered levels of GABA and NASs. Second, as there has been intense interest in treatment approaches for depression that target dysregulated GABAergic neurotransmission, we discuss NASs approved or currently in clinical development for the treatment of depression. Brexanolone, an intravenous NAS and a GABAAreceptor PAM, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) in patients 15 years and older. Other NASs include zuranolone, an investigational oral GABAAreceptor PAM, and PH10, which acts on nasal chemosensory receptors; clinical data to date have shown improvement in depressive symptoms with these investigational NASs in adults with MDD or PPD. Finally, the review discusses how NAS GABAAreceptor PAMs may potentially address the unmet need for novel and effective treatments with rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in patients with MDD.© 2023.

We aimed to identify a series of hypermethylated DNA markers and develop a blood-based HCC diagnosis panel containing DNA methylation sites and protein markers with improved sensitivity for early-stage HCC detection.Overall, 850K methylation arrays were performed using paired tissue DNA samples from 60 HCC patients. Ten candidate hypermethylated CpG sites were selected for further evaluation by quantitative methylation-specific PCR with 60 pairs of tissue samples. Six methylated CpG sites, along with α-fetoprotein (AFP) and des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin (DCP), were assayed in 150 plasma samples. Finally, an HCC diagnosis panel, named HepaClear, was developed in a cohort consisting of 296 plasma samples and validated in an independent cohort consisting of 198 plasma samples. The HepaClear panel, containing 3 hypermethylated CpG sites (cg14263942, cg12701184, and cg14570307) and 2 protein markers (AFP and DCP), yielded a sensitivity of 82.6% and a specificity of 96.2% in the training set and a sensitivity of 84.7% and a specificity of 92.0% in the validation set. The HepaClear panel had higher sensitivity (72.0%) for early-stage HCC than AFP (≥ 20 ng/mL, 48.0%) and DCP (≥ 40 mAU/mL, 62.0%) and detected 67.5% of AFP-negative HCC patients (AFP ≤ 20 ng/mL).We developed a multimarker HCC detection panel (HepaClear) that shows high sensitivity for early-stage HCC. The HepaClear panel exhibits high potential for HCC screening and diagnosis from an at-risk population.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Gene-searching efforts are well underway, but the identification of environmental risk factors is at least as important and should be a priority because some of them may be amenable to prevention or early intervention strategies. Genetically informative studies, particularly those employing the discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin design, are ideally suited to study environmental risk factors. This protocol paper describes the study rationale, aims, and methods of OCDTWIN, an open cohort of MZ twin pairs who are discordant for the diagnosis of OCD.OCDTWIN has two broad aims. In Aim 1, we are recruiting MZ twin pairs from across Sweden, conducting thorough clinical assessments, and building a biobank of biological specimens, including blood, saliva, urine, stool, hair, nails, and multimodal brain imaging. A wealth of early life exposures (e.g., perinatal variables, health-related information, psychosocial stressors) are available through linkage with the nationwide registers and the Swedish Twin Registry. Blood spots stored in the Swedish phenylketonuria (PKU) biobank will be available to extract DNA, proteins, and metabolites, providing an invaluable source of biomaterial taken at birth. In Aim 2, we will perform within-pair comparisons of discordant MZ twins, which will allow us to isolate unique environmental risk factors that are in the causal pathway to OCD, while strictly controlling for genetic and early shared environmental influences. To date (May 2023), 43 pairs of twins (21 discordant for OCD) have been recruited.OCDTWIN hopes to generate unique insights into environmental risk factors that are in the causal pathway to OCD, some of which have the potential of being actionable targets.© 2023.

"37328788","Endoplasmic reticulum stress-related gene model predicts prognosis and guides therapies in lung adenocarcinoma.","BMC Bioinformatics","The prognosis and survival of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients are still not promising despite recent breakthroughs in treatment. Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is a self-protective mechanism resulting from an imbalance in quality control of unfolded proteins when cells are stressed, which plays an active role in lung cancer development, but the relationship between ERS and the pathological characteristics and clinical prognosis of LUAD patients remains unclear.LASSO and Cox regression were applied based on sequencing information to construct the model, which was validated to be robust. The risk scores of the patients were calculated using the formula provided by the model, and the patients were divided into high and low-risk groups according to the median cut-off of risk scores. Cox regression analysis identifies independent prognostic factors for these patients, and enrichment analysis of prognosis-related genes was also performed. The relationship between risk scores and tumor mutation burden (TMB), cancer stem cell index, and drug sensitivity was explored.We constructed a 13-gene prognostic model for LUAD patients. Patients in the high-risk group had worse overall survival, lower immune score and ESTIMATE score, higher TMB, higher cancer stem cell index, and higher sensitivity to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, we constructed a nomogram that predicts 5-year survival in LUAD patients, which helps clinicians to foresee the prognosis from a new perspective.Our results highlight the association of ERS with LUAD and the potential use of ERS in guiding treatment.© 2023.

The PcG patterns were then compared in terms of the overall survival (OS), signaling pathway activation, and immune cell infiltration. The PcG-related gene score (PcGScore) was developed using Univariate Cox regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm to estimate the prognostic value and treatment sensitivity of LUAD. Finally, the prognostic ability of the model was validated using a validation dataset.Two PcG patterns were obtained by consensus clustering analysis, and the two patterns showed significant differences in prognosis, immune cell infiltration, and signaling pathways. Both the univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses confirmed that the PcGScore was a reliable and independent predictor of LUAD (P<0.001). The high- and low-PCGScore groups showed significant differences in the prognosis, clinical outcomes, genetic variation, immune cell infiltration, and immunotherapeutic and chemotherapeutic effects. Lastly, the PcGScore demonstrated exceptional accuracy in predicting the OS of the LUAD patients in a validation dataset (P<0.001).The study indicated that the PcGScore could serve as a novel biomarker to predict prognosis, clinical outcomes, and treatment sensitivity for LUAD patients.2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

In fisheries, age is routinely obtained by counting daily or annual increments in calcified structures (e.g., otoliths) which requires lethal sampling. Recently, DNA methylation has been shown to estimate age using DNA extracted from fin tissue without the need to kill the fish. In this study we used conserved known age-associated sites from the zebrafish (Danio rerio) genome to predict the age of golden perch (Macquaria ambigua), a large-bodied native fish from eastern Australia. Individuals aged using validated otolith techniques from across the species' distribution were used to calibrate three epigenetic clocks. One clock was calibrated using daily (daily clock) and another with annual (annual clock) otolith increment counts, respectively. A third used both daily and annual increments (universal clock). We found a high correlation between the otolith and epigenetic age (Pearson correlation > 0.94) across all clocks. The median absolute error was 2.4 days in the daily clock, 184.6 days in the annual clock, and 74.5 days in the universal clock. Our study demonstrates the emerging utility of epigenetic clocks as non-lethal and high-throughput tools for obtaining age estimates to support the management of fish populations and fisheries.© 2023.

However, studies have yet to examine the genetics of PTSD while factoring in risk for alcohol dependence, which commonly co-occur. We examined genome-wide associations for DSM-IV PTSD among 4,978 trauma-exposed participants (31% with alcohol dependence, 50% female, 30% African ancestry) from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). We also examined associations of polygenic risk scores (PRS) derived from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC)-PTSD Freeze 2 (N = 3533) and Million Veterans Program GWAS of PTSD (N = 5200) with PTSD and substance dependence in COGA, and moderating effects of sex and alcohol dependence. 7.3% of COGA participants met criteria for PTSD, with higher rates in females (10.1%) and those with alcohol dependence (12.3%). No independent loci met genome-wide significance in the PTSD meta-analysis of European (EA) and African ancestry (AA) participants. The PGC-PTSD PRS was associated with increased risk for PTSD (B = 0.126, p < 0.001), alcohol dependence (B = 0.231, p < 0.001), and cocaine dependence (B = 0.086, p < 0.01) in EA individuals. A significant interaction was observed, such that EA individuals with alcohol dependence and higher polygenic risk for PTSD were more likely to have PTSD (B = 0.090, p < 0.01) than those without alcohol dependence. These results further support the importance of examining substance dependence, specifically alcohol dependence, and PTSD together when investigating genetic influence on these disorders.© 2023.

"37340421","NIPSNAP1 directs dual mechanisms to restrain senescence in cancer cells.","J Transl Med","Although the executive pathways of senescence are known, the underlying control mechanisms are diverse and not fully understood, particularly how cancer cells avoid triggering senescence despite experiencing exacerbated stress conditions within the tumor microenvironment.Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic screening was used to identify differentially regulated genes in serum-starved hepatocellular carcinoma cells and RNAi employed to determine knockdown phenotypes of prioritized genes. Thereafter, gene function was investigated using cell proliferation assays (colony-formation, CCK-8, Edu incorporation and cell cycle) together with cellular senescence assays (SA-β-gal, SAHF and SASP). Gene overexpression and knockdown techniques were applied to examine mRNA and protein regulation in combination with luciferase reporter and proteasome degradation assays, respectively. Flow cytometry was applied to detect changes in cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in vivo gene function examined using a xenograft model.Among the genes induced by serum deprivation, NIPSNAP1 was selected for investigation. Subsequent experiments revealed that NIPSNAP1 promotes cancer cell proliferation and inhibits P27-dependent induction of senescence via dual mechanisms. Firstly, NIPSNAP1 maintains the levels of c-Myc by sequestering the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXL14 to prevent the proteasome-mediated turnover of c-Myc. Intriguingly, NIPSNAP1 levels are restrained by transcriptional repression mediated by c-Myc-Miz1, with repression lifted in response to serum withdrawal, thus identifying feedback regulation between NIPSNAP1 and c-Myc. Secondly, NIPSNAP1 was shown to modulate ROS levels by promoting interactions between the deacetylase SIRT3 and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). Consequent activation of SOD2 serves to maintain cellular ROS levels below the critical levels required to induce cell cycle arrest and senescence. Importantly, the actions of NIPSNAP1 in promoting cancer cell proliferation and preventing senescence were recapitulated in vivo using xenograft models.Together, these findings reveal NIPSNAP1 as an important mediator of c-Myc function and a negative regulator of cellular senescence. These findings also provide a theoretical basis for cancer therapy where targeting NIPSNAP1 invokes cellular senescence.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37344596","Y chromosome loss in cancer drives growth by evasion of adaptive immunity.","Nature","Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) is observed in multiple cancer types, including 10-40% of bladder cancers1-6, but its clinical and biological significance is unknown. Here, using genomic and transcriptomic studies, we report that LOY correlates with poor prognoses in patients with bladder cancer. We performed in-depth studies of naturally occurring LOY mutant bladder cancer cells as well as those with targeted deletion of Y chromosome by CRISPR-Cas9. Y-positive (Y+) and Y-negative (Y-) tumours grew similarly in vitro, whereas Y-tumours were more aggressive than Y+tumours in immune-competent hosts in a T cell-dependent manner. High-dimensional flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that Y-tumours promote striking dysfunction or exhaustion of CD8+T cells in the tumour microenvironment. These findings were validated using single-nuclei RNA sequencing and spatial proteomic evaluation of human bladder cancers. Of note, compared with Y+tumours, Y-tumours exhibited an increased response to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy in both mice and patients with cancer. Together, these results demonstrate that cancer cells with LOY mutations alter T cell function, promoting T cell exhaustion and sensitizing them to PD-1-targeted immunotherapy. This work provides insights into the basic biology of LOY mutation and potential biomarkers for improving cancer immunotherapy.© 2023.

"37323536","Genetic association of mosaic loss of chromosome Y with prostate cancer in men of European and East Asian ancestries: a Mendelian randomization study.","Front Aging","Background:Genomic instability is a significant hallmark of aging and has a major impact on aging biology. Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) in blood cells is a common chromosomal abnormality in aging men and is considered an indicator of genomic instability. Previous studies have indicated a connection between mLOY and prostate cancer risk, but the causal relationship has not been fully established.Methods:To determine the causal effect of mLOY on prostate cancer, we conducted a Mendelian Randomization (MR) study in two ancestral groups. We utilized 125 and 42 mLOY-associated variants as instrumental variables (IVs) in European and East Asian GWAS of prostate cancer, respectively. Summary-level data on prostate cancer was obtained from the PRACTICAL consortium (79,148 cases and 61,106 controls of European ancestry) and the Biobank Japan consortium (5,408 cases and 103,939 controls of East Asian ancestry). A single population was used to assess the causal relationship in East Asian ancestry. Our main method for obtaining MR results was inverse-variance weighted (IVW), and we conducted sensitivity analyses to confirm the robustness of our results. Finally, we combined the estimates from both sources using a fixed-effects meta-analysis.Results:Our MR analysis using the IVW method showed that a one-unit increase in genetically predicted mLOY was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in the PRACTICAL consortium (OR = 1.09%, 95% CI: 1.05-1.13,p= 1.2 × 10-5), but not in the Biobank Japan consortium (OR = 1.13%, 95% CI: 0.88-1.45,p= 0.34). Sensitivity analyses robustly indicated increased odds ratios for prostate cancer with every one-unit increase in genetically predicted mLOY for the PRACTICAL consortium. Furthermore, mLOY was found to be associated with prostate cancer risk in a meta-analysis of both sources (OR = 1.09%, 95% CI: 1.05-1.13,p= 8.0 × 10-6).Conclusion:Our MR study provides strong evidence that higher mLOY increases the risk of prostate cancer. Preventing mLOY may be a means of reducing the risk of developing prostate cancer.Copyright © 2023 Kobayashi, Hachiya, Ikehata and Horie."
"37308974","The lncRNA HOTAIR: a pleiotropic regulator of epithelial cell plasticity.","J Exp Clin Cancer Res","The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a trans-differentiation process that endows epithelial cells with mesenchymal properties, including motility and invasion capacity; therefore, its aberrant reactivation in cancerous cells represents a critical step to gain a metastatic phenotype. The EMT is a dynamic program of cell plasticity; many partial EMT states can be, indeed, encountered and the full inverse mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) appears fundamental to colonize distant secondary sites. The EMT/MET dynamics is granted by a fine modulation of gene expression in response to intrinsic and extrinsic signals. In this complex scenario, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) emerged as critical players. This review specifically focuses on the lncRNA HOTAIR, as a master regulator of epithelial cell plasticity and EMT in tumors. Molecular mechanisms controlling its expression in differentiated as well as trans-differentiated epithelial cells are highlighted here. Moreover, current knowledge about HOTAIR pleiotropic functions in regulation of both gene expression and protein activities are described. Furthermore, the relevance of the specific HOTAIR targeting and the current challenges of exploiting this lncRNA for therapeutic approaches to counteract the EMT are discussed.© 2023. The Author(s)."

This current opinion addresses biomarkers that warrant consideration in future research for monitoring the athlete training load. In this regard, we identified a variety of emerging load-sensitive biomarkers, e.g., cytokines (such as IL-6), chaperones (such as heat shock proteins) or enzymes (such as myeloperoxidase) that could improve future athlete load monitoring as they have shown meaningful increases in acute and chronic exercise settings. In some cases, they have even been linked to training status or performance characteristics. However, many of these markers have not been extensively studied and the cost and effort of measuring these parameters are still high, making them inconvenient for practitioners so far. We therefore outline strategies to improve knowledge of acute and chronic biomarker responses, including ideas for standardized study settings. In addition, we emphasize the need for methodological advances such as the development of minimally invasive point-of-care devices as well as statistical aspects related to the evaluation of these monitoring tools to make biomarkers suitable for regular load monitoring.© 2023.

Replication with a 20-year follow-up was based on the British Whitehall II study. For both analyses, participants who had no dementia at baseline, had complete data on at least 1 dementia risk score, and were linked to electronic health records from hospitalizations or mortality were included. Data analysis was conducted from July 5, 2022, to April 20, 2023.Four existing dementia risk scores: the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia (CAIDE)-Clinical score, the CAIDE-APOE-supplemented score, the Brief Dementia Screening Indicator (BDSI), and the Australian National University Alzheimer Disease Risk Index (ANU-ADRI).Dementia was ascertained from linked electronic health records. To evaluate how well each score predicted the 10-year risk of dementia, concordance (C) statistics, detection rate, false-positive rate, and the ratio of true to false positives were calculated for each risk score and for a model including age alone.Of 465 929 UK Biobank participants without dementia at baseline (mean [SD] age, 56.5 [8.1] years; range, 38-73 years; 252 778 [54.3%] female participants), 3421 were diagnosed with dementia at follow-up (7.5 per 10 000 person-years). If the threshold for a positive test result was calibrated to achieve a 5% false-positive rate, all 4 risk scores detected 9% to 16% of incident dementia and therefore missed 84% to 91% (failure rate). The corresponding failure rate was 84% for a model that included age only. For a positive test result calibrated to detect at least half of future incident dementia, the ratio of true to false positives ranged between 1 to 66 (for CAIDE-APOE-supplemented) and 1 to 116 (for ANU-ADRI). For age alone, the ratio was 1 to 43. The C statistic was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.65-0.67) for the CAIDE clinical version, 0.73 (95% CI, 0.72-0.73) for the CAIDE-APOE-supplemented, 0.68 (95% CI, 0.67-0.69) for BDSI, 0.59 (95% CI, 0.58-0.60) for ANU-ADRI, and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.79-0.80) for age alone. Similar C statistics were seen for 20-year dementia risk in the Whitehall II study cohort, which included 4865 participants (mean [SD] age, 54.9 [5.9] years; 1342 [27.6%] female participants). In a subgroup analysis of same-aged participants aged 65 (±1) years, discriminatory capacity of risk scores was low (C statistics between 0.52 and 0.60).In these cohort studies, individualized assessments of dementia risk using existing risk prediction scores had high error rates. These findings suggest that the scores were of limited value in targeting people for dementia prevention. Further research is needed to develop more accurate algorithms for estimation of dementia risk."

Unbiased proteomics using biological specimens can lead to improved risk stratification and discover pathophysiological mechanisms.Using measurements of ~4000 plasma proteins in two cohorts of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we discovered and validated markers of COVID-associated AKI (stage 2 or 3) and long-term kidney dysfunction. In the discovery cohort (N = 437), we identified 413 higher plasma abundances of protein targets and 30 lower plasma abundances of protein targets associated with COVID-AKI (adjusted p < 0.05). Of these, 62 proteins were validated in an external cohort (p < 0.05, N = 261).We demonstrate that COVID-AKI is associated with increased markers of tubular injury (NGAL) and myocardial injury. Using estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) measurements taken after discharge, we also find that 25 of the 62 AKI-associated proteins are significantly associated with decreased post-discharge eGFR (adjusted p < 0.05). Proteins most strongly associated with decreased post-discharge eGFR included desmocollin-2, trefoil factor 3, transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 10, and cystatin-C indicating tubular dysfunction and injury.Using clinical and proteomic data, our results suggest that while both acute and long-term COVID-associated kidney dysfunction are associated with markers of tubular dysfunction, AKI is driven by a largely multifactorial process involving hemodynamic instability and myocardial damage.© 2023.

"37340100","The impact of maternal bariatric surgery on long-term health of offspring: a scoping review.","Pediatr Res","While pregnancy post-bariatric surgery has become increasingly common, little is known about whether and how maternal bariatric surgery affects the next generation. This scoping review aimed to collate available evidence about the long-term health of offspring following maternal bariatric surgery. A literature search was conducted using three databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE) to obtain relevant human and animal studies. A total of 26 studies were included: 17 were ancillary reports from five ""primary"" studies (three human, two animal studies) and the remaining nine were ""independent"" studies (eight human, one animal studies). The human studies adopted sibling-comparison, case-control, and single-group descriptive designs. Despite limited data and inconsistent results across studies, findings suggested that maternal bariatric surgery appeared to (1) modify epigenetics (especially genes involved in immune, glucose, and obesity regulation); (2) alter weight status (unclear direction of alteration); (3) impair cardiometabolic, immune, inflammatory, and appetite regulation markers (primarily based on animal studies); and (4) not affect the neurodevelopment in offspring. In conclusion, this review supports that maternal bariatric surgery has an effect on the health of offspring. However, the scarcity of studies and heterogenous findings highlight that more research is required to determine the scope and degree of such effects. IMPACT: There is evidence that bariatric surgery modifies epigenetics in offspring, especially genes involved in immune, glucose, and obesity regulation. Bariatric surgery appears to alter weight status in offspring, although the direction of alteration is unclear. There is preliminary evidence that bariatric surgery impairs offspring's cardiometabolic, immune, inflammatory, and appetite regulation markers. Therefore, extra care may be needed to ensure optimal growth in children born to mothers with previous bariatric surgery.© 2023.

Activated astrocytes play a major role in inflammation. Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), secreted by activated astrocytes, promotes neuroinflammation. Pyroptosis is a pro-inflammatory form of programmed cell death that has emerged as a new area of research in stroke. Nevertheless, the potential role of LCN2 in astrocyte pyroptosis remains unclear.An ischemic stroke model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in vivo. In this study, in vitro, oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (O/R) were applied to cultured astrocytes. 24p3R (the LCN2 receptor) was inhibited by astrocyte-specific adeno-associated virus (AAV-GFAP-24p3Ri). MCC950 and Nigericin sodium salt (Nig) were used to inhibit or promote the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome pharmacologically, respectively. Histological and biochemical analyses were performed to assess astrocyte and neuron death. Additionally, the neurological deficits of mice were evaluated.LCN2 expression was significantly induced in astrocytes 24 h after stroke onset in the mouse MCAO model. Lcn2 knockout (Lcn2-/-) mice exhibited reduced infarct volume and improved neurological and cognitive functions after MCAO. LCN2 and its receptor 24p3R were colocalized in astrocytes. Mechanistically, suppression of 24p3R by AAV-GFAP-24p3Ri alleviated pyroptosis-related pore formation and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines via LCN2, which was then reversed by Nig-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Astrocyte pyroptosis was exacerbated in Lcn2-/-mice by intracerebroventricular administration of recombinant LCN2 (rLCN2), while this aggravation was restricted by blocking 24p3R or inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation with MCC950.LCN2/24p3R mediates astrocyte pyroptosis via NLRP3 inflammasome activation following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.© 2023.

"37292698","Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of skeletal muscle regeneration across mouse lifespan identifies altered stem cell states associated with senescence.","bioRxiv","Skeletal muscle regeneration is driven by the interaction of myogenic and non-myogenic cells. In aging, regeneration is impaired due to dysfunctions of myogenic and non-myogenic cells, but this is not understood comprehensively. We collected an integrated atlas of 273,923 single-cell transcriptomes from muscles of young, old, and geriatric mice (∼5, 20, 26 months-old) at six time-points following myotoxin injury. We identified eight cell types, including T and NK cells and macrophage subtypes, that displayed accelerated or delayed response dynamics between ages. Through pseudotime analysis, we observed myogenic cell states and trajectories specific to old and geriatric ages. To explain these age differences, we assessed cellular senescence by scoring experimentally derived and curated gene-lists. This pointed to an elevation of senescent-like subsets specifically within the self-renewing muscle stem cells in aged muscles. This resource provides a holistic portrait of the altered cellular states underlying skeletal muscle regenerative decline across mouse lifespan.Skeletal muscle regeneration relies on the orchestrated interaction of myogenic and non-myogenic cells with spatial and temporal coordination. The regenerative capacity of skeletal muscle declines with aging due to alterations in myogenic stem/progenitor cell states and functions, non-myogenic cell contributions, and systemic changes, all of which accrue with age. A holistic network-level view of the cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic changes influencing muscle stem/progenitor cell contributions to muscle regeneration across lifespan remains poorly resolved. To provide a comprehensive atlas of regenerative muscle cell states across mouse lifespan, we collected a compendium of 273,923 single-cell transcriptomes from hindlimb muscles of young, old, and geriatric (4-7, 20, and 26 months-old, respectively) mice at six closely sampled time-points following myotoxin injury. We identified 29 muscle-resident cell types, eight of which exhibited accelerated or delayed dynamics in their abundances between age groups, including T and NK cells and multiple macrophage subtypes, suggesting that the age-related decline in muscle repair may arise from temporal miscoordination of the inflammatory response. We performed a pseudotime analysis of myogenic cells across the regeneration timespan and found age-specific myogenic stem/progenitor cell trajectories in old and geriatric muscles. Given the critical role that cellular senescence plays in limiting cell contributions in aged tissues, we built a series of tools to bioinformatically identify senescence in these single-cell data and assess their ability to identify senescence within key myogenic stages. By comparing single-cell senescence scores to co-expression of hallmark senescence genesCdkn2aandCdkn1a, we found that an experimentally derived gene-list derived from a muscle foreign body response (FBR) fibrosis model accurately (receiver-operator curve AUC = 0.82-0.86) identified senescent-like myogenic cells across mouse ages, injury time-points, and cell-cycle states, in a manner comparable to curated gene-lists. Further, this scoring approach pinpointed transitory senescence subsets within the myogenic stem/progenitor cell trajectory that are related to stalled MuSC self-renewal states across all ages of mice. This new resource of mouse skeletal muscle aging provides a comprehensive portrait of the changing cellular states and interaction network underlying skeletal muscle regeneration across mouse lifespan."
"37292639","CRISPR/Cas9-based depletion of 16S ribosomal RNA improves library complexity of single-cell RNA-sequencing.","bioRxiv","Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cell types and states in various contexts, such as development and disease. To selectively capture protein-coding polyadenylated transcripts, most methodologies rely on poly(A) enrichment to exclude ribosomal transcripts that constitute >80% of the transcriptome. However, it is common for ribosomal transcripts to sneak into the library, which can add significant background by flooding libraries with irrelevant sequences. The challenge of amplifying all RNA transcripts from a single cell has motivated the development of new technologies to optimize retrieval of transcripts of interest. This problem is especially striking in planarians, where a single 16S ribosomal transcript is widely enriched (20-80%) across single-cell methods. Therefore, we adapted the Depletion of Abundant Sequences by Hybridization (DASH) to the standard 10X scRNA-seq protocol. We designed single-guide RNAs tiling the 16S sequence for CRISPR-mediated degradation, and subsequently generated untreated and DASH-treated datasets from the same libraries to enable a side-by-side comparison of the effects of DASH. DASH specifically removes 16S sequences without off-target effects on other genes. By assessing the cell barcodes shared by both libraries, we find that DASH-treated cells have consistently higher complexity given the same amount of reads, which enables the detection of a rare cell cluster and more differentially expressed genes. In conclusion, DASH can be easily integrated into existing sequencing protocols and customized to deplete unwanted transcripts in any organism."
"37322153","Direct enzymatic sequencing of 5-methylcytosine at single-base resolution.","Nat Chem Biol","5-methylcytosine (5mC) is the most important DNA modification in mammalian genomes. The ideal method for 5mC localization would be both nondestructive of DNA and direct, without requiring inference based on detection of unmodified cytosines. Here we present direct methylation sequencing (DM-Seq), a bisulfite-free method for profiling 5mC at single-base resolution using nanogram quantities of DNA. DM-Seq employs two key DNA-modifying enzymes: a neomorphic DNA methyltransferase and a DNA deaminase capable of precise discrimination between cytosine modification states. Coupling these activities with deaminase-resistant adapters enables accurate detection of only 5mC via a C-to-T transition in sequencing. By comparison, we uncover a PCR-related underdetection bias with the hybrid enzymatic-chemical TET-assisted pyridine borane sequencing approach. Importantly, we show that DM-Seq, unlike bisulfite sequencing, unmasks prognostically important CpGs in a clinical tumor sample by not confounding 5mC with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. DM-Seq thus offers an all-enzymatic, nondestructive, faithful and direct method for the reading of 5mC alone.© 2023. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc."

Longitudinal Within-Person Associations in a Nationally Representative Cohort.","JAACAP Open","This study examined longitudinal associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and social isolation across childhood. The study tested the direction of this association across time, while accounting for preexisting characteristics, and assessed whether this association varied by ADHD presentation, informant, sex, and socioeconomic status.Participants included 2,232 children from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study. ADHD symptoms and social isolation were measured at ages 5, 7, 10, and 12. Random-intercept cross-lagged panel models were used to assess the directionality of the association across childhood.Children with increased ADHD symptoms were consistently at increased risk of becoming socially isolated later in childhood, over and above stable characteristics (β = .05-.08). These longitudinal associations were not bidirectional; isolated children were not at risk of worsening ADHD symptoms later on. Children with hyperactive ADHD presentation were more likely to become isolated, compared with inattentive presentation. This was evident in the school setting, as observed by teachers, but not by mothers at home.The study findings highlight the importance of enhancing peer social support and inclusion for children with ADHD, particularly in school settings. This study adds explanatory value beyond traditional longitudinal methods, as the results represent how individual children change over time, relative to their own preexisting characteristics.We worked to ensure sex and gender balance in the recruitment of human participants.

We aim to develop, validate, and implement a cost-effective ctDNA-methylation-based plasma test to aid lung cancer early detection.Case-control studies were designed to select the most relevant markers to lung cancer. Patients with lung cancer or benign lung disease and healthy individuals were recruited from different clinical centers. A multi-locus qPCR assay, LunaCAM, was developed for lung cancer alertness by ctDNA methylation. Two LunaCAM models were built for screening (-S) or diagnostic aid (-D) to favor sensitivity or specificity, respectively. The performance of the models was validated for different intended uses in clinics.Profiling DNA methylation on 429 plasma samples including 209 lung cancer, 123 benign diseases and 97 healthy participants identified the top markers that detected lung cancer from benign diseases and healthy with an AUC of 0.85 and 0.95, respectively. The most effective methylation markers were verified individually in 40 tissues and 169 plasma samples to develop LunaCAM assay. Two models corresponding to different intended uses were trained with 513 plasma samples, and validated with an independent collection of 172 plasma samples. In validation, LunaCAM-S model achieved an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.88-0.94) between lung cancer and healthy individuals, whereas LunaCAM-D model stratified lung cancer from benign pulmonary diseases with an AUC of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.86). When implemented sequentially in the validation set, LunaCAM-S enables to identify 58 patients of lung cancer (90.6% sensitivity), followed by LunaCAM-D to remove 20 patients with no evidence of cancer (83.3% specificity). LunaCAM-D significantly outperformed the blood test of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and the combined model can further improve the predictive power for lung cancer to an overall AUC of 0.86.We developed two different models by ctDNA methylation assay to sensitively detect early-stage lung cancer or specifically classify lung benign diseases. Implemented at different clinical settings, LunaCAM models has a potential to provide a facile and inexpensive avenue for early screening and diagnostic aids for lung cancer.© 2023. The Author(s)."

To address this, we performed single nucleus RNAseq on tissue from 32 human AD and non-AD donors (19 female, 13 male) each with five cortical regions: entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, visual association cortex, and primary visual cortex. Analysis of 51,586 endothelial cells revealed unique gene expression patterns across the five regions in non-AD donors. Alzheimer's brain endothelial cells were characterized by upregulated protein folding genes and distinct transcriptomic differences in response to amyloid β plaques and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. This dataset demonstrates previously unrecognized regional heterogeneity in the endothelial cell transcriptome in both aged non-AD and AD brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTIn this work, we show that vascular endothelial cells collected from five different brain regions display surprising variability in gene expression. In the presence of Alzheimer's disease pathology, endothelial cell gene expression is dramatically altered with clear differences in regional and temporal changes. These findings help explain why certain brain regions appear to differ in susceptibility to disease-related vascular remodeling events that may impact blood flow.Copyright © 2023 Bryant et al."

The upregulated gene networks in PBMCs of ASD patients are strongly associated with activated immune-inflammatory pathways, including interferon-α signaling, and cellular responses to DNA repair. Enrichment analyses of the upregulated CNS gene networks indicate involvement of immune-inflammatory pathways, cytokine production, Toll-Like Receptor signalling, with a major involvement of the PI3K-Akt pathway. Analyses of the downregulated CNS genes suggest electron transport chain dysfunctions at multiple levels. Network topological analyses revealed that the consequent aberrations in axonogenesis, neurogenesis, synaptic transmission, and regulation of transsynaptic signalling affect neurodevelopment with subsequent impairments in social behaviours and neurocognition. The results suggest a defense response against viral infection.Peripheral activation of immune-inflammatory pathways, most likely induced by viral infections, may result in CNS neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to abnormalities in transsynaptic transmission, and brain neurodevelopment.© 2023 The Authors."
"37339986","Deep learning for deterioration prediction of COVID-19 patients based on time-series of three vital signs.","Sci Rep","Unrecognized deterioration of COVID-19 patients can lead to high morbidity and mortality. Most existing deterioration prediction models require a large number of clinical information, typically collected in hospital settings, such as medical images or comprehensive laboratory tests. This is infeasible for telehealth solutions and highlights a gap in deterioration prediction models based on minimal data, which can be recorded at a large scale in any clinic, nursing home, or even at the patient's home. In this study, we develop and compare two prognostic models that predict if a patient will experience deterioration in the forthcoming 3 to 24 h. The models sequentially process routine triadic vital signs: (a) oxygen saturation, (b) heart rate, and (c) temperature. These models are also provided with basic patient information, including sex, age, vaccination status, vaccination date, and status of obesity, hypertension, or diabetes. The difference between the two models is the way that the temporal dynamics of the vital signs are processed. Model #1 utilizes a temporally-dilated version of the Long-Short Term Memory model (LSTM) for temporal processes, and Model #2 utilizes a residual temporal convolutional network (TCN) for this purpose. We train and evaluate the models using data collected from 37,006 COVID-19 patients at NYU Langone Health in New York, USA. The convolution-based model outperforms the LSTM based model, achieving a high AUROC of 0.8844-0.9336 for 3 to 24 h deterioration prediction on a held-out test set. We also conduct occlusion experiments to evaluate the importance of each input feature, which reveals the significance of continuously monitoring the variation of the vital signs. Our results show the prospect for accurate deterioration forecast using a minimum feature set that can be relatively easily obtained using wearable devices and self-reported patient information.© 2023.

Although there are computational methods for extracting gene regulatory relationships from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, the data integration problem, essential for accurate cell type identification, has been mostly treated as a standalone challenge. Here we present scTIE, a unified method that integrates temporal multimodal data and infers regulatory relationships predictive of cellular state changes. scTIE uses an autoencoder to embed cells from all time points into a common space using iterative optimal transport, followed by extracting interpretable information to predict cell trajectories. Using a variety of synthetic and real temporal multimodal datasets, we demonstrate scTIE achieves effective data integration while preserving more biological signals than existing methods, particularly in the presence of batch effects and noise. Furthermore, on the exemplar multiome dataset we generated from differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells over time, we demonstrate scTIE captures regulatory elements highly predictive of cell transition probabilities, providing new potentials to understand the regulatory landscape driving developmental processes."

As CHIP-associated mutations are known to alter the development and function of myeloid cells, we hypothesized that CHIP may also be associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disease in which brain-resident myeloid cells are thought to have a major role. To perform association tests between CHIP and AD dementia, we analyzed blood DNA sequencing data from 1,362 individuals with AD and 4,368 individuals without AD. Individuals with CHIP had a lower risk of AD dementia (meta-analysis odds ratio (OR) = 0.64, P = 3.8 × 10-5), and Mendelian randomization analyses supported a potential causal association. We observed that the same mutations found in blood were also detected in microglia-enriched fraction of the brain in seven of eight CHIP carriers. Single-nucleus chromatin accessibility profiling of brain-derived nuclei in six CHIP carriers revealed that the mutated cells comprised a large proportion of the microglial pool in the samples examined. While additional studies are required to validate the mechanistic findings, these results suggest that CHIP may have a role in attenuating the risk of AD.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37323185","Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of digestive neuroendocrine neoplasms.","Ther Adv Med Oncol","Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are initially monoclonal neoplasms that progressively become polyclonal, with very different genotypic and phenotypic characteristics leading to biological differences, including the Ki-67 proliferation index, morphology, or sensitivity to treatments. Whereas inter-patient heterogeneity has been well described, intra-tumor heterogeneity has been little studied. However, NENs present a high degree of heterogeneity, both spatially within the same location or between different lesions, and through time. This can be explained by the emergence of tumor subclones with different behaviors. These subpopulations can be distinguished by the Ki-67 index, but also by the expression of hormonal markers or by differences in the intensity of uptake on metabolic imaging, such as68Ga-somatostatin receptor and Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. As these features are directly related to prognosis, it seems mandatory to move toward a standardized, improved selection of the tumor areas to be studied to be as predictive as possible. The temporal evolution of NENs frequently leads to changes in tumor grade over time, with impact on prognosis and therapeutic decision-making. However, there is no recommendation regarding systematic biopsy of NEN recurrence or progression, and which lesion to sample. This review aims to summarize the current state of knowledge, the main hypotheses, and the main implications regarding intra-tumor spatial and temporal heterogeneity in digestive NENs.© The Author(s), 2023."
"37340465","Promotion of axon regeneration and protection on injured retinal ganglion cells by rCXCL2.","Inflamm Regen","In addition to rescuing injured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) by stimulating the intrinsic growth ability of damaged RGCs in various retinal/optic neuropathies, increasing evidence has shown that the external microenvironmental factors also play a crucial role in restoring the survival of RGCs by promoting the regrowth of RGC axons, especially inflammatory factors. In this study, we aimed to screen out the underlying inflammatory factor involved in the signaling of staurosporine (STS)-induced axon regeneration and verify its role in the protection of RGCs and the promotion of axon regrowth.We performed transcriptome RNA sequencing for STS induction models in vitro and analyzed the differentially expressed genes. After targeting the key gene, we verified the role of the candidate factor in RGC protection and promotion of axon regeneration in vivo with two RGC-injured animal models (optic nerve crush, ONC; retinal N-methyl-D-aspartate, NMDA damage) by using cholera toxin subunit B anterograde axon tracing and specific immunostaining of RGCs.We found that a series of inflammatory genes expressed upregulated in the signaling of STS-induced axon regrowth and we targeted the candidate CXCL2 gene since the level of the chemokine CXCL2 gene elevated significantly among the top upregulated genes. We further demonstrated that intravitreal injection of rCXCL2 robustly promoted axon regeneration and significantly improved RGC survival in ONC-injured mice in vivo. However, different from its role in ONC model, the intravitreal injection of rCXCL2 was able to simply protect RGCs against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity in mouse retina and maintain the long-distance projection of RGC axons, yet failed to promote significant axon regeneration.We provide the first in vivo evidence that CXCL2, as an inflammatory factor, is a key regulator in the axon regeneration and neuroprotection of RGCs. Our comparative study may facilitate deciphering the exact molecular mechanisms of RGC axon regeneration and developing high-potency targeted drugs.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37292627","Epigenome Editing Durability Varies Widely Across Cardiovascular Disease Target Genes.","bioRxiv","Hepatic knockdown of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene or the angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) gene has been demonstrated to reduce blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and hepatic knockdown of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene has been demonstrated to reduce blood pressure. Genome editing can productively target each of these three genes in hepatocytes in the liver, offering the possibility of durable ""one-and-done"" therapies for hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. However, concerns around making permanent gene sequence changes via DNA strand breaks might hinder acceptance of these therapies. Epigenome editing offers an alternative approach to gene inactivation, via silencing of gene expression by methylation of the promoter region, but the long-term durability of epigenome editing remains to be established.We assessed the ability of epigenome editing to durably reduce the expression of the humanPCSK9, ANGPTL3, andAGTgenes in HuH-7 hepatoma cells. Using the CRISPRoff epigenome editor, we identified guide RNAs that produced efficient gene knockdown immediately after transfection. We assessed the durability of gene expression and methylation changes through serial cell passages.Cells treated with CRISPRoff andPCSK9guide RNAs were maintained for up to 124 cell doublings and demonstrated durable knockdown of gene expression and increased CpG dinucleotide methylation in the promoter, exon 1, and intron 1 regions. In contrast, cells treated with CRISPRoff andANGPTL3guide RNAs experienced only transient knockdown of gene expression. Cells treated with CRISPRoff andAGTguide RNAs also experienced transient knockdown of gene expression; although initially there was increased CpG methylation throughout the early part of the gene, this methylation was geographically heterogeneous-transient in the promoter, and stable in intron 1.This work demonstrates precise and durable gene regulation via methylation, supporting a new therapeutic approach for protection against cardiovascular disease via knockdown of genes such asPCSK9. However, the durability of knockdown with methylation changes is not generalizable across target genes, likely limiting the therapeutic potential of epigenome editing compared to other modalities."

We generated 249 high-resolution in situ Hi-C chromatin contact maps of subcutaneous AT and three visceral ATs, analyzing transcriptomic and chromatin architectural changes under different nutritional treatments. We find that chromatin architecture remodeling underpins transcriptomic divergence in ATs, potentially linked to metabolic risks in obesity development. Analysis of chromatin architecture among subcutaneous ATs of different mammals suggests the presence of transcriptional regulatory divergence that could explain phenotypic, physiological, and functional differences in ATs. Regulatory element conservation analysis in pigs and humans reveals similarities in the regulatory circuitry of genes responsible for the obesity phenotype and identified non-conserved elements in species-specific gene sets that underpin AT specialization.

Flatmounts of the dissected leptomeninges and dura were used to facilitiate high-quality confocal imaging and quantification of cell abundances and morphologies. Upon infection, the major meningeal cell types - including endothelial cells (ECs), macrophages, and fibroblasts - exhibit distinctive changes in their transcriptomes. Additionally, ECs in the leptomeninges redistribute CLDN5 and PECAM1, and leptomeningeal capillaries exhibit foci with reduced blood-brain barrier integrity. The vascular response to infection appears to be largely driven by TLR4 signaling, as determined by the nearly identical responses induced by infection and LPS administration and by the blunted response to infection inTlr4-/-mice. Interestingly, knocking outCcr2, encoding a major chemoattractant for monocytes, or acute depletion of leptomeningeal macrophages, following intracebroventricular injection of liposomal clodronate, had little or no effect on the response of leptomeningeal ECs toE. coliinfection. Taken together, these data imply that EC responses to infection are largely driven by the intrinsic EC response to LPS.© 2023, Wang et al."

The finding persisted after the adjustment of established modifiers of oxidative stress (including BMI, smoking, and glycated hemoglobin). In contrast, systemic levels of DNA damage from oxidation, which traditionally has been causally linked to both T2D and aging, failed to predict mortality. Strikingly, these findings were subsequently replicated in an independent general population study (n = 3649).

Here, we aim to identify candidate metabolite biomarkers of MetS and its associated risk factors to better understand the complex interplay of underlying signaling pathways.We quantified serum samples of the KORA F4 study participants (N = 2815) and analyzed 121 metabolites. Multiple regression models adjusted for clinical and lifestyle covariates were used to identify metabolites that were Bonferroni significantly associated with MetS. These findings were replicated in the SHIP-TREND-0 study (N = 988) and further analyzed for the association of replicated metabolites with the five components of MetS. Database-driven networks of the identified metabolites and their interacting enzymes were also constructed.We identified and replicated 56 MetS-specific metabolites: 13 were positively associated (e.g., Val, Leu/Ile, Phe, and Tyr), and 43 were negatively associated (e.g., Gly, Ser, and 40 lipids). Moreover, the majority (89%) and minority (23%) of MetS-specific metabolites were associated with low HDL-C and hypertension, respectively. One lipid, lysoPC a C18:2, was negatively associated with MetS and all of its five components, indicating that individuals with MetS and each of the risk factors had lower concentrations of lysoPC a C18:2 compared to corresponding controls. Our metabolic networks elucidated these observations by revealing impaired catabolism of branched-chain and aromatic amino acids, as well as accelerated Gly catabolism.Our identified candidate metabolite biomarkers are associated with the pathophysiology of MetS and its risk factors. They could facilitate the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. For instance, elevated levels of lysoPC a C18:2 may protect MetS and its five risk components.

Here we present grandR, a comprehensive package for quality control, differential gene expression analysis, kinetic modeling, and visualization of such data. We compare several existing methods for inference of RNA synthesis rates and half-lives using progressive labeling time courses. We demonstrate the need for recalibration of effective labeling times and introduce a Bayesian approach to study the temporal dynamics of RNA using snapshot experiments.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37349410","Understanding tumour endothelial cell heterogeneity and function from single-cell omics.","Nat Rev Cancer","Anti-angiogenic therapies (AATs) are used to treat different types of cancers. However, their success is limited owing to insufficient efficacy and resistance. Recently, single-cell omics studies of tumour endothelial cells (TECs) have provided new mechanistic insight. Here, we overview the heterogeneity of human TECs of all tumour types studied to date, at the single-cell level. Notably, most human tumour types contain varying numbers but only a small population of angiogenic TECs, the presumed targets of AATs, possibly contributing to the limited efficacy of and resistance to AATs. In general, TECs are heterogeneous within and across all tumour types, but comparing TEC phenotypes across tumours is currently challenging, owing to the lack of a uniform nomenclature for endothelial cells and consistent single-cell analysis protocols, urgently raising the need for a more consistent approach. Nonetheless, across most tumour types, universal TEC markers (ACKR1, PLVAP and IGFBP3) can be identified. Besides angiogenesis, biological processes such as immunomodulation and extracellular matrix organization are among the most commonly predicted enriched signatures of TECs across different tumour types. Although angiogenesis and extracellular matrix targets have been considered for AAT (without the hoped success), the immunomodulatory properties of TECs have not been fully considered as a novel anticancer therapeutic approach. Therefore, we also discuss progress, limitations, solutions and novel targets for AAT development.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."

We tested whether de novo germline mutations (DNMs) are increased in families with germline defects in polymerase proofreading or base excision repair. A parent with a single germline POLE or POLD1 mutation, or biallelic MUTYH mutations, had 3-4 fold increased DNMs over sex-matched controls. POLE had the largest effect. The DNMs carried mutational signatures of the appropriate DNA repair deficiency. No DNM increase occurred in offspring of MUTYH heterozygous parents. Parental DNA repair defects caused about 20-150 DNMs per child, additional to the ~60 found in controls, but almost all extra DNMs occurred in non-coding regions. No increase in post-zygotic mutations was detected, excepting a child with bi-allelic MUTYH mutations who was excluded from the main analysis; she had received chemotherapy and may have undergone oligoclonal haematopoiesis. Inherited DNA repair defects associated with base pair-level mutations increase DNMs, but phenotypic consequences appear unlikely.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Wnt signaling governs normal sperm maturation. However, the role of Wnt signaling in spermatogonia in NOA has incompletely been uncovered, and upstream molecules regulating Wnt signaling remain unclear.Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of NOA was used to identify the hub gene module in NOA utilizing weighted gene co-expression network analyses (WGCNAs). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of NOA was employed to explore dysfunctional signaling pathways in the specific cell type with gene sets of signaling pathways. Single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (pySCENIC) for Python analysis was applied to speculate putative transcription factors in spermatogonia. Moreover, single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) determined the regulated genes of these transcription factors. Finally, spatial transcriptomic data were used to analyze cell type and Wnt signaling spatial distribution.The Wnt signaling pathway was demonstrated to be enriched in the hub gene module of NOA by bulk RNA-seq. Then, scRNA-seq data revealed the downregulated activity and dysfunction of Wnt signaling of spermatogonia in NOA samples. Conjoint analyses of the pySCENIC algorithm and scATAC-seq data indicated that three transcription factors (CTCF,AR, andARNTL) were related to the activities of Wnt signaling in NOA. Eventually, spatial expression localization of Wnt signaling was identified to be in accordance with the distribution patterns of spermatogonia, Sertoli cells, and Leydig cells.In conclusion, we identified that downregulated Wnt signaling of spermatogonia in NOA and three transcription factors (CTCF,AR, andARNTL) may be involved in this dysfunctional Wnt signaling. These findings provide new mechanisms for NOA and new therapeutic targets for NOA patients.Copyright © 2023 Zeng, Chen, Liu, Tang, Wu and Liu."
"37300822","Catalytic domain-dependent and -independent transcriptional activities of the tumour suppressor histone H3K27 demethylase UTX/KDM6A in specific cancer types.","Epigenetics","The histone H3K27 demethylase, UTX/KDM6A, plays a critical role in the early development of vertebrates, and mutations are frequently found in various cancers. Several studies on developmental and cancer biology have focused on preferential transcriptional regulation by UTX independently of its H3K27 demethylase catalytic activity. Here, we analysed gene expression profiles of wild-type (WT) UTX and a catalytic activity-defective mutant in 786-O and HCT116 cells and confirmed that catalytic activity-dependent and -independent regulation contributes to the expression of most of the target genes. Indeed, the catalytic activity-defective mutant indeed suppressed colony formation similar to the WT in our assay system. However, the expression of several genes was significantly dependent on the catalytic activity of UTX in a cell type-specific manner, which could account for the inherent variation in the transcriptional landscape of various cancer types. The promoter/enhancer regions of the catalytic activity-dependent genes identified here were found to be preferentially modified with H3K4me1 and less with H3K27me3 than those of the independent genes. These findings, combined with previous reports, highlight not only the understanding of determinants for the catalytic activity dependency but also the development and application of pharmaceutical agents targeting the H3K27 or H3K4 modifications."

Quantifying shared heritability among the cancers detects positive genetic correlations between breast and prostate cancer across populations. Common genetic components increase the statistical power, and the large-scale meta-analysis of 277,896 breast/prostate cancer cases and 901,858 controls identifies 91 newly genome-wide significant loci.

"37325658","Aberrant inflammasome activation as a driving force of human autoimmune skin disease.","Front Immunol","Autoimmune skin diseases are understood as conditions in which the adaptive immune system with autoantigen-specific T cells and autoantibody-producing B cells reacting against self-tissues plays a crucial pathogenic role. However, there is increasing evidence that inflammasomes, which are large multiprotein complexes that were first described 20 years ago, contribute to autoimmune disease progression. The inflammasome and its contribution to the bioactivation of interleukins IL-1β and IL-18 play an essential role in combating foreign pathogens or tissue damage, but may also act as a pathogenic driver of myriad chronic inflammatory diseases when dysfunctionally regulated. Inflammasomes containing the NOD-like receptor family members NLRP1 and NLRP3 as well as the AIM2-like receptor family member AIM2 have been increasingly investigated in inflammatory skin conditions. In addition to autoinflammatory diseases, which are often associated with skin involvement, the aberrant activation of the inflammasome has also been implied in autoimmune diseases that can either affect the skin besides other organs such as systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis or are isolated to the skin in humans. The latter include, among others, the T-cell mediated disorders vitiligo, alopecia areata, lichen planus and cutaneous lupus erythematosus as well as the autoantibody-driven blistering skin disease bullous pemphigoid. Some diseases are characterized by both autoinflammatory and autoimmune responses such as the chronic inflammatory skin disease psoriasis. Further insights into inflammasome dysregulation and associated pathways as well as their role in forming adaptive immune responses in human autoimmune skin pathology could potentially offer a new field of therapeutic options in the future.Copyright © 2023 Fetter, de Graaf, Claus and Wenzel."

The firstCTCFvariants in CRD cases were documented in 2013. To date, 76CTCFvariants have been further described in the literature. In recent years, due to the increased application of next-generation sequencing (NGS), growing numbers ofCTCFvariants are being identified, and multiple genotype-phenotype databases cataloging such variants are emerging.In this study, we aimed to expand the genotypic spectrum of CRD, by cataloging NDD phenotypes associated with reportedCTCFvariants. Here, we systematically reviewed all knownCTCFvariants reported in case studies and large-scale exome sequencing cohorts. We also conducted a meta-analysis using public variant data from genotype-phenotype databases to identify additionalCTCFvariants, which we then curated and annotated.From this combined approach, we report an additional 86CTCFvariants associated with NDD phenotypes that have not yet been described in the literature. Furthermore, we describe and explain inconsistencies in the quality of reported variants, which impairs the reuse of data for research of NDDs and other pathologies.From this integrated analysis, we provide a comprehensive and annotated catalog of all currently knownCTCFmutations associated with NDD phenotypes, to aid diagnostic applications, as well as translational and basic research.Copyright © 2023 Price, Fedida, Pugacheva, Ji, Loukinov and Lobanenkov."

Integrating the effects generated by TSMR, functional annotations and noncoding variant prediction framework were applied to analyze and interpret the functional instrument variants (IVs).The results of the inverse variance weighted method showed a strong significant causal relationship between hypothyroidism and risk of RA in European ancestry [odds ratio (OR) = 1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49, 2.58;p< 0.001]. The outcomes of MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and simple mode also showed that hypothyroidism was significantly associated with increased risk of RA in European ancestry. The MR-PRESSO method also showed significant results [Outlier-corrected Causal Estimate = 0.70; standard error (SE) = 0.06;p< 0.001]. An independent dataset and an Asian ancestry dataset were applied to estimate and obtain the coincident results.

"37344847","Novel models by machine learning to predict prognosis of breast cancer brain metastases.","J Transl Med","Breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) are the most fatal, with limited survival in all breast cancer distant metastases. These patients are deemed to be incurable. Thus, survival time is their foremost concern. However, there is a lack of accurate prediction models in the clinic. What's more, primary surgery for BCBM patients is still controversial.The data used for analysis in this study was obtained from the SEER database (2010-2019). We made a COX regression analysis to identify prognostic factors of BCBM patients. Through cross-validation, we constructed XGBoost models to predict survival in patients with BCBM. Meanwhile, a BCBM cohort from our hospital was used to validate our models. We also investigated the prognosis of patients treated with surgery or not, using propensity score matching and K-M survival analysis. Our results were further validated by subgroup COX analysis in patients with different molecular subtypes.The XGBoost models we created had high precision and correctness, and they were the most accurate models to predict the survival of BCBM patients (6-month AUC = 0.824, 1-year AUC = 0.813, 2-year AUC = 0.800 and 3-year survival AUC = 0.803). Moreover, the models still exhibited good performance in an externally independent dataset (6-month: AUC = 0.820; 1-year: AUC = 0.732; 2-year: AUC = 0.795; 3-year: AUC = 0.936). Then we used Shiny-Web tool to make our models be easily used from website. Interestingly, we found that the BCBM patients with an annual income of over USD$70,000 had better BCSS (HR = 0.523, 95%CI 0.273-0.999, P < 0.05) than those with less than USD$40,000. The results showed that in all distant metastasis sites, only lung metastasis was an independent poor prognostic factor for patients with BCBM (OS: HR = 1.606, 95%CI 1.157-2.230, P < 0.01; BCSS: HR = 1.698, 95%CI 1.219-2.365, P < 0.01), while bone, liver, distant lymph nodes and other metastases were not. We also found that surgical treatment significantly improved both OS and BCSS in BCBM patients with the HER2 + molecular subtypes and was beneficial to OS of the HR-/HER2- subtype. In contrast, surgery could not help BCBM patients with HR + /HER2- subtype improve their prognosis (OS: HR = 0.887, 95%CI 0.608-1.293, P = 0.510; BCSS: HR = 0.909, 95%CI 0.604-1.368, P = 0.630).We analyzed the clinical features of BCBM patients and constructed 4 machine-learning prognostic models to predict their survival. Our validation results indicate that these models should be highly reproducible in patients with BCBM. We also identified potential prognostic factors for BCBM patients and suggested that primary surgery might improve the survival of BCBM patients with HER2 + and triple-negative subtypes.© 2023.

Hi-C and other ligation-based methods have become routine but have specific biases. Here, we develop multiplex-GAM, a faster and more affordable version of genome architecture mapping (GAM), a ligation-free technique that maps chromatin contacts genome-wide. We perform a detailed comparison of multiplex-GAM and Hi-C using mouse embryonic stem cells. When examining the strongest contacts detected by either method, we find that only one-third of these are shared. The strongest contacts specifically found in GAM often involve 'active' regions, including many transcribed genes and super-enhancers, whereas in Hi-C they more often contain 'inactive' regions. Our work shows that active genomic regions are involved in extensive complex contacts that are currently underestimated in ligation-based approaches, and highlights the need for orthogonal advances in genome-wide contact mapping technologies.© 2023.

"37292821","Centromere-specifying nucleosomes persist in aging mouse oocytes in the absence of nascent assembly.","bioRxiv","Centromeres direct genetic inheritance but are not themselves genetically encoded. Instead, centromeres are defined epigenetically by the presence of a histone H3 variant, CENP-A1. In cultured somatic cells, an established paradigm of cell cycle-coupled propagation maintains centromere identity: CENP-A is partitioned between sisters during replication and replenished by new assembly, which is restricted to G1. The mammalian female germline challenges this model because of the cell cycle arrest between pre-meiotic S-phase and the subsequent G1, which can last for the entire reproductive lifespan (months to decades). New CENP-A chromatin assembly maintains centromeres during prophase I in worm and starfish oocyte2,3, suggesting that a similar process may be required for centromere inheritance in mammals. However, we show that centromere chromatin is maintained long-term independent of new assembly during the extended prophase I arrest in mouse oocytes. Conditional knockout of Mis18α, an essential component of the assembly machinery, in the female germline at the time of birth has almost no impact on centromeric CENP-A nucleosome abundance nor any detectable detriment to fertility."

We present a novel analytical approach to identify multiple bacterial taxa within the gut microbiome of children at 9-11 years associated with prenatal Pb exposure.Data came from a subset of participants (n=123) in the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) cohort. Pb concentrations were measured in maternal whole blood from the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Stool samples collected at 9-11 years old underwent metagenomic sequencing to assess the gut microbiome. Using a novel analytical approach, Microbial Co-occurrence Analysis (MiCA), we paired a machine-learning algorithm with randomization-based inference to first identify microbial cliques that were predictive of prenatal Pb exposure and then estimate the association between prenatal Pb exposure and microbial clique abundance.With second-trimester Pb exposure, we identified a 2-taxa microbial clique that includedBifidobacterium adolescentisandRuminococcus callidus, and a 3-taxa clique that addedPrevotella clara. Increasing second-trimester Pb exposure was associated with significantly increased odds of having the 2-taxa microbial clique below the 50thpercentile relative abundance (OR=1.03,95%CI[1.01-1.05]). In an analysis of Pb concentration at or above vs. below the United States and Mexico guidelines for child Pb exposure, odds of the 2-taxa clique in low abundance were 3.36(95%CI[1.32-8.51]) and 6.11(95%CI[1.87-19.93]), respectively. Trends were similar with the 3-taxa clique but not statistically significant.Using a novel combination of machine-learning and causal-inference, MiCA identified a significant association between second-trimester Pb exposure and reduced abundance of a probiotic microbial clique within the gut microbiome in late childhood. Pb exposure levels at the guidelines for child Pb poisoning in the United States, and Mexico are not sufficient to protect against the potential loss of probiotic benefits."

While excellent validation and release testing assays designed to evaluate potency, genetic integrity, and sterility exist, they do not have the ability to predict cell type-specific differentiation capacity. Selection of iPSC lines that have limited capacity to produce high-quality transplantable cells, places significant strain on valuable clinical manufacturing resources. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree and root cause of variability in retinal differentiation capacity between cGMP-derived patient iPSC lines. In turn, our goal was to develop a release testing assay that could be used to augment the widely used ScoreCard panel. IPSCs were generated from 15 patients (14-76 years old), differentiated into retinal organoids, and scored based on their retinal differentiation capacity. Despite significant differences in retinal differentiation propensity, RNA-sequencing revealed remarkable similarity between patient-derived iPSC lines prior to differentiation. At 7 days of differentiation, significant differences in gene expression could be detected. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed perturbations in pathways associated with pluripotency and early cell fate commitment. For example, good and poor producers had noticeably different expressions of OCT4 and SOX2 effector genes. QPCR assays targeting genes identified via RNA sequencing were developed and validated in a masked fashion using iPSCs from 8 independent patients. A subset of 14 genes, which include the retinal cell fate markers RAX, LHX2, VSX2, and SIX6 (all elevated in the good producers), were found to be predictive of retinal differentiation propensity.© The Author(s) 2023.

The main outcomes are Time from symptom Onset to mitochondrial disease Diagnosis (TOD) and Number of Doctors Seen during this diagnostic process (NDOCS).Expert recoding increased analyzable responses by 34% for final mitochondrial diagnosis and 39% for prior non-mitochondrial diagnosis. Only one of 122 patients who initially saw a primary care physician (PCP) received a mitochondrial diagnosis, compared to 26 of 86 (30%) who initially saw a specialist (p < 0.001). Mean TOD overall was 9.9 ± 13.0 years, and mean NDOCS 6.7 ± 5.2. Mitochondrial diagnosis brings extensive benefits through treatment changes and increased membership in and support of advocacy groups.Because TOD is long and NDOCS high, there is great potential for shortening the mitochondrial odyssey. Although prompt patient contact with primary mitochondrial disease specialists, or early implementation of appropriate tests, may shorten the diagnostic odyssey, specific proposals for improvement require testing and confirmation with adequately complete, unbiased data across all its stages, and appropriate methods.

The mislocalization of CENP-A to non-centromeric regions contributes to CIN in yeasts, flies and human cells. Even though overexpression and mislocalization of CENP-A have been reported in cancers, the mechanisms responsible for its mislocalization remain poorly understood. Here, we used an imaging-based high-throughput RNAi screen to identify factors that prevent mislocalization of overexpressed YFP-tagged CENP-A (YFP-CENP-A) in HeLa cells. Among the top five candidates in the screen - the depletion of which showed increased nuclear YFP-CENP-A fluorescence - were the histone chaperones CHAF1B (or p60) and CHAF1A (or p150). Follow-up validation and characterization experiments showed that CHAF1B-depleted cells exhibited CENP-A mislocalization, CIN phenotypes and increased enrichment of CENP-A in chromatin fractions. The depletion of DAXX, a histone H3.3 chaperone, suppressed CENP-A mislocalization and CIN in CHAF1B-depleted cells. We propose that in CHAF1B-depleted cells, DAXX promotes mislocalization of the overexpressed CENP-A to non-centromeric regions, resulting in CIN. In summary, we identified regulators of CENP-A localization and defined a role for CHAF1B in preventing DAXX-dependent CENP-A mislocalization and CIN.© 2023.

Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1), a member of the TRP channels superfamily, is activated by many migraine triggers and expressed in trigeminal neurons and brain regions that are important in migraine pathogenesis. TRP channels change noxious stimuli into pain signals with the involvement of epigenetic regulation. The expression of the TRPA1 encoding gene, TRPA1, is modulated in pain-related syndromes by epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and effects of non-coding RNAs: micro RNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs. TRPA1 may change epigenetic profile of many pain-related genes as it may modify enzymes responsible for epigenetic modifications and expression of non-coding RNAs. TRPA1 may induce the release of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), from trigeminal neurons and dural tissue. Therefore, epigenetic regulation of TRPA1 may play a role in efficacy and safety of anti-migraine therapies targeting TRP channels and CGRP. TRPA1 is also involved in neurogenic inflammation, important in migraine pathogenesis. The fundamental role of TRPA1 in inflammatory pain transmission may be epigenetically regulated. In conclusion, epigenetic connections of TRPA1 may play a role in efficacy and safety of anti-migraine therapy targeting TRP channels or CGRP and they should be further explored for efficient and safe antimigraine treatment. This narrative/perspective review presents information on the structure and functions of TRPA1 as well as role of its epigenetic connections in pain transmission and potential in migraine therapy.© 2023.

We show that cellular plasticity of NB tumor cells is conserved upon metastasis and tumor cell type composition is NB subtype-dependent. NB cells signal to the BM microenvironment, rewiring via macrophage mgration inhibitory factor and midkine signaling specifically monocytes, which exhibit M1 and M2 features, are marked by activation of pro- and anti-inflammatory programs, and express tumor-promoting factors, reminiscent of tumor-associated macrophages.

"37365401","Episignature analysis of moderate effects and mosaics.","Eur J Hum Genet","DNA methylation classifiers (""episignatures"") help to determine the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance (VUS). However, their sensitivity is limited due to their training on unambiguous cases with strong-effect variants so that the classification of variants with reduced effect size or in mosaic state may fail. Moreover, episignature evaluation of mosaics as a function of their degree of mosaicism has not been developed so far. We improved episignatures with respect to three categories. Applying (i) minimum-redundancy-maximum-relevance feature selection we reduced their length by up to one order of magnitude without loss of accuracy. Performing (ii) repeated re-training of a support vector machine classifier by step-wise inclusion of cases in the training set that reached probability scores larger than 0.5, we increased the sensitivity of the episignature-classifiers by 30%. In the newly diagnosed patients we confirmed the association between DNA methylation aberration and age at onset of KMT2B-deficient dystonia. Moreover, we found evidence for allelic series, including KMT2B-variants with moderate effects and comparatively mild phenotypes such as late-onset focal dystonia. Retrained classifiers also can detect mosaics that previously remained below the 0.5-threshold, as we showed for KMT2D-associated Kabuki syndrome. Conversely, episignature-classifiers are able to revoke erroneous exome calls of mosaicism, as we demonstrated by (iii) comparing presumed mosaic cases with a distribution of artificial in silico-mosaics that represented all the possible variation in degree of mosaicism, variant read sampling and methylation analysis.© 2023.

Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), secreted by osteoblasts and osteocytes, can inhibit bone formation and mineralization. This research aims to investigate the relationship between CS and FGF23.We collected peripheral blood from two pairs of identical twins for methylation sequencing of the target region. FGF23 mRNA levels in the peripheral blood of CS patients and age-matched controls were measured. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were conducted to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of FGF23. The expression levels of FGF23 and its downstream factors fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFr3)/tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP)/osteopontin (OPN) in primary osteoblasts from CS patients (CS-Ob) and controls (CT-Ob) were detected. In addition, the osteogenic abilities of FGF23-knockdown or FGF23-overexpressing Ob were examined.DNA methylation of the FGF23 gene in CS patients was decreased compared to that of their identical twins, accompanied by increased mRNA levels. CS patients had increased peripheral blood FGF23 mRNA levels and decreased computed tomography (CT) values compared with controls. The FGF23 mRNA levels were negatively correlated with the CT value of the spine, and ROCs of FGF23 mRNA levels showed high sensitivity and specificity for CS. Additionally, significantly increased levels of FGF23, FGFr3, OPN, impaired osteogenic mineralization and lower TNAP levels were observed in CS-Ob. Moreover, FGF23 overexpression in CT-Ob increased FGFr3 and OPN levels and decreased TNAP levels, while FGF23 knockdown induced downregulation of FGFr3 and OPN but upregulation of TNAP in CS-Ob. Mineralization of CS-Ob was rescued after FGF23 knockdown.Our results suggested increased peripheral blood FGF23 levels, decreased bone mineral density in CS patients, and a good predictive ability of CS by peripheral blood FGF23 levels.

Included papers were selected if they were economic evaluations and/or budget impact analyses.A total of 24 studies were included and analyzed, with the majority being full economic evaluations (n = 19, 79.2%). Four studies (16.7%) were health and budget impact analyses, and one study (4.1%) incorporated both an economic evaluation and a budget impact analysis. Cohort-level modeling techniques were the most common approach (n = 16; 80%). LB technologies were cost-effective in 15 studies (75%) considering different biomarkers, cancer types and stages, and economic analyses. These studies evaluated LBs for screening and early detection (66.7%), treatment selection (26.7%), and monitoring treatment response (6.6%). Budget impact analysis results were varied among included studies, with the majority of studies (n = 4; 80%) reporting either cost savings, minimal, or modest budget impact, while one study (20%) reported LBs as an efficient strategy. The reviewed studies often inadequately reported or addressed modeling challenges, such as patient-level processes, the combination of tests and treatments, preferences, and uncertainty.LBs could provide a cost-effective approach for treatment selection in lung cancer and aid in the screening and early detection of other cancers, including colorectal, gastric, breast, and brain cancers. This is in comparison with various alternatives, such as the standard of care (SOC) and no screening scenario. However, it is important to mention that in some comparisons, LBs were used in combination with SOC instead of replacing it. Importantly, few studies have pointed toward LBs' cost-effectiveness for monitoring treatment response. Most health and budget impact analyses, especially those focused on lung cancer, suggest potential cost savings or a minimal-to-moderate budget impact. Nevertheless, additional research is needed to ascertain their effectiveness across various stages of lung and colorectal cancer, as well as to address potential modeling challenges.PROSPERO CRD42022307939.© 2023.

"37323577","Engineering CpG island DNA methylation in pluripotent cells through synthetic CpG-free ssDNA insertion.","Cell Rep Methods","Cellular differentiation requires global changes to DNA methylation (DNAme), where it functions to regulate transcription factor, chromatin remodeling activity, and genome interpretation. Here, we describe a simple DNAme engineering approach in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) that stably extends DNAme across target CpG islands (CGIs). Integration of synthetic CpG-free single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) induces a target CpG island methylation response (CIMR) in multiple PSC lines, Nt2d1 embryonal carcinoma cells, and mouse PSCs but not in highly methylated CpG island hypermethylator phenotype (CIMP)+ cancer lines.MLH1CIMR DNAme spanned the CGI, was precisely maintained through cellular differentiation, suppressedMLH1expression, and sensitized derived cardiomyocytes and thymic epithelial cells to cisplatin. Guidelines for CIMR editing are provided, and initial CIMR DNAme is characterized atTP53andONECUT1CGIs. Collectively, this resource facilitates CpG island DNAme engineering in pluripotency and the genesis of novel epigenetic models of development and disease.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"37341803","Unravelling the genetic causality of immunoglobulin G N-glycans in ischemic stroke.","Glycoconj J","Evidence suggests that immunoglobulin G (IgG) N-glycosylation is associated with ischemic stroke (IS). However, the causality of IgG N-glycosylation for IS remains unknown.Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to investigate the potential causal effects of genetically determined IgG N-glycans on IS using publicly available summarized genetic data from East Asian and European populations. Genetic instruments were used as proxies for IgG N-glycan traits. IgG N-glycans were analysed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Four complementary MR methods were performed, including the inverse variance weighted method (IVW), MR‒Egger, weighted median and penalized weighted median. Furthermore, to further test the robustness of the results, MR based on Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) was then applied to select and prioritize IgG N-glycan traits as risk factors for IS.After correcting for multiple testing, in two-sample MR analyses, genetically predicted IgG N-glycans were unrelated to IS in both East Asian and European populations, and the results remained consistent and robust in the sensitivity analysis. Moreover, MR-BMA also showed consistent results in both East Asian and European populations.Contrary to observational studies, the study did not provide enough genetic evidence to support the causal associations of genetically predicted IgG N-glycan traits and IS, suggesting that N-glycosylation of IgG might not directly involve in the pathogenesis of IS.© 2023.

"37357239","Spinal cord injury: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic interventions.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Spinal cord injury (SCI) remains a severe condition with an extremely high disability rate. The challenges of SCI repair include its complex pathological mechanisms and the difficulties of neural regeneration in the central nervous system. In the past few decades, researchers have attempted to completely elucidate the pathological mechanism of SCI and identify effective strategies to promote axon regeneration and neural circuit remodeling, but the results have not been ideal. Recently, new pathological mechanisms of SCI, especially the interactions between immune and neural cell responses, have been revealed by single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptome analysis. With the development of bioactive materials and stem cells, more attention has been focused on forming intermediate neural networks to promote neural regeneration and neural circuit reconstruction than on promoting axonal regeneration in the corticospinal tract. Furthermore, technologies to control physical parameters such as electricity, magnetism and ultrasound have been constantly innovated and applied in neural cell fate regulation. Among these advanced novel strategies and technologies, stem cell therapy, biomaterial transplantation, and electromagnetic stimulation have entered into the stage of clinical trials, and some of them have already been applied in clinical treatment. In this review, we outline the overall epidemiology and pathophysiology of SCI, expound on the latest research progress related to neural regeneration and circuit reconstruction in detail, and propose future directions for SCI repair and clinical applications.© 2023.

"37347276","Transcriptomic profiling of Parkinson's disease brains reveals disease stage specific gene expression changes.","Acta Neuropathol","Parkinson´s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms. Aggravation of symptoms is mirrored by accumulation of protein aggregates mainly composed by alpha-synuclein in different brain regions, called Lewy bodies (LB). Previous studies have identified several molecular mechanisms as autophagy and inflammation playing a role in PD pathogenesis. Increased insights into mechanisms involved in early disease stages and driving the progression of the LB pathology are required for the development of disease-modifying strategies. Here, we aimed to elucidate disease stage-specific transcriptomic changes in brain tissue of well-characterized PD and control donors. We collected frontal cortex samples from 84 donors and sequenced both the coding and non-coding RNAs. We categorized our samples into groups based on their degree of LB pathology aiming to recapitulate a central aspect of disease progression. Using an analytical pipeline that corrected for sex, age at death, RNA quality, cell composition and unknown sources of variation, we found major disease stage-specific transcriptomic changes. Gene expression changes were most pronounced in donors at the disease stage when microscopic LB changes first occur in the sampled brain region. Additionally, we identified disease stage-specific enrichment of brain specific pathways and immune mechanisms. On the contrary, we showed that mitochondrial mechanisms are enriched throughout the disease course. Our data-driven approach also suggests a role for several poorly characterized lncRNAs in disease development and progression of PD. Finally, by combining genetic and epigenetic information, we highlighted two genes (MAP4K4 and PHYHIP) as candidate genes for future functional studies. Together our results indicate that transcriptomic dysregulation and associated functional changes are highly disease stage-specific, which has major implications for the study of neurodegenerative disorders.© 2023.

"37322182","Trained immunity in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","Nat Rev Cardiol","Trained immunity, also known as innate immune memory, is a persistent hyper-responsive functional state of innate immune cells. Accumulating evidence implicates trained immunity as an underlying mechanism of chronic inflammation in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In this context, trained immunity is induced by endogenous atherosclerosis-promoting factors, such as modified lipoproteins or hyperglycaemia, causing broad metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming of the myeloid cell compartment. In addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle factors, including unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyle, sleep deprivation and psychosocial stress, as well as inflammatory comorbidities, have been shown to activate trained immunity-like mechanisms in bone marrow haematopoietic stem cells. In this Review, we discuss the molecular and cellular mechanisms of trained immunity, its systemic regulation through haematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow, and the activation of these mechanisms by cardiovascular disease risk factors. We also highlight other trained immunity features that are relevant for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including the diverse cell types that show memory characteristics and transgenerational inheritance of trained immunity traits. Finally, we propose potential strategies for the therapeutic modulation of trained immunity to manage atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.© 2023. Springer Nature Limited."
"37142056","Robust and High-Throughput Analytical Flow Proteomics Analysis of Cynomolgus Monkey and Human Matrices With Zeno SWATH Data-Independent Acquisition.","Mol Cell Proteomics","Modern mass spectrometers routinely allow deep proteome coverage in a single experiment. These methods are typically operated at nanoflow and microflow regimes, but they often lack throughput and chromatographic robustness, which is critical for large-scale studies. In this context, we have developed, optimized, and benchmarked LC-MS methods combining the robustness and throughput of analytical flow chromatography with the added sensitivity provided by the Zeno trap across a wide range of cynomolgus monkey and human matrices of interest for toxicological studies and clinical biomarker discovery. Sequential Window Acquisition of All Theoretical Fragment Ion Mass Spectra (SWATH) data-independent acquisition (DIA) experiments with Zeno trap activated (Zeno SWATH DIA) provided a clear advantage over conventional SWATH DIA in all sample types tested with improved sensitivity, quantitative robustness, and signal linearity as well as increased protein coverage by up to 9-fold. Using a 10-min gradient chromatography, up to 3300 proteins were identified in tissues at 2 μg peptide load. Importantly, the performance gains with Zeno SWATH translated into better biological pathway representation and improved the ability to identify dysregulated proteins and pathways associated with two metabolic diseases in human plasma. Finally, we demonstrate that this method is highly stable over time with the acquisition of reliable data over the injection of 1000+ samples (14.2 days of uninterrupted acquisition) without the need for human intervention or normalization. Altogether, Zeno SWATH DIA methodology allows fast, sensitive, and robust proteomic workflows using analytical flow and is amenable to large-scale studies.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

"37262074","The circadian clock is disrupted in pancreatic cancer.","PLoS Genet","Disruption of the circadian clock is linked to cancer development and progression. Establishing this connection has proven beneficial for understanding cancer pathogenesis, determining prognosis, and uncovering novel therapeutic targets. However, barriers to characterizing the circadian clock in human pancreas and human pancreatic cancer-one of the deadliest malignancies-have hindered an appreciation of its role in this cancer. Here, we employed normalized coefficient of variation (nCV) and clock correlation analysis in human population-level data to determine the functioning of the circadian clock in pancreas cancer and adjacent normal tissue. We found a substantially attenuated clock in the pancreatic cancer tissue. Then we exploited our existing mouse pancreatic transcriptome data to perform an analysis of the human normal and pancreas cancer samples using a machine learning method, cyclic ordering by periodic structure (CYCLOPS). Through CYCLOPS ordering, we confirmed the nCV and clock correlation findings of an intact circadian clock in normal pancreas with robust cycling of several core clock genes. However, in pancreas cancer, there was a loss of rhythmicity of many core clock genes with an inability to effectively order the cancer samples, providing substantive evidence of a dysregulated clock. The implications of clock disruption were further assessed with a Bmal1 knockout pancreas cancer model, which revealed that an arrhythmic clock caused accelerated cancer growth and worse survival, accompanied by chemoresistance and enrichment of key cancer-related pathways. These findings provide strong evidence for clock disruption in human pancreas cancer and demonstrate a link between circadian disruption and pancreas cancer progression.Copyright: © 2023 Schwartz et al.

"37308902","Metabolomic phenotyping of obesity for profiling cardiovascular and ocular diseases.","J Transl Med","We aimed to evaluate the impacts of metabolomic body mass index (metBMI) phenotypes on the risks of cardiovascular and ocular diseases outcomes.This study included cohorts in UK and Guangzhou, China. By leveraging the serum metabolome and BMI data from UK Biobank, this study developed and validated a metBMI prediction model using a ridge regression model among 89,830 participants based on 249 metabolites. Five obesity phenotypes were obtained by metBMI and actual BMI (actBMI): normal weight (NW, metBMI of 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), overweight (OW, metBMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2), obesity (OB, metBMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), overestimated (OE, metBMI-actBMI > 5 kg/m2), and underestimated (UE, metBMI-actBMI < - 5 kg/m2). Additional participants from the Guangzhou Diabetes Eye Study (GDES) were included for validating the hypothesis. Outcomes included all-cause and cardiovascular (CVD)-cause mortality, as well as incident CVD (coronary heart disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction [MI], and stroke) and age-related eye diseases (age-related macular degeneration [AMD], cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy [DR]).In the UKB, although OE group had lower actBMI than NW group, the OE group had a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality than those in NW prediction group (HR, 1.68; 95% CI 1.16-2.43). Similarly, the OE group had a 1.7-3.6-fold higher risk than their NW counterparts for cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and coronary heart disease (all P < 0.05). In addition, risk of age-related macular denegation (HR, 1.96; 95% CI 1.02-3.77) was significantly higher in OE group. In the contrast, UE and OB groups showed similar risks of mortality and of cardiovascular and age-related eye diseases (all P > 0.05), though the UE group had significantly higher actBMI than OB group. In the GDES cohort, we further confirmed the potential of metabolic BMI (metBMI) fingerprints for risk stratification of cardiovascular diseases using a different metabolomic approach.Gaps of metBMI and actBMI identified novel metabolic subtypes, which exhibit distinctive cardiovascular and ocular risk profiles. The groups carrying obesity-related metabolites were at higher risk of mortality and morbidity than those with normal health metabolites. Metabolomics allowed for leveraging the future of diagnosis and management of 'healthily obese' and 'unhealthily lean' individuals.© 2023. The Author(s)."

These advances are beginning to define the dynamical principles of development across stages, tissues and organs, enabling a better understanding of human development before birth in health and disease, and potentially leading to improved treatments for infertility and developmental disorders. However, there are still significant roadblocks en route to this goal.

"37365340","Multiscale analysis of pangenomes enables improved representation of genomic diversity for repetitive and clinically relevant genes.","Nat Methods","Advancements in sequencing technologies and assembly methods enable the regular production of high-quality genome assemblies characterizing complex regions. However, challenges remain in efficiently interpreting variation at various scales, from smaller tandem repeats to megabase rearrangements, across many human genomes. We present a PanGenome Research Tool Kit (PGR-TK) enabling analyses of complex pangenome structural and haplotype variation at multiple scales. We apply the graph decomposition methods in PGR-TK to the class II major histocompatibility complex demonstrating the importance of the human pangenome for analyzing complicated regions. Moreover, we investigate the Y-chromosome genes, DAZ1/DAZ2/DAZ3/DAZ4, of which structural variants have been linked to male infertility, and X-chromosome genes OPN1LW and OPN1MW linked to eye disorders. We further showcase PGR-TK across 395 complex repetitive medically important genes. This highlights the power of PGR-TK to resolve complex variation in regions of the genome that were previously too complex to analyze.© 2023.

Focus on Melanoma.","Curr Oncol Rep","Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) demonstrated robust antitumor activity and tolerable safety in advanced melanoma. Data on long-term outcome of patients who benefited from this therapy and who are still free of progression despite ICI discontinuation is now available. We review here the characteristics of long-term ICI responders and address the critical question of cure.Long-term outcome of patients with metastatic melanoma enrolled in large phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials evaluating ICI in metastatic melanoma is now available. Durable responses, with more than 6 years of median follow-up, may persist after discontinuation. They occur more frequently in patients who achieved a complete response rather than in patients who had partial response or stable disease. Although long-term clinical benefit is more frequent in patients with high PDL-1 expression and smaller tumor burden, durable response may also be observed regardless of baseline characteristics. In patients with asymptomatic brain metastasis, combined immunotherapy (ipilimumab plus nivolumab) may also lead to long-term remission. Clinical trials confirm the durable antitumor activity of ICI. Although the hope for cure seems reasonable for many patients in this situation, late relapses may occur and no relapse-predictive biomarkers have been identified yet. Long-term responders who relapse can respond to a rechallenge of ICI although data are limited concerning the rate and the duration of this new response.© 2023.
