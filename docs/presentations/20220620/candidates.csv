"35704571","Tet2 coordinates with Foxo1 and Runx1 to balance T follicular helper cell and T helper 1 cell differentiation.","Sci Adv","In response to various types of infection, naïve CD4+T cells differentiate into diverse helper T cell subsets; however, the epigenetic programs that regulate differentiation in response to viral infection remain poorly understood. Demethylation of CpG dinucleotides by Tet methylcytosine dioxygenases is a key component of epigenetic programing that promotes specific gene expression, cellular differentiation, and function. We report that following viral infection, Tet2-deficient CD4+T cells preferentially differentiate into highly functional germinal center T follicular helper (TFH) cells that provide enhanced help for B cells. Using genome-wide DNA methylation and transcription factor binding analyses, we find that Tet2 coordinates with multiple transcription factors, including Foxo1 and Runx1, to mediate the demethylation and expression of target genes, including genes encoding repressors of TFHdifferentiation. Our findings establish Tet2 as an important regulator of TFHcell differentiation and reveal pathways that could be targeted to enhance immune responses against infectious disease."
"35703121","Nucleome programming is required for the foundation of totipotency in mammalian germline development.","EMBO J","Germ cells are unique in engendering totipotency, yet the mechanisms underlying this capacity remain elusive. Here, we perform comprehensive and in-depth nucleome analysis of mouse germ-cell development in vitro, encompassing pluripotent precursors, primordial germ cells (PGCs) before and after epigenetic reprogramming, and spermatogonia/spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Although epigenetic reprogramming, including genome-wide DNA de-methylation, creates broadly open chromatin with abundant enhancer-like signatures, the augmented chromatin insulation safeguards transcriptional fidelity. These insulatory constraints are then erased en masse for spermatogonial development. Notably, despite distinguishing epigenetic programming, including global DNA re-methylation, the PGCs-to-spermatogonia/SSCs development entails further euchromatization. This accompanies substantial erasure of lamina-associated domains, generating spermatogonia/SSCs with a minimal peripheral attachment of chromatin except for pericentromeres-an architecture conserved in primates. Accordingly, faulty nucleome maturation, including persistent insulation and improper euchromatization, leads to impaired spermatogenic potential. Given that PGCs after epigenetic reprogramming serve as oogenic progenitors as well, our findings elucidate a principle for the nucleome programming that creates gametogenic progenitors in both sexes, defining a basis for nuclear totipotency.© 2022 The Authors."
"35703085","DNA methylation in people with Anorexia Nervosa: Epigenome-wide patterns in actively ill, long-term remitted, and healthy-eater women.","World J Biol Psychiatry","Objectives:Recent studies have reported altered methylation levels at disorder-relevant DNA sites in people who are ill with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) compared to findings in people with no eating disorder (ED) or in whom AN has remitted. The preceding implies state-related influences upon gene expression in people with AN. The present study further examined this notion.Methods:We measured genome-wide DNA methylation in 145 women with active AN, 49 showing stable one-year remission of AN, and 64 with no ED.Results:Comparisons revealed 205 differentially methylated sites between active and no ED groups, and 162 differentially methylated sites between active and remitted groups (Q < 0.01). Probes tended to map onto genes relevant to psychiatric, metabolic and immune functions. Notably, several of the genes identified here as being differentially methylated in people with AN (e.g.,SYNJ2, PRKAG2, STAT3,CSGALNACT1, NEGR1,NR1H3) have figured in previous studies on AN. Effects also associated illness chronicity and lower BMI with more pronounced DNA methylation alterations, and remission of AN with normalization of DNA methylation.Conclusions:Findings corroborate earlier results suggesting reversible DNA methylation alterations in AN, and point to particular genes at which epigenetic mechanisms may act to shape AN phenomenology."
"35701666","Spatial heterogeneity in DNA methylation and chromosomal alterations in diffuse gliomas and meningiomas.","Mod Pathol","Adult-type diffuse gliomas and meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors of the central nervous system. DNA methylation profiling is a novel diagnostic technique increasingly used also in the clinic. Although molecular heterogeneity is well described in these tumors, DNA methylation heterogeneity is less studied. We therefore investigated the intratumor genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity in diffuse gliomas and meningiomas, with focus on potential clinical implications. We further investigated tumor purity as a source for heterogeneity in the tumors. We analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation profiles generated from 126 spatially separated tumor biopsies from 39 diffuse gliomas and meningiomas. Moreover, we evaluated five methods for measurement of tumor purity and investigated intratumor heterogeneity by assessing DNA methylation-based classification, chromosomal copy number alterations and molecular markers. Our results demonstrated homogeneous methylation-based classification of IDH-mutant gliomas and further corroborates subtype heterogeneity in glioblastoma IDH-wildtype and high-grade meningioma patients after excluding samples with low tumor purity. We detected a large number of differentially methylated CpG sites within diffuse gliomas and meningiomas, particularly in tumors of higher grades. The presence of CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion differed in one out of two patients with IDH-mutant astrocytomas, CNS WHO grade 4. We conclude that diffuse gliomas and high-grade meningiomas are characterized by intratumor heterogeneity, which should be considered in clinical diagnostics and in the assessment of methylation-based and molecular markers.© 2022.

"35700439","Epigenome-wide Association Study Identified VTI1A DNA Methylation Associated with Accelerometer-assessed Physical Activity.","Med Sci Sports Exerc","Health benefits of physical activity (PA) may be mediated by DNA methylation alterations. The purpose of the current study was to comprehensively identify CpG sites whose methylation levels were associated with accelerometer-assessed total PA in a general Japanese population.The study participants were from the baseline survey of Saga Japan Multi-institutional Collaborative Cohort. PA was objectively measured by a single-axis accelerometer for seven days. We employed a two-stage strategy. In the discovery stage, we performed a meta-analysis of two epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of total PA in 898 individuals (a combination of random sample [n = 507] and case-control study sample [n = 391]. Peripheral blood DNA methylation levels were measured using Infinium EPIC or HM450 arrays. In the replication stage, we subsequently examined whether CpG sites significantly associated (P < 1 × 10-5) with total PA were replicated in another sample (n = 1711), in which methylation levels were measured by pyrosequencing. A multiple linear regression was performed to determine the cross-sectional association between total PA and methylation levels with adjustment for potential confounders, including BMI. A fixed-effects model was used in the meta-analysis. Correlations between total PA-associated DNA methylation and several inflammatory markers, such as hs-CRP, were also conducted.In the meta-analysis, nine CpG sites were significantly associated with total PA (P < 1 × 10-5). Among the nine sites, one site cg07030336 (annotated to VTI1A/ZDHHC6 gene) was successfully replicated (P = 0.009).The current study showed that greater accelerometer-assessed total PA was associated with higher DNA methylation levels at cg07030336 (VTI1A/ZDHHC6) in the general population. Additionally, we found a divergent relationship between the methylation levels at cg07030336 and several inflammatory biomarkers.Copyright © 2022 by the American College of Sports Medicine."
"35700037","Association study between polymorphisms in DNA methylation-related genes and testicular germ cell tumor risk.","Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev","Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), histologically classified as seminomas and non-seminomas, are believed to arise from primordial gonocytes, with the maturation process blocked when are subjected to DNA methylation reprogramming. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA methylation machinery and folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism genes have been postulated to influence the proper establishment of DNA methylation.In this pathway-focused investigation we evaluated the association between 273 selected tag SNPs from 28 DNA methylation-related genes and TGCT risk. We carried out association analysis at individual SNP and gene-based level using summary statistics from the Genome Wide Association Study meta-analysis recently conducted by the international Testicular Cancer Consortium on 10,156 TGCT cases and 179,683 controls.In individual SNP analyses, seven SNPs, four mapping within MTHFR, were associated with TGCT risk after correction for multiple testing (q-value ≤.05). Queries of public databases showed that three of these SNPs were associated with MTHFR changes in enzymatic activity (rs1801133) or expression level in testis tissue (rs12121543, rs1476413). Gene-based analyses revealed MTHFR (q-value=8.4x10-4), MECP2 (q-value=2x10-3) and ZBTB4 (q-value=0.03) as the top TGCT-associated genes. Stratifying by tumor histology, four MTHFR SNPs were associated with seminoma. In gene-based analysis MTHFR was associated with risk of seminoma (q-value=2.8x10-4), but not with non-seminomatous tumors (q-value=0.22).Genetic variants within MTHFR, potentially having an impact on the DNA methylation pattern, are associated with TGCT risk.This finding suggests that TGCT pathogenesis could be associated to the folate cycle status, and this relation could be partly due to hereditary factors."
"35698272","A novel locus on 6p21.2 for cancer treatment-induced cardiac dysfunction among childhood cancer survivors.","J Natl Cancer Inst","Adult survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk of cardiac late effects.Using whole-genome sequencing data from 1,870 survivors of European ancestry in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE) study, genetic variants were examined for association with ejection fraction (EF) and clinically assessed cancer therapy-induced cardiac dysfunction (CCD). Significant findings were validated in 301 SJLIFE survivors of African ancestry and 4,020 survivors of European ancestry from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). All statistical tests were 2-sided.A variant near KCNK17 showed genome-wide significant association with EF (rs2815063-A: EF reduction = 1.6%; P = 2.1 × 10-8) in SJLIFE survivors of European ancestry, which replicated in SJLIFE survivors of African ancestry (EF reduction: 1.5%; P = .004). The rs2815063-A also showed a 1.80-fold (P = .008) risk of severe/disabling or life-threatening CCD and replicated in 4,020 CCSS survivors of European ancestry (OR = 1.40; P = .039). Notably, rs2815063-A was specifically associated among survivors exposed to doxorubicin only, with a stronger effect on EF (3.3% EF reduction) and CCD (2.97-fold). Whole blood DNA methylation data in 1,651 SJLIFE survivors of European ancestry showed significant correlation of rs2815063-A with dysregulation of KCNK17 enhancers (false discovery rate <5%), which replicated in 263 survivors of African ancestry. Consistently, the rs2815063-A was associated with KCNK17 downregulation based on RNA-sequencing of 75 survivors.Leveraging the two largest cohorts of childhood cancer survivors in North America and survivor-specific polygenomic functional data, we identified a novel risk locus for CCD which showed specificity with doxorubicin-induced cardiac dysfunction and highlighted dysregulation of KCNK17 as the likely molecular mechanism underlying this genetic association.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35697711","Genome-wide identification, in silico characterization and expression analysis of the RNA helicase gene family in chickpea (C. arietinum L.).","Sci Rep","The RNA helicases are an important class of enzymes which are known to influence almost every aspect of RNA metabolism. The majority of RNA helicases belong to the SF2 (superfamily 2) superfamily, members of which are further categorized into three separate subfamilies i.e., the DEAD, DEAH and DExD/H-box subfamilies. In chickpea, these RNA helicases have not been characterized until now. A genome-wide analysis across the chickpea genome led to the identification of a total of 150 RNA helicase genes which included 50 DEAD, 33 DEAH and 67 DExD/H-box genes. These were distributed across all the eight chromosomes, with highest number on chromosome 4 (26) and least on chromosome 8 (8). Gene duplication analysis resulted in identification of 15 paralogous gene pairs with Ka/Ks values < 1, indicating towards the genes being under purifying selection during the course of evolution. The promoter regions of the RNA helicase genes were enriched in cis-acting elements like the light and ABA-responsive elements. The drought responsiveness of the genes was analysed by studying the expression profiles of few of these genes, in two different genotypes, the cultivated variety ICC 8261 (kabuli, C. arietinum) and the wild accession ILWC 292 (C. reticulatum), through qRT-PCR. These genotypes were selected based on their drought responsiveness in a field experiment, where it was observed that the percentage (%) reduction in relative water content (RWC) and membrane stability index (MSI) for the drought stressed plants after withholding water for 24 days, over the control or well-watered plants, was least for both the genotypes. The genes CaDEAD50 and CaDExD/H66 were identified as drought-responsive RNA helicase genes in chickpea. The protein encoded by the CaDExD/H66 gene shares a high degree of homology with one of the CLSY (CLASSY) proteins of A. thaliana. We hypothesize that this gene could possibly be involved in regulation of DNA methylation levels in chickpea by regulating siRNA production, in conjunction with other proteins like the Argonaute, RNA dependent RNA polymerases and Dicer-like proteins.© 2022.

"35697274","Epigenetically-regulated miR-30a/c-5p directly target TWF1 and hamper ccRCC cell aggressiveness.","Transl Res","Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is highly prone to metastasize and displays an extremely low 5-year survival rate. Not only miRNAs (miRs) are key gene expression regulators but can also be epigenetically modified. Abnormal miR expression has been linked with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-driven ccRCC progression. MiR-30a/c-5p were found downregulated in ccRCC and associated with aggressiveness. Herein, we sought to unravel miR-30a/c-5p mechanistic role in ccRCC. RNA sequencing and genome-wide methylome data of ccRCC and normal tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were integrated to identify candidate miRs CpG loci deregulated in ccRCC. TargetScan was searched to identify miR putative targets. MiR-30a/c-5p expression and promoter methylation was evaluated in vitro, by PCR. Western blot, functional and luciferase assays were performed after cell transfection with either pre-miR, antimiR, or siRNA against TWF1. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed in ccRCC tissues. We found miR-30c-5p downregulation and aberrant promoter methylation in ccRCC tissues. In vitro studies revealed concomitant miR-30a/c-5p downregulation and increased promoter methylation, as well as a significant re-expression following decitabine treatment. Functional assays demonstrated that both miRs significantly decreased cell aggressiveness and the protein levels of EMT-promoting players, while upregulating epithelial markers, namely Claudin-1 and ZO-1. Importantly, we confirmed TWF1 as a direct target of both miRs, and its potential involvement in EMT/MET regulation. IHC analysis revealed higher TWF1 expression in primary tissues from patients that developed metastases, after surgical treatment. Our results implicate miR-30a/c-5p in ccRCC cells' aggressiveness attenuation by directly targeting TWF1 and hampering EMT.Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Inc."

In the present study, whole-genome CpG methylation in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) was analyzed to define the epigenetic changes in lymphocytes, which are the primary immune cells involved in NERD.Genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 27 NERD and 24 aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA) was subjected to bisulfate conversion and a methylation array. Quantitative CpG methylation, the β-values as a quantitative measure of DNA methylation, in lymphocytes were calculated after adjustments for cellular composition.Fifty-six hypermethylated and three hypomethylated differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) in PBLs in the NERD compared with ATA. The top 10 CpG loci predicted the methylation risk score, with a positive predictive value of 91.3%, a negative predictive value of 81.5% and an accuracy of 84.3%. As demonstrated in the nasal polyps, 30 DMCs were predicted to bind to the following 10 transcription factors, ranked in descending order: AP-2alphaA, TFII-1, STAT4, FOXP3, GR, c-Est-1, E2F-1, XBP1, ENKTF-1 and NF-1. Gene ontology analysis identified 13 categories such as regulation of T-helper 17 cell differentiation, including SMAD7 and NFKBIZ. PBLs in NERD contained no DMCs in genes associated with the prostaglandin and leukotriene pathways, which were found in ATA.PBLs in NERD form a unique pattern of DNA CpG methylation, and the combined analysis may provide predictive values for NERD.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Therefore, we investigated lifestyle effects on blood DNA methylation in participants of the LIFE-Adult study, a well-characterised population-based cohort from Germany.Lifestyle scores (LS) based on diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake were calculated in 4107 participants of the LIFE-Adult study. Fifty subjects with an extremely healthy lifestyle and 50 with an extremely unhealthy lifestyle (5th and 95th percentiles LS) were selected for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in blood samples employing Illumina Infinium® Methylation EPIC BeadChip system technology.Differences in DNA methylation patterns between body mass index groups (<25 vs. >30 kg/m2) were rather marginal compared to inter-lifestyle differences (0 vs. 145 differentially methylated positions [DMPs]), which identified 4682 differentially methylated regions (DMRs; false discovery rate [FDR <5%) annotated to 4426 unique genes. A DMR annotated to the glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 (GFPT2) locus showed the strongest hypomethylation (∼6.9%), and one annotated to glutamate rich 1 (ERICH1) showed the strongest hypermethylation (∼5.4%) in healthy compared to unhealthy lifestyle individuals. Intersection analysis showed that diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake equally contributed to the observed differences, which affected, among others, pathways related to glutamatergic synapses (adj. p < .01) and axon guidance (adj. p < .05). We showed that methylation age correlates with chronological age and waist-to-hip ratio with lower DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) acceleration distances in participants with healthy lifestyles. Finally, two identified top DMPs for the alanyl aminopeptidase (ANPEP) locus also showed the strongest expression quantitative trait methylation in blood.DNA methylation patterns help discriminate individuals with a healthy versus unhealthy lifestyle, which may mask subtle methylation differences derived from obesity.© 2022 The Authors.

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation may play a role in the sexual differences observed in diseases and other physiological traits.We performed a meta-analysis of the association of sex and cord blood DNA methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites in 8438 newborns from 17 cohorts participating in the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium. We also examined associations of child sex with DNA methylation in older children ages 5.5-10 years from 8 cohorts (n = 4268).In newborn blood, sex was associated at Bonferroni level significance with differences in DNA methylation at 46,979 autosomal CpG sites (p < 1.3 × 10-7) after adjusting for white blood cell proportions and batch. Most of those sites had lower methylation levels in males than in females. Of the differentially methylated CpG sites identified in newborn blood, 68% (31,727) met look-up level significance (p < 1.1 × 10-6) in older children and had methylation differences in the same direction.This is a large-scale meta-analysis examining sex differences in DNA methylation in newborns and older children. Expanding upon previous studies, we replicated previous findings and identified additional autosomal sites with sex-specific differences in DNA methylation.

We demonstrated that R-loops contribute to DNA damages in DNMT3b knockout and ICF cells. More prominent DNA damage signal in DNMT3b knockout cells was due to the loss of DNMT3b expression and the acquirement of p53 mutation. Genome-wide ChIP-sequencing mapped DNA damage sites at satellite repetitive DNA sequences including (peri-)centromere regions. However, the steady-state levels of (peri-)centromeric R-loops were reduced in DNMT3b knockout and ICF cells. Our analysis indicates that XPG and XPF endonucleases-mediated cleavages remove (peri-)centromeric R-loops to generate DNA beaks, causing chromosome instability. DNMT3b dysfunctions clearly increase R-loops susceptibility to the cleavage process. Finally, we showed that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in centromere are probably repaired by error-prone end-joining pathway in ICF cells. Thus, DNMT3 dysfunctions undermine the integrity of centromere by R-loop-mediated DNA damages and repair.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was conducted and the global DNA methylation dynamics were mapped. Generally, CGs had a higher DNA methylation level than CHHs and CHGs, and tail-fat tissues had higher CG methylation levels than muscle tissues. For DNA repeat elements, SINE had the highest methylation level, while Simple had the lowest. When dividing the gene promoter region into small bins (200 bp per bin), the bins near the transcription start site (±200 bp) had the highest CG count per bin but the lowest DNA methylation levels. A series of DMRs were identified in muscle and tail-fat tissues between the two breeds. Among them, the introns of geneCAMK2D(calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II δ) demonstrated significant DNA methylation level differences between the two breeds in both muscle and tail-fat tissues, and it may play a crucial role in fat metabolism and meat quality traits. This study may provide basic datasets and references for further epigenetic modification studies during sheep genetic improvement."

Six Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms were utilized for the diagnosis of AD while enrichment analysis was used to elucidate the pathogenesis of AD.A total of 3684 CpGs were significantly (adj.p-value &lt; 0.05) differentially methylated in AD versus controls. All six AI algorithms achieved high predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.949-0.998) in an independent test group. As an example, Deep Learning (DL) achieved an AUC (95% CI) = 0.99 (0.95-1.0), with 94.5% sensitivity and specificity.We describe numerous epigenetically altered genes which were previously reported to be differentially expressed in the brain of AD sufferers. Genes identified by AI to be the best predictors of AD were either known to be expressed in the brain or have been previously linked to AD. We highlight enrichment in the Calcium signaling pathway, Glutamatergic synapse, Hedgehog signaling pathway, Axon guidance and Olfactory transduction in AD sufferers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported genome-wide DNA methylation study using cfDNA to detect AD."

American Indian communities have a high burden of lung disease compared to the national average. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of DNAm and lung function in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). We conducted a cross-sectional study of American Indian adults, 45-74 years of age who participated in the SHS. DNAm was measured using the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC platform at baseline (1989-1991). Lung function was measured via spirometry, including forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), at visit 2 (1993-1995). Airflow limitation was defined as FEV1 < 70% predicted and FEV1/FVC < 0.7, restriction was defined as FEV1/FVC > 0.7 and FVC < 80% predicted, and normal spirometry was defined as FEV1/FVC > 0.7, FEV1 > 70% predicted, FVC > 80% predicted. We used elastic-net models to select relevant CpGs for lung function and spirometry-defined lung disease. We also conducted bioinformatic analyses to evaluate the biological plausibility of the findings.Among 1677 participants, 21.2% had spirometry-defined airflow limitation and 13.6% had spirometry-defined restrictive pattern lung function. Elastic-net models selected 1118 Differentially Methylated Positions (DMPs) as predictors of airflow limitation and 1385 for restrictive pattern lung function. A total of 12 DMPs overlapped between airflow limitation and restrictive pattern. EGFR, MAPK1 and PRPF8 genes were the most connected nodes in the protein-protein interaction network. Many of the DMPs targeted genes with biological roles related to lung function such as protein kinases.We found multiple differentially methylated CpG sites associated with chronic lung disease. These signals could contribute to better understand molecular mechanisms involved in lung disease, as assessed systemically, as well as to identify patterns that could be useful for diagnostic purposes. Further experimental and longitudinal studies are needed to assess whether DNA methylation has a causal role in lung disease.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35681050","Genetic, parental and lifestyle factors influence telomere length.","Commun Biol","The average length of telomere repeats (TL) declines with age and is considered to be a marker of biological ageing. Here, we measured TL in six blood cell types from 1046 individuals using the clinically validated Flow-FISH method. We identified remarkable cell-type-specific variations in TL. Host genetics, environmental, parental and intrinsic factors such as sex, parental age, and smoking are associated to variations in TL. By analysing the genome-wide methylation patterns, we identified that the association of maternal, but not paternal, age to TL is mediated by epigenetics. Single-cell RNA-sequencing data for 62 participants revealed differential gene expression in T-cells. Genes negatively associated with TL were enriched for pathways related to translation and nonsense-mediated decay. Altogether, this study addresses cell-type-specific differences in telomere biology and its relation to cell-type-specific gene expression and highlights how perinatal factors play a role in determining TL, on top of genetics and lifestyle.© 2022.

Here, we investigate matched genotype and methylation profiles of primary chondrocytes from macroscopically intact (low-grade) and degraded (high-grade) osteoarthritis cartilage and from synoviocytes collected from 98 osteoarthritis-affected individuals undergoing knee replacement surgery. We perform an epigenome-wide association study of knee cartilage degeneration and report robustly replicating methylation markers, which reveal an etiologic mechanism linked to the migration of epithelial cells. Using machine learning, we derive methylation models of cartilage degeneration, which we validate with 82% accuracy in independent data. We report a genome-wide methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) map of articular cartilage and synovium and identify 18 disease-grade-specific mQTLs in osteoarthritis cartilage. We resolve osteoarthritis GWAS loci through causal inference and colocalization analyses and decipher the epigenetic mechanisms that mediate the effect of genotype on disease risk.

"35679710","Kaempferol antagonizes adipogenesis by repressing histone H3K4 methylation at PPARγ target genes.","Biochem Biophys Res Commun","We previously demonstrated that kaempferol, a flavonoid present in various herbs, inhibits adipogenesis by repressing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activity. Here, we focused on elucidation of the underlying mechanism using genome-wide tools. First, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed downregulation of genes involved in adipogenesis in response to kaempferol. Subsequent ChIP assays revealed that kaempferol regulates the expression of adipogenic (Adipoq, Fabp4, Lpl) genes by modulating enrichment of active H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 histone codes on target promoters. Second, we performed ChIP sequencing analysis of active H3K4me3, and co-analysis with RNA-seq identified PPARγ responsive sites in genes downregulated by kaempferol, in terms of expression and H3K4me3 deposition. Third, direct kaempferol binding to PPARγ, for which the KDvalue was 44.54 μM, was determined by microscale thermophoresis. Further RT-qPCR and GST pull-down assays demonstrated that kaempferol antagonizes rosiglitazone-induced PPARγ activation and impairs the rosiglitazone-dependent interaction between PPARγ and its coactivator CBP. Overall, our data suggest that kaempferol, as a PPARγ antagonist, mediates epigenetic repression of lipid accumulation by regulating histone methylation, and could serve as a candidate epigenetic drug to treat obesity-related diseases.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Sex and age also exhibit substantial associations with genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) differences in humans. Using a random sample of Illumina EPIC-based genome-wide methylomes from peripheral whole blood of 1,976 parents, participating in The Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), we explored whether DNAm in genes linked to SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry and to severe COVID-19 were associated with sex and age. This was carried out by testing 1,572 DNAm sites (CpGs) located near 45 genes for associations with age and sex. We found that DNAm in 281 and 231 of 1,572 CpGs were associated (pFDR<0.01) with sex and aging, respectively. CpGs linked to SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry genes were all associated with age and sex, except for the ACE2 receptor gene (located on the X-chromosome), which was only associated with sex (pFDR<0.01). Furthermore, we examined whether 1,487 autosomal CpGs associated with host-cell entry and severe COVID-19 were more or less associated with sex and age than what would be expected from the same number of randomly sampled genome-wide CpGs. We found that the CpGs associated with host-cell entry and severe COVID-19 were not more or less associated with sex (R2 = 0.77, p = 0.09) than the CpGs sampled from random genomic regions; age was actually found to be significantly less so (R2 = 0.36, p = 0.04). Hence, while we found wide-spread associations between sex and age at CpGs linked to genes implicated with SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry and severe COVID-19, the effect from the sum of these CpGs was not stronger than that from randomly sampled CpGs; for age it was significantly less so. These findings could suggest that advanced age and male sex may not be unsurmountable barriers for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to evolve increased infectiousness."
"35677240","Transcriptome-Wide Characterization of Alkaloids and Chlorophyll Biosynthesis in Lotus Plumule.","Front Plant Sci","Lotus plumule is a green tissue in the middle of seeds that predominantly accumulates bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids (bis-BIAs) and chlorophyll (Chl). However, the biosynthetic mechanisms of these two metabolites remain largely unknown in lotus. This study used physiological and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) approaches to characterize the development and molecular mechanisms of bis-BIAs and Chl biosynthesis in lotus plumule. Physiological analysis revealed that exponential plumule growth occurred between 9 and 15 days after pollination (DAP), which coincided with the onset of bis-BIAs biosynthesis and its subsequent rapid accumulation. Transcriptome analysis of lotus plumule identified a total of 8,725 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), representing ~27.7% of all transcripts in the lotus genome. Sixteen structural DEGs, potentially associated with bis-BIAs biosynthesis, were identified. Of these, 12 encodedO-methyltransferases (OMTs) are likely involved in the methylation and bis-BIAs diversity in lotus. In addition, functionally divergent paralogous and redundant homologous gene members of the BIAs biosynthesis pathway, as well as transcription factors co-expressed with bis-BIAs and Chl biosynthesis genes, were identified. Twenty-two genes encoding 16 conserved enzymes of the Chl biosynthesis pathway were identified, with the majority being significantly upregulated by Chl biosynthesis. Photosynthesis and Chl biosynthesis pathways were simultaneously activated during lotus plumule development. Moreover, our results showed that light-driven Pchlide reduction is essential for Chl biosynthesis in the lotus plumule. These results will be useful for enhancing our understanding of alkaloids and Chl biosynthesis in plants.Copyright © 2022 Sun, Song, Deng, Liu, Yang, Zhang, Wang, Xin, Chen, Liu and Yang."
"35675764","A TET1-PSPC1-Neat1 molecular axis modulates PRC2 functions in controlling stem cell bivalency.","Cell Rep","TET1 maintains hypomethylation at bivalent promoters through its catalytic activity in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, TET1 catalytic activity-independent function in regulating bivalent genes is not well understood. Using a proteomics approach, we map the TET1 interactome in ESCs and identify PSPC1 as a TET1 partner. Genome-wide location analysis reveals that PSPC1 functionally associates with TET1 and Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2). We establish that PSPC1 and TET1 repress, and the lncRNA Neat1 activates, bivalent gene expression. In ESCs, Neat1 is preferentially bound to PSPC1 alongside its PRC2 association at bivalent promoters. During the ESC-to-epiblast-like stem cell (EpiLC) transition, PSPC1 and TET1 maintain PRC2 chromatin occupancy at bivalent gene promoters, while Neat1 facilitates the activation of certain bivalent genes by promoting PRC2 binding to their mRNAs. Our study demonstrates a TET1-PSPC1-Neat1 molecular axis that modulates PRC2-binding affinity to chromatin and bivalent gene transcripts in controlling stem cell bivalency.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

"35674491","METTL18-mediated histidine methylation of RPL3 modulates translation elongation for proteostasis maintenance.","Elife","Protein methylation occurs predominantly on lysine and arginine residues, but histidine also serves as a methylation substrate. However, a limited number of enzymes responsible for this modification have been reported. Moreover, the biological role of histidine methylation has remained poorly understood to date. Here, we report that human METTL18 is a histidine methyltransferase for the ribosomal protein RPL3 and that the modification specifically slows ribosome traversal on Tyr codons, allowing the proper folding of synthesized proteins. By performing an in vitro methylation assay with a methyl donor analog and quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that His245 of RPL3 is methylated at the τ-Nposition by METTL18. Structural comparison of the modified and unmodified ribosomes showed stoichiometric modification and suggested a role in translation reactions. Indeed, genome-wide ribosome profiling and an in vitro translation assay revealed that translation elongation at Tyr codons was suppressed by RPL3 methylation. Because the slower elongation provides enough time for nascent protein folding, RPL3 methylation protects cells from the cellular aggregation of Tyr-rich proteins. Our results reveal histidine methylation as an example of a ribosome modification that ensures proteome integrity in cells."

Here, we present a mega-analysis of 14 publicly available placenta DNA methylation (DNAm) microarray datasets to identify individual CpGs and regions associated with fetal sex. In the discovery dataset of placentas from full term pregnancies (N = 532 samples), 5212 CpGs met genome-wide significance (p < 1E-8) and were enriched in pathways such as keratinization (FDR p-value = 7.37E-14), chemokine activity (FDR p-value = 1.56E-2), and eosinophil migration (FDR p-value = 1.83E-2). Nine differentially methylated regions were identified (fwerArea < 0.1) including a region in the promoter of ZNF300 that showed consistent differential DNAm in samples from earlier timepoints in pregnancy and appeared to be driven predominately by effects in the trophoblast cell type. We describe the largest study of fetal sex differences in placenta DNAm performed to date, revealing genes and pathways characterizing sex-specific placenta function and health outcomes later in life.© 2022.

"35670920","Prenatal Maternal Smoke, DNA Methylation, and Multi-omics of Tissues and Child Health.","Curr Environ Health Rep","Maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy is of public health concern, and understanding the biological mechanisms can help to promote smoking cessation campaigns. This non-systematic review focuses on the effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on offspring's epigenome, consistent in chemical modifications of the genome that regulate gene expression.Recent meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies have shown that maternal smoking during pregnancy is consistently associated with offspring's DNA methylation changes, both in the placenta and blood. These studies indicate that effects on blood DNA methylation can persist for years, and that the longer the duration of the exposure and the higher the dose, the larger the effects. Hence, DNA methylation scores have been developed to estimate past exposure to maternal smoking during pregnancy as biomarkers. There is robust evidence for DNA methylation alterations associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy; however, the role of sex, ethnicity, and genetic background needs further exploration. Moreover, there are no conclusive studies about exposure to low doses or during the preconception period. Similarly, studies on tissues other than the placenta and blood are scarce, and cell-type specificity within tissues needs further investigation. In addition, biological interpretation of DNA methylation findings requires multi-omics data, poorly available in epidemiological settings. Finally, although several mediation analyses link DNA methylation changes with health outcomes, they do not allow causal inference. For this, a combination of data from multiple study designs will be essential in the future to better address this topic.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35670129","Arabidopsis HEAT SHOCK FACTOR BINDING PROTEIN is required to limit meiotic crossovers and HEI10 transcription.","EMBO J","The number of meiotic crossovers is tightly controlled and most depend on pro-crossover ZMM proteins, such as the E3 ligase HEI10. Despite the importance of HEI10 dosage for crossover formation, how HEI10 transcription is controlled remains unexplored. In a forward genetic screen using a fluorescent crossover reporter in Arabidopsis thaliana, we identify heat shock factor binding protein (HSBP) as a repressor of HEI10 transcription and crossover numbers. Using genome-wide crossover mapping and cytogenetics, we show that hsbp mutations or meiotic HSBP knockdowns increase ZMM-dependent crossovers toward the telomeres, mirroring the effects of HEI10 overexpression. Through RNA sequencing, DNA methylome, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we reveal that HSBP is required to repress HEI10 transcription by binding with heat shock factors (HSFs) at the HEI10 promoter and maintaining DNA methylation over the HEI10 5' untranslated region. Our findings provide insights into how the temperature response regulator HSBP restricts meiotic HEI10 transcription and crossover number by attenuating HSF activity.© 2022 The Authors."
"35592546","The EWAS Catalog: a database of epigenome-wide association studies.","Wellcome Open Res","Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) seek to quantify associations between traits/exposures and DNA methylation measured at thousands or millions of CpG sites across the genome. In recent years, the increase in availability of DNA methylation measures in population-based cohorts and case-control studies has resulted in a dramatic expansion of the number of EWAS being performed and published. To make this rich source of results more accessible, we have manually curated a database of CpG-trait associations (with p<1x10-4) from published EWAS, each assaying over 100,000 CpGs in at least 100 individuals. From January 7, 2022, The EWAS Catalog contained 1,737,746 associations from 2,686 EWAS. This includes 1,345,398 associations from 342 peer-reviewed publications. In addition, it also contains summary statistics for 392,348 associations from 427 EWAS, performed on data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The database is accompanied by a web-based tool and R package, giving researchers the opportunity to query EWAS associations quickly and easily, and gain insight into the molecular underpinnings of disease as well as the impact of traits and exposures on the DNA methylome. The EWAS Catalog data extraction team continue to update the database monthly and we encourage any EWAS authors to upload their summary statistics to our website.

"35665255","DNA Methylation Mediates the Association Between Individual and Neighborhood Social Disadvantage and Cardiovascular Risk Factors.","Front Cardiovasc Med","Low socioeconomic status (SES) and living in a disadvantaged neighborhood are associated with poor cardiovascular health. Multiple lines of evidence have linked DNA methylation to both cardiovascular risk factors and social disadvantage indicators. However, limited research has investigated the role of DNA methylation in mediating the associations of individual- and neighborhood-level disadvantage with multiple cardiovascular risk factors in large, multi-ethnic, population-based cohorts. We examined whether disadvantage at the individual level (childhood and adult SES) and neighborhood level (summary neighborhood SES as assessed by Census data and social environment as assessed by perceptions of aesthetic quality, safety, and social cohesion) were associated with 11 cardiovascular risk factors including measures of obesity, diabetes, lipids, and hypertension in 1,154 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). For significant associations, we conducted epigenome-wide mediation analysis to identify methylation sites mediating the relationship between individual/neighborhood disadvantage and cardiovascular risk factors using the JT-Comp method that assesses sparse mediation effects under a composite null hypothesis. In models adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, medication use, and genetic principal components of ancestry, epigenetic mediation was detected for the associations of adult SES with body mass index (BMI), insulin, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), as well as for the association between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and HDL-C at FDRq< 0.05. The 410 CpG mediators identified for the SES-BMI association were enriched for CpGs associated with gene expression (expression quantitative trait methylation loci, or eQTMs), and corresponding genes were enriched in antigen processing and presentation pathways. For cardiovascular risk factors other than BMI, most of the epigenetic mediators lost significance after controlling for BMI. However, 43 methylation sites showed evidence of mediating the neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and HDL-C association after BMI adjustment. The identified mediators were enriched for eQTMs, and corresponding genes were enriched in inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Our findings support the hypothesis that DNA methylation acts as a mediator between individual- and neighborhood-level disadvantage and cardiovascular risk factors, and shed light on the potential underlying epigenetic pathways. Future studies are needed to fully elucidate the biological mechanisms that link social disadvantage to poor cardiovascular health.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Zhao, Ammous, Song, Du, Shang, Ratliff, Moore, Kelly, Needham, Diez Roux, Liu, Butler, Kardia, Mukherjee, Zhou and Smith."
"35661211","Altered Hydroxymethylome in the substantia Nigra of Parkinson's disease.","Hum Mol Genet","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, and aging and genetic and environmental exposure can contribute to its pathogenesis. DNA methylation has been suggested to play a pivotal role in neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is generated through 5-methylcytosine (5mC) oxidization by ten-eleven translocation proteins and is particularly enriched in the brain. Although 5hmC has been linked to multiple neurological disorders, little is known about 5hmC alterations in the substantia nigra of patients with PD. To determine the specific alterations in DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in PD brain samples, we examined the genome-wide profiles of 5mC and 5hmC in the substantia nigra of patients with PD and Alzheimer's disease (ad). We identified 4119 differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) and no differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in the postmortem brains of patients with PD compared with those of controls. These DhMRs were PD-specific when compared to the results of ad. Gene ontology analysis revealed that several signaling pathways, such as neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, were significantly enriched in PD DhMRs. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed substantial alterations in multiple signaling pathways, including phospholipase D (PLD), cAMP, and Rap1. In addition, using a PD Drosophila model, we found that one of the 5hmC-modulated genes, PLD1, modulated α-synuclein toxicity. Our analysis suggested that 5hmC may act as an independent epigenetic marker and contribute to the pathogenesis of PD.© The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Terpenoid compounds, particularly monoterpenes (C10) and sesquiterpenes, are the most important and abundant among these active substances (C15). Terpenes play a variety of roles and have beneficial biological properties in plants. With these considerations, the current study sought to clone theNAD+-dependent farnesol dehydrogenase (SoFLDH, EC: 1.1.1.354) gene from S. officinalis. Functional analysis revealed that, SoFLDH has an open reading frame of 2,580 base pairs that encodes 860 amino acids.SoFLDH has two conserved domains and four types of highly conserved motifs: YxxxK, RXR, RR (X8) W, TGxxGhaG. However, SoFLDH was cloned from Salvia officinalis leaves and functionally overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate its role in sesquiterpenoid synthases. In comparison to the transgenic plants, the wild-type plants showed a slight delay in growth and flowering formation. To this end, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that SoFLDH transgenic plants were responsible for numerous forms of terpene synthesis, particularly sesquiterpene. These results provide a base for further investigation on SoFLDH gene role and elucidating the regulatory mechanisms for sesquiterpene synthesis in S. offcinalis. And our study paves the way for the future metabolic engineering of the biosynthesis of useful terpene compounds in S. offcinalis."
"35655223","Genome-wide DNA methylation reveals potential epigenetic mechanism of age-dependent viral susceptibility in grass carp.","Immun Ageing","Grass carp are an important farmed fish in China that are infected by many pathogens, especially grass carp reovirus (GCRV). Notably, grass carp showed age-dependent susceptibility to GCRV; that is, grass carp not older than one year were sensitive to GCRV, while those over three years old were resistant to this virus. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, whole genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression variations between susceptible five-month-old (FMO) and resistant three-year-old (TYO) grass carp were investigated aiming to uncover potential epigenetic mechanisms.Colorimetric quantification revealed that the global methylation level in TYO fish was higher than that in FMO fish. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of the two groups revealed 6214 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 4052 differentially methylated genes (DMGs), with most DMRs and DMGs showing hypermethylation patterns in TYO fish. Correlation analysis revealed that DNA hypomethylation in promoter regions and DNA hypermethylation in gene body regions were associated with gene expression. Enrichment analysis revealed that promoter hypo-DMGs in TYO fish were significantly enriched in typical immune response pathways, whereas gene body hyper-DMGs in TYO fish were significantly enriched in terms related to RNA transcription, biosynthesis, and energy production. RNA-seq analysis of the corresponding samples indicated that most of the genes in the above terms were upregulated in TYO fish. Moreover, gene function analysis revealed that the two genes involved in energy metabolism displayed antiviral effects.Collectively, these results revealed genome-wide variations in DNA methylation between grass carp of different ages. DNA methylation and gene expression variations in genes involved in immune response, biosynthesis, and energy production may contribute to age-dependent susceptibility to GCRV in grass carp. Our results provide important information for disease-resistant breeding programs for grass carp and may also benefit research on age-dependent diseases in humans.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35654772","Accelerated epigenetic aging in suicide attempters uninfluenced by high intent-to-die and choice of lethal methods.","Transl Psychiatry","Suicide attempts (SA) are associated with excess non-suicidal mortality, putatively mediated in part by premature cellular senescence. Epigenetic age (EA) estimators of biological age have been previously demonstrated to strongly predict physiological dysregulation and mortality risk. Herein, we investigate if violent SA with high intent-to-die is predictive of epigenetics-derived estimates of biological aging. The genome-wide methylation pattern was measured using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip in whole blood of 88 suicide attempters. Subjects were stratified into two groups based on the putative risk of later committed suicide (low- [n = 58] and high-risk [n = 30]) in dependency of SA method (violent or non-violent) and/or intent-to-die (high/low). Estimators of intrinsic and extrinsic EA acceleration, one marker optimized to predict physiological dysregulation (DNAmPhenoAge/AgeAccelPheno) and one optimized to predict lifespan (DNAmGrimAge/AgeAccelGrim) were investigated for associations to severity of SA, by univariate and multivariate analyses. The study was adequately powered to detect differences of 2.2 years in AgeAccelGrim in relation to SA severity. Baseline DNAmGrimAge exceeded chronological age by 7.3 years on average across all samples, conferring a mean 24.6% increase in relation to actual age. No individual EA acceleration marker was differentiated by suicidal risk group (p > 0.1). Thus, SA per se but not severity of SA is related to EA, implicating that excess non-suicidal mortality in SA is unrelated to risk of committed suicide. Preventative healthcare efforts aimed at curtailing excess mortality after SA may benefit from acting equally powerful to recognize somatic comorbidities irrespective of the severity inherent in the act itself.© 2022.

"35654255","Epigenome-wide DNA methylation signature of plasma zinc and their mediation roles in the association of zinc with lung cancer risk.","Environ Pollut","Essential trace element zinc is associated with decreased lung cancer risk, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate role of DNA methylation in zinc-lung cancer association. We conducted a case-cohort study within prospective Dongfeng-Tongji cohort, including 359 incident lung cancer cases and a randomly selected sub-cohort of 1399 participants. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was used to examine association of plasma zinc with DNA methylation in peripheral blood. For the zinc-related CpGs, their mediation effects on zinc-lung cancer association were assessed; their diagnostic performance for lung cancer was testified in the case-cohort study and further validated in another 126 pairs of lung cancer case-control study. We identified 28 CpGs associated with plasma zinc at P < 1.0 × 10-5and seven of them (cg07077080, cg01077808, cg17749033, cg15554270, cg26125625, cg10669424, and cg15409013 annotated to GSR, CALR3, SLC16A3, PHLPP2, SLC12A8, VGLL4, and ADAMTS16, respectively) were associated with incident risk of lung cancer. Moreover, the above seven CpGs were differently methylated between 126 pairs of lung cancer and adjacent normal lung tissues and had the same directions with EWAS of zinc. They could mediate a separate 7.05%∼22.65% and a joint 29.42% of zinc-lung cancer association. Compared to using traditional factors, addition of methylation risk score exerted improved discriminations for lung cancer both in case-cohort study [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.818 vs. 0.738] and in case-control study (AUC = 0.816 vs. 0.646).

Defining epigenomic biomarkers of lifelong CVH exposure and understanding their roles in CVD development may help develop preventive and therapeutic strategies for CVD.In 1085 CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) participants, we defined a clinical cumulative CVH score that combines body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and fasting glucose measured longitudinally from young adulthood through middle age over 20 years (mean age, 25-45). Blood DNA methylation at >840 000 methylation markers was measured twice over 5 years (mean age, 40 and 45). Epigenome-wide association analyses on the cumulative CVH score were performed in CARDIA and compared in the FHS (Framingham Heart Study). We used penalized regression to build a methylation-based risk score to evaluate the risk of incident coronary artery calcification and clinical CVD events.We identified 45 methylation markers associated with cumulative CVH at false discovery rate <0.01 (P=4.7E-7-5.8E-17) in CARDIA and replicated in FHS. These associations were more pronounced with methylation measured at an older age.CPT1A,ABCG1, andSREBF1appeared as the most prominent genes. The 45 methylation markers were mostly located in transcriptionally active chromatin and involved lipid metabolism, insulin secretion, and cytokine production pathways. Three methylation markers located in genesSARS1,SOCS3, andLINC-PINTstatistically mediated 20.4% of the total effect between CVH and risk of incident coronary artery calcification. The methylation risk score added information and significantly (P=0.004) improved the discrimination capacity of coronary artery calcification status versus CVH score alone and showed association with risk of incident coronary artery calcification 5 to 10 years later independent of cumulative CVH score (odds ratio, 1.87;P=9.66E-09). The methylation risk score was also associated with incident clinical CVD in FHS (hazard ratio, 1.28;P=1.22E-05).Cumulative CVH from young adulthood contributes to midlife epigenetic programming over time. Our findings demonstrate the role of epigenetic markers in response to CVH changes and highlight the potential of epigenomic markers for precision CVD prevention, and earlier detection of subclinical CVD, as well."

Here, we found a pure culture designated PheN4, which was affiliated with Virgibacillus halodenitrificans and could degrade phenanthrene with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor and a wide range of salinities (from 0.3% to 20%) under anaerobic environments. The optimal salinity for biodegradation of phenanthrene by PheN4 was 5%, which could degrade 93.5% of 0.62 ± 0.04 mM phenanthrene within 10 days with the initial inoculum of 0.01 gVSS/L. Meanwhile, an increased microbial amount could efficiently promote the phenanthrene biodegradation rate. The metabolic processes of anaerobic phenanthrene biodegradation under hypersaline conditions by PheN4 were proposed based on intermediates and genome analyses. Phenanthrene was initially activated via methylation to form 2-methylphenanthrene. Next, fumarate addition and β-oxidation or direct oxidation of the methyl group, ring reduction and ring cleavage were identified as the midstream and downstream steps. In addition, PheN4 could utilize benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene as carbon sources, but Benz[a]anthracene, pyrene, and Benzo[a]pyrene could not be biodegraded by PheN4. This study could provide some guidance for the bioremediation of PAH pollutants in anaerobic and hypersaline zones.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Here, an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed in a sample of 76 OCD patients of European ancestry (37 women, age ± SD: 33.51 ± 10.92 years) and 76 sex- and age-matched healthy controls for the first time using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip. After quality control, nine epigenome-wide significant quantitative trait methylation sites (QTMs) and 21 suggestive hits were discerned in the final sample of 68 patients and 68 controls. The top hit (cg24159721) and four other significant QTMs (cg11894324, cg01070250, cg11330075, cg15174812) map to the region of the microRNA 12136 gene (MIR12136). Two additional significant CpG sites (cg05740793, cg20450977) are located in the flanking region of the MT-RNR2 (humanin) like 8 gene (MT-RNRL8), while two further QTMs (cg16267121, cg15890734) map to the regions of the MT-RNR2 (humanin) like 3 (MT-RNRL3) and MT-RNR2 (humanin) like 2 (MT-RNRL2) genes.

"35639959","DNMT3A mutations define a unique biological and prognostic subgroup associated with cytotoxic T-cells in PTCL-NOS.","Blood","Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are heterogenous T-cell neoplasms often associated with epigenetic dysregulation. We investigated de novo DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) mutations in common PTCL entities, including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and novel molecular subtypes identified within PTCL-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) designated as PTCL-GATA3 and PTCL-TBX21. DNMT3A-mutated PTCL-TBX21 cases showed inferior overall-survival, with DNMT3A mutated residues skewed towards the methyltransferase domain and dimerization motif (S881-R887). Transcriptional profiling demonstrated significant enrichment of activated CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic gene signatures in the DNMT3A-mutantPTCL-TBX21 cases, which was further validated using immunohistochemistry. Genome-wide methylation analysis of DNMT3A-mutantversus wild-type PTCL-TBX21 cases demonstrated hypomethylation in target genes regulating IFN-g, TCR signaling and EOMES, a master transcriptional regulator of cytotoxic effector cells. Similar findings were observed in a murine model of PTCL with Dnmt3a loss (in-vivo) and further validated in-vitro by ectopic expression of DNMT3A-mutants (DNMT3A-R882, -Q886, -V716, versus WT) in CD8+T-cell line, resulting in T-cell activation and EOMES upregulation. Furthermore, stable, ectopic expression of the DNMT3A-mutants in primary CD3+ T-cell cultures resulted in the preferential outgrowth of CD8+ T-cells with DNMT3AR882H mutation. Single-cell-RNA-seq analysis of CD3+ T-cells revealed differential CD8+ T-cell subset polarization, mirroring findings in DNMT3A-mutated PTCL-TBX21 and validating the cytotoxic and T-cell memory transcriptional programs associated with the DNMT3AR882H mutation. Our findings indicate that DNMT3A mutations define a cytotoxic subset in PTCL-TBX21 with prognostic significance, thus may further refine pathological heterogeneity in PTCL-NOS and suggest alternative treatment strategies for this subset.Copyright © 2022 American Society of Hematology."
"35637626","DNA methylation profiling of central nervous system hemangioblastomas identifies two distinct subgroups.","Brain Pathol","Hemangioblastomas (HBs) of the central nervous system are highly vascular neoplasms that occur sporadically or as a manifestation of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Despite their benign nature, HBs are clinically heterogeneous and can be associated with significant morbidity due to mass effects of peritumoral cysts or tumor progression. Underlying molecular factors involved in HB tumor biology remain elusive. We investigated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles and clinical and histopathological features in a series of 47 HBs from 42 patients, including 28 individuals with VHL disease. Thirty tumors occurred in the cerebellum, 8 in the brainstem and 8 HBs were of spinal location, while 1 HB was located in the cerebrum. Histologically, 12 HBs (26%) belonged to the cellular subtype and exclusively occurred in the cerebellum, whereas 35 HBs were reticular (74%). Unsupervised clustering and dimensionality reduction of DNA methylation profiles revealed two distinct subgroups. Methylation cluster 1 comprised 30 HBs of mainly cerebellar location (29/30, 97%), whereas methylation cluster 2 contained 17 HBs predominantly located in non-cerebellar compartments (16/17, 94%). The sum of chromosomal regions being affected by copy-number alterations was significantly higher in methylation cluster 1 compared to cluster 2 (mean 262 vs. 109 Mb, p = 0.001). Of note, loss of chromosome 6 occurred in 9/30 tumors (30%) of methylation cluster 1 and was not observed in cluster 2 tumors (p = 0.01). No relevant methylation differences between sporadic and VHL-related HBs or cystic and non-cystic HBs could be detected. Deconvolution of the bulk DNA methylation profiles revealed four methylation components that were associated with the two methylation clusters suggesting cluster-specific cell-type compositions. In conclusion, methylation profiling of HBs reveals 2 distinct subgroups that mainly associate with anatomical location, cytogenetic profiles and differences in cell type composition, potentially reflecting different cells of origin.© 2022 The Authors.

"35635730","The dynamics of methylation of CpG sites associated with SLE subtypes in a longitudinal cohort.","Arthritis Rheumatol","Cross-sectional studies have revealed associations between DNA methylation and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) outcomes. To study the dynamics of DNA methylation, we examined participants from a SLE longitudinal cohort sampled at two time-points.One hundred and one participants from the California Lupus Epidemiology Study were studied. DNA extracted from blood at cohort enrollment and after two years was analyzed using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip. Paired t-tests were utilized to identify changes at 256 CpG sites previously associated with SLE subtypes as well as genome-wide. Mixed linear models were developed to understand the relationship between DNA methylation and disease activity, medication use and sample cell proportions, adjusting for age, sex and genetic principal components.The majority of CpGs that were previously associated with SLE subtypes remained stable over two years (185 CpGs (72.3%), t-test FDR >0.05). Compared to background genome-wide methylation, there was an enrichment of SLE subtype associated CpGs that changed over time (27.7% vs 0.34%). Changes in cell proportion were associated with changes at 67 CpGs (p<2.70E-05) and 15 CpGs had at least one significant association with use of an immunosuppressive medication.In this longitudinal cohort of SLE, we identified a subset of SLE subtype associated CpGs that were stable over time and may be useful as biomarkers of disease subtypes. Another subset of SLE subtype-associated CpGs changed at a higher proportion compared to the genome-wide methylome. Additional studies are needed to understand the etiology and impact of these methylation changes in SLE-associated CpGs.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We aimed to identify differences in the methylation profiles of theNLRP3gene between major depressive disorder (MDD) patients and healthy controls (HCs). We also investigated the correlation of the methylation score of loci inNLRP3with cortical thickness in the MDD group using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. A total of 220 patients with MDD and 82 HCs were included in the study, and genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of theNLRP3gene was performed. Among the total sample, 88 patients with MDD and 74 HCs underwent T1-weighted structural MRI and were included in the neuroimaging-methylation analysis. We identified five significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) inNLRP3. In the MDD group, the methylation scores of cg18793688 and cg09418290 showed significant positive or negative correlations with cortical thickness in the occipital, parietal, temporal, and frontal regions, which showed significant differences in cortical thickness between the MDD and HC groups. Our findings suggest thatNLRP3DNA methylation may predispose to depression-related brain structural changes by increasing NLRP3 inflammasome-related neuroinflammatory processes in MDD."

In this study, P39 and Kasumi-1 cells and their azacitidine-resistant and decitabine-resistant sublines were evaluated comparatively with transcriptomic and methylomic analyses. Expression profiling and genome-wide methylation microarray showed downregulation ofPTENassociated with DNA hypermethylation in P39 cell lines resistant to azacitidine and decitabine. This pattern ofPTENdysregulation was also confirmed in a cohort of patients failing treatment with HMA. DNA hypomethylation ofMDM2was detected with downregulation ofMDM2in HMA resistant cell lines. Long-read sequencing revealed significant RNA hypomethylation ofMDM2resulting in alternative splicing and production of a truncatedMDM2transcript in azacitidine-resistant P39 cells. The expression of thisMDM2truncated transcript was also significantly increased in HMA-resistant patients compared with HMA-responsive patients. In conclusion, epigenetic and epi-transcriptomic dysregulation ofPTENandMDM2were associated with resistance to hypomethylating agents."
"35628470","Lack of Major Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Changes in Succinate-Treated Human Epithelial Cells.","Int J Mol Sci","The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolite, succinate, is a competitive inhibitor of dioxygenase enzymes that require alpha ketoglutarate as a cofactor. One family of dioxygenases are the ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins, which oxidize 5-methylcytosine to promote DNA demethylation. Inhibition of DNA demethylation is expected to lead to DNA hypermethylation, at least at genomic regions at which TET proteins are engaged. We treated human bronchial epithelial cells with succinate for five days and confirmed its effect on TET protein function by observing diminished formation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, the first oxidation product of the TET enzymatic reaction. We then analyzed global DNA methylation patterns by performing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Unexpectedly, we did not observe differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that reached genome-wide statistical significance. We observed a few regions of clustered DNA hypomethylation, which was also not expected based on the proposed mechanisms. We discuss potential explanations for our observations and the implications of these findings for tumorigenesis."

Suicide cannot be explained by genetics alone, therefore epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation are thought to play a role. DNA methylation could be a valuable tool in helping predict those at-risk individuals. This cross-sectional study comprised 112 subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and were grouped according to the current suicidal ideation severity. DNA methylation across the genome was measured with the Infinium®MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We utilized the dmpFinder and bumphunter functions within the Bioconductor minfi package to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs), respectively. Following quality control, we removed one sample from the analysis and reported the most significant DMPs and DMRs associated with suicidal ideation severity. All positions and regions identified in this analysis were only found to have suggestive levels of significance at the genome-wide level. The present study was one of the first to investigate genome-wide methylation and suicidal ideation severity. While there were many strengths of our study, including investigating both differentially methylated positions and regions, further larger-scale studies are necessary to replicate, support, and validate our findings presented here."

While morphological variations between species have been associated with environmental factors, such as pollinators, how genetic and epigenetic factors are involved in the rapid divergence in this genus remains under investigated. In this study, we surveyed the genomes and DNA methylomes of tenAquilegiaspecies, representative of the Asian, European and North American lineages. Our analyses of the phylogeny and population structure revealed high genetic and DNA methylomic divergence across these three lineages. By multi-level genome-wide scanning, we identified candidate genes exhibiting lineage-specific genetic or epigenetic variation patterns that were signatures of inter-specific divergence. We demonstrated that these species-specific genetic variations and epigenetic variabilities are partially independent and are both functionally related to various biological processes vital to adaptation, including stress tolerance, cell reproduction and DNA repair. Our study provides an exploratory overview of how genetic and epigenetic signatures are associated with the diversification of theAquilegiaspecies."

In most cases, patients develop relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), while 10-15% of patients develop primary progressive MS (PPMS), which differs from RRMS in the mechanisms of the pathological process, some demographic, and some clinical characteristics. These differences may be explained by the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in PPMS including DNA methylation as one of the key epigenetic processes. The features of DNA methylation in various cell populations in PPMS patients remain understudied. The goal of this study is to identify differentially methylated CpG sites (DMSs) of the genome of CD4+ T lymphocytes, which characterize PPMS. The study included eight treatment-naive PPMS patients and eight healthy controls. Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation of CD4+ T lymphocytes was performed using high-density DNA microarrays. We have identified 108 DMSs, which distinguish PPMS patients from healthy controls. In PPMS patients 81% of the DMSs are hypermethylated. More than a half of the identified DMSs are located in known genes in CpG islands and adjacent regions, which indicates a high functional significance of these DMSs in PPMS development. Analysis of the overrepresentation of DMS-containing genes in the main biological processes demonstrates their involvement in the regulation of cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix and the development of the immune response, i.e., antigen processing and presentation, and development of the immune system. Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in CD4+ T lymphocytes of PPMS patients indicates the involvement of this epigenetic process in the immunopathogenesis of the disease. These results may help better understand the pathogenesis of this severe form of MS."

We investigate the role of epigenetics in the respiratory morbidity after infection by comparing methylation patterns from children who develop recurrent wheezing (RW-RSV), subsequent asthma (AS-RVS), and those experiencing complete recovery (CR-RSV).Prospective, observational study of infants aged < 2 years with RSV respiratory infection admitted to hospital and followed-up after discharge for at least three years. According to their clinical course, patients were categorized into subgroups: RW-RSV (n= 36), AS-RSV (n= 9), and CR-RSV (n= 32). The DNA genome-wide methylation pattern was analyzed in whole blood samples, collected during the acute phase of the infection, using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip (850K CpG sites). Differences in methylation were determined through a linear regression model adjusted for age, gender and cell composition.Patients who developed respiratory sequelae showed a statistically significant higher proportion of NK and CD8T cells (inferred through a deconvolution approach) than those with complete recovery. We identified 5,097 significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) when comparing RW-RSV and AS-RVS together against CR-RSV. Methylation profiles affect several genes involved in airway inflammation processes. The most significant DMPs were found to be hypomethylated in cases and therefore generally leading to overexpression of affected genes. The lead CpG position (cg24509398) falls at the gene body ofEYA3(P-value = 2.77×10-10), a tyrosine phosphatase connected with pulmonary vascular remodeling, a key process in the asthma pathology. Logistic regression analysis resulted in a diagnostic epigenetic signature of 3-DMPs (involving genesZNF2698,LOC102723354andRPL15/NKIRAS1) that allows to efficiently differentiate sequelae cases from CR-RSV patients (AUC = 1.00).

"35616899","Gene-environment interactions in childhood asthma revisited; expanding the interaction concept.","Pediatr Allergy Immunol","Investigation of gene-environment interactions (GxE) may provide important insights into the gene regulatory framework in response to environmental factors of relevance for childhood asthma. Over the years, different methodological strategies have been applied, more recently using genome-wide approaches. The best example to date is the major asthma locus on the 17q12-21 chromosome region, viral infections, and airway epithelium processes where recent studies have shed much light on mechanisms in childhood asthma. However, there are challenges with the traditional single variant-single exposure interaction models, as they do not encompass the complexity and cumulative effects of multiple exposures or multiple genetic variants. As such, we need to redefine our traditional GxE thinking, and we propose in this review to expand the GxE concept by also evaluating other omics layers, such as epigenetics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics. In addition, host factors such as age, gender, and other exposures are very likely to influence GxE effects and need firmly to be considered in future studies.© 2022 The Authors.

The present study characterized theMBDfamilies in watermelon and other cucurbit plants regarding the gene numbers and structures, phylogenetic and syntenic relationships, evolution events, and conserved domain organization of the MBD proteins. The watermelon ClMBD proteins were found to be localized in nucleus, and ClMBD2 and ClMBD3 interacted with ClIDM2 and ClIDM3. ClMBD2 bound to DNA harboring methylated CG sites but not to DNA with methylated CHG and CHH sitesin vitro. TheClMBDgenes exhibited distinct expression patterns in watermelon plants after SA and MeJA treatment and after infection by fungal pathogensFusarium oxysporumf.sp.niveumandDidymella bryoniae. Overexpression ofClMBD2,ClMBD3, orClMBD5in Arabidopsis resulted in attenuated resistance againstBotrytis cinerea, accompanied by down-regulated expression ofAtPDF1.2and increased accumulation of H2O2uponB. cinereainfection. Overexpression ofClMBD1andClMBD2led to down-regulated expression ofAtPR1and decreased resistance while overexpression ofClMBD5resulted in up-regulated expression ofAtPR1and increased resistance againstPseudomonas syringaepv.tomatoDC3000. Transcriptome analysis revealed that overexpression ofClMBD2in Arabidopsis up-regulated the expression of a small set of genes that negatively regulate Arabidopsis immunity.

However, there is a lack of consensus on CIMP markers, and thus, more comprehensive methylation markers are required to reliably predict the clinical outcomes. This study aimed to clarify the effects of genome-wide DNA methylation status on clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors.We enrolled 241 patients with mCRC, who received chemotherapy plus EGFR inhibitors as a first-line treatment. We analyzed the incidence and clinicopathological characteristics of highly methylated CRC (HMCC) and associations between genome-wide DNA methylation status and response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).In total, 169 patients were included in the final analyses. The frequency of HMCC was 8.9% (15/169). The characteristics of patients with HMCC included right-sided primary tumor location (P = 0.042), undifferentiated histology (P = 0.047), and BRAF V600E mutation (P < 0.0001). Patients with HMCC showed worse clinical outcomes than those with low-methylated CRC in terms of RR (P = 0.017), PFS (P = 0.004), and OS (P = 0.019). In the multivariate analysis, peritoneal metastasis (P = 0.017), methylation status (P = 0.037), and BRAF V600E mutations (P = 0.0001) were independent factors for shorter PFS.Genome-wide DNA methylation status is an independent factor associated with PFS in patients with mCRC treated with first-line EGFR inhibitors.© 2022.

This knowledge gap does not originate from a lack of DNAm-trait associations, but rather stems from study design issues that affect the interpretability of EWAS results. Despite known limitations in predicting the function of a particular CpG site, most EWAS maintain the broad assumption that altered DNAm results in a concomitant change of transcription at the most proximal gene. This study integrated DNAm and gene expression (GE) measurements in two cohorts, the Adolescent and Young Adult Twin Study (AYATS) and the Pregnancy, Race, Environment, Genes (PREG) study, to improve the understanding of epigenomic regulatory mechanisms. CpG sites associated with GE inciswere enriched in areas of transcription factor binding and areas of intermediate-to-low CpG density. CpG sites associated withtransGE were also enriched in areas of known regulatory significance, including enhancer regions. These results highlight issues with restricting DNAm-transcript annotations to small genomic intervals and question the validity of assuming acisDNAm-GE pathway. Based on these findings, the interpretation of EWAS results is limited in studies without multi-omic support and further research should identify genomic regions in which GE-associated DNAm is overrepresented. An in-depth characterization of GE-associated CpG sites could improve predictions of the downstream functional impact of altered DNAm and inform best practices for interpreting DNAm-trait associations generated by EWAS."

We explored whether DNA methylation differs between these subgroups and whether subgroup-unique methylation risk scores (MRSs) predict diabetic complications.Genome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed in blood from subjects with newly diagnosed T2D in discovery and replication cohorts. Subgroup-unique MRSs were built, including top subgroup-unique DNA methylation sites. Regression models examined whether MRSs associated with subgroups and future complications.We found epigenetic differences between the T2D subgroups. Subgroup-unique MRSs were significantly different in those patients allocated to each respective subgroup compared with the combined group of all other subgroups. These associations were validated in an independent replication cohort, showing that subgroup-unique MRSs associate with individual subgroups (odds ratios 1.6-6.1 per 1-SD increase, P < 0.01). Subgroup-unique MRSs were also associated with future complications. Higher MOD-MRS was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular (hazard ratio [HR] 0.65, P = 0.001) and renal (HR 0.50, P < 0.001) disease, whereas higher SIRD-MRS and MARD-MRS were associated with an increased risk of these complications (HR 1.4-1.9 per 1-SD increase, P < 0.01). Of 95 methylation sites included in subgroup-unique MRSs, 39 were annotated to genes previously linked to diabetes-related traits, including TXNIP and ELOVL2. Methylation in the blood of 18 subgroup-unique sites mirrors epigenetic patterns in tissues relevant for T2D, muscle and adipose tissue.We identified differential epigenetic patterns between T2D subgroups, which associated with future diabetic complications.

To shed light on the CpG methylation dynamics during melanoma development, we analyzed the methylome profiles of a four-stage cell line model of melanoma progression: non-tumorigenic melanocytes (melan-a), premalignant melanocytes (4C), non-metastatic melanoma cells (4C11-), and metastatic melanoma cells (4C11+). We identified 540 hypo- and 37 hypermethylated gene promoters that together characterized a malignancy signature, and 646 hypo- and 520 hypermethylated promoters that distinguished a metastasis signature. Differentially methylated genes from these signatures were correlated with overall survival using TCGA-SKCM methylation data. Moreover, multivariate Cox analyses with LASSO regularization identified panels of 33 and 31 CpGs, respectively, from the malignancy and metastasis signatures that predicted poor survival. We found a concordant relationship between DNA methylation and transcriptional levels for genes from the malignancy (Pyroxd2 and Ptgfrn) and metastasis (Arnt2, Igfbp4 and Ptprf) signatures, which were both also correlated with melanoma prognosis. Altogether, this study reveals novel CpGs methylation markers associated with malignancy and metastasis that collectively could improve the survival prediction of melanoma patients.© 2022.

There is a need to determine the appropriateness of epigenetic biomarkers for early detection as well as expand our understanding of the carcinogenic process. Therefore, the aim of the study was to assess how DNA methylation pattern of GALR1 gene evolves in a sample set representing colorectal neoplastic progression. The study was designed into three phases. Firstly, Methylation status of GALR1 was assessed with genome-wide DNA methylation beadchip and pyrosequencing assays in colorectal lesions and paired normal tissues. Then, linear mixed-effects modeling analyses were applied to describe the trend of DNA methylation during the progression of colorectal neoplasia. In the third phase, quantitative RT-PCR was used to examine GALR1 expression in patients with precursor lesion and colorectal cancer. We found that significant hypermethylation of GALR1 promoter was a widely existent modification in CRCs (P < 0.001). When further examined methylation pattern of GALR1 during neoplastic progression of CRC, we found that DNA methylation level of GALR1 showed a significant stepwise increase from normal to hyperplastic polyps, to adenomas and to carcinoma samples (P < 0.001). Besides, loss of mRNA expression is a common accompaniment to adenomas and carcinomas. Public omics data analyses showed an inverse correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation (P < 0.001). Our findings indicate that epigenetic alteration of GALR1 promoter is gradually accumulated during the colorectal neoplastic progression. It can potentially be a promising biomarker used for screening and surveillance of colorectal cancer.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Japan Society of Human Genetics."
"35603816","Epigenetic ageing of the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum in humans and chimpanzees.","Epigenetics","Epigenetic age has emerged as an important biomarker of biological ageing. It has revealed that some tissues age faster than others, which is vital to understanding the complex phenomenon of ageing and developing effective interventions. Previous studies have demonstrated that humans exhibit heterogeneity in pace of epigenetic ageing among brain structures that are consistent with differences in structural and microanatomical deterioration. Here, we add comparative data on epigenetic brain ageing for chimpanzees, humans' closest relatives. Such comparisons can further our understanding of which aspects of human ageing are evolutionarily conserved or specific to our species, especially given that humans are distinguished by a long lifespan, large brain, and, potentially, more severe neurodegeneration with age. Specifically, we investigated epigenetic ageing of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, of humans and chimpanzees by generating genome-wide CpG methylation data and applying established epigenetic clock algorithms to produce estimates of biological age for these tissues. We found that both species exhibit relatively slow epigenetic ageing in the brain relative to blood. Between brain structures, humans show a faster rate of epigenetic ageing in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to the cerebellum, which is consistent with previous findings. Chimpanzees, in contrast, show comparable rates of epigenetic ageing in the two brain structures. Greater epigenetic change in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to the cerebellum may reflect both the protracted development of this structure in humans and its greater age-related vulnerability to neurodegenerative pathology."

A genome-wide association study meta-analysis was performed on these individuals to understand genetic variation associated with resistance to disease. We further constructed a polygenic resilience score, performed MAGMA gene-based analyses and functional enrichment analyses.A higher polygenic resilience score was associated with a lower risk for PD (Beta= -0.054, SE = 0.022; P = 0.013). Although no single locus reached genome-wide significance, MAGMA gene-based analyses nominated TBCA as a putative gene. Furthermore, we estimated the narrow-sense heritability associated with resilience to PD (h2= 0.081, SE = 0.035, P = 0.0003). Subsequent functional enrichment analysis highlighted histone methylation as potential pathway harboring resilience alleles that could mitigate the effects of PD risk loci.The present study represents a novel and comprehensive assessment of heritable genetic variation contributing to PD resistance. We show that a genetic resilience score can modify the penetrance of PD genetic risk factors and therefore protect individuals carrying a high-risk genetic burden from developing PD.

"35596190","The mediating effect of DNA methylation in the association between maternal sleep during pregnancy and offspring adiposity status: a prospective cohort study.","Clin Epigenetics","Childhood overweight/obesity is a global public health concern. It is important to identify its early-life risk factors. Maternal poor sleep is common in late pregnancy, and previous studies indicated that poor sleep may influence the offspring's adiposity status. However, very few studies in humans investigated the effect of the different sleep parameters (sleep quantity, quality, and timing) on the offspring's adiposity indicators, and long-term studies are even more scarce. In addition, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study therefore aimed to examine the association between the three maternal sleep dimensions in the late pregnancy and the offspring adiposity indicators and to explore the potential mediating effect of the cord blood DNA methylation in the above association.Included participants in the current study were 2211 healthy pregnant women with singleton gestation from the Shanghai Birth Cohort (SBC) and Shanghai Sleep Birth Cohort (SSBC). Maternal nighttime sleep duration, quality, and midpoint (an indicator of circadian rhythm) were assessed by the same instrument in both cohorts during late pregnancy, and the offspring's body mass index (BMI) and subcutaneous fat (SF) were measured at 2 years old. Additionally, in 231 SSBC samples, the genome-wide DNA methylation levels were measured using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. The multivariate linear regression was used to determine the associations between the maternal sleep parameters and the offspring adiposity indicators. The epigenome-wide association study was conducted to identify the maternal sleep-related CpG sites. The mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the potential intermediate role of DNA methylation in the association between maternal sleep and offspring adiposity indicators.The mean maternal nighttime sleep duration and the sleep midpoint for combined cohorts were 9.24 ± 1.13 h and 3.02 ± 0.82, respectively, and 24.5% of pregnant women experienced poor sleep quality in late pregnancy. After adjusting for the covariates, the maternal later sleep midpoint was associated with the increased SF in offspring (Coef. = 0.62, 95% CI 0.37-0.87, p < 0.001) at 2 years old. However, no significant associations of the nighttime sleep duration or sleep quality with the offspring adiposity indicators were found. In the SSBC sample, 45 differential methylated probes (DMPs) were associated with the maternal sleep midpoint, and then, we observed 10 and 3 DMPs that were also associated with the offspring's SF and BMI at 2 years, of which cg04351668 (MARCH9) and cg12232388 significantly mediated the relationship of sleep midpoint and SF and cg12232388 and cg12225226 mediated the sleep midpoint-BMI association, respectively.Maternal later sleep timing in late pregnancy was associated with higher childhood adiposity in the offspring. Cord blood DNA methylation may play a mediation role in that relationship.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Their inherent ability to generate natively expressed recombinant proteins and antigens allows these technologies to mimic foreign gene expression without infection. Furthermore, foreign nucleic acid fragments have an inherent ability to act as natural immune adjuvants and stimulate innate pathogen- and DNA damage-associated receptors that are responsible for activating pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and DNA damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signalling pathways. This makes nucleic-acid-based expression technologies attractive for a wide range of vaccine and oncolytic immunotherapeutic uses. Recently, RNA vaccines have demonstrated their efficacy in generating strong humoral and cellular immune responses for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). DNA vaccines, which are more stable and easier to manufacture, generate similar immune responses to RNA, but typically exhibit lower immunogenicity. Here we report on a novel method of constructing self-amplifying DNA expression vectors that have the potential to amplify and enhance gene/antigen expression at a cellular level by increasing per cell gene copy numbers, boost genomic adjuvating effects and mitigate through replication many of the problems faced by non-replicating vectors such as degradation, methylation and gene silencing. These vectors employ a viral origin rolling circle replication cycle in mammalian host cells that amplifies the vector and gene of interest (GOI) copy number, maintaining themselves as nuclear episomes. We show that these vectors maintain persistently elevated GOI expression levels at the cellular level and induce morphological cellular alterations synonymous with increased cellular stress."

While the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are diverse, their relative contributions need to be investigated quantitatively to better understand the evolvability of plasticity across biological levels. This requires relating plastic responses of the epigenome, transcriptome, and organismal phenotype, and investigating how they vary with the genotype. Here we carried out this approach for responses to osmotic stress in Dunaliella salina, a green microalga that is a model organism for salinity tolerance. We compared two strains that show markedly different demographic responses to osmotic stress, and showed that these phenotypic responses involve strain- and environment-specific variation in gene expression levels, but a relative low-albeit significant-effect of strain × environment interaction. We also found an important genotype effect on the genome-wide methylation pattern, but little contribution from environmental conditions to the latter. However, we did detect a significant marginal effect of epigenetic variation on gene expression, beyond the influence of genetic differences on epigenetic state, and we showed that hypomethylated regions are correlated with higher gene expression. Our results indicate that epigenetic mechanisms are either not involved in the rapid plastic response to environmental change in this species, or involve only few changes in trans that are sufficient to trigger concerted changes in the expression of many genes, and phenotypic responses by multiple traits.© 2022 The Authors.

"35590059","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia displays a distinct highly methylated genome.","Nat Cancer","DNA methylation is tightly regulated during development and is stably maintained in healthy cells. In contrast, cancer cells are commonly characterized by a global loss of DNA methylation co-occurring with CpG island hypermethylation. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the commonest childhood cancer, perturbations of CpG methylation have been reported to be associated with genetic disease subtype and outcome, but data from large cohorts at a genome-wide scale are lacking. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing across ALL subtypes, leukemia cell lines and healthy hematopoietic cells, and show that unlike most cancers, ALL samples exhibit CpG island hypermethylation but minimal global loss of methylation. This was most pronounced in T cell ALL and accompanied by an exceptionally broad range of hypermethylation of CpG islands between patients, which is influenced by TET2 and DNMT3B. These findings demonstrate that ALL is characterized by an unusually highly methylated genome and provide further insights into the non-canonical regulation of methylation in cancer.© 2022.

"35580182","DNA methylation clocks for dogs and humans.","Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DNA methylation profiles have been used to develop biomarkers of aging known as epigenetic clocks, which predict chronological age with remarkable accuracy and show promise for inferring health status as an indicator of biological age. Epigenetic clocks were first built to monitor human aging, but their underlying principles appear to be evolutionarily conserved, as they have now been successfully developed for many mammalian species. Here, we describe reliable and highly accurate epigenetic clocks shown to apply to 93 domestic dog breeds. The methylation profiles were generated using the mammalian methylation array, which utilizes DNA sequences that are conserved across all mammalian species. Canine epigenetic clocks were constructed to estimate age and also average time to death. We also present two highly accurate human–dog dual species epigenetic clocks (R = 0.97), which may facilitate the ready translation from canine to human use (or vice versa) of antiaging treatments being developed for longevity and preventive medicine. Finally, epigenome-wide association studies here reveal individual methylation sites that may underlie the inverse relationship between breed weight and lifespan. Overall, we describe robust biomarkers to measure aging and, potentially, health status in canines."
"35681159","Cardiovascular health and four epigenetic clocks.","Clin Epigenetics","Cardiovascular health (CVH) was defined by the American Heart Association as an integrative idealness of seven clinical or lifestyle factors. Based on populations of European ancestry, recent studies have shown that ideal CVH is associated with a slower aging rate. The aging rate is measured by levels of epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), usually obtained from the residuals of regressing DNA methylation (DNAm) age on chronological age. However, little has been known about the association of CVH with biological aging in Asian populations.We here analyzed blood DNAm data and clinical/lifestyle factors of 2474 Taiwan Biobank (TWB) participants, to investigate the association of CVH with EAA. CVH was assessed by seven components: smoking status, physical activity, dietary habits, body mass index, total cholesterol, fasting glucose, and blood pressure levels. Four measures of EAA were applied, among which two were based on the first-generation DNAm clocks (HannumEAA and IEAA) and two were based on the second-generation clocks (PhenoEAA and GrimEAA). After excluding 276 individuals with cardiovascular diseases, we regressed EAA on the CVH score (ranging from 0 to 7, integrating the abovementioned seven components) while adjusting for sex, drinking status, and educational attainment. Our results showed that a decrease in one point in the CVH score was associated with a 0.350-year PhenoEAA (p = 4.5E-4) and a 0.499-year GrimEAA (p = 4.2E-15). By contrast, HannumEAA and IEAA were not significantly associated with the CVH score. We have obtained consistent results within each generation of epigenetic clocks.This is one of the first studies to comprehensively investigate the associations of CVH with four epigenetic clocks. Our TWB data showed that ideal CVH is associated with lower levels of EAA calculated according to the second-generation epigenetic clocks (PhenoEAA and GrimEAA). Having an ideal CVH status can lower EAA and reduce the risk of aging-related disorders.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35589784","Effect of excess weight and insulin resistance on DNA methylation in prepubertal children.","Sci Rep","Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, regulate gene expression and play a role in the development of insulin resistance. This study evaluates how the BMI z-score (BMIz) and the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), alone or in combination, relate to clinical outcomes and DNA methylation patterns in prepubertal children. DNA methylation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and clinical outcomes were measured in a cohort of 41 prepubertal children. Children with higher HOMA-IR had higher blood pressure and plasma lactate levels while children with higher BMIz had higher triglycerides levels. Moreover, the DNA methylation analysis demonstrated that a 1 unit increase in the BMIz was associated with a 0.41 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.53) increase in methylation of a CpG near the PPP6R2 gene. This gene is important in the regulation of NF-kB expression. However, there was no strong evidence that the BMIz and the HOMA-IR were synergistically related to any clinical or DNA methylation outcomes. In summary, the results suggest that obesity and insulin resistance may impact metabolic health both independently in prepubertal children. In addition, obesity also has an impact on the DNA methylation of the PPP6R2 gene. This may be a novel underlying starting point for the systemic inflammation associated with obesity and insulin resistance, in this population.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35581658","Aberrant hypomethylation at imprinted differentially methylated regions is involved in biparental placental mesenchymal dysplasia.","Clin Epigenetics","Placental mesenchymal dysplasia (PMD) is a morphological abnormality resembling partial hydatidiform moles. It is often associated with androgenetic/biparental mosaicism (ABM) and complicated by Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), an imprinting disorder. These phenomena suggest an association between PMD and aberrant genomic imprinting, particularly of CDKN1C and IGF2. The existence of another type of PMD containing the biparental genome has been reported. However, the frequency and etiology of biparental PMD are not yet fully understood.We examined 44 placental specimens from 26 patients with PMD: 19 of these were macroscopically normal and 25 exhibited macroscopic PMD. Genotyping by DNA microarray or short tandem repeat analysis revealed that approximately 35% of the macroscopic PMD specimens could be classified as biparental, while the remainder were ABM. We performed a DNA methylation analysis using bisulfite pyrosequencing of 15 placenta-specific imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 36 ubiquitous imprinted DMRs. As expected, most DMRs in the macroscopic PMD specimens with ABM exhibited the paternal epigenotype. Importantly, the biparental macroscopic PMD specimens exhibited frequent aberrant hypomethylation at seven of the placenta-specific DMRs. Allelic expression analysis using single-nucleotide polymorphisms revealed that five imprinted genes associated with these aberrantly hypomethylated DMRs were biallelically expressed. Frequent aberrant hypomethylation was observed at five ubiquitous DMRs, including GRB10 but not ICR2 or ICR1, which regulate the expression of CDKN1C and IGF2, respectively. Whole-exome sequencing performed on four biparental macroscopic PMD specimens did not reveal any pathological genetic abnormalities. Clinical and molecular analyses of babies born from pregnancies with PMD revealed four cases with BWS, each exhibiting different molecular characteristics, and those between BWS and PMD specimens were not always the same.These data clarify the prevalence of biparental PMD and ABM-PMD and strongly implicate hypomethylation of DMRs in the pathogenesis of biparental PMD, particularly placenta-specific DMRs and the ubiquitous GRB10, but not ICR2 or ICR1. Aberrant hypomethylation of DMRs was partial, indicating that it occurs after fertilization. PMD is an imprinting disorder, and it may be a missing link between imprinting disorders and placental disorders incompatible with life, such as complete hydatidiform moles and partial hydatidiform moles.© 2022.

Aging clock models were applied to the subjects with different COVID-19 conditions in the UK-Biobank cohort. We performed a bivariate genomic scan for age-related COVID-19 and Mendelian Randomization analysis of 389 immune cell traits to investigate their effect on lifespan and COVID-19 risk.We show that the genetic variation that supports longer life is significantly associated with the lower risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. The odds ratio is 0.31 (P = 9.7 × 10-6) and 0.46 (P = 3.3 × 10-4), respectively, per additional 10 years of life. We detect an association between biological age acceleration and future incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection. Genetic profiling of age-related COVID-19 infection indicates key contributions of Notch signaling and immune system development. We reveal a negative correlation between the effects of immune cell traits on lifespan and COVID-19 risk. We find that lower B-cell CD19 levels are indicative of an increased risk of COVID-19 and decreased life expectancy, which is further validated by COVID-19 clinical data.Our analysis suggests that the factors that accelerate aging lead to an increased COVID-19 risk and point to the importance of Notch signaling and B cells in both. Interventions that target these factors to reduce biological age may reduce the risk of COVID-19.© The Author(s) 2021."
"35676474","Graph pangenome captures missing heritability and empowers tomato breeding.","Nature","Missing heritability in genome-wide association studies defines a major problem in genetic analyses of complex biological traits1,2. The solution to this problem is to identify all causal genetic variants and to measure their individual contributions3,4. Here we report a graph pangenome of tomato constructed by precisely cataloguing more than 19 million variants from 838 genomes, including 32 new reference-level genome assemblies. This graph pangenome was used for genome-wide association study analyses and heritability estimation of 20,323 gene-expression and metabolite traits. The average estimated trait heritability is 0.41 compared with 0.33 when using the single linear reference genome. This 24% increase in estimated heritability is largely due to resolving incomplete linkage disequilibrium through the inclusion of additional causal structural variants identified using the graph pangenome. Moreover, by resolving allelic and locus heterogeneity, structural variants improve the power to identify genetic factors underlying agronomically important traits leading to, for example, the identification of two new genes potentially contributing to soluble solid content. The newly identified structural variants will facilitate genetic improvement of tomato through both marker-assisted selection and genomic selection. Our study advances the understanding of the heritability of complex traits and demonstrates the power of the graph pangenome in crop breeding.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35592702","Genetic and Epigenetic Interplay Define Disease Onset and Severity in Repeat Diseases.","Front Aging Neurosci","Repeat diseases, such as fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Friedreich ataxia, Huntington disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, and some forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are caused by repetitive DNA sequences that are expanded in affected individuals. The age at which an individual begins to experience symptoms, and the severity of disease, are partially determined by the size of the repeat. However, the epigenetic state of the area in and around the repeat also plays an important role in determining the age of disease onset and the rate of disease progression. Many repeat diseases share a common epigenetic pattern of increased methylation at CpG islands near the repeat region. CpG islands are CG-rich sequences that are tightly regulated by methylation and are often found at gene enhancer or insulator elements in the genome. Methylation of CpG islands can inhibit binding of the transcriptional regulator CTCF, resulting in a closed chromatin state and gene down regulation. The downregulation of these genes leads to some disease-specific symptoms. Additionally, a genetic and epigenetic interplay is suggested by an effect of methylation on repeat instability, a hallmark of large repeat expansions that leads to increasing disease severity in successive generations. In this review, we will discuss the common epigenetic patterns shared across repeat diseases, how the genetics and epigenetics interact, and how this could be involved in disease manifestation. We also discuss the currently available stem cell and mouse models, which frequently do not recapitulate epigenetic patterns observed in human disease, and propose alternative strategies to study the role of epigenetics in repeat diseases.Copyright © 2022 Barbé and Finkbeiner."
"35697682","A proteogenomic signature of age-related macular degeneration in blood.","Nat Commun","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the most common causes of visual impairment in the elderly, with a complex and still poorly understood etiology. Whole-genome association studies have discovered 34 genomic regions associated with AMD. However, the genes and cognate proteins that mediate the risk, are largely unknown. In the current study, we integrate levels of 4782 human serum proteins with all genetic risk loci for AMD in a large population-based study of the elderly, revealing many proteins and pathways linked to the disease. Serum proteins are also found to reflect AMD severity independent of genetics and predict progression from early to advanced AMD after five years in this population. A two-sample Mendelian randomization study identifies several proteins that are causally related to the disease and are directionally consistent with the observational estimates. In this work, we present a robust and unique framework for elucidating the pathobiology of AMD.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We quantified 596 lipid species in serum from 4,492 individuals from the Busselton Health Study. The discovery GWAS identified 3,361 independent lipid-loci associations, involving 667 genomic regions (479 previously unreported), with validation in two independent cohorts. A meta-analysis revealed an additional 70 independent genomic regions associated with lipid species. We identified 134 lipid endophenotypes for CAD associated with 186 genomic loci. Associations between independent lipid-loci with coronary atherosclerosis were assessed in ∼456,000 individuals from the UK Biobank. Of the 53 lipid-loci that showed evidence of association (P < 1 × 10-3), 43 loci were associated with at least one lipid endophenotype. These findings illustrate the value of integrative biology to investigate the aetiology of atherosclerosis and CAD, with implications for other complex diseases.© 2022. The Author(s)."

First, data on EphA7 methylation and expression in cervical cancer were extracted and analyzed via bioinformatics tools. Subsequently, CRISPR-based methylation perturbation tools (dCas9-Tet1/DNMT3a) were constructed to further demonstrate the association between DNA methylation and EphA7 expression. Ultimately, the clinical value of EphA7 methylation in cervical cancer was validated in cervical tissues and Thinprep cytologic test (TCT) samples by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP), respectively.Pooled analysis showed that EphA7 promoter methylation levels were significantly increased in cervical cancer compared to normal tissues (P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with EphA7 expression. These prediction results were subsequently confirmed in cell lines; moreover, CRISPR-based methylation perturbation tools (dCas9-Tet1/DNMT3a) demonstrated that DNA methylation participates in the regulation of EphA7 expression directly. Consistent with these findings, the methylation level and the positive rate of EphA7 gradually increased with severity from normal to cancer stages in TCT samples (P < 0.01).EphA7 hypermethylation is present in cervical cancer and is a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of cervical cancer.© 2022.

"35701800","Antiprogestins reduce epigenetic field cancerization in breast tissue of young healthy women.","Genome Med","Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in premenopausal women. Progesterone drives expansion of luminal progenitor cells, leading to the development of poor-prognostic breast cancers. However, it is not known if antagonising progesterone can prevent breast cancers in humans. We suggest that targeting progesterone signalling could be a means of reducing features which are known to promote breast cancer formation.In healthy premenopausal women with and without a BRCA mutation we studied (i) estrogen and progesterone levels in saliva over an entire menstrual cycle (n = 20); (ii) cancer-free normal breast-tissue from a control population who had no family or personal history of breast cancer and equivalently from BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (n = 28); triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) biopsies and healthy breast tissue taken from sites surrounding the TNBC in the same individuals (n = 14); and biopsies of ER+ve/PR+ve stage T1-T2 cancers and healthy breast tissue taken from sites surrounding the cancer in the same individuals (n = 31); and (iii) DNA methylation and DNA mutations in normal breast tissue (before and after treatment) from clinical trials that assessed the potential preventative effects of vitamins and antiprogestins (mifepristone and ulipristal acetate; n = 44).Daily levels of progesterone were higher throughout the menstrual cycle of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, raising the prospect of targeting progesterone signalling as a means of cancer risk reduction in this population. Furthermore, breast field cancerization DNA methylation signatures reflective of (i) the mitotic age of normal breast epithelium and (ii) the proportion of luminal progenitor cells were increased in breast cancers, indicating that luminal progenitor cells with elevated replicative age are more prone to malignant transformation. The progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone reduced both the mitotic age and the proportion of luminal progenitor cells in normal breast tissue of all control women and in 64% of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. These findings were validated by an alternate progesterone receptor antagonist, ulipristal acetate, which yielded similar results. Importantly, mifepristone reduced both the TP53 mutation frequency as well as the number of TP53 mutations in mitotic-age-responders.These data support the potential usage of antiprogestins for primary prevention of poor-prognostic breast cancers.Clinical trial 1 Mifepristone treatment prior to insertion of a levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system for improved bleeding control - a randomized controlled trial, clinicaltrialsregister.eu, 2009-009014-40 ; registered on 20 July 2009.

Prior analyses of MS genetics have identified broad enrichments across peripheral immune cells, yet the driver immune subsets are unclear.We utilize chromatin accessibility data across hematopoietic cells to identify cell type-specific enrichments of MS genetic signals. We find that CD4 T and B cells are independently enriched for MS genetics and further refine the driver subsets to Th17 and memory B cells, respectively. We replicate our findings in data from untreated and treated MS patients and find that immunomodulatory treatments suppress chromatin accessibility at driver cell types. Integration of statistical fine-mapping and chromatin interactions nominate numerous putative causal genes, illustrating complex interplay between shared and cell-specific genes.Overall, our study finds that open chromatin regions in CD4 T cells and B cells independently drive MS genetic signals.

Seventy-seven loci exceeded genome-wide significance, including 25 without prior NAFLD or alanine aminotransferase associations, with one additional locus identified in European American-only and two in African American-only analyses (P < 5 × 10-8). External replication in histology-defined NAFLD cohorts (7,397 cases and 56,785 controls) or radiologic imaging cohorts (n = 44,289) replicated 17 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P < 6.5 × 10-4), of which 9 were new (TRIB1, PPARG, MTTP, SERPINA1, FTO, IL1RN, COBLL1, APOH and IFI30).

Significant cross-ancestry genetic correlation for SWB between samples was observed. Polygenic risk analysis in an independent Korean cohort (n = 22,455) demonstrated transferability between populations. Significant correlations between SWB and major depressive disorder, and significant enrichment of central nervous system-related polymorphisms heritability in both ancestry populations were found.

Genes & Health (G&H) is a large, population study of British Pakistanis and Bangladeshis (BPB) comprising genomic and routine health data. We assessed the extent to which genetic risk for T2D is shared between BPB and European populations (EUR). We then investigated whether the integration of a polygenic risk score (PRS) for T2D with an existing risk tool (QDiabetes) could improve prediction of incident disease and the characterisation of disease subtypes.In this observational cohort study, we assessed whether common genetic loci associated with T2D in EUR individuals were replicated in 22,490 BPB individuals in G&H. We replicated fewer loci in G&H (n = 76/338, 22%) than would be expected given power if all EUR-ascertained loci were transferable (n = 101, 30%; p = 0.001). Of the 27 transferable loci that were powered to interrogate this, only 9 showed evidence of shared causal variants. We constructed a T2D PRS and combined it with a clinical risk instrument (QDiabetes) in a novel, integrated risk tool (IRT) to assess risk of incident diabetes. To assess model performance, we compared categorical net reclassification index (NRI) versus QDiabetes alone. In 13,648 patients free from T2D followed up for 10 years, NRI was 3.2% for IRT versus QDiabetes (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0% to 4.4%). IRT performed best in reclassification of individuals aged less than 40 years deemed low risk by QDiabetes alone (NRI 5.6%, 95% CI 3.6% to 7.6%), who tended to be free from comorbidities and slim. After adjustment for QDiabetes score, PRS was independently associated with progression to T2D after gestational diabetes (hazard ratio (HR) per SD of PRS 1.23, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.42, p = 0.028). Using cluster analysis of clinical features at diabetes diagnosis, we replicated previously reported disease subgroups, including Mild Age-Related, Mild Obesity-related, and Insulin-Resistant Diabetes, and showed that PRS distribution differs between subgroups (p = 0.002). Integrating PRS in this cluster analysis revealed a Probable Severe Insulin Deficient Diabetes (pSIDD) subgroup, despite the absence of clinical measures of insulin secretion or resistance. We also observed differences in rates of progression to micro- and macrovascular complications between subgroups after adjustment for confounders. Study limitations include the absence of an external replication cohort and the potential biases arising from missing or incorrect routine health data.Our analysis of the transferability of T2D loci between EUR and BPB indicates the need for larger, multiancestry studies to better characterise the genetic contribution to disease and its varied aetiology. We show that a T2D PRS optimised for this high-risk BPB population has potential clinical application in BPB, improving the identification of T2D risk (especially in the young) on top of an established clinical risk algorithm and aiding identification of subgroups at diagnosis, which may help future efforts to stratify care and treatment of the disease."

However, the underlying mechanisms are not known. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the plausible molecular factors underlying progression to PDR. To study the association of genetic variants with PDR under the intrauterine famine exposure, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were previously reported to be associated with type 2 diabetes, glucose, and pharmacogenetics. Analyses were performed in the population from northern Ukraine with a history of exposure to the Great Ukrainian Holodomor famine [the Diagnostic Optimization and Treatment of Diabetes and its Complications in the Chernihiv Region (DOLCE study),n= 3,583]. A validation of the top genetic findings was performed in the Hong Kong diabetes registry (HKDR,n= 730) with a history of famine as a consequence of the Japanese invasion during WWII. In DOLCE, the genetic risk for PDR was elevated for the variants inADRA2A,PCSK9, andCYP2C19*2loci, but reduced atPROX1locus. The association ofADRA2Aloci with the risk of advanced diabetic retinopathy in famine-exposed group was further replicated in HKDR. The exposure of embryonic retinal cells to starvation for glucose, mimicking the perinatal exposure to famine, resulted in sustained increased expression ofAdra2aandPcsk9, but decreasedProx1. The exposure to starvation exhibited a lasting inhibitory effects on neurite outgrowth, as determined by neurite length. In conclusion, a consistent genetic findings on the famine-linked risk ofADRA2Awith PDR indicate that the nerves may likely to be responsible for communicating the effects of perinatal exposure to famine on the elevated risk of advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy in adults. These results suggest the possibility of utilizing neuroprotective drugs for the prevention and treatment of PDR.Copyright © 2022 Fedotkina, Jain, Prasad, Luk, García-Ramírez, Özgümüs, Cherviakova, Khalimon, Svietleisha, Buldenko, Kravchenko, Jain, Vaag, Chan, Khalangot, Hernández, Nilsson, Simo, Artner and Lyssenko."
"35592639","Sex-Specific Brain Transcriptional Signatures in Human MDD and Their Correlates in Mouse Models of Depression.","Front Behav Neurosci","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is amongst the most devastating psychiatric conditions affecting several millions of people worldwide every year. Despite the importance of this disease and its impact on modern societies, still very little is known about the etiological mechanisms. Treatment strategies have stagnated over the last decades and very little progress has been made to improve the efficiency of current therapeutic approaches. In order to better understand the disease, it is necessary for researchers to use appropriate animal models that reproduce specific aspects of the complex clinical manifestations at the behavioral and molecular levels. Here, we review the current literature describing the use of mouse models to reproduce specific aspects of MDD and anxiety in males and females. We first describe some of the most commonly used mouse models and their capacity to display unique but also shared features relevant to MDD. We then transition toward an integral description, combined with genome-wide transcriptional strategies. The use of these models reveals crucial insights into the molecular programs underlying the expression of stress susceptibility and resilience in a sex-specific fashion. These studies performed on human and mouse tissues establish correlates into the mechanisms mediating the impact of stress and the extent to which different mouse models of chronic stress recapitulate the molecular changes observed in depressed humans. The focus of this review is specifically to highlight the sex differences revealed from different stress paradigms and transcriptional analyses both in human and animal models.Copyright © 2022 Touchant and Labonté."
"35680849","PTBP2 - a gene with relevance for both Anorexia nervosa and body weight regulation.","Transl Psychiatry","Genetic factors are relevant for both eating disorders and body weight regulation. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) for anorexia nervosa (AN) detected eight genome-wide significant chromosomal loci. One of these loci, rs10747478, was also genome-wide and significantly associated with body mass index (BMI). The nearest coding gene is the Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 2 gene (PTBP2). To detect mutations in PTBP2, Sanger sequencing of the coding region was performed in 192 female patients with AN (acute or recovered) and 191 children or adolescents with (extreme) obesity. Twenty-five variants were identified. Twenty-three of these were predicted to be pathogenic or functionally relevant in at least one in silico tool. Two novel synonymous variants (p.Ala77Ala and p.Asp195Asp), one intronic SNP (rs188987764), and the intronic deletion (rs561340981) located in the highly conserved region of PTBP2 may have functional consequences. Ten of 20 genes interacting with PTBP2 were studied for their impact on body weight regulation based on either previous functional studies or GWAS hits for body weight or BMI. In a GWAS for BMI (Pulit et al. 2018), the number of genome-wide significant associations at the PTBP2 locus was different between males (60 variants) and females (two variants, one of these also significant in males). More than 65% of these 61 variants showed differences in the effect size pertaining to BMI between sexes (absolute value of Z-score >2, two-sided p < 0.05). One LD block overlapping 5'UTR and all coding regions of PTBP2 comprises 56 significant variants in males. The analysis based on sex-stratified BMI GWAS summary statistics implies that PTBP2 may have a more pronounced effect on body weight regulation in males than in females.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35590387","Functional genomic analysis delineates regulatory mechanisms of GWAS-identified bipolar disorder risk variants.","Genome Med","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple risk loci for bipolar disorder (BD). However, pinpointing functional (or causal) variants in the reported risk loci and elucidating their regulatory mechanisms remain challenging.We first integrated chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data from human brain tissues (or neuronal cell lines) and position weight matrix (PWM) data to identify functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Then, we verified the regulatory effects of these transcription factor (TF) binding-disrupting SNPs (hereafter referred to as ""functional SNPs"") through a series of experiments, including reporter gene assays, allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis, TF knockdown, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis. Finally, we overexpressed PACS1 (whose expression was most significantly associated with the identified functional SNPs rs10896081 and rs3862386) in mouse primary cortical neurons to investigate if PACS1 affects dendritic spine density.We identified 16 functional SNPs (in 9 risk loci); these functional SNPs disrupted the binding of 7 TFs, for example, CTCF and REST binding was frequently disrupted. We then identified the potential target genes whose expression in the human brain was regulated by these functional SNPs through eQTL analysis. Of note, we showed dysregulation of some target genes of the identified TF binding-disrupting SNPs in BD patients compared with controls, and overexpression of PACS1 reduced the density of dendritic spines, revealing the possible biological mechanisms of these functional SNPs in BD.Our study identifies functional SNPs in some reported risk loci and sheds light on the regulatory mechanisms of BD risk variants. Further functional characterization and mechanistic studies of these functional SNPs and candidate genes will help to elucidate BD pathogenesis and develop new therapeutic approaches and drugs.© 2022.

"35681201","Enhancer-promoter interaction maps provide insights into skeletal muscle-related traits in pig genome.","BMC Biol","Gene expression programs are intimately linked to the interplay of active cis regulatory elements mediated by chromatin contacts and associated RNAs. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many variants in these regulatory elements that can contribute to phenotypic diversity. However, the functional interpretation of these variants remains nontrivial due to the lack of chromatin contact information or limited contact resolution. Furthermore, the distribution and role of chromatin-associated RNAs in gene expression and chromatin conformation remain poorly understood. To address this, we first present a comprehensive interaction map of nuclear dynamics of 3D chromatin-chromatin interactions (H3K27ac BL-HiChIP) and RNA-chromatin interactions (GRID-seq) to reveal genomic variants that contribute to complex skeletal muscle traits.In a genome-wide scan, we provide systematic fine mapping and gene prioritization from GWAS leading signals that underlie phenotypic variability of growth rate, meat quality, and carcass performance. A set of candidate functional variants and 54 target genes previously not detected were identified, with 71% of these candidate functional variants choosing to skip over their nearest gene to regulate the target gene in a long-range manner. The effects of three functional variants regulating KLF6 (related to days to 100 kg), MXRA8 (related to lean meat percentage), and TAF11 (related to loin muscle depth) were observed in two pig populations. Moreover, we find that this multi-omics interaction map consists of functional communities that are enriched in specific biological functions, and GWAS target genes can serve as core genes for exploring peripheral trait-relevant genes.Our results provide a valuable resource of candidate functional variants for complex skeletal muscle-related traits and establish an integrated approach to complement existing 3D genomics by exploiting RNA-chromatin and chromatin-chromatin interactions for future association studies.© 2022.

"35654974","A phenotypic spectrum of autism is attributable to the combined effects of rare variants, polygenic risk and sex.","Nat Genet","The genetic etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is multifactorial, but how combinations of genetic factors determine risk is unclear. In a large family sample, we show that genetic loads of rare and polygenic risk are inversely correlated in cases and greater in females than in males, consistent with a liability threshold that differs by sex. De novo mutations (DNMs), rare inherited variants and polygenic scores were associated with various dimensions of symptom severity in children and parents. Parental age effects on risk for ASD in offspring were attributable to a combination of genetic mechanisms, including DNMs that accumulate in the paternal germline and inherited risk that influences behavior in parents. Genes implicated by rare variants were enriched in excitatory and inhibitory neurons compared with genes implicated by common variants. Our results suggest that a phenotypic spectrum of ASD is attributable to a spectrum of genetic factors that impact different neurodevelopmental processes.© 2022.

Here, we aimed to examine whether proANP and its coding gene methylation were associated with CVD in the Chinese population.Serum proANP and peripheral blood DNA methylation of natriuretic peptide A gene (NPPA) promoter was quantified at baseline for 2,498 community members (mean aged 53 years, 38% men) in the Gusu cohort. CVD events were obtained during 10 years of follow-up. A competing-risks survival regression model was applied to examine the prospective associations of proANP andNPPApromoter methylation with incident CVD.During follow-up, 210 participants developed CVD events, 50 participants died from non-cardiovascular causes, and 214 participants were lost. Per 1-nmol/L increment of serum proANP was associated with a 22% (HR = 1.22, 95%CI: 1.03-1.44,P= 0.025) higher risk of CVD during follow-up. Of the 9 CpG sites assayed, per 2-fold increment of DNA methylation at CpG3 (located at Chr1:11908299) was significantly associated with a half lower risk of CVD (HR = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.30-0.82,P= 0.006). The gene-based analysis found that DNA methylation of the 9 CpGs atNPPApromoter as a whole was significantly associated with incident CVD (P< 0.05).Increased proANP and hypomethylation atNPPApromoter at baseline predicted an increased future risk of CVD in Chinese adults. Aberrant DNA methylation of theNPPAgene may participate in the mechanisms of CVD.Copyright: © 2022 The Author(s)."
"35606422","Prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity from sequencing data with interpretable machine learning.","Nat Biotechnol","Protein-ligand interactions are increasingly profiled at high throughput using affinity selection and massively parallel sequencing. However, these assays do not provide the biophysical parameters that most rigorously quantify molecular interactions. Here we describe a flexible machine learning method, called ProBound, that accurately defines sequence recognition in terms of equilibrium binding constants or kinetic rates. This is achieved using a multi-layered maximum-likelihood framework that models both the molecular interactions and the data generation process. We show that ProBound quantifies transcription factor (TF) behavior with models that predict binding affinity over a range exceeding that of previous resources; captures the impact of DNA modifications and conformational flexibility of multi-TF complexes; and infers specificity directly from in vivo data such as ChIP-seq without peak calling. When coupled with an assay called KD-seq, it determines the absolute affinity of protein-ligand interactions. We also apply ProBound to profile the kinetics of kinase-substrate interactions. ProBound opens new avenues for decoding biological networks and rationally engineering protein-ligand interactions.© 2022. The Author(s)."

A therapeutic approach for advanced cancer comprising multicore encapsulated iron oxide (IO) Sarah Nanoparticles (SaNPs), that uniquely self-regulate their temperature, was developed thus overcoming the safety challenges of hyperthermia. SaNPs are intravenously injected and accumulate in tumor tissue, leading to selective heating upon exposure to an external alternating magnetic field (AMF). A series of studies were conducted in healthy swine to assess SaNPs' safety, alone or combined with AMF application. Administration of single high (up to 22 mg IO/kg) or low (3.6 mg IO/kg) SaNP doses had no adverse effects, including no infusion reactions. Vital signs remained stable with no significant clinical pathology changes, and no treatment-associated toxicities. Biodistribution analysis indicated that SaNPs predominantly accumulate in the lungs and clear in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In minipigs that received a single SaNP no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL)-based dose (3.6 mg IO/kg) with AMF, the average percentage remaining in vital organs after 90 days was 13.7%. No noticeable clinical signs were noted during the 87 to 92-day observation period following irradiation, and no inflammation, necrosis, nor thermal damage were found in the histopathology evaluation. In another minipig, ~ 90 days after three recurrent high doses (14 mg IO/kg), without AMF, almost half of the injected SaNPs were cleared with no residual detrimental effects. We demonstrate that the approach is safe and well tolerated in swine, opening potential avenues as a novel therapeutic modality for cancer patients.© 2022.

"35586366","Association Between the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and Adverse Clinical Prognosis in Patients with Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage.","Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat","The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an index reflecting the overall inflammatory and stress status of patients with major diseases. Many studies associated the NLR with neurological deterioration and a poor prognosis in the spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, most previous studies did not further analyze NLR by stratification, and with a relatively small sample size. Besides, the outcome evaluation mostly focused on short-term prognosis or a single timepoint.Patients' basic characteristics and laboratory examination results, including the NLR were taken at baseline, and data from the 1-year follow-up, including the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and survival status, was obtained for all patients. Patients included in the study were classified into four groups according to NLR quartiles (Q1-Q4). Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between different NLR levels and poor outcomes (mRS 3-5 and mRS 3-6).A total of 594 ICH patients were enrolled. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and hematoma volume at first admission were significantly different between different NLR level groups (all P values <0.05). In the multivariate logistic regression model, at the 30-day follow-up, the Q4 (significantly increased NLR) group showed an elevated risk of poor outcomes (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.17-4.83, P=0.02) and functional disability (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.05-4.65, P=0.04). At the 3-month follow-up, the Q4 group still showed an elevated risk of poor outcomes (OR, 2.83; 95% CI, 1.38-5.77, P<0.01) and functional disability (OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.28-5.98, P<0.01). At the 1-year follow-up, the Q2 (slightly elevated NLR) group showed significant functional disability (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.16-0.72, P<0.01).A significantly increased NLR may have an impact on the poor outcomes and functional disability of patients with ICH, while a slightly elevated NLR may play a protective role.© 2022 Du et al."
"35585989","Mechanisms of Kwashiorkor-Associated Immune Suppression: Insights From Human, Mouse, and Pig Studies.","Front Immunol","Malnutrition refers to inadequate energy and/or nutrient intake. Malnutrition exhibits a bidirectional relationship with infections whereby malnutrition increases risk of infections that further aggravates malnutrition. Severe malnutrition (SM) is the main cause of secondary immune deficiency and mortality among children in developing countries. SM can manifest as marasmus (non-edematous), observed most often (68.6% of all malnutrition cases), kwashiorkor (edematous), detected in 23.8% of cases, and marasmic kwashiorkor, identified in ~7.6% of SM cases. Marasmus and kwashiorkor occur due to calorie-energy and protein-calorie deficiency (PCD), respectively. Kwashiorkor and marasmic kwashiorkor present with reduced protein levels, protein catabolism rates, and altered levels of micronutrients leading to uncontrolled oxidative stress, exhaustion of anaerobic commensals, and proliferation of pathobionts. Due to these alterations, kwashiorkor children present with profoundly impaired immune function, compromised intestinal barrier, and secondary micronutrient deficiencies. Kwashiorkor-induced alterations contribute to growth stunting and reduced efficacy of oral vaccines. SM is treated with antibiotics and ready-to-use therapeutic foods with variable efficacy. Kwashiorkor has been extensively investigated in gnotobiotic (Gn) mice and piglet models to understand its multiple immediate and long-term effects on children health. Due to numerous physiological and immunological similarities between pigs and humans, pig represents a highly relevant model to study kwashiorkor pathophysiology and immunology. Here we summarize the impact of kwashiorkor on children's health, immunity, and gut functions and review the relevant findings from human and animal studies. We also discuss the reciprocal interactions between PCD and rotavirus-a highly prevalent enteric childhood pathogen due to which pathogenesis and immunity are affected by childhood SM.Copyright © 2022 Michael, Amimo, Rajashekara, Saif and Vlasova."

It is not a trivial task to assign diverse cohesin functions. Moreover, the context-specific roles of cohesin-mediated interactions, especially on intragenic regions, have not been thoroughly investigated. Here we perform a comprehensive characterization of cohesin binding sites in several human cell types. We integrate epigenomic, transcriptomic and chromatin interaction data to explore the context-specific functions of intragenic cohesin related to gene activation. We identify a specific subset of cohesin binding sites, decreased intragenic cohesin sites (DICs), which are negatively correlated with transcriptional regulation. A subgroup of DICs is enriched with enhancer markers and RNA polymerase II, while the others are more correlated to chromatin architecture. DICs are observed in various cell types, including cells from patients with cohesinopathy. We also implement machine learning to our data and identified genomic features for isolating DICs from all cohesin sites. These results suggest a previously unidentified function of cohesin on intragenic regions for transcriptional regulation.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We designed a time course experiment that successfully sampled the period when Atlantic salmon commence their trajectory towards sexual maturation.Through deep RNA sequencing, we discovered key genes and pathways associated with maturation in the pituitary-ovarian axis. Analyzing DNA methylomes revealed a bias towards hypermethylation in ovary that implicated maturation-related genes. Co-analysis of DNA methylome and gene expression changes revealed chromatin remodeling genes and key transcription factors were both significantly hypermethylated and upregulated in the ovary during the onset of maturation. We also observed changes in chromatin state landscapes that were strongly correlated with fundamental remodeling of gene expression in liver. Finally, a multiomic integrated analysis revealed regulatory networks and identified hub genes including TRIM25 gene (encoding the estrogen-responsive finger protein) as a putative key regulator in the pituitary that underwent a 60-fold change in connectivity during the transition to maturation.The study successfully documented transcriptome and epigenome changes that involved key genes and pathways acting in the pituitary - ovarian axis. Using a Systems Biology approach, we identified hub genes and their associated networks deemed crucial for onset of maturation. The results provide a comprehensive view of the spatiotemporal changes involved in a complex trait and opens the door to future efforts aiming to manipulate puberty in an economically important aquaculture species.© 2022.

However, little is known about the role of DNA methylation in fine-tuning maternal physiology. Understanding the changes in DNA methylation during pregnancy is the first step in clarifying the association of diet, nutrition, and thromboembolism with the changes in DNA methylation. In this study, we investigated whether and how the DNA methylation pattern changes in the three trimesters and after delivery in ten uncomplicated pregnancies.DNA methylation was measured using a Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip. There were 14,018 cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites with statistically significant changes in DNA methylation over the four time periods (p< 0.001). Overall, DNA methylation after delivery was higher than that of the three trimesters (p< 0.001), with the protein ubiquitination pathway being the top canonical pathway involved. We classified the CpG sites into nine groups according to the changes in the three trimesters and found that 38.37% of CpG sites had DNA methylation changes during pregnancy, especially between the first and second trimesters.DNA methylation pattern changes between trimesters, indicating possible involvement in maternal adaptation to pregnancy. Meanwhile, DNA methylation patterns during pregnancy and in the postpartum period were different, implying that puerperium repair may also function through DNA methylation mechanisms.Copyright © 2022 Lin, Tsai, Shih, Tai, Lee and Lin."

This has been termed developmental programming. Mounting evidence suggests that the growth and metabolism of male and female fetuses differ. Therefore, sexual dimorphism in response to pre-conception or early-life exposures could contribute to known sex differences in susceptibility to poor metabolic health in adulthood. However, until recently, many studies, especially those in animal models, focused on a single sex, or, often in the case of studies performed during intrauterine development, did not report the sex of the animal at all. In this review, we (a) summarize the evidence that male and females respond differently to a suboptimal pre-conceptional or in utero environment, (b) explore the potential biological mechanisms that underlie these differences and (c) review the consequences of these differences for long-term metabolic health, including that of subsequent generations.© 2022.

New therapeutic strategies are aimed to modulate the athero-inflammatory process that partially orchestrates underlying vascular damage. Peripheral blood circulating cells include different immune cells with a central role in the development of the atherogenic inflammatory response. The anti-aging protein α-Klotho has been related to protective effects against CVD. KL is expressed in monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes where it exerts anti-inflammatory effects. In this work, we analyse the relationships of the levels of inflammatory markers with the expression of the KL gene in PBCCs and with the serum levels of soluble KL in atherosclerotic vascular disease. For this, we conducted a cross-sectional single-center case-control study including a study group of 76 CVD patients and a control group of 16 cadaveric organ donors without medical antecedent or study indicating CVD. Vascular artery fragments and whole blood and serum samples were obtained during elective or organ retrieval surgery. Serum levels of sKL, TNFα and IL10, and gene expression levels of KL, TNF, IL10, NFKB1, DNMT1, and DNMT3A in PBCCs were measured. In these cells, we also determined KL promoter methylation percentage. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses were employed to visualize atherosclerotic lesions and to measure IL10 and TNFα levels in vascular fragments. Patients with CVD presented higher values of proinflammatory markers both at systemic and in the vasculature and in the PBCCs, compared to the control group. In PBCCs, CVD patients also presented lower gene expression levels of KL gene (56.4% difference, P < 0.001), higher gene expression levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3A (P < 0.0001, for both) and a higher methylation status of in the promoter region of KL (34.1 ± 4.1% vs. 14.6 ± 3.4%, P < 0.01). In PBCCs and vasculature, KL gene expression correlated inversely with pro-inflammatory markers and directly with anti-inflammatory markers. sKL serum levels presented similar associations with the expression levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers in PBCCs. The differences in KL expression levels in PBCCs and in serum sKL levels with respect to control group was even greater in those CVD patients with macroscopically observable atheromatous plaques. We conclude that promoter methylation-mediated downregulation of KL gene expression in PBCCs is associated with the pro-inflammatory status in atherosclerotic vascular disease.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Knowledge on how to produce the heterogeneity is quite limited. This study aims to examine fluctuations in differential gene expression by alleles of sequence variants across expression processes.Genome-wide eQTL analyses with transcriptome-wide gene expression data revealed 20 cis-acting eQTLs associated simultaneously with mRNA expression, ribosome occupancy, and protein abundance. A 97 kb-long eQTL signal for mitochondrial ribosomal protein L43 (MRPL43) covered the gene, showing a heterogeneous effect size on gene products across expression stages. One allele of the eQTL was associated with increased mRNA expression and ribosome occupancy but decreased protein abundance. We examined the heterogeneity and found that the eQTL can be attributed to the independent functions of three nucleotide variants, with a strong linkage. NC_000010.11:g.100987606G > T, upstream of MRPL43, may regulate the binding affinity of transcription factors. NC_000010.11:g.100986746C > G, 3 bp from an MRPL43 splice donor site, may alter the splice site. NC_000010.11:g.100978794A > G, in the isoform with a long 3'-UTR, may strengthen the binding affinity of the microRNA. Individuals with the TGG haplotype at these three variants had higher levels of mRNA expression and ribosome occupancy than individuals with the GCA haplotype but lower protein levels, producing the flipped effect throughout the expression process.These findings suggest that multiple functional variants in a linkage exert their regulatory functions at different points in the gene expression process, producing a complexity of single eQTLs.© 2022.

"35580068","Attribution of Cancer Origins to Endogenous, Exogenous, and Preventable Mutational Processes.","Mol Biol Evol","Mutational processes in tumors create distinctive patterns of mutations, composed of neutral ""passenger"" mutations and oncogenic drivers that have quantifiable effects on the proliferation and survival of cancer cell lineages. Increases in proliferation and survival are mediated by natural selection, which can be quantified by comparing the frequency at which we detect substitutions to the frequency at which we expect to detect substitutions assuming neutrality. Most of the variants detectable with whole-exome sequencing in tumors are neutral or nearly neutral in effect, and thus the processes generating the majority of mutations may not be the primary sources of the tumorigenic mutations. Across 24 cancer types, we identify the contributions of mutational processes to each oncogenic variant and quantify the degree to which each process contributes to tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that the origination of variants driving melanomas and lung cancers is predominantly attributable to the preventable, exogenous mutational processes associated with ultraviolet light and tobacco exposure, respectively, whereas the origination of selected variants in gliomas and prostate adenocarcinomas is largely attributable to endogenous processes associated with aging. Preventable mutations associated with pathogen exposure and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme activity account for a large proportion of the cancer effect within head-and-neck, bladder, cervical, and breast cancers. These attributions complement epidemiological approaches-revealing the burden of cancer driven by single-nucleotide variants caused by either endogenous or exogenous, nonpreventable, or preventable processes, and crucially inform public health strategies.© The Author(s) 2022.

In multivariable-adjusted models, baseline use of fish oil was associated with 8% lower risk of CMM [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.89-0.96, P < 0.001] and 10% lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI 0.85-0.95, P < 0.001).In individuals with hypertension, baseline use of fish oil was associated with a reduced risk of CMM and all-cause mortality, and further clinical trials are needed to prove this hypothesis.© 2022.

"35681061","Context-specific Polycomb mechanisms in development.","Nat Rev Genet","Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are crucial chromatin regulators that maintain repression of lineage-inappropriate genes and are therefore required for stable cell fate. Recent advances show that PcG proteins form distinct multi-protein complexes in various cellular environments, such as in early development, adult tissue maintenance and cancer. This surprising compositional diversity provides the basis for mechanistic diversity. Understanding this complexity deepens and refines the principles of PcG complex recruitment, target-gene repression and inheritance of memory. We review how the core molecular mechanism of Polycomb complexes operates in diverse developmental settings and propose that context-dependent changes in composition and mechanism are essential for proper epigenetic regulation in development.© 2022.

"35697866","Allelic imbalance of chromatin accessibility in cancer identifies candidate causal risk variants and their mechanisms.","Nat Genet","While many germline cancer risk variants have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the mechanisms by which these variants operate remain largely unknown. Here we used 406 cancer ATAC-Seq samples across 23 cancer types to identify 7,262 germline allele-specific accessibility QTLs (as-aQTLs). Cancer as-aQTLs had stronger enrichment for cancer risk heritability (up to 145 fold) than any other functional annotation across seven cancer GWAS. Most cancer as-aQTLs directly altered transcription factor (TF) motifs and exhibited differential TF binding and gene expression in functional screens. To connect as-aQTLs to putative risk mechanisms, we introduced the regulome-wide associations study (RWAS). RWAS identified genetically associated accessible peaks at >70% of known breast and prostate loci and discovered new risk loci in all examined cancer types. Integrating as-aQTL discovery, motif analysis and RWAS identified candidate causal regulatory elements and their probable upstream regulators. Our work establishes cancer as-aQTLs and RWAS analysis as powerful tools to study the genetic architecture of cancer risk.© 2022.

Here, we propose an integrative method PUMICE (Prediction Using Models Informed by Chromatin conformations and Epigenomics) to integrate 3D genomic and epigenomic data with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to more accurately predict gene expressions. PUMICE helps define and prioritize regions that harbor cis-regulatory variants, which outperforms competing methods. We further describe an extension to our method PUMICE +, which jointly combines TWAS results from single- and multi-tissue models. Across 79 traits, PUMICE + identifies 22% more independent novel genes and increases median chi-square statistics values at known loci by 35% compared to the second-best method, as well as achieves the narrowest credible interval size. Lastly, we perform computational drug repurposing and confirm that PUMICE + outperforms other TWAS methods.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35655232","Effects of DNA methylation on cardiometabolic risk factors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Arch Public Health","Epigenetic changes, especially DNA methylation have a main role in regulating cardiometabolic disorders and their risk factors. This study provides a review of the current evidence on the association between methylation of some genes (LINE1, ABCG1, SREBF1, PHOSPHO1, ADRB3, and LEP) and cardiometabolic risk factors.A systematic literature search was conducted in electronic databases including Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar and Scopus up to end of 2020. All observational human studies (cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort) were included. Studies that assessed the effect of DNA methylation on cardiometabolic risk factors were selected.Among 1398 articles, eight studies and twenty-one studies were included in the meta-analysis and the systematic review, respectively. Our study showed ABCG1 and LINE1 methylation were positively associated with blood pressure (Fisher's zr = 0.07 (0.06, 0.09), 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.08). Methylation in LINE1, ABCG1, SREBF1, PHOSPHO1 and ADRB3 had no significant association with HDL levels (Fisher's zr = - 0.05 (- 0.13, 0.03), 95% CI:-0.12 to 0.02). Positive association was existed between LINE1, ABCG1 and LEP methylation and LDL levels (Fisher's zr = 0.13 (0.04, 0.23), 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.23). Moreover, positive association was found between HbA1C and ABCG1 methylation (Fisher's zr = 0.11 (0.09, 0.13), 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.12). DNA methylation of LINE1, ABCG1 and SREBF1 genes had no significant association with glucose levels (Fisher's zr = 0.01 (- 0.12, 0.14), 95% CI:-0.12 to 0.14).This meta-analysis showed that DNA methylation was associated with some cardiometabolic risk factors including LDL-C, HbA1C, and blood pressure.Registration ID of the protocol on PROSPERO is CRD42020207677 .© 2022.

"35701597","Impact of schizophrenia GWAS loci converge onto distinct pathways in cortical interneurons vs glutamatergic neurons during development.","Mol Psychiatry","Remarkable advances have been made in schizophrenia (SCZ) GWAS, but gleaning biological insight from these loci is challenging. Genetic influences on gene expression (e.g., eQTLs) are cell type-specific, but most studies that attempt to clarify GWAS loci's influence on gene expression have employed tissues with mixed cell compositions that can obscure cell-specific effects. Furthermore, enriched SCZ heritability in the fetal brain underscores the need to study the impact of SCZ risk loci in specific developing neurons. MGE-derived cortical interneurons (cINs) are consistently affected in SCZ brains and show enriched SCZ heritability in human fetal brains. We identified SCZ GWAS risk genes that are dysregulated in iPSC-derived homogeneous populations of developing SCZ cINs. These SCZ GWAS loci differential expression (DE) genes converge on the PKC pathway. Their disruption results in PKC hyperactivity in developing cINs, leading to arborization deficits. We show that the fine-mapped GWAS locus in the ATP2A2 gene of the PKC pathway harbors enhancer marks by ATACseq and ChIPseq, and regulates ATP2A2 expression. We also generated developing glutamatergic neurons (GNs), another population with enriched SCZ heritability, and confirmed their functionality after transplantation into the mouse brain. Then, we identified SCZ GWAS risk genes that are dysregulated in developing SCZ GNs. GN-specific SCZ GWAS loci DE genes converge on the ion transporter pathway, distinct from those for cINs. Disruption of the pathway gene CACNA1D resulted in deficits of Ca2+currents in developing GNs, suggesting compromised neuronal function by GWAS loci pathway deficits during development. This study allows us to identify cell type-specific and developmental stage-specific mechanisms of SCZ risk gene function, and may aid in identifying mechanism-based novel therapeutic targets.© 2022.

While many genetic loci have been identified to associate with CAD, the intermediate causal risk factors and etiology have not been fully understood. This study assesses the causal effects of 37 heritable clinical factors on CAD in East Asian and European populations.We collected genome-wide association summary statistics of 37 clinical factors from the Biobank Japan (42,793 to 191,764 participants) and the UK Biobank (314,658 to 442,817 participants), paired with summary statistics of CAD from East Asians (29,319 cases and 183,134 controls) and Europeans (91,753 cases and 311,344 controls). These clinical factors covered 12 cardiometabolic traits, 13 hematological indices, 7 hepatological and 3 renal function indices, and 2 serum electrolyte indices. We performed univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses in East Asians and Europeans separately, followed by meta-analysis.Univariable MR analyses identified reliable causal evidence (P < 0.05/37) of 10 cardiometabolic traits (height, body mass index [BMI], blood pressure, glycemic and lipid traits) and 4 other clinical factors related to red blood cells (red blood cell count [RBC], hemoglobin, hematocrit) and uric acid (UA). Interestingly, while generally consistent, we identified population heterogeneity in the causal effects of BMI and UA, with higher effect sizes in East Asians than those in Europeans. After adjusting for cardiometabolic factors in multivariable MR analysis, red blood cell traits (RBC, meta-analysis odds ratio 1.07 per standard deviation increase, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.13; hemoglobin, 1.10, 1.03-1.16; hematocrit, 1.10, 1.04-1.17) remained significant (P < 0.05), while UA showed an independent causal effect in East Asians only (1.12, 1.06-1.19, P = 3.26×10-5).We confirmed the causal effects of 10 cardiometabolic traits on CAD and identified causal risk effects of RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and UA independent of traditional cardiometabolic factors. We found no causal effects for 23 clinical factors, despite their reported epidemiological associations. Our findings suggest the physiology of red blood cells and the level of UA as potential intervention targets for the prevention of CAD.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35668323","Variant to function mapping at single-cell resolution through network propagation.","Nat Biotechnol","Genome-wide association studies in combination with single-cell genomic atlases can provide insights into the mechanisms of disease-causal genetic variation. However, identification of disease-relevant or trait-relevant cell types, states and trajectories is often hampered by sparsity and noise, particularly in the analysis of single-cell epigenomic data. To overcome these challenges, we present SCAVENGE, a computational algorithm that uses network propagation to map causal variants to their relevant cellular context at single-cell resolution. We demonstrate how SCAVENGE can help identify key biological mechanisms underlying human genetic variation, applying the method to blood traits at distinct stages of human hematopoiesis, to monocyte subsets that increase the risk for severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to intermediate lymphocyte developmental states that predispose to acute leukemia. Our approach not only provides a framework for enabling variant-to-function insights at single-cell resolution but also suggests a more general strategy for maximizing the inferences that can be made using single-cell genomic data.© 2022.

We identified 53/c loci affecting hearing loss risk, including common coding variants in COL9A3 and TMPRSS3. Through exome sequencing of 108,415 cases and 329,581 controls, we observed rare coding associations with 11 Mendelian hearing loss genes, including additive effects in known hearing loss genes GJB2 (Gly12fs; odds ratio [OR] = 1.21, P = 4.2 × 10-11) and SLC26A5 (gene burden; OR = 1.96, P = 2.8 × 10-17). We also identified hearing loss associations with rare coding variants in FSCN2 (OR = 1.14, P = 1.9 × 10-15) and KLHDC7B (OR = 2.14, P = 5.2 × 10-30). Our results suggest a shared etiology between Mendelian and common hearing loss in adults. This work illustrates the potential of large-scale exome sequencing to elucidate the genetic architecture of common disorders where both common and rare variation contribute to risk.© 2022.

"35697868","Genome-wide association analysis reveals insights into the genetic architecture of right ventricular structure and function.","Nat Genet","Right ventricular (RV) structure and function influence the morbidity and mortality from coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Little is known about the genetic basis of RV measurements. Here we perform genome-wide association analyses of four clinically relevant RV phenotypes (RV end-diastolic volume, RV end-systolic volume, RV stroke volume, RV ejection fraction) from cardiovascular magnetic resonance images, using a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm in 29,506 UK Biobank participants. We identify 25 unique loci associated with at least one RV phenotype at P < 2.27 ×10-8, 17 of which are validated in a combined meta-analysis (n = 41,830). Several candidate genes overlap with Mendelian cardiomyopathy genes and are involved in cardiac muscle contraction and cellular adhesion. The RV polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are associated with DCM and CAD. The findings substantially advance our understanding of the genetic underpinning of RV measurements.© 2022.

We investigated the effect of plasma concentration of omega-3 PUFA (i.e. docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and total omega-3 PUFA) and omega-6 PUFA (i.e. linoleic acid and total omega-6 PUFA) on the risk of CVDs using Mendelian randomization.We conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating PUFA to date including a sample of 114,999 individuals and incorporated these data in a two-sample Mendelian randomization framework to investigate the involvement of circulating PUFA on a wide range of CVDs in up to 1,153,768 individuals of European ancestry (i.e. coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, aortic aneurysm, venous thromboembolism and aortic valve stenosis).GWAS identified between 46 and 64 SNPs for the four PUFA traits, explaining 4.8-7.9% of circulating PUFA variance and with mean F statistics >100. Higher genetically predicted DHA (and total omega-3 fatty acids) concentration was related to higher risk of some cardiovascular endpoints; however, these findings did not pass our criteria for multiple testing correction and were attenuated when accounting for LDL-cholesterol through multivariable Mendelian randomization or excluding SNPs in the vicinity of the FADS locus. Estimates for the relation between higher genetically predicted linoleic acid (and total omega-6) concentration were inconsistent across different cardiovascular endpoints and Mendelian randomization methods. There was weak evidence of higher genetically predicted linoleic acid being related to lower risk of ischemic stroke and peripheral artery disease when accounting by LDL-cholesterol.We have conducted the largest GWAS of circulating PUFA to date and the most comprehensive Mendelian randomization analyses. Overall, our Mendelian randomization findings do not support a protective role of circulating PUFA concentration on the risk of CVDs. However, horizontal pleiotropy via lipoprotein-related traits could be a key source of bias in our analyses.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35681053","Mendelian imputation of parental genotypes improves estimates of direct genetic effects.","Nat Genet","Effects estimated by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) include effects of alleles in an individual on that individual (direct genetic effects), indirect genetic effects (for example, effects of alleles in parents on offspring through the environment) and bias from confounding. Within-family genetic variation is random, enabling unbiased estimation of direct genetic effects when parents are genotyped. However, parental genotypes are often missing. We introduce a method that imputes missing parental genotypes and estimates direct genetic effects. Our method, implemented in the software package snipar (single-nucleotide imputation of parents), gives more precise estimates of direct genetic effects than existing approaches. Using 39,614 individuals from the UK Biobank with at least one genotyped sibling/parent, we estimate the correlation between direct genetic effects and effects from standard GWASs for nine phenotypes, including educational attainment (r = 0.739, standard error (s.e.) = 0.086) and cognitive ability (r = 0.490, s.e. = 0.086).

We conducted four complementary studies to investigate associations between parental IBD and autism in children, and elucidated their underlying etiology. Conducting a nationwide population-based cohort study using Swedish registers, we found evidence of associations between parental diagnoses of IBD and autism in children. Polygenic risk score analyses of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children suggested associations between maternal genetic liability to IBD and autistic traits in children. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses provided evidence of a potential causal effect of genetic liability to IBD, especially ulcerative colitis, on autism. Linkage disequilibrium score regression did not indicate a genetic correlation between IBD and autism. Triangulating evidence from these four complementary approaches, we found evidence of a potential causal link between parental, particularly maternal, IBD and autism in children. Perinatal immune dysregulation, micronutrient malabsorption and anemia may be implicated.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Current management consists of either compression stockings, or surgical ablation for more advanced disease. Most varicose veins patients report a positive family history, and heritability is ~17%. We describe the largest two-stage genome-wide association study of varicose veins in 401,656 individuals from UK Biobank, and replication in 408,969 individuals from 23andMe (total 135,514 cases and 675,111 controls).

Abnormal nuclear morphology is primarily observed as an increased number of hypolobulated immature neutrophils, called band cells, during infection or in rare envelopathies like Pelger-Huët anomaly. To search for sequence variants affecting nuclear morphology of granulocytes, we performed a genome-wide association study using band neutrophil fraction from 88,101 Icelanders. We describe 13 sequence variants affecting band neutrophil fraction at nine loci. Five of the variants are at the Lamin B receptor (LBR) locus, encoding an inner nuclear membrane protein. Mutations in LBR are linked to Pelger-Huët anomaly. In addition, we identify cosegregation of a rare stop-gain sequence variant in LBR and Pelger Huët anomaly in an Icelandic eight generation pedigree, initially reported in 1963. Two of the other loci include genes which, like LBR, play a role in the nuclear membrane function and integrity. These GWAS results highlight the role proteins of the inner nuclear membrane have as important for neutrophil nuclear morphology.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35618892","Assessing the contribution of genetic nurture to refractive error.","Eur J Hum Genet","Parents pass on both their genes and environment to offspring, prompting debate about the relative importance of nature versus nurture in the inheritance of complex traits. Advances in molecular genetics now make it possible to quantify an individual's genetic predisposition to a trait via his or her 'polygenic score'. However, part of the risk captured by an individual's polygenic score may actually be attributed to the genotype of their parents. In the most well-studied example of this indirect 'genetic nurture' effect, about half the genetic contribution to educational attainment was found to be attributed to parental alleles, even if those alleles were not inherited by the child. Refractive errors, such as myopia, are a common cause of visual impairment and pose high economic and quality-of-life costs. Despite strong evidence that refractive errors are highly heritable, the extent to which genetic risk is conferred directly via transmitted risk alleles or indirectly via the environment that parents create for their children is entirely unknown. Here, an instrumental variable analysis in 1944 pairs of adult siblings from the United Kingdom was used to quantify the proportion of the genetic risk ('single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability') of refractive error contributed by genetic nurture. We found no evidence of a contribution from genetic nurture: non-within-family SNP-heritability estimate = 0.213 (95% confidence interval 0.134-0.310) and within-family SNP-heritability estimate = 0.250 (0.152-0.372). Our findings imply the genetic contribution to refractive error is principally an intrinsic effect from alleles transmitted from parents to offspring.© 2022. The Author(s)."

There is currently a paucity of genomic research on an individual's job attainment, as well as how it is related to other SES variables and overall well-being at the whole genome level. By incorporating O*NET occupational information into the UK Biobank database, we performed GWAS analyses of six major job attainment characteristics-job complexity, autonomy, innovation, information demands, emotional demands, and physical demands-on 219,483 individuals of European ancestry. The job attainment characteristics had moderate to high pairwise genetic correlations, manifested by three latent factors: cognitive, emotional, and physical requirements. The latent factor of overall job requirement underlying the job attainment traits represented a critical genetic path from educational attainment to income (P < 0.001). Job attainment characteristics were genetically positively correlated with positive health and well-being outcomes (i.e., subject well-being, overall health rating, number of non-cancer illnesses etc. (|rg|: 0.14-0.51), similar to other SES indices; however, the genetic correlations exhibited opposite directions for physical demands (|rg|: 0.14-0.51) and were largely negligible for emotional demands. By adopting a finer-grained approach to capture specific job attainment phenotypes, our study represents an important step forward in understanding the shared genetic architecture among job attainment characteristics, other SES indices, and potential role in health and well-being outcomes.© 2022.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an emerging magnetic resonance imaging technique that measures tissue magnetic susceptibility and has been shown to detect pathological changes in tissue iron, myelin and calcification. We present an open resource of QSM-based imaging measures of multiple brain structures in 35,273 individuals from the UK Biobank prospective epidemiological study. We identify statistically significant associations of 251 phenotypes with magnetic susceptibility that include body iron, disease, diet and alcohol consumption. Genome-wide associations relate magnetic susceptibility to 76 replicating clusters of genetic variants with biological functions involving iron, calcium, myelin and extracellular matrix. These patterns of associations include relationships that are unique to QSM, in particular being complementary to T2* signal decay time measures.

Understanding the heritable component of the response to medication is of great interest but challenging due to several reasons, including small study cohorts and computational limitations.Here, we study the heritability of variation in the glycaemic response to metformin, first-line therapeutic agent for type 2 diabetes (T2D), by leveraging 18 years of electronic health records (EHR) data from Israel's largest healthcare service provider, consisting of over five million patients of diverse ethnicities and socio-economic background. Our cohort consists of 80,788 T2D patients treated with metformin, with an accumulated number of 1,611,591 HbA1C measurements and 4,581,097 metformin prescriptions. We estimate the explained variance of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c%) reduction due to inheritance by constructing a six-generation population-size pedigree from national registries and linking it to medical health records.Using Linear Mixed Model-based framework, a common-practice method for heritability estimation, we calculate a heritability measure ofh2=12.6%(95% CI,6.1%-19.1%) for absolute reduction of HbA1c% after metformin treatment in the entire cohort,h2=21.0%(95% CI,7.8%-34.4%) for males andh2=22.9%(95% CI,10.0%-35.7%) in females. Results remain unchanged after adjusting for pre-treatment HbA1c%, and in proportional reduction of HbA1c%.To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to estimate heritability of drug response using solely EHR data combining a pedigree-based kinship matrix. We demonstrate that while response to metformin treatment has a heritable component, most of the variation is likely due to other factors, further motivating non-genetic analyses aimed at unraveling metformin's action mechanism.© The Author(s) 2021."

Our multivariable MR analysis further suggests that the BMI-related effect might be driven by fat mass (OR: 1.63, 1.03-2.58), but not fat-free mass (OR: 1.00, 0.61-1.66). Several white blood cell counts are negatively associated with severe COVID-19, including those of neutrophils (OR: 0.76, 0.61-0.94), granulocytes (OR: 0.75, 0.601-0.93), and myeloid white blood cells (OR: 0.77, 0.62-0.96). Furthermore, some circulating proteins are associated with an increased risk of (e.g., zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein) or protection from severe COVID-19 (e.g., prostate-associated microseminoprotein).Our study suggests that fat mass and white blood cells might be involved in the development of severe COVID-19.

Genome-wide association studies have identified over 200 loci associated with CAD, where the majority of risk variants reside in noncoding DNA sequences impacting cis-regulatory elements. Here, we applied single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing to profile 28,316 nuclei across coronary artery segments from 41 patients with varying stages of CAD, which revealed 14 distinct cellular clusters. We mapped ~320,000 accessible sites across all cells, identified cell-type-specific elements and transcription factors, and prioritized functional CAD risk variants. We identified elements in smooth muscle cell transition states (for example, fibromyocytes) and functional variants predicted to alter smooth muscle cell- and macrophage-specific regulation of MRAS (3q22) and LIPA (10q23), respectively. We further nominated key driver transcription factors such as PRDM16 and TBX2. Together, this single-nucleus atlas provides a critical step towards interpreting regulatory mechanisms across the continuum of CAD risk.© 2022.

We selected five neurodegenerative disorders, namely, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Sleep duration (SD), short sleep (SS), long sleep (LS), chronotype (CHR), morning person (MP), insomnia (INS), and multisite chronic pain (MCP) were considered as exposures. We conducted Mendelian randomization (MR) using an inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method to compute causal effect estimates using latest available GWAS data sets. The MP phenotype was observed as the strongest risk factor for genetic liability to AMD (ORIVW= 1.192; 95% CI 1.078, 1.318,P= 0.0007). We observed suggestive evidence of risky effects of CHR on AMD (P= 0.0034), SS on AD (P= 0.0044), and INS on ALS (P= 0.0123). However, we failed to observe any role of pain. The results were robust on sensitivity analyses. Our study highlighted the role of MP as a risk factor for AMD.Copyright © 2022 Grover, Sharma, and International Age-related Macular Degeneration Genomics Consortium (IAMDGC)."
"35659766","Single-cell RNA sequencing of mitotic-arrested prospermatogonia with DAZL::GFP chickens and revealing unique epigenetic reprogramming of chickens.","J Anim Sci Biotechnol","Germ cell mitotic arrest is conserved in many vertebrates, including birds, although the time of entry or exit into quiescence phase differs. Mitotic arrest is essential for the normal differentiation of male germ cells into spermatogonia and accompanies epigenetic reprogramming and meiosis inhibition from embryonic development to post-hatch. However, mitotic arrest was not well studied in chickens because of the difficulty in obtaining pure germ cells from relevant developmental stage.We performed single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate transcriptional dynamics of male germ cells during mitotic arrest in DAZL::GFP chickens. Using differentially expressed gene analysis and K-means clustering to analyze cells at different developmental stages (E12, E16, and hatch), we found that metabolic and signaling pathways were regulated, and that the epigenome was reprogrammed during mitotic arrest. In particular, we found that histone H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation (by HDAC2) and DNA demethylation (by DNMT3B and HELLS) led to a transcriptionally permissive chromatin state. Furthermore, we found that global DNA demethylation occurred gradually after the onset of mitotic arrest, indicating that the epigenetic-reprogramming schedule of the chicken genome differs from that of the mammalian genome. DNA hypomethylation persisted after hatching, and methylation was slowly re-established 3 weeks later.We found a unique epigenetic-reprogramming schedule of mitotic-arrested chicken prospermatogonia and prolonged hypomethylation after hatching. This will provide a foundation for understanding the process of germ-cell epigenetic regulation in several species for which this process is not clearly described. Our findings on the biological processes related to sex-specific differentiation of prospermatogonia could help studying germline development in vitro more elaborately.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35680998","A phylogenetic and proteomic reconstruction of eukaryotic chromatin evolution.","Nat Ecol Evol","Histones and associated chromatin proteins have essential functions in eukaryotic genome organization and regulation. Despite this fundamental role in eukaryotic cell biology, we lack a phylogenetically comprehensive understanding of chromatin evolution. Here, we combine comparative proteomics and genomics analysis of chromatin in eukaryotes and archaea. Proteomics uncovers the existence of histone post-translational modifications in archaea. However, archaeal histone modifications are scarce, in contrast with the highly conserved and abundant marks we identify across eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that chromatin-associated catalytic functions (for example, methyltransferases) have pre-eukaryotic origins, whereas histone mark readers and chaperones are eukaryotic innovations. We show that further chromatin evolution is characterized by expansion of readers, including capture by transposable elements and viruses. Overall, our study infers detailed evolutionary history of eukaryotic chromatin: from its archaeal roots, through the emergence of nucleosome-based regulation in the eukaryotic ancestor, to the diversification of chromatin regulators and their hijacking by genomic parasites.© 2022.

"35668230","Classification of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome sequences using Neurochaos Learning.","Med Biol Eng Comput","The high spread rate of SARS-CoV-2 virus has put the researchers all over the world in a demanding situation. The need of the hour is to develop novel learning algorithms that can effectively learn a general pattern by training with fewer genome sequences of coronavirus. Learning from very few training samples is necessary and important during the beginning of a disease outbreak when sequencing data is limited. This is because a successful detection and isolation of patients can curb the spread of the virus. However, this poses a huge challenge for machine learning and deep learning algorithms as they require huge amounts of training data to learn the pattern and distinguish from other closely related viruses. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm - Neurochaos Learning (NL) for classification of coronavirus genome sequence that addresses this specific problem. NL is inspired from the empirical evidence of chaos and non-linearity at the level of neurons in biological neural networks. The average sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for NL are 0.998, 0.999 and 0.998 respectively for the multiclass classification problem (SARS-CoV-2, Coronaviridae, Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus and Influenza) using leave one out crossvalidation. With just one training sample per class for 1000 independent random trials of training, we report an average macro F1-score [Formula: see text] for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 genome sequences. We compare the performance of NL with K-nearest neighbours (KNN), logistic regression, random forest, SVM, and naïve Bayes classifiers. We foresee promising future applications in genome classification using NL with novel combinations of chaotic feature engineering and other machine learning algorithms.© 2022.

One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was further used to access the causality between BMI trajectories and NSCLC risk. Additionally, polygenic risk score (PRS) and genome-wide interaction analysis (GWIA) were used to evaluate the multiplicative interaction between BMI trajectories and genetic variants in NSCLC risk.Compared with individuals maintaining a stable normal BMI (n = 47,982, 34.74%), BMI trajectories from normal to overweight (n = 64,498, 46.70%), from normal to obese (n = 21,259, 15.39%), and from overweight to obese (n = 4,371, 3.16%) were associated with a decreased risk of NSCLC (hazard ratio [HR] for trend = 0.78, P < 2×10-16). An MR study using BMI trajectory associated with genetic variants revealed no significant association between BMI trajectories and NSCLC risk. Further analysis of PRS showed that a higher GWAS-identified PRS (PRSGWAS) was associated with an increased risk of NSCLC, while the interaction between BMI trajectories and PRSGWASwith the NSCLC risk was not significant (PsPRS= 0.863 and PwPRS= 0.704). In GWIA analysis, four independent susceptibility loci (P < 1×10-6) were found to be associated with BMI trajectories on NSCLC risk, including rs79297227 (12q14.1, located in SLC16A7, Pinteraction= 1.01×10-7), rs2336652 (3p22.3, near CLASP2, Pinteraction= 3.92×10-7), rs16018 (19p13.2, in CACNA1A, Pinteraction= 3.92×10-7), and rs4726760 (7q34, near BRAF, Pinteraction= 9.19×10-7). Functional annotation demonstrated that these loci may be involved in the development of NSCLC by regulating cell growth, differentiation, and inflammation.Our study has shown an association between BMI trajectories, genetic factors, and NSCLC risk. Interestingly, four novel genetic loci were identified to interact with BMI trajectories on NSCLC risk, providing more support for the aetiology research of NSCLC.http://www.gov , NCT01696968 .© 2022.

"35591976","Immune disease variants modulate gene expression in regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.","Cell Genom","Identifying cellular functions dysregulated by disease-associated variants could implicate novel pathways for drug targeting or modulation in cell therapies. However, follow-up studies can be challenging if disease-relevant cell types are difficult to sample. Variants associated with immune diseases point toward the role of CD4+regulatory T cells (Treg cells). We mapped genetic regulation (quantitative trait loci [QTL]) of gene expression and chromatin activity in Treg cells, and we identified 133 colocalizing loci with immune disease variants. Colocalizations of immune disease genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants with expression QTLs (eQTLs) controlling the expression ofCD28andSTAT5A, involved in Treg cell activation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling, support the contribution of Treg cells to the pathobiology of immune diseases. Finally, we identified seven known drug targets suitable for drug repurposing and suggested 63 targets with drug tractability evidence among the GWAS signals that colocalized with Treg cell QTLs. Our study is the first in-depth characterization of immune disease variant effects on Treg cell gene expression modulation and dysregulation of Treg cell function.© 2022 The Authors."
"35606596","Non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway controls regulatory T cell function by integrating metabolism and epigenetics.","Nat Metab","Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity. Here, we show that the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) regulates Tregfunction to prevent autoimmunity. Deletion of transketolase (TKT), an indispensable enzyme of non-oxidative PPP, in Tregcells causes a fatal autoimmune disease in mice, with impaired Tregsuppressive capability despite regular Tregnumbers and normal Foxp3 expression levels. Mechanistically, reduced glycolysis and enhanced oxidative stress induced by TKT deficiency triggers excessive fatty acid and amino acid catabolism, resulting in uncontrolled oxidative phosphorylation and impaired mitochondrial fitness. Reduced α-KG levels as a result of reductive TCA cycle activity leads to DNA hypermethylation, thereby limiting functional gene expression and suppressive activity of TKT-deficient Tregcells. We also find that TKT levels are frequently downregulated in Tregcells of people with autoimmune disorders. Our study identifies the non-oxidative PPP as an integrator of metabolic and epigenetic processes that control Tregfunction.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."

However, the classifications of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutant ccRCC are unclear. Here, VHL mutant ccRCC from The Cancer Genome Atlas and E-MTAB-1980 datasets were divided into two sub-clusters through non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. Most VHL mutant ccRCC patients in sub-cluster2 were with pathological T1 stage and VHL mutant ccRCC patients in sub-cluster1 were with decreased overall survival. DNA replication and homologous recombination scores were higher, while, WNT signaling pathway and regulation of autophagy scores were lower in sub-cluster1 VHL mutant ccRCC. Moreover, PBX1 transcriptional scores and mRNA expressions were lower in sub-cluster1 VHL mutant ccRCC patients and were associated with the overall survival of VHL mutant ccRCC. Furthermore, PBX1 associated genes EMCN and ERG were down-regulated in sub-cluster1 VHL mutant ccRCC and overall survival was decreased in EMCN or ERG lowly expressed VHL mutant ccRCC patients. Also, PBX1 and EMCN were down-regulated in ccRCC tissues, compared with normal kidney tissues. At last, we constructed risk models based on PBX1, EMCN and EGR expression features. With the increase of the risk score, the number of death of VHL mutant ccRCC patients was increased.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35676498","Maternal PUFAs, Placental Epigenetics, and Their Relevance to Fetal Growth and Brain Development.","Reprod Sci","Dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially omega-3 (n-3) and n-6 long-chain (LC) PUFAs, are indispensable for the fetus' brain supplied by the placenta. Despite being highly unsaturated, n-3 LCPUFA-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plays a protective role as an antioxidant in the brain. Deficiency of DHA during fetal development may cause irreversible damages in neurodevelopment programming. Dietary PUFAs can impact placental structure and functions by regulating early placentation processes, such as angiogenesis. They promote remodeling of uteroplacental architecture to facilitate increased blood flow and surface area for nutrient exchange. The placenta's fatty acid transfer depends on the uteroplacental vascular development, ensuring adequate maternal circulatory fatty acids transport to fulfill the fetus' rapid growth and development requirements. Maternal n-3 PUFA deficiency predominantly leads to placental epigenetic changes than other fetal developing organs. A global shift in DNA methylation possibly transmits epigenetic instability in developing fetuses due to n-3 PUFA deficiency. Thus, an optimal level of maternal omega-3 (n-3) PUFAs may protect the placenta's structural and functional integrity and allow fetal growth by controlling the aberrant placental epigenetic changes. This narrative review summarizes the recent advances and underpins the roles of maternal PUFAs on the structure and functions of the placenta and their relevance to fetal growth and brain development.© 2022.

"35585924","Detecting Brain Structure-Specific Methylation Signatures and Rules for Alzheimer's Disease.","Front Neurosci","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease that leads to irreversible behavioral changes, erratic emotions, and loss of motor skills. These conditions make people with AD hard or almost impossible to take care of. Multiple internal and external pathological factors may affect or even trigger the initiation and progression of AD. DNA methylation is one of the most effective regulatory roles during AD pathogenesis, and pathological methylation alterations may be potentially different in the various brain structures of people with AD. Although multiple loci associated with AD initiation and progression have been identified, the spatial distribution patterns of AD-associated DNA methylation in the brain have not been clarified. According to the systematic methylation profiles on different structural brain regions, we applied multiple machine learning algorithms to investigate such profiles. First, the profile on each brain region was analyzed by the Boruta feature filtering method. Some important methylation features were extracted and further analyzed by the max-relevance and min-redundancy method, resulting in a feature list. Then, the incremental feature selection method, incorporating some classification algorithms, adopted such list to identify candidate AD-associated loci at methylation with structural specificity, establish a group of quantitative rules for revealing the effects of DNA methylation in various brain regions (i.e., four brain structures) on AD pathogenesis. Furthermore, some efficient classifiers based on essential methylation sites were proposed to identify AD samples. Results revealed that methylation alterations in different brain structures have different contributions to AD pathogenesis. This study further illustrates the complex pathological mechanisms of AD.Copyright © 2022 Li, Guo, Zeng, Yin, Feng, Huang and Cai."

We sought for a sparse set of CpG sites predicting lung cancer and explored the role of smoking in these associations. We analysed CpGs in relation to lung cancer in participants from two nested case-control studies, using (LASSO)-penalised regression. We accounted for the effects of smoking using known smoking-related CpGs, and through conditional-independence network. We identified 29 CpGs (8 smoking-related, 21 smoking-unrelated) associated with lung cancer. Models additionally adjusted for Comprehensive Smoking Index-(CSI) selected 1 smoking-related and 49 smoking-unrelated CpGs. Selected CpGs yielded excellent discriminatory performances, outperforming information provided by CSI only. Of the 8 selected smoking-related CpGs, two captured lung cancer-relevant effects of smoking that were missed by CSI. Further, the 50 CpGs identified in the CSI-adjusted model complementarily explained lung cancer risk. These markers may provide further insight into lung cancer carcinogenesis and help improving early identification of high-risk patients.© 2022. The Author(s)."

For women's health, there are important physiologic, neurologic, and hormonal distinctions throughout the lifecycle that impact nutritional needs. Distinct from those for men, these nutritional needs must be translated into appropriate nutrition policy that aims to not only avoid overt nutritional deficiency, but also to promote health and minimize risk for chronic disease. Through a series of webinars, scientific experts discussed the advances in the understanding of the unique nutritional needs, challenges and opportunities of the various life stages for women across the life course and identified emerging nutritional interventions that may be beneficial for women. Nevertheless, there is concern that existing nutrition policy intended for women's health is falling short with examples of programs that are focused more on delivering calories than achieving optimal nutrition. To be locally effective, targeted nutrition needs to offer different proposals for different cultural, socio-economic, and geographic communities, and needs to be applicable at all stages of growth and development. There must be adequate access to nutritious foods, and the information to understand and implement proven nutritional opportunities. Experts provided recommendations for improvement of current entitlement programs that will address accessibility and other social and environmental issues to support women properly throughout the lifecycle.© 2022.

Recent studies showed differential circulating miRNAs in AIS but their diagnostic potential and links to low bone mass have not been well-documented. The present study aimed to compare miRNA profiles in bone tissues collected from AIS and non-scoliotic subjects, and to explore if the selected miRNA candidates could be useful diagnostic biomarkers for AIS. Microarray analysis identified miR-96-5p being the most upregulated among the candidates. miR-96-5p level was measured in plasma samples from 100 AIS and 52 healthy girls. Our results showed significantly higher plasma levels of miR-96-5p in AIS girls with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.671 for diagnostic accuracy. A model that was composed of plasma miR-96-5p and patient-specific parameters (age, body weight and years since menarche) gave rise to an improved AUC of 0.752. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) indicated functional links between bone metabolic pathways and miR-96-5p. In conclusion, differentially expressed miRNAs in AIS bone and plasma samples represented a new source of disease biomarkers and players in AIS etiopathogenesis, which required further validation study involving AIS patients of both genders with long-term follow-up.© 2022.

To identify co-expressed miRNA modules in schizophrenia patients and verify the possibility of using peripheral blood miRNAs as novel biomarkers, high-throughput sequencing was performed on 15 first-episode schizophrenia patients (FES) and 15 healthy controls (CTL). We found 79 differential expressed miRNAs (DEMs) in FES patients and three FES-related co-expression miRNA modules by miRNA-seq data standardized difference analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Then, 41 hub miRNAs were screened from the intersection of key modules and DEMs, among which miR-9-5p, miR-144-3p, miR-328-3p, and miR-4467 were selected for qRT-PCR verification in a larger sample (FES = 35, CTL = 60). The level of miR-9-5p in FES patients was downregulated, and miR-4467 was upregulated with better diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.719). The target genes of miR-9-5p engage in the biological processes (BP) such as body behaviour, neuronal differentiation regulation, nervous system development, and neurotrophin signaling pathways. Their hub target genes were also located, including NEDD4, EIF4G1, FBXL16, and FBXL3. Summarily, miR-9-5p and miR-4467 hold promise in blood diagnosis for SCZ, and miR-9-5p might affect the onset and development of SCZ through target regulation of neurodevelopment-related mRNAs.

In obesity, immune cell derived inflammation contributes to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Diet-induced weight loss improves glucose tolerance; however, weight regain further exacerbates the impairment in glucose homeostasis observed with obesity. To interrogate the immunometabolic adaptations that occur in AT during murine weight loss and weight regain, we utilized cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITEseq) in male mice. Obesity-induced imprinting of AT immune cells persisted through weight-loss and progressively worsened with weight regain, ultimately leading to impaired recovery of type 2 regulatory cells, activation of antigen presenting cells, T cell exhaustion, and enhanced lipid handling in macrophages in weight cycled mice. This work provides critical groundwork for understanding the immunological causes of weight cycling-accelerated metabolic disease.

While microgravity-induced differential gene expression (DGE) has been extensively investigated, the contribution of differential alternative splicing (DAS) to the plasticity and functional status of the skeletal muscle transcriptome has not been studied in an animal model. Therefore, by evaluating both DGE and DAS across spaceflight, we set out to provide the first comprehensive characterization of the transcriptomic landscape of skeletal muscle during exposure to microgravity.RNA-sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and morphological analyses were conducted utilizing total RNA and tissue sections isolated from the gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles of 30-week-old female BALB/c mice exposed to microgravity or ground control conditions for 9 weeks.In response to microgravity, the skeletal muscle transcriptome was remodeled via both DGE and DAS. Importantly, while DGE showed variable gene network enrichment, DAS was enriched in structural and functional gene networks of skeletal muscle, resulting in the expression of alternatively spliced transcript isoforms that have been associated with the physiological changes to skeletal muscle in microgravity, including muscle atrophy and altered fiber type function. Finally, RNA-binding proteins, which are required for regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, were themselves differentially spliced but not differentially expressed, an upstream event that is speculated to account for the downstream splicing changes identified in target skeletal muscle genes.Our work serves as the first investigation of coordinate changes in DGE and DAS in large limb muscles across spaceflight. It opens up a new opportunity to understand (i) the molecular mechanisms by which splice variants of skeletal muscle genes regulate the physiological adaptations of skeletal muscle to microgravity and (ii) how small molecule splicing regulator therapies might thwart muscle atrophy and alterations to fiber type function during prolonged spaceflight.© 2022.

"35697834","Direct identification of A-to-I editing sites with nanopore native RNA sequencing.","Nat Methods","Inosine is a prevalent RNA modification in animals and is formed when an adenosine is deaminated by the ADAR family of enzymes. Traditionally, inosines are identified indirectly as variants from Illumina RNA-sequencing data because they are interpreted as guanosines by cellular machineries. However, this indirect method performs poorly in protein-coding regions where exons are typically short, in non-model organisms with sparsely annotated single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or in disease contexts where unknown DNA mutations are pervasive. Here, we show that Oxford Nanopore direct RNA sequencing can be used to identify inosine-containing sites in native transcriptomes with high accuracy. We trained convolutional neural network models to distinguish inosine from adenosine and guanosine, and to estimate the modification rate at each editing site. Furthermore, we demonstrated their utility on the transcriptomes of human, mouse and Xenopus. Our approach expands the toolkit for studying adenosine-to-inosine editing and can be further extended to investigate other RNA modifications.© 2022.

"35637517","3D genome organization in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition spectrum.","Genome Biol","The plasticity along the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) spectrum has been shown to be regulated by various epigenetic repertoires. Emerging evidence of local chromatin conformation changes suggests that regulation of EMT may occur at a higher order of three-dimensional genome level.We perform Hi-C analysis and combine ChIP-seq data across cancer cell lines representing different EMT states. We demonstrate that the epithelial and mesenchymal genes are regulated distinctively. We find that EMT genes are regulated within their topologically associated domains (TADs), with only a subset of mesenchymal genes being influenced by A/B compartment switches, indicating topological remodeling is required in the transcriptional regulation of these genes. At the TAD level, epithelial and mesenchymal genes are associated with different regulatory trajectories. The epithelial gene-residing TADs are enriched with H3K27me3 marks in the mesenchymal-like states. The mesenchymal gene-residing TADs, which do not show enrichment of H3K27me3 in epithelial-like states, exhibit increased interaction frequencies with regulatory elements in the mesenchymal-like states.We propose a novel workflow coupling immunofluorescence and dielectrophoresis to unravel EMT heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. The predicted three-dimensional structures of chromosome 10, harboring Vimentin, identify cell clusters of different states. Our results pioneer a novel avenue to decipher the complexities underlying the regulation of EMT and may infer the barriers of plasticity in the 3D genome context.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35637420","Identifying synergistic high-order 3D chromatin conformations from genome-scale nanopore concatemer sequencing.","Nat Biotechnol","High-order three-dimensional (3D) interactions between more than two genomic loci are common in human chromatin, but their role in gene regulation is unclear. Previous high-order 3D chromatin assays either measure distant interactions across the genome or proximal interactions at selected targets. To address this gap, we developed Pore-C, which combines chromatin conformation capture with nanopore sequencing of concatemers to profile proximal high-order chromatin contacts at the genome scale. We also developed the statistical method Chromunity to identify sets of genomic loci with frequencies of high-order contacts significantly higher than background ('synergies'). Applying these methods to human cell lines, we found that synergies were enriched in enhancers and promoters in active chromatin and in highly transcribed and lineage-defining genes. In prostate cancer cells, these included binding sites of androgen-driven transcription factors and the promoters of androgen-regulated genes. Concatemers of high-order contacts in highly expressed genes were demethylated relative to pairwise contacts at the same loci. Synergies in breast cancer cells were associated with tyfonas, a class of complex DNA amplicons. These results rigorously link genome-wide high-order 3D interactions to lineage-defining transcriptional programs and establish Pore-C and Chromunity as scalable approaches to assess high-order genome structure.© 2022.

Lactate concentrations, oxygen consumption rate and metabolomics were examined as mechanistic endpoints. In vivo plasma concentrations of IACS-010759 in mice were determined by LC-MS to select a dose that reflected clinically attainable concentrations.In vitro, the combination of AZD3965 and IACS-010759 is synergistic and induces DLBCL cell death, whereas monotherapy treatments induce a cytostatic response. Significant anti-tumour activity was evident in Toledo and Farage models when the two inhibitors were administered concurrently despite limited or no effect on the growth of DLBCL xenografts as monotherapies.This is the first study to examine a combination of two distinct approaches to targeting tumour metabolism in DLBCL xenografts. Whilst nanomolar concentrations of either AZD3965 or IACS-010759 monotherapy demonstrate anti-proliferative activity against DLBCL cell lines in vitro, appreciable clinical activity in DLBCL patients may only be realised through their combined use.© 2022.

Pioneering efforts in recent decades have established the core protein componentry of these organelles1and have linked their dysfunction to more than 150 distinct disorders2,3. Still, hundreds of mitochondrial proteins lack clear functions4, and the underlying genetic basis for approximately 40% of mitochondrial disorders remains unresolved5. Here, to establish a more complete functional compendium of human mitochondrial proteins, we profiled more than 200 CRISPR-mediated HAP1 cell knockout lines using mass spectrometry-based multiomics analyses. This effort generated approximately 8.3 million distinct biomolecule measurements, providing a deep survey of the cellular responses to mitochondrial perturbations and laying a foundation for mechanistic investigations into protein function. Guided by these data, we discovered that PIGY upstream open reading frame (PYURF) is an S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase chaperone that supports both complex I assembly and coenzyme Q biosynthesis and is disrupted in a previously unresolved multisystemic mitochondrial disorder. We further linked the putative zinc transporter SLC30A9 to mitochondrial ribosomes and OxPhos integrity and established RAB5IF as the second gene harbouring pathogenic variants that cause cerebrofaciothoracic dysplasia.

"35614096","Mutational signatures are markers of drug sensitivity of cancer cells.","Nat Commun","Genomic analyses have revealed mutational footprints associated with DNA maintenance gone awry, or with mutagen exposures. Because cancer therapeutics often target DNA synthesis or repair, we asked if mutational signatures make useful markers of drug sensitivity. We detect mutational signatures in cancer cell line exomes (where matched healthy tissues are not available) by adjusting for the confounding germline mutation spectra across ancestries. We identify robust associations between various mutational signatures and drug activity across cancer cell lines; these are as numerous as associations with established genetic markers such as driver gene alterations. Signatures of prior exposures to DNA damaging agents - including chemotherapy - tend to associate with drug resistance, while signatures of deficiencies in DNA repair tend to predict sensitivity towards particular therapeutics. Replication analyses across independent drug and CRISPR genetic screening data sets reveal hundreds of robust associations, which are provided as a resource for drug repurposing guided by mutational signature markers.© 2022.

"35595749","A 3D gene expression atlas of the floral meristem based on spatial reconstruction of single nucleus RNA sequencing data.","Nat Commun","Cellular heterogeneity in growth and differentiation results in organ patterning. Single-cell transcriptomics allows characterization of gene expression heterogeneity in developing organs at unprecedented resolution. However, the original physical location of the cell is lost during this methodology. To recover the original location of cells in the developing organ is essential to link gene activity with cellular identity and function in plants. Here, we propose a method to reconstruct genome-wide gene expression patterns of individual cells in a 3D flower meristem by combining single-nuclei RNA-seq with microcopy-based 3D spatial reconstruction. By this, gene expression differences among meristematic domains giving rise to different tissue and organ types can be determined. As a proof of principle, the method is used to trace the initiation of vascular identity within the floral meristem. Our work demonstrates the power of spatially reconstructed single cell transcriptome atlases to understand plant morphogenesis.

"35660939","DNA-methylome-assisted classification of patients with poor prognostic subventricular zone associated IDH-wildtype glioblastoma.","Acta Neuropathol","Glioblastoma (GBM) derived from the ""stem cell"" rich subventricular zone (SVZ) may constitute a therapy-refractory subgroup of tumors associated with poor prognosis. Risk stratification for these cases is necessary but is curtailed by error prone imaging-based evaluation. Therefore, we aimed to establish a robust DNA methylome-based classification of SVZ GBM and subsequently decipher underlying molecular characteristics. MRI assessment of SVZ association was performed in a retrospective training set of IDH-wildtype GBM patients (n = 54) uniformly treated with postoperative chemoradiotherapy. DNA isolated from FFPE samples was subject to methylome and copy number variation (CNV) analysis using Illumina Platform and cnAnalysis450k package. Deep next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a panel of 130 GBM-related genes was conducted (Agilent SureSelect/Illumina). Methylome, transcriptome, CNV, MRI, and mutational profiles of SVZ GBM were further evaluated in a confirmatory cohort of 132 patients (TCGA/TCIA). A 15 CpG SVZ methylation signature (SVZM) was discovered based on clustering and random forest analysis. One third of CpG in the SVZM were associated with MAB21L2/LRBA. There was a 14.8% (n = 8) discordance between SVZM vs. MRI classification. Re-analysis of these patients favored SVZM classification with a hazard ratio (HR) for OS of 2.48 [95% CI 1.35-4.58], p = 0.004 vs. 1.83 [1.0-3.35], p = 0.049 for MRI classification. In the validation cohort, consensus MRI based assignment was achieved in 62% of patients with an intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.51 and non-significant HR for OS (2.03 [0.81-5.09], p = 0.133). In contrast, SVZM identified two prognostically distinct subgroups (HR 3.08 [1.24-7.66], p = 0.016). CNV alterations revealed loss of chromosome 10 in SVZM- and gains on chromosome 19 in SVZM- tumors. SVZM- tumors were also enriched for differentially mutated genes (p < 0.001). In summary, SVZM classification provides a novel means for stratifying GBM patients with poor prognosis and deciphering molecular mechanisms governing aggressive tumor phenotypes.© 2022.

However, the role of the FAM83 family in the development of breast tumors is unclear to date. This report explores the expression, prognostic significance, and function of the FAM83 family members in breast cancer using public databases.UALCAN database was used to explore the expression of FAM83 family members in breast cancer. Furthermore, we validated the expression of FAM83 family members in twenty pairs of breast cancer and normal tissues by RT-PCR. Kaplan-Meier plotter database was used to explore the prognostic significance of FAM83 family members in breast cancer. GeneMANIA and DAVID databases were used for functional and pathway enrichment analysis of genes co-expressed with FAM83A, FAM83D, FAM83F, and FAM83G. MEXPRESS and UALCAN databases were used to analyze the level of DNA promoter methylation of FAM83A, FAM83D, FAM83F, and FAM83G in breast cancer. TIMER database was utilized to explore the relationships between immune cell infiltration and FAM83A, FAM83D, FAM83F, and FAM83G expression.Among FAM83 family members, FAM83A, FAM83D, FAM83F, and FAM83G were higher expressed in breast cancer than in normal tissues. We also validated the significant high expression of FAM83A, FAM83D, FAM83F, and FAM83G mRNA in breast cancer than in normal samples. Their increased expression has an adverse prognostic effect on breast cancer patients. These genes co-expressed with FAM83A, FAM83D, FAM83F, and FAM83G might take part in cell proliferation, G2/M transition of the mitotic cell cycle, regulation of apoptosis process and other cancer-related biological processes. In addition, they were mainly enriched in the Hippo signaling pathway, Hedgehog signaling pathway, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and other cancer-related pathways. We also found that promoter DNA methylation might regulate the expression of FAM83A, FAM83D, FAM83F, and FAM83G mRNA in most CpG islands. At last, we found the expression of FAM83A, FAM83D, FAM83F, and FAM83G mRNA was significantly related to immune cell infiltration.FAM83A, FAM83D, FAM83F, and FAM83G were highly expressed in breast cancer tissues and had an adverse effect on the survival outcomes of breast cancer patients. Also, they were involved in breast cancer-related signal pathways. Therefore, they might serve as potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer clinical treatment.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Understanding the reasons will be beneficial for treating women with lung cancer in the future. In this study, we found that tumor formation was more significant in female EGFRL858Rmice than in male mice. P53 expression levels were downregulated in the estradiol (E2)-treated lung cancer cells, female mice with EGFRL858R-induced lung cancer mice, and premenopausal women with lung cancer. E2 increased DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression to enhance methylation in the TP53 promoter, which led to the downregulation of p53. Overexpression of GFP-p53 decreased DNMT1 expression in lung cancer cells. TP53 knockout in mice with EGFRL858R-induced lung cancer not only changed gene expression in cancer cells but also increased the polarization of M2 macrophages by increasing C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) expression and decreasing growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) expression. The TP53 mutation rate was increased in females with late-stage but not early-stage lung cancer compared to males with lung cancer. In conclusion, E2-induced DNMT1 and p53 expression were negatively regulated each other in females with lung cancer, which not only affected cancer cells but also modulated the tumor-associated microenvironment, ultimately leading to a poor prognosis.© 2022.

"35581740","Differences in the expression of DNA methyltransferases and demethylases in leukocytes and the severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension between ethnic groups.","Physiol Rep","The loss of ten-eleven translocation (TET2) methylcytosine dioxygenase expression contributes to the pathobiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, whether the expression and activity of other TETs and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are altered in PAH remains enigmatic. Therefore, our objective was to determine the expression of DNMT (1, 3a, and 3b) and TET (1, 2, and 3) and their total activity. We assessed the expression of DNMT and TET enzymes in the leukocytes and their activity in extracellular vesicles (EVs). Expression of DNMT (1, 3a, and 3b), TET (2 and 3) in leukocytes, and total activity in EVs, from PAH patients was higher than in healthy controls. Additionally, we noticed there were difference in expression of these epigenetic enzyme based on ethnicity and found higher DNMT1 and lower TET2/TET3 expression in Caucasian than Hispanic/African American (combine) patients. Since loss-of-function mutation(s) and down-regulation of TET enzymes are associated with hematological malignancies and cytokine production, we determined the expression of genes that encode cytokines in samples of Caucasian and Hispanic/African American patients. Expression of IL6, CSF2, and CCL5 genes were higher in the leukocytes of Caucasian than Hispanic/African American patients, and CSF2 and CCL5 negatively correlated with the decreased expression of TET3. Interestingly, the expression of gene encoding CD34, a marker of myeloid and lymphoid precursor cells, and CD163, a monocyte/macrophage protein, was higher in the leukocytes of Caucasian than Hispanic/African American patients. Furthermore, Hispanic/African American patients having higher TET2/TET3 expression had higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. In conclusion, our results revealed higher DNMT1 and lower TET2/TET3 in Caucasian than Hispanic/African American patients together potentially augmented genes encoding inflammation causing cytokines, and CD34+-derived immunogenic cells, and the severity of PAH.© 2022 The Authors.

"35650446","How genetic risk contributes to autoimmune liver disease.","Semin Immunopathol","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and GWAS/genome-wide meta-analyses (GWMA) for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) have been successful over the past decade, identifying about 100 susceptibility loci in the human genome, with strong associations with the HLA locus and many susceptibility variants outside the HLA locus with relatively low risk. However, identifying causative variants and genes and determining their effects on liver cells and their immunological microenvironment is far from trivial. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) based on current genome-wide data have limited potential to predict individual disease risk. Interestingly, results of mediated expression score regression analysis provide evidence that a substantial portion of gene expression at susceptibility loci is mediated by genetic risk variants, in contrast to many other complex diseases. Genome- and transcriptome-wide comparisons between AIH, PBC, and PSC could help to better delineate the shared inherited component of autoimmune liver diseases (AILDs), and statistical fine-mapping, chromosome X-wide association testing, and genome-wide in silico drug screening approaches recently applied to GWMA data from PBC could potentially be successfully applied to AIH and PSC. Initial successes through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments in PBC and PSC now raise high hopes for understanding the impact of genetic risk variants in the context of liver-resident immune cells and liver cell subpopulations, and for bridging the gap between genetics and disease.© 2022.

"35618845","Immune disease risk variants regulate gene expression dynamics during CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation.","Nat Genet","During activation, T cells undergo extensive gene expression changes that shape the properties of cells to exert their effector function. Understanding the regulation of this process could help explain how genetic variants predispose to immune diseases. Here, we mapped genetic effects on gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) using single-cell transcriptomics. We profiled 655,349 CD4+T cells, capturing transcriptional states of unstimulated cells and three time points of cell activation in 119 healthy individuals. This identified 38 cell clusters, including transient clusters that were only present at individual time points of activation. We found 6,407 genes whose expression was correlated with genetic variation, of which 2,265 (35%) were dynamically regulated during activation. Furthermore, 127 genes were regulated by variants associated with immune-mediated diseases, with significant enrichment for dynamic effects. Our results emphasize the importance of studying context-specific gene expression regulation and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying genetic susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases.© 2022.

"35606385","Development and validation of an RNA-seq-based transcriptomic risk score for asthma.","Sci Rep","Recent progress in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) allows us to explore whole-genome gene expression profiles and to develop predictive model for disease risk. The objective of this study was to develop and validate an RNA-seq-based transcriptomic risk score (RSRS) for disease risk prediction that can simultaneously accommodate demographic information. We analyzed RNA-seq gene expression data from 441 asthmatic and 254 non-asthmatic samples. Logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression analysis in the training set identified 73 differentially expressed genes (DEG) to form a weighted RSRS that discriminated asthmatics from healthy subjects with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 in the testing set after adjustment for age and gender. The 73-gene RSRS was validated in three independent RNA-seq datasets and achieved AUCs of 0.70, 0.77 and 0.60, respectively. To explore their biological and molecular functions in asthma phenotype, we examined the 73 genes by enrichment pathway analysis and found that these genes were significantly (p < 0.0001) enriched for DNA replication, recombination, and repair, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, and eumelanin biosynthesis and developmental disorder. Further in-silico analyses of the 73 genes using Connectivity map shows that drugs (mepacrine, dactolisib) and genetic perturbagens (PAK1, GSR, RBM15 and TNFRSF12A) were identified and could potentially be repurposed for treating asthma. These findings show the promise for RNA-seq risk scores to stratify and predict disease risk.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35581642","Explaining the complex impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on children with overweight and obesity: a comparative ecological analysis of parents' perceptions in three countries.","BMC Public Health","The Covid-19 pandemic has changed children's eating and physical activity behaviours. These changes have been positive for some households and negative for others, revealing health inequalities that have ramifications for childhood obesity. This study investigates the pandemic's impact on families of children aged 2-6 years with overweight or obesity.Drawing on interviews conducted as part of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) for childhood obesity, thematic analysis was used to examine how parents of pre-schoolers perceived changes in their eating, screentime and physical activity behaviours between the first and second waves of Covid-19. Parents (n = 70, representing 68 families) were interviewed twice during a period of 6 months in three countries with markedly different pandemic policies - Sweden, Romania, and Spain. The analysis is informed by Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, which embeds home- and school-based influences within societal and policy contexts.The findings show that, although all participants were recruited from an RCT for families of children with excess weight, they reported different responses to the pandemic's second wave, with some children engaging in healthier eating and physical activity, and others engaging in comfort eating and a more sedentary lifestyle. Differences in children's obesity-related behaviours were closely related to differences in parents' practices, which were, in turn, linked to their emotional and social wellbeing. Notably, across all sites, parents' feeding and physical activity facilitation practices, as well as their emotional and social wellbeing, were embedded in household resilience. In resilient households, where parents had secure housing and employment, they were better able to adapt to the challenges posed by the pandemic, whereas parents who experienced household insecurity found it more difficult to cope.As the Covid-19 pandemic is turning into a long-term public health challenge, studies that address household resilience are crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment responses to childhood obesity.© 2022.

Here we performed automated extraction of ascending aortic diameter from cardiac magnetic resonance images of 36,021 individuals from the UK Biobank, followed by genome-wide association. We identified lead variants across 41 loci, including genes related to cardiovascular development (HAND2, TBX20) and Mendelian forms of thoracic aortic disease (ELN, FBN1). A polygenic score significantly predicted prevalent risk of thoracic aortic aneurysm and the need for surgical intervention for patients with thoracic aneurysm across multiple ancestries within the UK Biobank, FinnGen, the Penn Medicine Biobank and the Million Veterans Program (MVP). Additionally, we highlight the primary causal role of blood pressure in reducing aortic dilation using Mendelian randomization.

Here, we aimed to conduct TMB-based gene signature and molecular subtypes in gastric cancer.Based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between high- and low-TMB groups in TCGA, a LASSO model was developed for predicting overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The predictive performance was externally verified in the GSE84437 dataset. Molecular subtypes were conducted via consensus clustering approach based on TMB-related DEGs. The immune microenvironment was estimated by ESTIMATE and ssGSEA algorithms.High-TMB patients had prolonged survival duration. TMB-related DEGs were distinctly enriched in cancer- (MAPK, P53, PI3K-Akt, and Wnt pathways) and immune-related pathways (T cell selection and differentiation). The TMB-based gene model was developed (including MATN3, UPK1B, GPX3, and RGS2), and high-risk score was predictive of poor prognosis and recurrence. ROC and multivariate analyses revealed the well predictive performance, which was confirmed in the external cohort. Furthermore, we established the nomogram containing the risk score, age, and stage for personalized prediction of OS and DFS. High-risk score was characterized by high stromal score, increased immune checkpoints, immune cell infiltrations, and enhanced sensitivity to gefitinib, vinorelbine, and gemcitabine. Three TMB-based molecular subtypes were conducted, characterized by distinct prognosis, immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity.Collectively, we established a prognostic signature and three distinct molecular subtypes based on TMB features for gastric cancer, which might be beneficial for prognostic prediction and clinical decision-making.Copyright © 2022 Cheng Wei et al."

The relationships between molecular subtypes and prognosis and clinical characteristics were further explored. IRGs were acquired from the ImmPort database, and round-robin pairing of immune-related lncRNAs was performed. The NMF algorithm was used to identify molecular subtypes, and the immune score of a single sample was calculated through ESTIMATE, TIMER, ssGSEA, MCPcounter, and CIBERSORT. The relationship between molecular subtypes and immune microenvironments was identified. A hypergeometric test was used to test the lncRNA pairs among the OV molecular subtypes (C1 and C2 subtypes). The BH method was used to screen the different lncRNA pairs, and a predictive risk model was constructed and verified. Finally, correlation analysis between the risk model, immune checkpoint genes, and chemotherapy drugs was carried out. Based on IRLnc_GP to classify 373 OV samples of TCGA, the samples were divided into two subtypes, and the prognosis between the subtypes showed significant differences. The C1 subtype with a poor prognosis was more related to the pathways of tumor occurrence and development. We identified 180 differential lncRNA pairs between subtypes and constructed a prognostic risk model based on 8 IRLnc_GPs. In the independent dataset, the distribution of subtypes in functional modules was different and highly repeatable. There were significant differences in the molecular and clinical characteristics of the subtypes and the drug sensitivity of immunotherapy/chemotherapy. In conclusion, the risk model established based on IRLnc_GP can better evaluate the prognosis of OV samples and can also assess the effects of different drug treatments in the high- and low-risk groups, providing new insights and ideas for the treatment of OV.Copyright © 2022 Xingling Wang et al."

NfL is linked to mortality in neurological disorders, remaining unexplored in population studies. We investigated whether initial (v1) and annualized change (δ) in plasma NfL can predict all-cause mortality in middle-aged dementia-free urban adults.Longitudinal data were from 694 participants in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span study (HANDLS, mean agev1: 47.8 years, 42% male, 55.8% African American). Plasma NfL was measured prospectively at three visits. Analyses included Cox proportional hazards models for all-cause mortality risk and 4-way decomposition testing for interaction and mediation.Unlike men, women exhibited a direct association between δNfL (above vs. below median) and all-cause mortality risk in both the minimally (HR = 3.91, 95% CI 1.10-13.9, p = 0.036) and fully adjusted models (HR = 4.92, 95% CI 1.26-19.2, p = 0.022), and for δNfL (per unit increase) in the full model (HR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.04-2.61, p = 0.034). In both models, and among women, 1 standard deviation of NfLv1was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk (reduced model: HR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.24-3.25, p = 0.005; full model: HR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.02-2.98, p = 0.041). Only few interactions were detected for cardio-metabolic risk factors. Notably, NfLv1was shown to be a better prognostic indicator at normal hsCRP values among women, while HbA1c and δNfL interacted synergistically to determine mortality risk, overall.These findings indicate that plasma NfL levels at baseline and over time can predict all-cause mortality in women and interacts with hsCRP and HbA1c to predict that risk.© 2022.

Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins-7 (IGFBP7), as a member of the IGF family, is associated with osteogenic differentiation and the senescence of MSCs, but its exact function and mechanism remain unclear. We found IGFBP7 promoted the osteogenic differentiation and prevented the senescence of dental pulp-derived MSCs (DPSCs), as observed in the gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses, the senescence-associated marker p21 showed the most pronounced expression changes. We demonstrated that IGFBP7 activated the biological activity of SIRT1 deacetylase via metabolism, resulting in a deacetylation of H3K36ac and a decrease of the binding affinity of H3K36ac to p21 promoter, thereby reducing the transcription of p21, which ultimately prevents DPSCs senescence and promotes tissue regeneration. The activation of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) by Coenzyme Q10 could rescue the promotion of DPSC senescence induced by the knockdown of IGFBP7, whereas the inhibition of ETC by rotenone attenuated the prevention of DPSC senescence induced by IGFBP7 overexpression. In conclusion, our present results reveal a novel function of IGFBP7 in preventing DPSC senescence via the metabolism-induced deacetylation of H3K36ac and reduction of p21 transcription, suggesting that IGFBP7 is a potential target for promoting tissue regeneration in an aging environment.© 2022.

The study is a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study involving 203 stable CAD patients. Patients were divided into two groups, based on the optimal AST/ALT ratio threshold calculated by the ROC curve (low group: AST/ALT ratio < 1.40; high group: AST/ALT ratio ≥ 1.40). Results were compared using hazard ratio (HR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI). ACM occurred in 18 patients after an average follow-up time of 749 (435-1122) days. Among them, ACM occurred in 6 patients in the low group and 12 patients in the high group, with significant differences between the groups (4.65% versus 16.22%, P value = 0.005). In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, an elevated AST/ALT ratio was associated with increased ACM in stable ACD patients (HR 3.78, 95% CI 1.44-9.93, P value < 0.001). An elevated AST/ALT ratio was still found to be an independent prognostic factor for ACM (HR 2.93, 95% CI 1.08-7.91, P value = 0.034) after adjusting for potential confounders. Therefore, an elevated AST/ALT ratio is an independent prognostic factor for ACM in stable ACD patients.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The incidence rate is increasing year by year, which seriously threatens the safety of maternal and infant. Obesity is a vital factor in inducing GDM. Pregnant women with GDM account for a large proportion of overweight and obese pregnant women. Our study aimed to explore the potential mechanism of differential metabolites on inflammation and find the intervention and management methods for GDM in overweight and obese pregnant women.Umbilical cord blood samples and placenta were collected from normal weight pregnant women with GDM (control group) and overweight and obese pregnant women with GDM (obesity group) for a comparative study. Serum inflammatory factors IL-10, TNF-α, IL-6, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and TLR4 expression were detected by ELISA. The expression levels of BCL-2 and caspase-3 were measured by Western blot. TUNEL staining was used to observe the apoptosis of placental villi. KEGG combined with metabolomics was used to compare the differences of metabolic maps between the two groups.Compared with the control group, the level of anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 in the cord blood was decreased in the obesity group, while the levels of proinflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-6, and LPS were increased. In the placental tissues, the obesity group had higher concentrations of LPS, TLR4, and caspase-3 and lower concentration of BCL-2. Placental villi in the obesity group were more likely to undergo apoptosis than the control group. Correlation analysis showed that the above metabolite concentrations were negatively correlated with TNF-αor LPS.Metabolites could control obesity in the process of controlling the occurrence and development of inflammation.Copyright © 2022 Qiuling Chen et al."
"35600523","Trauma in Context: an Integrative Treatment Model.","J Child Adolesc Trauma","Evidenced based trauma treatments benefit children, but they rarely suffice for youth with multiple and complex comorbidities. After the completion of standard treatments, many children continue to show residual social, behavioral, and emotional difficulties. Part of the difficulty is that while the literature on trauma describes numerous facets that contribute to the severity, expression, and outcomes of trauma exposure, clinical assessments and interventions do not sufficiently reflect that literature. Clinicians thus have little guidance on how to integrate the intricacies of client's circumstances into a trauma-informed framework. To expand the scope and efficacy of treatments and guide clinicians in selecting appropriate interventions, this paper explores factors associated with pretreatment traumatic responses and proposes an integrative treatment model that includes the trauma experience, itself, combined with pre- and post-trauma factors that are both internal and external to the child and family. Pre-trauma experiences influence the severity of traumatic responses, while post-trauma factors impact a person's ability to cope and recover. Both are important targets for direct intervention.© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021."
"35701393","Dynamic 3D genome reorganization during development and metabolic stress of the porcine liver.","Cell Discov","Liver development is a complex process that is regulated by a series of signaling pathways. Three-dimensional (3D) chromatin architecture plays an important role in transcriptional regulation; nonetheless, its dynamics and role in the rapid transition of core liver functions during development and obesity-induced metabolic stress remain largely unexplored. To investigate the dynamic chromatin architecture during liver development and under metabolic stress, we generated high-resolution maps of chromatin architecture for porcine livers across six major developmental stages (from embryonic day 38 to the adult stage) and under a high-fat diet-induced obesity. The characteristically loose chromatin architecture supports a highly plastic genome organization during early liver development, which fundamentally contributes to the rapid functional transitions in the liver after birth. We reveal the multi-scale reorganization of chromatin architecture and its influence on transcriptional regulation of critical signaling processes during liver development, and show its close association with transition in hepatic functions (i.e., from hematopoiesis in the fetus to metabolism and immunity after birth). The limited changes in chromatin structure help explain the observed metabolic adaptation to excessive energy intake in pigs. These results provide a global overview of chromatin architecture dynamics associated with the transition of physiological liver functions between prenatal development and postnatal maturation, and a foundational resource that allows for future in-depth functional characterization.© 2022.

Six different AI platforms including support vector machine (SVM) and Deep Learning (DL) were used to identify CpG biomarkers and for LC detection. Training set and validation sets were generated, and 10-fold cross validation performed. Gene enrichment analysis using g:profiler and GREAT enrichment was used to elucidate the LC pathogenesis.Using a stringent GWAS significance threshold, p-value <5x10-8, we identified 4389 CpGs (cytosine methylation loci) in coding genes and 1812 CpGs in non-protein coding DNA regions that were differentially methylated in LC. SVM and three other AI platforms achieved an AUC=1.00; 95% CI (0.90-1.00) for LC detection. DL achieved an AUC=1.00; 95% CI (0.95-1.00) and 100% sensitivity and specificity. High diagnostic accuracies were achieved with only intragenic or only intergenic CpG loci. Gene enrichment analysis found dysregulation of molecular pathways involved in the development of small cell and non-small cell LC.Using AI and DNA methylation analysis of ctDNA, high LC detection rates were achieved. Further, many of the genes that were epigenetically altered are known to be involved in the biology of neoplasms in general and lung cancer in particular.Copyright © 2022 Bahado-Singh, Vlachos, Aydas, Gordevicius, Radhakrishna and Vishweswaraiah."
"35680847","Targeting NMDA receptors in neuropsychiatric disorders by drug screening on human neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells.","Transl Psychiatry","NMDA receptors (NMDARs), a prominent subtype of glutamatergic receptors, are implicated in the pathogenesis and development of neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia, and are therefore a potential therapeutic target in treating these disorders. Neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have provided the opportunity to investigate human NMDARs in their native environment. In this review, we describe the expression, function, and regulation of NMDARs in human iPSC-derived neurons and discuss approaches for utilizing human neurons for identifying potential drugs that target NMDARs in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. A challenge in studying NMDARs in human iPSC-derived neurons is a predominance of those receptors containing the GluN2B subunit and low synaptic expression, suggesting a relatively immature phenotype of these neurons and delayed development of functional NMDARs. We outline potential approaches for improving neuronal maturation of human iPSC-derived neurons and accelerating the functional expression of NMDARs. Acceleration of functional expression of NMDARs in human iPSC-derived neurons will improve the modeling of neuropsychiatric disorders and facilitate the discovery and development of novel therapeutics targeting NMDARs for the treatment of these disorders.© 2022.

The historical focus on genetic evolution under drug ""pressure"" as a key driver of resistance has uncovered numerous mechanisms of therapeutic value, especially with respect to acquired resistance. However, recent discoveries have also revealed a potential role for an ancient evolutionary balance between endogenous ""viral"" elements in the human genome and diverse factors involved in their restriction in tumor evolution and drug resistance. It has long been appreciated that the stability of genomic repeats such as telomeres and centromeres affect tumor fitness, but recent findings suggest that de-regulation of other repetitive genome elements, including retrotransposons, might also be exploited as cancer therapy.

However, the mechanism of how their interaction regulates aging, particularly in mammals, remains largely unknown. Here we show ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2 (Elovl2), a gene whose epigenetic alterations are most highly correlated with age prediction, contributes to aging by regulating lipid metabolism. We applied artificial intelligence to predict the protein structure of ELOVL2 and the interaction with its substrate. Impaired Elovl2 function disturbs lipid synthesis with increased endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to key aging phenotypes at both cellular and physiological level. Furthermore, restoration of mitochondrial activity can rescue age-related macular degeneration (AMD) phenotypes induced by Elovl2 deficiency in human retinal pigmental epithelial (RPE) cells; this indicates a conservative mechanism in both human and mouse. Taken together, we revealed an epigenetic-metabolism axis contributing to aging and illustrate the power of an AI-based approach in structure-function studies.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35610583","BEXCIS: Bayesian methods for estimating the degree of the skewness of X chromosome inactivation.","BMC Bioinformatics","X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is an epigenetic phenomenon that one of two X chromosomes in females is transcriptionally silenced during early embryonic development. Skewed XCI has been reported to be associated with some X-linked diseases. There have been several methods measuring the degree of the skewness of XCI. However, these methods may still have several limitations.We propose a Bayesian method to obtain the point estimate and the credible interval of the degree of XCI skewing by incorporating its prior information of being between 0 and 2. We consider a normal prior and a uniform prior for it (respectively denoted by BN and BU). We also propose a penalized point estimate based on the penalized Fieller's method and derive the corresponding confidence interval. Simulation results demonstrate that the BN and BU methods can solve the problems of extreme point estimates, noninformative intervals, empty sets and discontinuous intervals. The BN method generally outperforms other methods with the lowest mean squared error in the point estimation, and well controls the coverage probability with the smallest median and the least variation of the interval width in the interval estimation. We apply all the methods to the Graves' disease data and the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research data, and find that SNP rs3827440 in the Graves' disease data may undergo skewed XCI towards the allele C.We recommend the BN method for measuring the degree of the skewness of XCI in practice.

"35614216","Divergent transcriptional regulation of astrocyte reactivity across disorders.","Nature","Astrocytes respond to injury and disease in the central nervous system with reactive changes that influence the outcome of the disorder1-4. These changes include differentially expressed genes (DEGs) whose contextual diversity and regulation are poorly understood. Here we combined biological and informatic analyses, including RNA sequencing, protein detection, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and conditional gene deletion, to predict transcriptional regulators that differentially control more than 12,000 DEGs that are potentially associated with astrocyte reactivity across diverse central nervous system disorders in mice and humans. DEGs associated with astrocyte reactivity exhibited pronounced heterogeneity across disorders. Transcriptional regulators also exhibited disorder-specific differences, but a core group of 61 transcriptional regulators was identified as common across multiple disorders in both species. We show experimentally that DEG diversity is determined by combinatorial, context-specific interactions between transcriptional regulators. Notably, the same reactivity transcriptional regulators can regulate markedly different DEG cohorts in different disorders; changes in the access of transcriptional regulators to DNA-binding motifs differ markedly across disorders; and DEG changes can crucially require multiple reactivity transcriptional regulators. We show that, by modulating reactivity, transcriptional regulators can substantially alter disorder outcome, implicating them as therapeutic targets. We provide searchable resources of disorder-related reactive astrocyte DEGs and their predicted transcriptional regulators. Our findings show that transcriptional changes associated with astrocyte reactivity are highly heterogeneous and are customized from vast numbers of potential DEGs through context-specific combinatorial transcriptional-regulator interactions.© 2022.

A major limitation of studying neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) is lack of human pathological specimens obtained during the acute stages, thereby relegating research to post-mortem specimens obtained years after the initiation of pathology. Rodent reactive astrocytes have been shown to be cytotoxic to neurons and oligodendrocytes but may differ from human cells, especially in diseases with genetic susceptibility. Herein, we purified human CD49f+astrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from individual patient and control peripheral leukocytes. We compared TNF and IL1α stimulated human reactive astrocytes from seven persons with MS and six non-MS controls and show their transcriptomes are remarkably similar to those described in rodents. The functional effect of astrocyte conditioned media (ACM) was examined in a human oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) line differentiation assay. ACM was not cytotoxic to the OPCs but robustly inhibited the myelin basic protein (MBP) reporter. No differences were seen between MS and control stimulated astrocytes at either the transcript level or in ACM mediated OPC suppression assays. We next used RNAseq to interrogate differentially expressed genes in the OPC lines that had suppressed differentiation from the human ACM. Remarkably, not only was OPC differentiation and myelin gene expression suppressed, but we observed induction of several immune pathways in OPCs exposed to the ACM. These data support the notion that reactive astrocytes can inhibit OPC differentiation thereby limiting their remyelination capacity, and that OPCs take on an immune profile in the context of inflammatory cues.Copyright © 2022 Smith, Chamling, Gill, Martinez, Li, Fitzgerald, Sotirchos, Moroziewicz, Bauer, Paull, Gharagozloo, Bhargava, Zack, Fossati and Calabresi."

Here, we used an established human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) model to investigate the surface marker profile and proteome of TIC-induced reactive astrocytes.

Here, we focus primarily on a review of human data which has recently yielded a set of robust, reproducible results that exist in a much larger universe of conflicting reports stemming from small studies with important limitations in their study design. Thus, we are at an important crossroads in efforts to first understand at which step of the long, multiphasic course of AD a given immune response may play a causal role and then modulate this response to slow or block the pathophysiology of AD. We have a wealth of new experimental tools, analysis methods, and capacity to sample human participants at large scale longitudinally; these resources, when coupled to a foundation of reproducible results and novel study designs, will enable us to monitor human immune function in the CNS at the level of complexity that is required while simultaneously capturing the state of the peripheral immune system. This integration of peripheral and central perturbations in immune responses results in pathologic responses in the central nervous system parenchyma where specialized cellular microenvironments composed of multiple cell subtypes respond to these immune perturbations as well as to environmental exposures, comorbidities and the impact of the advancing life course. Here, we offer an overview that seeks to illustrate the large number of interconnecting factors that ultimately yield the neuroimmune component of AD.© 2022.

Here, we explored the expression of complement genes through computational analysis of preexisting single cell RNA sequencing data from lung transcriptomes of healthy young (3 months) and old C57BL/6 mice (24 months), and humans. We characterized the distribution of 48 complement genes. Across 28 distinct immune and non-immune cell types in mice, mesothelial cells expressed the greatest number of complement genes (e.g., C1ra, C2, C3), and regulators (e.g., Serping1, Cfh). C5 was abundant in type II alveolar epithelial cells and C1q in interstitial lung macrophages. There were only moderate differences in gene expression between young and old mice. Among 57 human lung cell types, mesothelial cells showed abundant complement expression. A few differences in gene  expression (e.g., FCN1, CFI, C6, C7) were also evident between mice and human lung cells. Our findings present a novel perspective on the expression patterns of complement genes in normal lungs. These findings highlight the potential functions of complement in tissue-specific homeostasis and immunity and may foster a mechanistic understanding of its role in lung health and disease.© 2022.

Here we provide a detailed dissection of this using single-cell RNA-sequencing of 1.3M peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 120 individuals, longitudinally exposed to three different pathogens. These analyses indicate that cell-type-specificity is a more prominent factor than pathogen-specificity regarding contexts that affect how genetics influences gene expression (i.e., eQTL) and co-expression (i.e., co-expression QTL). In monocytes, the strongest responder to pathogen stimulations, 71.4% of the genetic variants whose effect on gene expression is influenced by pathogen exposure (i.e., response QTL) also affect the co-expression between genes. This indicates widespread, context-specific changes in gene expression level and its regulation that are driven by genetics. Pathway analysis on the CLEC12A gene that exemplifies cell-type-, exposure-time- and genetic-background-dependent co-expression interactions, shows enrichment of the interferon (IFN) pathway specifically at 3-h post-exposure in monocytes. Similar genetic background-dependent association between IFN activity and CLEC12A co-expression patterns is confirmed in systemic lupus erythematosus by in silico analysis, which implies that CLEC12A might be an IFN-regulated gene. Altogether, this study highlights the importance of context for gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms of gene regulation in health and disease.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35676649","Comprehensive study of semi-supervised learning for DNA methylation-based supervised classification of central nervous system tumors.","BMC Bioinformatics","Precision medicine for cancer treatment relies on an accurate pathological diagnosis. The number of known tumor classes has increased rapidly, and reliance on traditional methods of histopathologic classification alone has become unfeasible. To help reduce variability, validation costs, and standardize the histopathological diagnostic process, supervised machine learning models using DNA-methylation data have been developed for tumor classification. These methods require large labeled training data sets to obtain clinically acceptable classification accuracy. While there is abundant unlabeled epigenetic data across multiple databases, labeling pathology data for machine learning models is time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially for rare tumor types. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches have been used to maximize the utility of labeled and unlabeled data for classification tasks and are effectively applied in genomics. SSL methods have not yet been explored with epigenetic data nor demonstrated beneficial to central nervous system (CNS) tumor classification.This paper explores the application of semi-supervised machine learning on methylation data to improve the accuracy of supervised learning models in classifying CNS tumors. We comprehensively evaluated 11 SSL methods and developed a novel combination approach that included a self-training with editing using support vector machine (SETRED-SVM) model and an L2-penalized, multinomial logistic regression model to obtain high confidence labels from a few labeled instances. Results across eight random forest and neural net models show that the pseudo-labels derived from our SSL method can significantly increase prediction accuracy for 82 CNS tumors and 9 normal controls.The proposed combination of semi-supervised technique and multinomial logistic regression holds the potential to leverage the abundant publicly available unlabeled methylation data effectively. Such an approach is highly beneficial in providing additional training examples, especially for scarce tumor types, to boost the prediction accuracy of supervised models.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Epigenetic aging may be an important pathway by which exposure to cigarette smoke affects health. However, little is known about how exposure to smoke at different life stages affects epigenetic aging, especially in older adults. This study examines how three epigenetic aging measures (GrimAge, PhenoAge, and DunedinPoAm38) are associated with parental smoking, smoking in youth, and smoking in adulthood, and whether these epigenetic aging measures mediate the link between smoke exposure and morbidity and mortality. This study utilizes data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Venous Blood Study (VBS), a nationally representative sample of US adults over 50 years old collected in 2016. 2978 participants with data on exposure to smoking, morbidity, and mortality were included.GrimAge is significantly increased by having two smoking parents, smoking in youth, and cigarette pack years in adulthood. PhenoAge and DunedinPoAm38 are associated with pack years. All three mediate some of the effect of pack years on cancer, high blood pressure, heart disease, and mortality and GrimAge and DunedinPoAm38 mediate this association on lung disease.Results suggest epigenetic aging is one biological mechanism linking lifetime exposure to smoking with development of disease and earlier death in later life. Interventions aimed at reducing smoking in adulthood may be effective at weakening this association.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Immunomodulation and epigenetic regulation have been hypothesized as mediators of this relationship, but the precise underlying molecular mechanisms are not well-characterized. This review examines the evidence for epigenetic modification at the intersection of COVID-19 and environmental chemical exposures.Numerous environmental contaminants including air pollutants, toxic metal(loid)s, per- and polyfluorinated substances, and endocrine disrupting chemicals are hypothesized to increase susceptibility to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the risk of severe COVID-19, but few studies currently exist. Drawing on evidence that many environmental chemicals alter the epigenetic regulation of key immunity genes and pathways, we discuss how exposures likely perturb host antiviral responses. Specific mechanisms vary by contaminant but include general immunomodulation as well as regulation of viral entry and recognition, inflammation, and immunologic memory pathways, among others. Associations between environmental contaminants and COVID-19 are likely mediated, in part, by epigenetic regulation of key immune pathways involved in the host response to SARS-CoV-2.© 2022.

Clinically, there are no ovarian cancer-specific markers for early detection. Here, we demonstrate the use of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylomes to detect ovarian cancer, especially the early-stage OC.Plasma from 74 epithelial ovarian cancer patients, 86 healthy volunteers, and 20 patients with benign pelvic masses was collected. The cfDNA methylomes of these samples were generated by cell-free methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq). The differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified by the contrasts between tumor and non-tumor groups, and the discrimination performance was evaluated with the iterative training and testing method.The DMRs identified for cfDNA methylomes can well discriminate tumor groups and non-tumor groups (ROC values from 0.86 to 0.98). The late-stage top 300 DMRs are more late-stage-specific and failed to detect early-stage OC. However, the early-stage markers have the potential to discriminate all-stage OCs from non-tumor samples.This study demonstrates that cfDNA methylomes generated with cfMeDIP-seq could be used to identify OC-specific biomarkers for OC, especially early OC detection. To detect early-stage OC, the biomarkers should be directly identified from early OC plasma samples rather than mix-stage ones.

Clear cell meningioma (CCM), an aggressive tumor of the central nervous system, is uniformly driven by loss of SMARCE1, an integral subunit of the mSWI/SNF core. Here, we identify a structural role for SMARCE1 in selectively stabilizing the canonical BAF (cBAF) complex core-ATPase module interaction. In CCM, cBAF complexes fail to stabilize on chromatin, reducing enhancer accessibility, and residual core module components increase the formation of BRD9-containing non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complexes. Combined attenuation of cBAF function and increased ncBAF complex activity generates the CCM-specific gene expression signature, which is distinct from that of NF2-mutated meningiomas. Importantly, SMARCE1-deficient cells exhibit heightened sensitivity to small-molecule inhibition of ncBAF complexes. These data inform the function of a previously elusive SWI/SNF subunit and suggest potential therapeutic approaches for intractable SMARCE1-deficient CCM tumors.© 2022.

Abnormal accumulation of senescent cells can cause potentially deleterious effects on the organism with age. As a vital marker of cellular senescence, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) is a novel mechanism to link cellular senescence with atherosclerosis.In this review, we concretely describe the characteristics of the SASP and its regulation mechanisms. Importantly, we provide novel perspectives on how the SASP can promote atherosclerosis. The SASP from different types of senescent cells have vital roles in atherosclerosis progression. As a significant mediator of the harmful effects of senescent cells, it can play a pro-atherogenic role by producing inflammation and immune dysfunction. Furthermore, the SASP can deliver senescence signals to the surrounding vascular cells, gradually contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. Finally, we focus on a variety of novel therapeutic strategies aimed to reduce the burden of atherosclerosis in elderly individuals by targeting senescent cells and inhibiting the regulatory mechanisms of the SASP.This review systematically summarizes the multiple roles of the SASP in atherosclerosis and can contribute to the exploration of new therapeutic opportunities.© 2022.

The newly identified thymic tuft cells are regulated by Pou2f3 and represent important elements for host type 2 immunity. However, epigenetic involvement in thymic tuft cell development remains unclear. We performed single-cell ATAC-seq of medullary TEC (mTEC) and established single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling of mTECs. The results showed that mTEC III cells can be further divided into three groups (Late Aire 1, 2, and 3) and that thymic tuft cells may be derived from Late Aire 2 cells. Pou2f3 is expressed in both Late Aire 2 cells and thymic tuft cells, while Pou2f3-regulated genes are specifically expressed in thymic tuft cells with simultaneous opening of chromatin accessibility, indicating the involvement of epigenetic modification in this process. Using the epigenetic regulator Sirt6-defect mouse model, we found that Sirt6 deletion increased Late Aire 2 cells and decreased thymic tuft cells and Late Aire 3 cells without affecting Pou2f3 expression. However, Sirt6 deletion reduced the chromatin accessibility of Pou2f3-regulated genes in thymic tuft cells, which may be caused by Sirt6-mediated regulation of Hdac9 expression. These data indicate that epigenetic regulation is indispensable for Pou2f3-mediated thymic tuft cell development.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Here, we review foundational technologies to profile the epigenome at multiple scales, including mapping the locations of transcription factors and histone modifications, DNA methylation and three-dimensional genome conformation. We discuss how these technologies have elucidated the development and epigenetic regulation of exhausted T cells and functional implications across viral infection, cancer, autoimmunity and engineered T cell therapies.

"35597802","Stress-induced despair behavior develops independently of the Ahr-RORγt axis in CD4 + cells.","Sci Rep","Current treatments for major depressive disorder are limited to neuropharmacological approaches and are ineffective for large numbers of patients. Recently, alternative means have been explored to understand the etiology of depression. Specifically, changes in the microbiome and immune system have been observed in both clinical settings and in mouse models. As such, microbial supplements and probiotics have become a target for potential therapeutics. A current hypothesis for the mechanism of action of these supplements is via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor's (Ahr) modulation of the T helper 17 cell (Th17) and T regulatory cell axis. As inflammatory RORγt + CD4 + Th17 T cells and their primary cytokine IL-17 have been implicated in the development of stress-induced depression, the connection between stress, the Ahr, Th17s and depression remains critical to understanding mood disorders. Here, we utilize genetic knockouts to examine the role of the microbial sensor Ahr in the development of stressinduced despair behavior. We observe an Ahr-independent increase in gut-associated Th17s in stressed mice, indicating that the Ahr is not responsible for this communication. Further, we utilized a CD4-specific RAR Related Orphan Receptor C (Rorc) knockout line to disrupt the production of Th17s. Mice lacking Rorc-produced IL-17 did not show any differences in behavior before or after stress when compared to controls. Finally, we utilize an unsupervised machine learning system to examine minute differences in behavior that could not be observed by traditional behavioral assays. Our data demonstrate that neither CD4 specific Ahr nor Rorc are necessary for the development of stress-induced anxiety- or depressive-like behaviors. These data suggest that research approaches should focus on other sources or sites of IL-17 production in stress-induced depression.© 2022. The Author(s)."

This research aims to examine the effects of PBM on the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of 23 day-old healthy male (n= 31) and female (n= 30) Wistar rats. Three groups of each sex were used: a PBM group which received 5 days of PBM, a device group submitted to the same conditions but without light radiation, and a control basal group. CCO histochemistry and c-Fos immunostaining were used to analyze brain metabolic activity and immediate early genes activation, respectively. Results displayed no metabolic differences between the three groups in both sexes. The same results were found in the analysis of c-Fos positive cells, reporting no differences between groups. This research, in contrast to the PBM consequences reported in healthy adult subjects, showed a lack of PBM effects in the brain markers we examined in young healthy rat brains. At this stage, brain function, specifically brain mitochondrial function, is not disturbed so it could be that the action of PBM in the mitochondria may not be detectable using the analysis of CCO activity and c-Fos protein expression. Further studies are needed to examine in depth the effects of PBM in brain development, cognitive functions and postnatal disorders, along with the exploration of the optimal light parameters.Copyright © 2022 Gutiérrez-Menéndez, Martínez, Méndez and Arias."

"35676449","Brain aging is faithfully modelled in organotypic brain slices and accelerated by prions.","Commun Biol","Mammalian models are essential for brain aging research. However, the long lifespan and poor amenability to genetic and pharmacological perturbations have hindered the use of mammals for dissecting aging-regulatory molecular networks and discovering new anti-aging interventions. To circumvent these limitations, we developed an ex vivo model system that faithfully mimics the aging process of the mammalian brain using cultured mouse brain slices. Genome-wide gene expression analyses showed that cultured brain slices spontaneously upregulated senescence-associated genes over time and reproduced many of the transcriptional characteristics of aged brains. Treatment with rapamycin, a classical anti-aging compound, largely abolished the time-dependent transcriptional changes in naturally aged brain slice cultures. Using this model system, we discovered that prions drastically accelerated the development of age-related molecular signatures and the pace of brain aging. We confirmed this finding in mouse models and human victims of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. These data establish an innovative, eminently tractable mammalian model of brain aging, and uncover a surprising acceleration of brain aging in prion diseases.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35593989","The α5-nAChR/PD-L1 axis facilitates lung adenocarcinoma cell migration and invasion.","Hum Cell","α5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α5-nAChR) is associated with the progression of smoking-related lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), but the molecular mechanism is unclear. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is encoded by the CD274 gene, which not only inhibits the immune system, but also plays a unique role in tumor growth and metastasis. Here, we gained important insights into the underlying mechanism between α5-nAChR and PD-L1 in LUAD progression. α5-nAChR was overexpressed in various histological subtypes, cancer stages and metastasis statuses of LUAD. The group that coexpressed α5-nAChR and PD-L1 had a worse prognosis than the other subgroups at different stages of LUAD lymph node metastasis. The expression of α5-nAChR and PD-L1 was associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker CDH2. In vitro, α5-nAChR mediated nicotine-induced PD-L1 expression via STAT3 and the expression of EMT markers. Downregulation of α5-nAChR and/or PD-L1 inhibited EMT marker expression, cell proliferation, migration and invasion compared to silencing α5-nAChR or PD-L1 alone in LUAD cells. Furthermore, α5-nAChR expression was associated with PD-L1 and EMT marker expression in mouse xenograft models. These results highlight that α5-nAChR mediates STAT3/PD-L1 signaling, which contributes to cell migration and invasion. Therefore, our study may reveal a new interaction between α5-nAChR and PD-L1 that is involved in tumor cell growth and progression in LUAD, which may be a promising target for NSCLC diagnosis and immunotherapy.© 2022.

"35619054","Paired guide RNA CRISPR-Cas9 screening for protein-coding genes and lncRNAs involved in transdifferentiation of human B-cells to macrophages.","BMC Genomics","CRISPR-Cas9 screening libraries have arisen as a powerful tool to identify protein-coding (pc) and non-coding genes playing a role along different processes. In particular, the usage of a nuclease active Cas9 coupled to a single gRNA has proven to efficiently impair the expression of pc-genes by generating deleterious frameshifts. Here, we first demonstrate that targeting the same gene simultaneously with two guide RNAs (paired guide RNAs, pgRNAs) synergistically enhances the capacity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knock out pc-genes. We next design a library to target, in parallel, pc-genes and lncRNAs known to change expression during the transdifferentiation from pre-B cells to macrophages. We show that this system is able to identify known players in this process, and also predicts 26 potential novel ones, of which we select four (two pc-genes and two lncRNAs) for deeper characterization. Our results suggest that in the case of the candidate lncRNAs, their impact in transdifferentiation may be actually mediated by enhancer regions at the targeted loci, rather than by the lncRNA transcripts themselves. The CRISPR-Cas9 coupled to a pgRNAs system is, therefore, a suitable tool to simultaneously target pc-genes and lncRNAs for genomic perturbation assays.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In the study of parenchymal lung disease, single-cell RNA-sequencing has better delineated known cell populations and identified novel cells and changes in cellular phenotypes and gene expression patterns associated with disease. In this review, we aim to highlight the advances and insights that have been made possible by applying these technologies to two seemingly very different lung diseases: fibrotic interstitial lung diseases, a group of relentlessly progressive lung diseases leading to pulmonary fibrosis, and COVID-19 pneumonia, an acute viral disease with life-threatening complications, including pulmonary fibrosis. We discuss changes in cell populations and gene expression, highlighting potential common features, such as alveolar cell epithelial injury and aberrant repair and monocyte-derived macrophage populations, as well as relevance and implications to mechanisms of disease and future directions.© 2022.

"35633417","Functional implications of the CpG island methylation in the pathogenesis of celiac disease.","Mol Biol Rep","Investigation of gene-environment cross talk through epigenetic modifications led to better understanding of the number of complex diseases. Clinical heterogeneity and differential treatment response often contributed by the epigenetic signatures which could be personal. DNA methylation at CpG islands presents a critical nuclear process as a result of gene-environment interactions. These CpG islands are frequently present near the promoter sequence of genes and get differentially methylated under specific environmental conditions. Technical advancements facilitate in high throughput screening of differentially methylated CpG islands. Recent epigenetic studies unraveled several CD susceptibility genes expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), duodenal mucosa, lamina and epithelial cells that are influenced by differentially methylated CpG islands. Here we highlighted these susceptibility genes; classify these genes based on cellular functions and tissue of expression. We further discussed how these genes interacts with each other to influence critical pathways like NF-κB signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling cascade, RIG-I like receptor signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor pathways among several others. This review also shed light on how gut microbiota may lead to the differential methylation of CpG islands of CD susceptibility genes. Large scale epigenetic studies followed by estimation of heritability of these CpG methylation and polygenic risk score estimation of these genes would prioritize potentially druggable targets for better therapeutics. In vivo studies are warranted to unravel further cellular responses to CpG methylation.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"35688856","Telomere-to-telomere human DNA replication timing profiles.","Sci Rep","The spatiotemporal organization of DNA replication produces a highly robust and reproducible replication timing profile. Sequencing-based methods for assaying replication timing genome-wide have become commonplace, but regions of high repeat content in the human genome have remained refractory to analysis. Here, we report the first nearly-gapless telomere-to-telomere replication timing profiles in human, using the T2T-CHM13 genome assembly and sequencing data for five cell lines. We find that replication timing can be successfully assayed in centromeres and large blocks of heterochromatin. Centromeric regions replicate in mid-to-late S-phase and contain replication-timing peaks at a similar density to other genomic regions, while distinct families of heterochromatic satellite DNA differ in their bias for replicating in late S-phase. The high degree of consistency in centromeric replication timing across chromosomes within each cell line prompts further investigation into the mechanisms dictating that some cell lines replicate their centromeres earlier than others, and what the consequences of this variation are.© 2022.

"35672304","JMJD3 intrinsically disordered region links the 3D-genome structure to TGFβ-dependent transcription activation.","Nat Commun","Enhancers are key regulatory elements that govern gene expression programs in response to developmental signals. However, how multiple enhancers arrange in the 3D-space to control the activation of a specific promoter remains unclear. To address this question, we exploited our previously characterized TGFβ-response model, the neural stem cells, focusing on a ~374 kb locus where enhancers abound. Our 4C-seq experiments reveal that the TGFβ pathway drives the assembly of an enhancer-cluster and precise gene activation. We discover that the TGFβ pathway coactivator JMJD3 is essential to maintain these structures. Using live-cell imaging techniques, we demonstrate that an intrinsically disordered region contained in JMJD3 is involved in the formation of phase-separated biomolecular condensates, which are found in the enhancer-cluster. Overall, in this work we uncover novel functions for the coactivator JMJD3, and we shed light on the relationships between the 3D-conformation of the chromatin and the TGFβ-driven response during mammalian neurogenesis.© 2022.

The nanoparticles promote cytotoxicity of DOX against tumor cells and in turn, they reduce adverse impacts on normal cells. The safety profile of nanostructures is an important topic and recently, the green synthesis of nanoparticles has obtained much attention for the preparation of biocompatible carriers. In the present study, we prepared layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanostructures for doxorubicin (DOX) delivery. The Cu-Al LDH nanoparticles were synthesized by combining Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and then, autoclave at 110. The green modification of LDH nanoparticles with Plantago ovata (PO) was performed and finally, DOX was loaded onto nanostructures. The FTIR, XRD, and FESEM were employed for the characterization of LDH nanoparticles, confirming their proper synthesis. The drug release study revealed the pH-sensitive release of DOX (highest release at pH 5.5) and prolonged DOX release due to PO modification. Furthermore, MTT assay revealed improved biocompatibility of Cu-Al LDH nanostructures upon PO modification and showed controlled and low cytotoxicity towards a wide range of cell lines. The CLSM demonstrated cellular uptake of nanoparticles, both in the HEK-293 and MCF-7 cell lines; however, the results were showed promising cellular internalizations to the HEK-293 rather than MCF-7 cells. The in vivo experiment highlighted the normal histopathological structure of kidneys and no side effects of nanoparticles, further confirming their safety profile and potential as promising nano-scale delivery systems. Finally, antibacterial test revealed toxicity of PO-modified Cu-Al LDH nanoparticles against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, the extent to which epigenetic age fluctuates under normal conditions is poorly understood. Therefore, we analyzed methylation data from monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from two Japanese men. The ranges of the Pan-tissue, Skin and blood, and DNAm PhenoAge epigenetic age during 3 months were ≥ 5.62, ≥ 3.04, and ≥ 8.23 years, and the maximum daily changes were 5.21, 3.20, and 6.53 years, respectively. These fluctuations were not suppressed by correcting for cell-type composition. Although the underlying biological mechanism remains unclear, there was a nonnegligible degree of age fluctuation which should inform personalized clinical applications.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35655092","Enhancer methylation dynamics drive core transcriptional regulatory circuitry in pan-cancer.","Oncogene","Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that enhancer methylation has strong and dynamic regulatory effects on gene expression. Some transcription factors (TFs) can auto- and cross-regulate in a feed-forward manner, and cooperate with their enhancers to form core transcriptional regulatory circuitries (CRCs). However, the elaborated regulatory mechanism between enhancer methylation and CRC remains the tip of the iceberg. Here, we revealed that DNA methylation could drive the tissue-specific enhancer basal transcription and target gene expression in human cancers. By integrating methylome, transcriptome, and 3D genomic data, we identified enhancer methylation triplets (enhancer methylation-enhancer transcription-target gene expression) and dissected potential regulatory patterns within them. Moreover, we observed that cancer-specific core TFs regulated by enhancers were able to shape their enhancer methylation forming the enhancer methylation-driven CRCs (emCRCs). Further parsing of clinical implications showed rewired emCRCs could serve as druggable targets and prognostic risk markers. In summary, the integrative analysis of enhancer methylation regulome would facilitate portraying the cancer epigenomics landscape and developing the epigenetic anti-cancer approaches.© 2022.

"35697963","Mortality and morbidity in ageing men: Biology, Lifestyle and Environment.","Rev Endocr Metab Disord","Males live shorter lives than women in all countries. The universality of shorter male life expectancy is a 21st Century phenomena. It occurs with the decline in infectious diseases and the rise in cardiovascular diseases accounting for mortality. Male/female differences in morbidity are not as succinctly characterized. Men have a higher prevalence of lethal diseases, which is linked to their lower life expectancy. Women have more non-lethal conditions such as depression and arthritis; which may also be linked in part to longer survival. Men have better physical functioning and less disability which is partly explained by gender differences in diseases and also by their greater strength, size, and stamina. Gender differences in risk factors for disease have changed over time with the prevalence and treatment of risk as well as differential behavior by gender. Examination of what are seen as basic molecular and cellular measures related to aging indicates men age faster than women; however, even these basic biological measures result from a combination of biology, behavior, and social factors.© 2022.

"35637336","In utero origin of myelofibrosis presenting in adult monozygotic twins.","Nat Med","The latency between acquisition of an initiating somatic driver mutation by a single-cell and clinical presentation with cancer is largely unknown. We describe a remarkable case of monozygotic twins presenting with CALR mutation-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) (aged 37 and 38 years), with a clinical phenotype of primary myelofibrosis. The CALR mutation was absent in T cells and dermal fibroblasts, confirming somatic acquisition. Whole-genome sequencing lineage tracing revealed a common clonal origin of the CALR-mutant MPN clone, which occurred in utero followed by twin-to-twin transplacental transmission and subsequent similar disease latency. Index sorting and single-colony genotyping revealed phenotypic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) as the likely MPN-propagating cell. Furthermore, neonatal blood spot analysis confirmed in utero origin of the JAK2V617F mutation in a patient presenting with polycythemia vera (aged 34 years). These findings provide a unique window into the prolonged evolutionary dynamics of MPNs and fitness advantage exerted by MPN-associated driver mutations in HSCs.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Adenine methylation is an epigenetic modification present in DNA (6mA) and RNA (m6A) that has a regulatory function in many cellular processes. This modification occurs through a reversible reaction that covalently binds a methyl group, usually at the N6position of the purine ring. This modification carries biophysical properties that affect the stability of nucleic acids as well as their binding affinity with other molecules. DNA 6mA has been related to genome stability, gene expression, DNA replication, and repair mechanisms. Recent advances have shown that 6mA in plant genomes is related to development and stress response. In this review, we present recent advances in the understanding of 6mA in DNA as an emergent epigenetic mark with distinctive characteristics. We discuss the key elements of this modification, focusing mainly on its importance in plant genomes. Furthermore, we highlight its chemical nature and the regulatory effects that it exerts on gene expression and plant development. Finally, we emphasize the functions of 6mA in photosynthesis, stress, and flowering.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

However, calorie restriction (CR) and sleep lower serum tyrosine levels. We previously showed that tyrosine inhibits tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS)-mediated activation of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1). Here, we show that histone serine-ADP-ribosylation is decreased in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brains, and increased tyrosine levels deplete TyrRS and cause neuronal DNA damage. However, dopamine and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increase TyrRS and histone serine-ADP-ribosylation. Furthermore, cis-resveratrol (cis-RSV) that binds to TyrRS mimicking a 'tyrosine-free' conformation increases TyrRS, facilitates histone serine-ADP-ribosylation-dependent DNA repair, and provides neuroprotection in a TyrRS-dependent manner. Conversely, trans-RSV that binds to TyrRS mimicking a 'tyrosine-like' conformation decreases TyrRS, inhibits serine-ADP-ribosylation-dependent DNA repair, and induces neurodegeneration in rat cortical neurons. Our findings suggest that age-associated increase in serum tyrosine levels may effect neurocognitive and metabolic disorders and offer a plausible explanation for divergent results obtained in clinical trials using resveratrol.© 2022.
