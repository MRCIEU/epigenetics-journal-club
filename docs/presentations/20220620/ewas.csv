disease,35703085,World J Biol Psychiatry,anorexia,blood,145 women,205 active vs controls; 162 active vs remitted,"DNA methylation in people with Anorexia Nervosa: Epigenome-wide patterns in actively ill, long-term remitted, and healthy-eater women.","Objectives:Recent studies have reported altered methylation levels at disorder-relevant DNA sites in people who are ill with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) compared to findings in people with no eating disorder (ED) or in whom AN has remitted. The preceding implies state-related influences upon gene expression in people with AN. The present study further examined this notion.Methods:We measured genome-wide DNA methylation in 145 women with active AN, 49 showing stable one-year remission of AN, and 64 with no ED.Results:Comparisons revealed 205 differentially methylated sites between active and no ED groups, and 162 differentially methylated sites between active and remitted groups (Q < 0.01). Probes tended to map onto genes relevant to psychiatric, metabolic and immune functions. Notably, several of the genes identified here as being differentially methylated in people with AN (e.g.,SYNJ2, PRKAG2, STAT3,CSGALNACT1, NEGR1,NR1H3) have figured in previous studies on AN. Effects also associated illness chronicity and lower BMI with more pronounced DNA methylation alterations, and remission of AN with normalization of DNA methylation.Conclusions:Findings corroborate earlier results suggesting reversible DNA methylation alterations in AN, and point to particular genes at which epigenetic mechanisms may act to shape AN phenomenology."
disease,35650177,Transl Psychiatry,obsessive-compulsive disorder,blood,76 cases vs controls,9,Epigenome-wide DNA methylation in obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"In adult patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), altered DNA methylation has been discerned in several candidate genes, while DNA methylation on an epigenome-wide level has been investigated in only one Chinese study so far. Here, an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was performed in a sample of 76 OCD patients of European ancestry (37 women, age ± SD: 33.51 ± 10.92 years) and 76 sex- and age-matched healthy controls for the first time using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip. After quality control, nine epigenome-wide significant quantitative trait methylation sites (QTMs) and 21 suggestive hits were discerned in the final sample of 68 patients and 68 controls. The top hit (cg24159721) and four other significant QTMs (cg11894324, cg01070250, cg11330075, cg15174812) map to the region of the microRNA 12136 gene (MIR12136). Two additional significant CpG sites (cg05740793, cg20450977) are located in the flanking region of the MT-RNR2 (humanin) like 8 gene (MT-RNRL8), while two further QTMs (cg16267121, cg15890734) map to the regions of the MT-RNR2 (humanin) like 3 (MT-RNRL3) and MT-RNR2 (humanin) like 2 (MT-RNRL2) genes. Provided replication of the present findings in larger samples, the identified QTMs might provide more biological insight into the pathogenesis of OCD and thereby could in the future serve as peripheral epigenetic markers of OCD risk with the potential to inform targeted preventive and therapeutic efforts.© 2022.

disease,35627945,Healthcare (Basel),schizophrenia with suicide ideation severity,blood,112,null,Differential Methylation Analysis of Suicidal Ideation Severity in Schizophrenia with the Illumina MethylationEPIC Array.,"There is a multitude of factors that makes difficult to identify those at risk for suicide, especially among schizophrenia patients. Suicide cannot be explained by genetics alone, therefore epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation are thought to play a role. DNA methylation could be a valuable tool in helping predict those at-risk individuals. This cross-sectional study comprised 112 subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, and were grouped according to the current suicidal ideation severity. DNA methylation across the genome was measured with the Infinium®MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We utilized the dmpFinder and bumphunter functions within the Bioconductor minfi package to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs), respectively. Following quality control, we removed one sample from the analysis and reported the most significant DMPs and DMRs associated with suicidal ideation severity. All positions and regions identified in this analysis were only found to have suggestive levels of significance at the genome-wide level. The present study was one of the first to investigate genome-wide methylation and suicidal ideation severity. While there were many strengths of our study, including investigating both differentially methylated positions and regions, further larger-scale studies are necessary to replicate, support, and validate our findings presented here."
disease,35595947,Eur J Epidemiol,lung cancer,blood,209 cases vs 826 controls (EPIC-Italy and NOWAC),29 (21 smoking-unrelated),Epigenetic mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis involve differentially methylated CpG sites beyond those associated with smoking.,"Smoking-related epigenetic changes have been linked to lung cancer, but the contribution of epigenetic alterations unrelated to smoking remains unclear. We sought for a sparse set of CpG sites predicting lung cancer and explored the role of smoking in these associations. We analysed CpGs in relation to lung cancer in participants from two nested case-control studies, using (LASSO)-penalised regression. We accounted for the effects of smoking using known smoking-related CpGs, and through conditional-independence network. We identified 29 CpGs (8 smoking-related, 21 smoking-unrelated) associated with lung cancer. Models additionally adjusted for Comprehensive Smoking Index-(CSI) selected 1 smoking-related and 49 smoking-unrelated CpGs. Selected CpGs yielded excellent discriminatory performances, outperforming information provided by CSI only. Of the 8 selected smoking-related CpGs, two captured lung cancer-relevant effects of smoking that were missed by CSI. Further, the 50 CpGs identified in the CSI-adjusted model complementarily explained lung cancer risk. These markers may provide further insight into lung cancer carcinogenesis and help improving early identification of high-risk patients.© 2022. The Author(s)."
exposure,35700439,Med Sci Sports Exerc,physical activity (accelerometer),blood,898 Japanese,9,Epigenome-wide Association Study Identified VTI1A DNA Methylation Associated with Accelerometer-assessed Physical Activity.,"Health benefits of physical activity (PA) may be mediated by DNA methylation alterations. The purpose of the current study was to comprehensively identify CpG sites whose methylation levels were associated with accelerometer-assessed total PA in a general Japanese population.The study participants were from the baseline survey of Saga Japan Multi-institutional Collaborative Cohort. PA was objectively measured by a single-axis accelerometer for seven days. We employed a two-stage strategy. In the discovery stage, we performed a meta-analysis of two epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of total PA in 898 individuals (a combination of random sample [n = 507] and case-control study sample [n = 391]. Peripheral blood DNA methylation levels were measured using Infinium EPIC or HM450 arrays. In the replication stage, we subsequently examined whether CpG sites significantly associated (P < 1 × 10-5) with total PA were replicated in another sample (n = 1711), in which methylation levels were measured by pyrosequencing. A multiple linear regression was performed to determine the cross-sectional association between total PA and methylation levels with adjustment for potential confounders, including BMI. A fixed-effects model was used in the meta-analysis. Correlations between total PA-associated DNA methylation and several inflammatory markers, such as hs-CRP, were also conducted.In the meta-analysis, nine CpG sites were significantly associated with total PA (P < 1 × 10-5). Among the nine sites, one site cg07030336 (annotated to VTI1A/ZDHHC6 gene) was successfully replicated (P = 0.009).The current study showed that greater accelerometer-assessed total PA was associated with higher DNA methylation levels at cg07030336 (VTI1A/ZDHHC6) in the general population. Additionally, we found a divergent relationship between the methylation levels at cg07030336 and several inflammatory biomarkers.Copyright © 2022 by the American College of Sports Medicine."
exposure,35692099,Clin Transl Med,healthy lifestyle,blood,unhealthy vs healthy,145,DNA methylation patterns reflect individual's lifestyle independent of obesity.,"Obesity is driven by modifiable lifestyle factors whose effects may be mediated by epigenetics. Therefore, we investigated lifestyle effects on blood DNA methylation in participants of the LIFE-Adult study, a well-characterised population-based cohort from Germany.Lifestyle scores (LS) based on diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake were calculated in 4107 participants of the LIFE-Adult study. Fifty subjects with an extremely healthy lifestyle and 50 with an extremely unhealthy lifestyle (5th and 95th percentiles LS) were selected for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis in blood samples employing Illumina Infinium® Methylation EPIC BeadChip system technology.Differences in DNA methylation patterns between body mass index groups (<25 vs. >30 kg/m2) were rather marginal compared to inter-lifestyle differences (0 vs. 145 differentially methylated positions [DMPs]), which identified 4682 differentially methylated regions (DMRs; false discovery rate [FDR <5%) annotated to 4426 unique genes. A DMR annotated to the glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 2 (GFPT2) locus showed the strongest hypomethylation (∼6.9%), and one annotated to glutamate rich 1 (ERICH1) showed the strongest hypermethylation (∼5.4%) in healthy compared to unhealthy lifestyle individuals. Intersection analysis showed that diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol intake equally contributed to the observed differences, which affected, among others, pathways related to glutamatergic synapses (adj. p < .01) and axon guidance (adj. p < .05). We showed that methylation age correlates with chronological age and waist-to-hip ratio with lower DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) acceleration distances in participants with healthy lifestyles. Finally, two identified top DMPs for the alanyl aminopeptidase (ANPEP) locus also showed the strongest expression quantitative trait methylation in blood.DNA methylation patterns help discriminate individuals with a healthy versus unhealthy lifestyle, which may mask subtle methylation differences derived from obesity.© 2022 The Authors.

mediation,35654255,Environ Pollut,mediation of plasma zinc on lung cancer risk,blood,359 lung cancer cases vs 1399 controls,7,Epigenome-wide DNA methylation signature of plasma zinc and their mediation roles in the association of zinc with lung cancer risk.,"Essential trace element zinc is associated with decreased lung cancer risk, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate role of DNA methylation in zinc-lung cancer association. We conducted a case-cohort study within prospective Dongfeng-Tongji cohort, including 359 incident lung cancer cases and a randomly selected sub-cohort of 1399 participants. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) was used to examine association of plasma zinc with DNA methylation in peripheral blood. For the zinc-related CpGs, their mediation effects on zinc-lung cancer association were assessed; their diagnostic performance for lung cancer was testified in the case-cohort study and further validated in another 126 pairs of lung cancer case-control study. We identified 28 CpGs associated with plasma zinc at P < 1.0 × 10-5and seven of them (cg07077080, cg01077808, cg17749033, cg15554270, cg26125625, cg10669424, and cg15409013 annotated to GSR, CALR3, SLC16A3, PHLPP2, SLC12A8, VGLL4, and ADAMTS16, respectively) were associated with incident risk of lung cancer. Moreover, the above seven CpGs were differently methylated between 126 pairs of lung cancer and adjacent normal lung tissues and had the same directions with EWAS of zinc. They could mediate a separate 7.05%∼22.65% and a joint 29.42% of zinc-lung cancer association. Compared to using traditional factors, addition of methylation risk score exerted improved discriminations for lung cancer both in case-cohort study [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.818 vs. 0.738] and in case-control study (AUC = 0.816 vs. 0.646). Our results provide new insights for the biological role of DNA methylation in the inverse association of zinc with incident lung cancer.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
phenotype,35681244,Clin Epigenetics,lung function (FEV1;FVC),blood,1677 adult Native Americans (Strong Heart Study),elastic net,An epigenome-wide study of DNA methylation profiles and lung function among American Indians in the Strong Heart Study.,"Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation (DNAm), are often related to environmental exposures, and are increasingly recognized as key processes in the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease. American Indian communities have a high burden of lung disease compared to the national average. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of DNAm and lung function in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). We conducted a cross-sectional study of American Indian adults, 45-74 years of age who participated in the SHS. DNAm was measured using the Illumina Infinium Human MethylationEPIC platform at baseline (1989-1991). Lung function was measured via spirometry, including forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), at visit 2 (1993-1995). Airflow limitation was defined as FEV1 < 70% predicted and FEV1/FVC < 0.7, restriction was defined as FEV1/FVC > 0.7 and FVC < 80% predicted, and normal spirometry was defined as FEV1/FVC > 0.7, FEV1 > 70% predicted, FVC > 80% predicted. We used elastic-net models to select relevant CpGs for lung function and spirometry-defined lung disease. We also conducted bioinformatic analyses to evaluate the biological plausibility of the findings.Among 1677 participants, 21.2% had spirometry-defined airflow limitation and 13.6% had spirometry-defined restrictive pattern lung function. Elastic-net models selected 1118 Differentially Methylated Positions (DMPs) as predictors of airflow limitation and 1385 for restrictive pattern lung function. A total of 12 DMPs overlapped between airflow limitation and restrictive pattern. EGFR, MAPK1 and PRPF8 genes were the most connected nodes in the protein-protein interaction network. Many of the DMPs targeted genes with biological roles related to lung function such as protein kinases.We found multiple differentially methylated CpG sites associated with chronic lung disease. These signals could contribute to better understand molecular mechanisms involved in lung disease, as assessed systemically, as well as to identify patterns that could be useful for diagnostic purposes. Further experimental and longitudinal studies are needed to assess whether DNA methylation has a causal role in lung disease.© 2022. The Author(s)."
phenotype,35652342,Circulation,longitudinal cardiovascular health score,blood,1085 (CARDIA study),45,Association of Cardiovascular Health Through Young Adulthood With Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Patterns in Midlife: The CARDIA Study.,"Cardiovascular health (CVH) from young adulthood is strongly associated with an individual's future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality. Defining epigenomic biomarkers of lifelong CVH exposure and understanding their roles in CVD development may help develop preventive and therapeutic strategies for CVD.In 1085 CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) participants, we defined a clinical cumulative CVH score that combines body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, and fasting glucose measured longitudinally from young adulthood through middle age over 20 years (mean age, 25-45). Blood DNA methylation at >840 000 methylation markers was measured twice over 5 years (mean age, 40 and 45). Epigenome-wide association analyses on the cumulative CVH score were performed in CARDIA and compared in the FHS (Framingham Heart Study). We used penalized regression to build a methylation-based risk score to evaluate the risk of incident coronary artery calcification and clinical CVD events.We identified 45 methylation markers associated with cumulative CVH at false discovery rate <0.01 (P=4.7E-7-5.8E-17) in CARDIA and replicated in FHS. These associations were more pronounced with methylation measured at an older age.CPT1A,ABCG1, andSREBF1appeared as the most prominent genes. The 45 methylation markers were mostly located in transcriptionally active chromatin and involved lipid metabolism, insulin secretion, and cytokine production pathways. Three methylation markers located in genesSARS1,SOCS3, andLINC-PINTstatistically mediated 20.4% of the total effect between CVH and risk of incident coronary artery calcification. The methylation risk score added information and significantly (P=0.004) improved the discrimination capacity of coronary artery calcification status versus CVH score alone and showed association with risk of incident coronary artery calcification 5 to 10 years later independent of cumulative CVH score (odds ratio, 1.87;P=9.66E-09). The methylation risk score was also associated with incident clinical CVD in FHS (hazard ratio, 1.28;P=1.22E-05).Cumulative CVH from young adulthood contributes to midlife epigenetic programming over time. Our findings demonstrate the role of epigenetic markers in response to CVH changes and highlight the potential of epigenomic markers for precision CVD prevention, and earlier detection of subclinical CVD, as well."
disease,35635730,Arthritis Rheumatol,systemic lupus erythematosus,blood 2 years apart,101,256,The dynamics of methylation of CpG sites associated with SLE subtypes in a longitudinal cohort.,"Cross-sectional studies have revealed associations between DNA methylation and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) outcomes. To study the dynamics of DNA methylation, we examined participants from a SLE longitudinal cohort sampled at two time-points.One hundred and one participants from the California Lupus Epidemiology Study were studied. DNA extracted from blood at cohort enrollment and after two years was analyzed using the Illumina EPIC BeadChip. Paired t-tests were utilized to identify changes at 256 CpG sites previously associated with SLE subtypes as well as genome-wide. Mixed linear models were developed to understand the relationship between DNA methylation and disease activity, medication use and sample cell proportions, adjusting for age, sex and genetic principal components.The majority of CpGs that were previously associated with SLE subtypes remained stable over two years (185 CpGs (72.3%), t-test FDR >0.05). Compared to background genome-wide methylation, there was an enrichment of SLE subtype associated CpGs that changed over time (27.7% vs 0.34%). Changes in cell proportion were associated with changes at 67 CpGs (p<2.70E-05) and 15 CpGs had at least one significant association with use of an immunosuppressive medication.In this longitudinal cohort of SLE, we identified a subset of SLE subtype associated CpGs that were stable over time and may be useful as biomarkers of disease subtypes. Another subset of SLE subtype-associated CpGs changed at a higher proportion compared to the genome-wide methylome. Additional studies are needed to understand the etiology and impact of these methylation changes in SLE-associated CpGs.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Here, we investigate matched genotype and methylation profiles of primary chondrocytes from macroscopically intact (low-grade) and degraded (high-grade) osteoarthritis cartilage and from synoviocytes collected from 98 osteoarthritis-affected individuals undergoing knee replacement surgery. We perform an epigenome-wide association study of knee cartilage degeneration and report robustly replicating methylation markers, which reveal an etiologic mechanism linked to the migration of epithelial cells. Using machine learning, we derive methylation models of cartilage degeneration, which we validate with 82% accuracy in independent data. We report a genome-wide methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) map of articular cartilage and synovium and identify 18 disease-grade-specific mQTLs in osteoarthritis cartilage. We resolve osteoarthritis GWAS loci through causal inference and colocalization analyses and decipher the epigenetic mechanisms that mediate the effect of genotype on disease risk. Together, our findings provide enhanced insights into epigenetic mechanisms underlying osteoarthritis in primary tissues.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

exposure,35596190,Clin Epigenetics,mediation of maternal sleep and offspring adiposity,cord blood,231 Shanghai Birth Cohort,13,The mediating effect of DNA methylation in the association between maternal sleep during pregnancy and offspring adiposity status: a prospective cohort study.,"Childhood overweight/obesity is a global public health concern. It is important to identify its early-life risk factors. Maternal poor sleep is common in late pregnancy, and previous studies indicated that poor sleep may influence the offspring's adiposity status. However, very few studies in humans investigated the effect of the different sleep parameters (sleep quantity, quality, and timing) on the offspring's adiposity indicators, and long-term studies are even more scarce. In addition, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study therefore aimed to examine the association between the three maternal sleep dimensions in the late pregnancy and the offspring adiposity indicators and to explore the potential mediating effect of the cord blood DNA methylation in the above association.Included participants in the current study were 2211 healthy pregnant women with singleton gestation from the Shanghai Birth Cohort (SBC) and Shanghai Sleep Birth Cohort (SSBC). Maternal nighttime sleep duration, quality, and midpoint (an indicator of circadian rhythm) were assessed by the same instrument in both cohorts during late pregnancy, and the offspring's body mass index (BMI) and subcutaneous fat (SF) were measured at 2 years old. Additionally, in 231 SSBC samples, the genome-wide DNA methylation levels were measured using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip. The multivariate linear regression was used to determine the associations between the maternal sleep parameters and the offspring adiposity indicators. The epigenome-wide association study was conducted to identify the maternal sleep-related CpG sites. The mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the potential intermediate role of DNA methylation in the association between maternal sleep and offspring adiposity indicators.The mean maternal nighttime sleep duration and the sleep midpoint for combined cohorts were 9.24 ± 1.13 h and 3.02 ± 0.82, respectively, and 24.5% of pregnant women experienced poor sleep quality in late pregnancy. After adjusting for the covariates, the maternal later sleep midpoint was associated with the increased SF in offspring (Coef. = 0.62, 95% CI 0.37-0.87, p < 0.001) at 2 years old. However, no significant associations of the nighttime sleep duration or sleep quality with the offspring adiposity indicators were found. In the SSBC sample, 45 differential methylated probes (DMPs) were associated with the maternal sleep midpoint, and then, we observed 10 and 3 DMPs that were also associated with the offspring's SF and BMI at 2 years, of which cg04351668 (MARCH9) and cg12232388 significantly mediated the relationship of sleep midpoint and SF and cg12232388 and cg12225226 mediated the sleep midpoint-BMI association, respectively.Maternal later sleep timing in late pregnancy was associated with higher childhood adiposity in the offspring. Cord blood DNA methylation may play a mediation role in that relationship.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation may play a role in the sexual differences observed in diseases and other physiological traits.We performed a meta-analysis of the association of sex and cord blood DNA methylation at over 450,000 CpG sites in 8438 newborns from 17 cohorts participating in the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium. We also examined associations of child sex with DNA methylation in older children ages 5.5-10 years from 8 cohorts (n = 4268).In newborn blood, sex was associated at Bonferroni level significance with differences in DNA methylation at 46,979 autosomal CpG sites (p < 1.3 × 10-7) after adjusting for white blood cell proportions and batch. Most of those sites had lower methylation levels in males than in females. Of the differentially methylated CpG sites identified in newborn blood, 68% (31,727) met look-up level significance (p < 1.1 × 10-6) in older children and had methylation differences in the same direction.This is a large-scale meta-analysis examining sex differences in DNA methylation in newborns and older children. Expanding upon previous studies, we replicated previous findings and identified additional autosomal sites with sex-specific differences in DNA methylation. Differentially methylated sites were enriched in genes involved in cancer, psychiatric disorders, and cardiovascular phenotypes.Copyright © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

mediation,35665255,Front Cardiovasc Med,mediation of socioeconomic status on cardiovascular risk,monocytes,1154,410,DNA Methylation Mediates the Association Between Individual and Neighborhood Social Disadvantage and Cardiovascular Risk Factors.,"Low socioeconomic status (SES) and living in a disadvantaged neighborhood are associated with poor cardiovascular health. Multiple lines of evidence have linked DNA methylation to both cardiovascular risk factors and social disadvantage indicators. However, limited research has investigated the role of DNA methylation in mediating the associations of individual- and neighborhood-level disadvantage with multiple cardiovascular risk factors in large, multi-ethnic, population-based cohorts. We examined whether disadvantage at the individual level (childhood and adult SES) and neighborhood level (summary neighborhood SES as assessed by Census data and social environment as assessed by perceptions of aesthetic quality, safety, and social cohesion) were associated with 11 cardiovascular risk factors including measures of obesity, diabetes, lipids, and hypertension in 1,154 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). For significant associations, we conducted epigenome-wide mediation analysis to identify methylation sites mediating the relationship between individual/neighborhood disadvantage and cardiovascular risk factors using the JT-Comp method that assesses sparse mediation effects under a composite null hypothesis. In models adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, medication use, and genetic principal components of ancestry, epigenetic mediation was detected for the associations of adult SES with body mass index (BMI), insulin, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), as well as for the association between neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and HDL-C at FDRq< 0.05. The 410 CpG mediators identified for the SES-BMI association were enriched for CpGs associated with gene expression (expression quantitative trait methylation loci, or eQTMs), and corresponding genes were enriched in antigen processing and presentation pathways. For cardiovascular risk factors other than BMI, most of the epigenetic mediators lost significance after controlling for BMI. However, 43 methylation sites showed evidence of mediating the neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and HDL-C association after BMI adjustment. The identified mediators were enriched for eQTMs, and corresponding genes were enriched in inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Our findings support the hypothesis that DNA methylation acts as a mediator between individual- and neighborhood-level disadvantage and cardiovascular risk factors, and shed light on the potential underlying epigenetic pathways. Future studies are needed to fully elucidate the biological mechanisms that link social disadvantage to poor cardiovascular health.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Zhao, Ammous, Song, Du, Shang, Ratliff, Moore, Kelly, Needham, Diez Roux, Liu, Butler, Kardia, Mukherjee, Zhou and Smith."

Here, we present a mega-analysis of 14 publicly available placenta DNA methylation (DNAm) microarray datasets to identify individual CpGs and regions associated with fetal sex. In the discovery dataset of placentas from full term pregnancies (N = 532 samples), 5212 CpGs met genome-wide significance (p < 1E-8) and were enriched in pathways such as keratinization (FDR p-value = 7.37E-14), chemokine activity (FDR p-value = 1.56E-2), and eosinophil migration (FDR p-value = 1.83E-2). Nine differentially methylated regions were identified (fwerArea < 0.1) including a region in the promoter of ZNF300 that showed consistent differential DNAm in samples from earlier timepoints in pregnancy and appeared to be driven predominately by effects in the trophoblast cell type. We describe the largest study of fetal sex differences in placenta DNAm performed to date, revealing genes and pathways characterizing sex-specific placenta function and health outcomes later in life.© 2022.
