Replication was attempted using maternal folate intake and blood methylation data from the MoBa study and verified if the findings were significant in a previous EWAS of maternal serum folate in cord blood.Results & conclusion:cg19888088 (cross-ancestry) inEBF3, cg01952260 (Europeans) and cg07077240 (South Asians) inHERC3were associated with serum folate. cg19888088 and cg01952260 were associated with diastolic blood pressure. cg07077240 was associated with variants inCASC15. The findings were not replicated and were not significant in cord blood."
,Yes,20230330,ewas,36966332,Sex differences in the intergenerational link between maternal and neonatal whole blood DNA methylation: a genome-wide analysis in 2 birth cohorts.,Clin Epigenetics,"The mother-child inheritance of DNA methylation (DNAm) variations could contribute to the inheritance of disease susceptibility across generations. However, no study has investigated patterns of mother-child associations in DNAm at the genome-wide scale. It remains unknown whether there are sex differences in mother-child DNAm associations.Using genome-wide DNAm profiling data (721,331 DNAm sites, including 704,552 on autosomes and 16,779 on the X chromosome) of 396 mother-newborn pairs (54.5% male) from the Boston Birth Cohort, we found significant sex differences in mother-newborn correlations in genome-wide DNAm patterns (Spearman's rho = 0.91-0.98; p = 4.0 × 10-8), with female newborns having stronger correlations. Sex differences in correlations were attenuated but remained significant after excluding X-chromosomal DNAm sites (Spearman's rho = 0.91-0.98; p = 0.035). Moreover, 89,267 DNAm sites (12.4% of all analyzed, including 88,051 [12.5% of analyzed] autosomal and 1,216 [7.2% of analyzed] X-chromosomal sites) showed significant mother-newborn associations in methylation levels, and the top autosomal DNAm sites had high heritability than the genome-wide background (e.g., the top 100 autosomal DNAm sites had a medium h2of 0.92). Additionally, significant interactions between newborn sex and methylation levels were observed for 11 X-chromosomal and 4 autosomal DNAm sites that were mapped to genes that have been associated with sex-specific disease/traits or early development (e.g., EFHC2, NXY, ADCYAP1R1, and BMP4). Finally, 18,769 DNAm sites (14,482 [77.2%] on the X chromosome) showed mother-newborn differences in methylation levels that were significantly associated with newborn sex, and the top autosomal DNAm sites had relatively small heritability (e.g., the top 100 autosomal DNAm sites had a medium h2of 0.23). These DNAm sites were mapped to 2,532 autosomal genes and 978 X-chromosomal genes with significant enrichment in pathways involved in neurodegenerative and psychological diseases, development, neurophysiological process, immune response, and sex-specific cancers. Replication analysis in the Isle of Wight birth cohort yielded consistent results.In two independent birth cohorts, we demonstrated strong mother-newborn correlations in whole blood DNAm on both autosomes and ChrX, and such correlations vary substantially by sex. Future studies are needed to examine to what extent our findings contribute to developmental origins of pediatric and adult diseases with well-observed sex differences.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Here, we examined DNAm in diseased rectal mucosa from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, focusing on constituent cell types with the goal of identifying therapeutic targets for UC other than the immune system. We profiled DNAm of rectal mucosal biopsies of pediatric UC at diagnosis (n = 211) and non-IBD control (n = 85) patients and performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of specific cell types to understand DNAm changes in epithelial, immune and fibroblast cells across disease states, course, and clinical outcomes. We also examined longitudinal analysis on follow-up samples (n = 73), and comparisons were made among patients with clinical outcomes including those undergoing colectomy versus those who did not. Additionally, we included RNA-seq from the same subjects to assess the impact of CpG sites on the transcription of nearby genes during the disease course.At diagnosis, UC rectal mucosa exhibited a lower proportion of epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and higher proportion of immune cells, in conjunction with variation in the DNAm pattern. While treatment had significant effects on the methylation signature of immune cells, its effects on fibroblasts and epithelial cells were attenuated. Individuals who required colectomy exhibited cell composition and DNAm patterns at follow-up more similar to disease onset than patients who did not require colectomy. Combining these results with gene expression profiles, we identify CpG sites whose methylation patterns are most consistent with a contribution to poor disease outcomes and could thus be potential therapeutic targets.Cell-specific epigenetic changes in the rectal mucosa in UC are associated with disease severity and outcome. Current therapeutics may more effectively target the immune than the epithelial and fibroblast compartments.© 2023. Crown."
Sarah,Yes,20230330,ewas,36964402,Centenarian clocks: epigenetic clocks for validating claims of exceptional longevity.,Geroscience,"Claims surrounding exceptional longevity are sometimes disputed or dismissed for lack of credible evidence. Here, we present three DNA methylation-based age estimators (epigenetic clocks) for verifying age claims of centenarians. The three centenarian clocks were developed based on n = 7039 blood and saliva samples from individuals older than 40, including n = 184 samples from centenarians, 122 samples from semi-supercentenarians (aged 105 +), and 25 samples from supercentenarians (aged 110 +). The oldest individual was 115 years old. Our most accurate centenarian clock resulted from applying a neural network model to a training set composed of individuals older than 40. An epigenome-wide association study of age in different age groups revealed that age effects in young individuals (age < 40) are correlated (r = 0.55) with age effects in old individuals (age > 90). We present a chromatin state analysis of age effects in centenarians. The centenarian clocks are expected to be useful for validating claims surrounding exceptional old age.© 2023. The Author(s)."
?,Yes,20230330,ewas,36959629,DNA methylation patterns at birth predict health outcomes in young adults born very low birthweight.,Clin Epigenetics,"Individuals born very low birthweight (VLBW) are at increased risk of impaired cardiovascular and respiratory function in adulthood. To identify markers to predict future risk for VLBW individuals, we analyzed DNA methylation at birth and at 28 years in the New Zealand (NZ) VLBW cohort (all infants born < 1500 g in NZ in 1986) compared with age-matched, normal birthweight controls. Associations between neonatal methylation and cardiac structure and function (echocardiography), vascular function and respiratory outcomes at age 28 years were documented.Genomic DNA from archived newborn heel-prick blood (n = 109 VLBW, 51 controls) and from peripheral blood at ~ 28 years (n = 215 VLBW, 96 controls) was analyzed on Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC 850 K arrays. Following quality assurance and normalization, methylation levels were compared between VLBW cases and controls at both ages by linear regression, with genome-wide significance set to p < 0.05 adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini-Hochberg). In neonates, methylation at over 16,400 CpG methylation sites differed between VLBW cases and controls and the canonical pathway most enriched for these CpGs was Cardiac Hypertrophy Signaling (p = 3.44E-11). The top 20 CpGs that differed most between VLBW cases and controls featured clusters in ARID3A, SPATA33, and PLCH1 and these 3 genes, along with MCF2L, TRBJ2-1 and SRC, led the list of 15,000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) reaching FDR-adj significance. Fifteen of the 20 top CpGs in the neonate EWAS showed associations between methylation at birth and adult cardiovascular traits (particularly LnRHI). In 28-year-old adults, twelve CpGs differed between VLBW cases and controls at FDR-adjusted significance, including hypermethylation in EBF4 (four CpGs), CFI and UNC119B and hypomethylation at three CpGs in HIF3A and one in KCNQ1. DNA methylation GrimAge scores at 28 years were significantly greater in VLBW cases versus controls and weakly associated with cardiovascular traits. Four CpGs were identified where methylation differed between VLBW cases and controls in both neonates and adults, three reversing directions with age (two CpGs in EBF4, one in SNAI1 were hypomethylated in neonates, hypermethylated in adults). Of these, cg16426670 in EBF4 at birth showed associations with several cardiovascular traits in adults.These findings suggest that methylation patterns in VLBW neonates may be informative about future adult cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes and have value in guiding early preventative care to improve adult health.© 2023.

?,No,20230330,placenta,36945560,Potentially causal associations between placental DNA methylation and schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.,medRxiv,"Increasing evidence supports the role of placenta in neurodevelopment and potentially, in the later onset of neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) and interaction QTL (iQTL) maps have proven useful to understand SNP-genome wide association study (GWAS) relationships, otherwise missed by conventional expression QTLs. In this context, we propose that part of the genetic predisposition to complex neuropsychiatric disorders acts through placental DNA methylation (DNAm). We constructed the first public placentalcis-mQTL database including nearly eight million mQTLs calculated in 368 fetal placenta DNA samples from the INMA project, ran cell type- and gestational age-imQTL models and combined those data with the summary statistics of the largest GWAS on 10 neuropsychiatric disorders using Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and colocalization. Finally, we evaluated the influence of the DNAm sites identified on placental gene expression in the RICHS cohort. We found that placentalcis-mQTLs are highly enriched in placenta-specific active chromatin regions, and useful to map the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders at prenatal stages. Specifically, part of the genetic burden for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder confers risk through placental DNAm. The potential causality of several of the observed associations is reinforced by secondary association signals identified in conditional analyses, regional pleiotropic methylation signals associated to the same disorder, and cell type- imQTLs, additionally associated to the expression levels of relevant immune genes in placenta. In conclusion, the genetic risk of several neuropsychiatric disorders could operate, at least in part, through DNAm and associated gene expression in placenta."
?,No,20230330,dnam age,36973715,Ageing as a software design flaw.,Genome Biol,"Ageing is inherent to all human beings, yet why we age remains a hotly contested topic. Most mechanistic explanations of ageing posit that ageing is caused by the accumulation of one or more forms of molecular damage. Here, I propose that we age not because of inevitable damage to the hardware but rather because of intrinsic design flaws in the software, defined as the DNA code that orchestrates how a single cell develops into an adult organism. As the developmental software runs, its sequence of events is reflected in shifting cellular epigenetic states. Overall, I suggest that to understand ageing we need to decode our software and the flow of epigenetic information throughout the life course.© 2023. The Author(s)."
?,No,20230330,mediation,36824903,Methods for Mediation Analysis with High-Dimensional DNA Methylation Data: Possible Choices and Comparison.,medRxiv,"Epigenetic researchers often evaluate DNA methylation as a mediator between social/environmental exposures and disease, but modern statistical methods for jointly evaluating many mediators have not been widely adopted. We compare seven methods for high-dimensional mediation analysis with continuous outcomes through both diverse simulations and analysis of DNAm data from a large national cohort in the United States, while providing an R package for their implementation. Among the considered choices, the best-performing methods for detecting active mediators in simulations are the Bayesian sparse linear mixed model by Song et al. (2020) and high-dimensional mediation analysis by Gao et al. (2019); while the superior methods for estimating the global mediation effect are high-dimensional linear mediation analysis by Zhou et al. (2021) and principal component mediation analysis by Huang and Pan (2016). We provide guidelines for epigenetic researchers on choosing the best method in practice and offer suggestions for future methodological development."
,Yes,20230330,ewas,36964604,Mediation effects of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation on birth outcomes after prenatal per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure in the Michigan mother-infant Pairs cohort.,Clin Epigenetics,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are chemicals that are resistant to degradation and ubiquitous in our environments. PFAS may impact the developing epigenome, but current human evidence is limited to assessments of total DNA methylation. We assessed associations between first trimester PFAS exposures with newborn DNA methylation, including 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC). DNA methylation mediation of associations between PFAS and birth outcomes were explored in the Michigan Mother Infant Pairs cohort. Nine PFAS were measured in maternal first trimester blood. Seven were highly detected and included for analysis: PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, and MeFOSAA. Bisulfite-converted cord blood DNA (n = 141) and oxidative-bisulfite-converted cord blood (n = 70) were assayed on Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChips to measure total DNA methylation (5-mC + 5-hmC) and 5-mC/5-hmC. Correcting for multiple comparisons, beta regressions were used to assess associations between levels of PFAS and total methylation, 5-mC, or 5-hmC. Nonlinear mediation analyses were used to assess the epigenetic meditation effect between PFAS and birth outcomes.PFAS was significantly associated with total methylation (q < 0.05: PFHxS-12 sites; PFOS-19 sites; PFOA-2 sites; PFNA-3 sites; PFDA-4 sites). In 72 female infants and 69 male infants, there were sex-specific associations between five PFAS and DNA methylation. 5-mC and 5-hmC were each significantly associated with thousands of sites for PFHxS, PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, and MeFOSAA (q < 0.05). Clusters of 5-mC and 5-hmC sites were significant mediators between PFNA and PFUnDA and decreased gestational age (q < 0.05).This study demonstrates the mediation role of specific types of DNA methylation on the relationship between PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. These results suggest that 5-mC and 5-hmC may be more sensitive to the developmental impacts of PFAS than total DNA methylation.© 2023. The Author(s)."
,No,20230330,splicing,36949544,Evidence for the role of transcription factors in the co-transcriptional regulation of intron retention.,Genome Biol,"Alternative splicing is a widespread regulatory phenomenon that enables a single gene to produce multiple transcripts. Among the different types of alternative splicing, intron retention is one of the least explored despite its high prevalence in both plants and animals. The recent discovery that the majority of splicing is co-transcriptional has led to the finding that chromatin state affects alternative splicing. Therefore, it is plausible that transcription factors can regulate splicing outcomes.We provide evidence for the hypothesis that transcription factors are involved in the regulation of intron retention by studying regions of open chromatin in retained and excised introns. Using deep learning models designed to distinguish between regions of open chromatin in retained introns and non-retained introns, we identified motifs enriched in IR events with significant hits to known human transcription factors. Our model predicts that the majority of transcription factors that affect intron retention come from the zinc finger family. We demonstrate the validity of these predictions using ChIP-seq data for multiple zinc finger transcription factors and find strong over-representation for their peaks in intron retention events.This work opens up opportunities for further studies that elucidate the mechanisms by which transcription factors affect intron retention and other forms of splicing.Source code available at https://github.com/fahadahaf/chromir.© 2023.

,No,20230330,epigenetics,36978128,X chromosome dosage and the genetic impact across human tissues.,Genome Med,"Sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) give rise to a broad range of phenotypic traits and diseases. Previous studies based on peripheral blood samples have suggested the presence of ripple effects, caused by altered X chromosome number, affecting the methylome and transcriptome. Whether these alterations can be connected to disease-specific tissues, and thereby having clinical implication for the phenotype, remains to be elucidated.We performed a comprehensive analysis of X chromosome number on the transcriptome and methylome in blood, fat, and muscle tissue from individuals with 45,X, 46,XX, 46,XY, and 47,XXY.X chromosome number affected the transcriptome and methylome globally across all chromosomes in a tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, 45,X and 47,XXY demonstrated a divergent pattern of gene expression and methylation, with overall gene downregulation and hypomethylation in 45,X and gene upregulation and hypermethylation in 47,XXY. In fat and muscle, a pronounced effect of sex was observed. We identified X chromosomal genes with an expression pattern different from what would be expected based on the number of X and Y chromosomes. Our data also indicate a regulatory function of Y chromosomal genes on X chromosomal genes. Fourteen X chromosomal genes were downregulated in 45,X and upregulated in 47,XXY, respectively, in all three tissues (AKAP17A, CD99, DHRSX, EIF2S3, GTPBP6, JPX, KDM6A, PP2R3B, PUDP, SLC25A6, TSIX, XIST, ZBED1, ZFX). These genes may be central in the epigenetic and genomic regulation of sex chromosome aneuploidies.We highlight a tissue-specific and complex effect of X chromosome number on the transcriptome and methylome, elucidating both shared and non-shared gene-regulatory mechanism between SCAs.© 2023.

,No,20230330,intergenerational,36320451,Regular smoking of male ancestors in adolescence and fat mass in young adult grandchildren and great-grandchildren.,Wellcome Open Res,"Background: Previous studies using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) have shown that if men commenced smoking prior to the onset of puberty their sons, their granddaughters and great-granddaughters were more likely to have excess fat (but not lean) mass during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. In this study we assess associations between ancestral smoking during adolescence (ages 11-16 years) with fat and lean mass of subsequent generations at two ages.Methods:We analysed data on exposures of grandparents and great-grandparents collected by ALSPAC. The outcomes were the fat masses of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren measured at ages 17 and 24. Measures of lean mass were used as controls. Adjustment was made for 8-10 demographic factors using multiple regression.Results:We found associations between adolescent smoking of thepaternalgrandfathers and the adjusted fat mass of their grandchildren, but no associations with the grandchildren's lean mass. Grandchildren at age 17 had an average excess fat mass of +1.65 [95% CI +0.04, +3.26] Kg, and at age 24 an average excess of +1.55 [95% CI -0.27, +3.38] Kg. Adolescent smoking by thematernalgrandfather showed similar, but weaker, associations: at 17 an average excess fat mass of +1.02 Kg [95% CI -0.20, +2.25] Kg, and at 24 an average excess of +1.28 [95% CI -0.11, +2.66] Kg. There were no pronounced differences between the sexes of the children. For the great-grandparents there were few convincing results, although numbers were small.Conclusions:We have shown associations between grandfathers' smoking in adolescence and increased fat (but not lean) mass in their children. Confirmation of these associations is required, either in a further data set or by demonstrating the presence of supportive biomarkers.Copyright: © 2023 Gregory S et al."
