"36977041","Marine Pollutant Tributyltin Affects DNA Methylation and Fitness of Banded Murex (Hexaplex trunculus) Populations.","Toxics","Banded murex,Hexaplex trunculus, is a marine gastropod whose reproductive fitness can be severely affected by very low concentrations of antifouling compound tributyltin (TBT). TBT has strong xenoandrogen impacts on snails, causing the development of imposex (e.g., the superimposition of male sexual characteristic in females), thereby affecting the fitness of entire populations. TBT is also known as a DNA-demethylating agent and an obesogenic factor. The aim of this study was to unravel the interactions between TBT bioaccumulation, phenotypic responses, and epigenetic and genetic endpoints in native populations ofH. trunculus. Seven populations inhabiting environments along the pollution gradient were sampled in the coastal eastern Adriatic. These included sites of intense marine traffic and boat maintenance activity and sites with low anthropogenic impact. Populations inhabiting intermediately and highly polluted sites exhibited higher TBT burdens, higher incidences of imposex, and higher wet masses of snails than populations in lowly polluted sites. Other morphometric traits and cellular biomarker responses did not show clear differentiation among populations in relation to marine traffic/pollution intensity. An analysis of methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP) revealed environmentally driven population differentiation and higher epigenetics than genetic within-population diversity. Moreover, decreases in genome-wide DNA methylation coincided with the imposex level and snail mass, suggesting an epigenetic background of the animal phenotypic response."
"36976029","Tuberculostearic Acid Controls Mycobacterial Membrane Compartmentalization.","mBio","The intracellular membrane domain (IMD) is a laterally discrete region of the mycobacterial plasma membrane, enriched in the subpolar region of the rod-shaped cell. Here, we report genome-wide transposon sequencing to discover the controllers of membrane compartmentalization in Mycobacterium smegmatis. The putative genecfashowed the most significant effect on recovery from membrane compartment disruption by dibucaine. Enzymatic analysis of Cfa and lipidomic analysis of acfadeletion mutant (Δcfa) demonstrated that Cfa is an essential methyltransferase for the synthesis of major membrane phospholipids containing a C19:0monomethyl-branched stearic acid, also known as tuberculostearic acid (TBSA). TBSA has been intensively studied due to its abundant and genus-specific production in mycobacteria, but its biosynthetic enzymes had remained elusive. Cfa catalyzed theS-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase reaction using oleic acid-containing lipid as a substrate, and Δcfaaccumulated C18:1oleic acid, suggesting that Cfa commits oleic acid to TBSA biosynthesis, likely contributing directly to lateral membrane partitioning. Consistent with this model, Δcfadisplayed delayed restoration of subpolar IMD and delayed outgrowth after bacteriostatic dibucaine treatment. These results reveal the physiological significance of TBSA in controlling lateral membrane partitioning in mycobacteria.IMPORTANCEAs its common name implies, tuberculostearic acid is an abundant and genus-specific branched-chain fatty acid in mycobacterial membranes. This fatty acid, 10-methyl octadecanoic acid, has been an intense focus of research, particularly as a diagnostic marker for tuberculosis. It was discovered in 1934, and yet the enzymes that mediate the biosynthesis of this fatty acid and the functions of this unusual fatty acid in cells have remained elusive. Through a genome-wide transposon sequencing screen, enzyme assay, and global lipidomic analysis, we show that Cfa is the long-sought enzyme that is specifically involved in the first step of generating tuberculostearic acid. By characterizing acfadeletion mutant, we further demonstrate that tuberculostearic acid actively regulates lateral membrane heterogeneity in mycobacteria. These findings indicate the role of branched fatty acids in controlling the functions of the plasma membrane, a critical barrier for the pathogen to survive in its human host."
"36975604","Epigenome-Wide Changes in the Cell Layers of the Vein Wall When Exposing the Venous Endothelium to Oscillatory Shear Stress.","Epigenomes","Epigenomic changes in the venous cells exerted by oscillatory shear stress towards the endothelium may result in consolidation of gene expression alterations upon vein wall remodeling during varicose transformation. We aimed to reveal such epigenome-wide methylation changes. Primary culture cells were obtained from non-varicose vein segments left after surgery of 3 patients by growing the cells in selective media after magnetic immunosorting. Endothelial cells were either exposed to oscillatory shear stress or left at the static condition. Then, other cell types were treated with preconditioned media from the adjacent layer's cells. DNA isolated from the harvested cells was subjected to epigenome-wide study using Illumina microarrays followed by data analysis with GenomeStudio (Illumina), Excel (Microsoft), and Genome Enhancer (geneXplain) software packages. Differential (hypo-/hyper-) methylation was revealed for each cell layer's DNA. The most targetable master regulators controlling the activity of certain transcription factors regulating the genes near the differentially methylated sites appeared to be the following: (1) HGS, PDGFB, and AR for endothelial cells; (2) HGS, CDH2, SPRY2, SMAD2, ZFYVE9, and P2RY1 for smooth muscle cells; and (3) WWOX, F8, IGF2R, NFKB1, RELA, SOCS1, and FXN for fibroblasts. Some of the identified master regulators may serve as promising druggable targets for treating varicose veins in the future."
"36975440","Association of DNA Promoter Methylation and BRAF Mutation in Thyroid Cancer.","Curr Oncol","TheBRAFV600E mutation and DNA promoter methylation play important roles in the pathogenesis of thyroid cancer (TC). However, the association of these genetic and epigenetic alterations is not clear. In this study, using paired tumor and surrounding normal tissue from the same patients, on a genome-wide scale we tried to identify (a) any association betweenBRAFmutation and DNA promoter methylation, and (b) if the molecular findings may provide a basis for therapeutic intervention. We included 40 patients with TC (female = 28, male = 12) without distant metastasis.BRAFmutation was present in 18 cases. We identified groups of differentially methylated loci (DML) that are found in (a) bothBRAFmutant and wild type, (b) only inBRAFmutant tumors, and (c) only inBRAFwild type. BRAF mutation-specific promoter loci were more frequently hypomethylated, whereas BRAF wild-type-specific loci were more frequently hypermethylated. Common DML were enriched in cancer-related pathways, including the mismatch repair pathway and Wnt-signaling pathway. Wild-type-specific DML were enriched in RAS signaling. Methylation status of checkpoint signaling genes, as well as the T-cell inflamed genes, indicated an opportunity for the potential use ofPDL1inhibitors in BRAF mutant TC. Our study shows an association betweenBRAFmutation and methylation in TC that may have biological significance."

"36973520","Ganglioglioma with adverse clinical outcome and atypical histopathological features were defined by alterations in PTPN11/KRAS/NF1 and other RAS-/MAP-Kinase pathway genes.","Acta Neuropathol","Exome-wide sequencing studies recently described PTPN11 as a novel brain somatic epilepsy gene. In contrast, germline mutations of PTPN11 are known to cause Noonan syndrome, a multisystem disorder characterized by abnormal facial features, developmental delay, and sporadically, also brain tumors. Herein, we performed a deep phenotype-genotype analysis of a comprehensive series of ganglioglioma (GG) with brain somatic alterations of the PTPN11/KRAS/NF1 genes compared to GG with common MAP-Kinase signaling pathway alterations, i.e., BRAFV600E. Seventy-two GG were submitted to whole exome sequencing and genotyping and 84 low grade epilepsy associated tumors (LEAT) to DNA-methylation analysis. In 28 tumours, both analyses were available from the same sample. Clinical data were retrieved from hospital files including disease onset, age at surgery, brain localization, and seizure outcome. A comprehensive histopathology staining panel was available in all cases. We identified eight GG with PTPN11 alterations, copy number variant (CNV) gains of chromosome 12, and the commonality of additional CNV gains in NF1, KRAS, FGFR4 and RHEB, as well as BRAFV600E alterations. Histopathology revealed an atypical glio-neuronal phenotype with subarachnoidal tumor spread and large, pleomorphic, and multinuclear cellular features. Only three out of eight patients with GG and PTPN11/KRAS/NF1 alterations were free of disabling-seizures 2 years after surgery (38% had Engel I). This was remarkably different from our series of GG with only BRAFV600E mutations (85% had Engel I). Unsupervised cluster analysis of DNA methylation arrays separated these tumours from well-established LEAT categories. Our data point to a subgroup of GG with cellular atypia in glial and neuronal cell components, adverse postsurgical outcome, and genetically characterized by complex alterations in PTPN11 and other RAS-/MAP-Kinase and/or mTOR signaling pathways. These findings need prospective validation in clinical practice as they argue for an adaptation of the WHO grading system in developmental, glio-neuronal tumors associated with early onset focal epilepsy.© 2023.

"36971423","Epigenetics as a mediator of genetic risk in osteoarthritis: role during development, homeostasis, aging, and disease progression.","Am J Physiol Cell Physiol","The identification of genomic loci that are associated with osteoarthritis (OA) has provided a starting point for understanding how genetic variation activates catabolic processes in the joint. However, genetic variants can only alter gene expression and cellular function when the epigenetic environment is permissive for these effects. In this review, we provide examples of how epigenetic shifts at distinct life stages can alter the risk for OA, which we posit is critical for proper interpretation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). During development, intensive work on the growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) locus has revealed the importance of tissue-specific enhancer activity in controlling both joint development and the subsequent risk for OA. During homeostasis in adults, underlying genetic risk factors may help establish beneficial or catabolic ""set points"" that dictate tissue function, with a strong cumulative effect on OA risk. During aging, methylation changes and the re-organization of chromatin can ""unmask"" the effects of genetic variants. The destructive function of variants that alter aging would only mediate effects after reproductive competence and thus avoid any evolutionary selection pressure, as consistent with larger frameworks of biological aging and its relationship to disease. A similar ""unmasking"" may occur during OA progression, which is supported by the finding of distinct expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in chondrocytes depending on degree of tissue degradation. Finally, we propose that massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) will be a valuable tool to test the function of putative OA GWAS variants in chondrocytes from different life stages."
"36970373","The role of long non-coding RNAs in carbohydrate and fat metabolism in the liver.","Noncoding RNA Res","The metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids (fat) in the liver is closely interconnected both in physiological conditions and in pathology. This relationship in the body is possible due to the regulation by many factors, including epigenetic ones. Histone modifications, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs are considered to be the main epigenetic factors. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) refers to ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules that do not code for a protein. They cover a huge number of RNA classes and perform a wide range of biological functions such as regulating gene expression, protecting the genome from exogenous DNA, and directing DNA synthesis. One such class of ncRNAs that has been extensively studied are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The important role of lncRNAs in the formation and maintenance of normal homeostasis of biological systems, as well as participation in many pathological processes, has been proven. The results of recent studies indicate the importance of lncRNAs in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Modifications of lncRNAs expression can lead to disruption of biological processes in tissues, including fat and protein, such as adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Further study of lncRNAs made it possible to partly determine the regulatory mechanisms underlying the formation of an imbalance in carbohydrate and fat metabolism individually and in their relationship, and the degree of interaction between different types of cells involved in this process. This review will focus on the function of lncRNAs and its relation to hepatic carbohydrate and fat metabolism and related diseases in order to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and prospects for studies with lncRNAs.© 2023 The Authors."

"36966332","Sex differences in the intergenerational link between maternal and neonatal whole blood DNA methylation: a genome-wide analysis in 2 birth cohorts.","Clin Epigenetics","The mother-child inheritance of DNA methylation (DNAm) variations could contribute to the inheritance of disease susceptibility across generations. However, no study has investigated patterns of mother-child associations in DNAm at the genome-wide scale. It remains unknown whether there are sex differences in mother-child DNAm associations.Using genome-wide DNAm profiling data (721,331 DNAm sites, including 704,552 on autosomes and 16,779 on the X chromosome) of 396 mother-newborn pairs (54.5% male) from the Boston Birth Cohort, we found significant sex differences in mother-newborn correlations in genome-wide DNAm patterns (Spearman's rho = 0.91-0.98; p = 4.0 × 10-8), with female newborns having stronger correlations. Sex differences in correlations were attenuated but remained significant after excluding X-chromosomal DNAm sites (Spearman's rho = 0.91-0.98; p = 0.035). Moreover, 89,267 DNAm sites (12.4% of all analyzed, including 88,051 [12.5% of analyzed] autosomal and 1,216 [7.2% of analyzed] X-chromosomal sites) showed significant mother-newborn associations in methylation levels, and the top autosomal DNAm sites had high heritability than the genome-wide background (e.g., the top 100 autosomal DNAm sites had a medium h2of 0.92). Additionally, significant interactions between newborn sex and methylation levels were observed for 11 X-chromosomal and 4 autosomal DNAm sites that were mapped to genes that have been associated with sex-specific disease/traits or early development (e.g., EFHC2, NXY, ADCYAP1R1, and BMP4). Finally, 18,769 DNAm sites (14,482 [77.2%] on the X chromosome) showed mother-newborn differences in methylation levels that were significantly associated with newborn sex, and the top autosomal DNAm sites had relatively small heritability (e.g., the top 100 autosomal DNAm sites had a medium h2of 0.23). These DNAm sites were mapped to 2,532 autosomal genes and 978 X-chromosomal genes with significant enrichment in pathways involved in neurodegenerative and psychological diseases, development, neurophysiological process, immune response, and sex-specific cancers. Replication analysis in the Isle of Wight birth cohort yielded consistent results.In two independent birth cohorts, we demonstrated strong mother-newborn correlations in whole blood DNAm on both autosomes and ChrX, and such correlations vary substantially by sex. Future studies are needed to examine to what extent our findings contribute to developmental origins of pediatric and adult diseases with well-observed sex differences.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36966195","Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug target gene associations with major depressive disorders: a Mendelian randomisation study integrating GWAS, eQTL and mQTL Data.","Pharmacogenomics J","Previous observational studies reported associations between non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and major depressive disorder (MDD), however, these associations are often inconsistent and underlying biological mechanisms are still poorly understood. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) study to examine relationships between genetic variants and NSAID target gene expression or DNA methylation (DNAm) using publicly available expression, methylation quantitative trait loci (eQTL or mQTL) data and genetic variant-disease associations from genome-wide association studies (GWAS of MDD). We also assessed drug exposure using gene expression and DNAm levels of NSAID targets as proxies. Genetic variants were robustly adjusted for multiple comparisons related to gene expression, DNAm was used as MR instrumental variables and GWAS statistics of MDD as the outcome. A 1-standard deviation (SD) lower expression of NEU1 in blood was related to lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of -0.215 mg/L (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.128-0.426) and a decreased risk of MDD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.806; 95% CI: 0.735-0.885; p = 5.36 × 10-6). A concordant direction of association was also observed for NEU1 DNAm levels in blood and a risk of MDD (OR = 0.886; 95% CI: 0.836-0.939; p = 4.71 × 10-5). Further, the genetic variants associated with MDD were mediated by NEU1 expression via DNAm (β = -0.519; 95% CI: -0.717 to -0.320256; p = 3.16 × 10-7). We did not observe causal relationships between inflammatory genetic marker estimations and MDD risk. Yet, we identified a concordant association of NEU1 messenger RNA and an adverse direction of association of higher NEU1 DNAm with MDD risk. These results warrant increased pharmacovigilance and further in vivo or in vitro studies to investigate NEU1 inhibitors or supplements for MDD.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36964596","Longitudinal DNA methylation profiling of the rectal mucosa identifies cell-specific signatures of disease status, severity and clinical outcomes in ulcerative colitis cell-specific DNA methylation signatures of UC.","Clin Epigenetics","In peripheral blood, DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns in inflammatory bowel disease patients reflect inflammatory status rather than disease status. Here, we examined DNAm in diseased rectal mucosa from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, focusing on constituent cell types with the goal of identifying therapeutic targets for UC other than the immune system. We profiled DNAm of rectal mucosal biopsies of pediatric UC at diagnosis (n = 211) and non-IBD control (n = 85) patients and performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of specific cell types to understand DNAm changes in epithelial, immune and fibroblast cells across disease states, course, and clinical outcomes. We also examined longitudinal analysis on follow-up samples (n = 73), and comparisons were made among patients with clinical outcomes including those undergoing colectomy versus those who did not. Additionally, we included RNA-seq from the same subjects to assess the impact of CpG sites on the transcription of nearby genes during the disease course.At diagnosis, UC rectal mucosa exhibited a lower proportion of epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and higher proportion of immune cells, in conjunction with variation in the DNAm pattern. While treatment had significant effects on the methylation signature of immune cells, its effects on fibroblasts and epithelial cells were attenuated. Individuals who required colectomy exhibited cell composition and DNAm patterns at follow-up more similar to disease onset than patients who did not require colectomy. Combining these results with gene expression profiles, we identify CpG sites whose methylation patterns are most consistent with a contribution to poor disease outcomes and could thus be potential therapeutic targets.Cell-specific epigenetic changes in the rectal mucosa in UC are associated with disease severity and outcome. Current therapeutics may more effectively target the immune than the epithelial and fibroblast compartments.© 2023. Crown."
"36964402","Centenarian clocks: epigenetic clocks for validating claims of exceptional longevity.","Geroscience","Claims surrounding exceptional longevity are sometimes disputed or dismissed for lack of credible evidence. Here, we present three DNA methylation-based age estimators (epigenetic clocks) for verifying age claims of centenarians. The three centenarian clocks were developed based on n = 7039 blood and saliva samples from individuals older than 40, including n = 184 samples from centenarians, 122 samples from semi-supercentenarians (aged 105 +), and 25 samples from supercentenarians (aged 110 +). The oldest individual was 115 years old. Our most accurate centenarian clock resulted from applying a neural network model to a training set composed of individuals older than 40. An epigenome-wide association study of age in different age groups revealed that age effects in young individuals (age < 40) are correlated (r = 0.55) with age effects in old individuals (age > 90). We present a chromatin state analysis of age effects in centenarians. The centenarian clocks are expected to be useful for validating claims surrounding exceptional old age.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Molecular genetic testing contributes to accurate diagnosis and enables an optimal clinical management of affected children. Here, we investigated a rare, molecularly distinct type of pediatric high-grade neuroepithelial tumor (n = 18), that was identified through unsupervised visualization of genome-wide DNA methylation array data, together with copy number profiling, targeted next-generation DNA sequencing, and RNA transcriptome sequencing. DNA and/or RNA sequencing revealed recurrent fusions involving the capicua transcriptional repressor (CIC) gene in 10/10 tumor samples analyzed, with the most common fusion being CIC::LEUTX (n = 9). In addition, a CIC::NUTM1 fusion was detected in one of the tumors. Apart from the detected fusion events, no additional oncogenic alteration was identified in these tumors. The histopathological review demonstrated a morphologically heterogeneous group of high-grade neuroepithelial tumors with positive immunostaining for markers of glial differentiation in combination with weak and focal expression of synaptophysin, CD56 and CD99. All tumors were located in the supratentorial compartment, occurred during childhood (median age 8.5 years) and typically showed early relapses. In summary, we expand the spectrum of pediatric-type tumors of the CNS by reporting a previously uncharacterized group of rare high-grade neuroepithelial tumors that share a common DNA methylation signature and recurrent gene fusions involving the transcriptional repressor CIC. Downstream functional consequences of the fusion protein CIC::LEUTX and potential therapeutic implications need to be further investigated.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36959629","DNA methylation patterns at birth predict health outcomes in young adults born very low birthweight.","Clin Epigenetics","Individuals born very low birthweight (VLBW) are at increased risk of impaired cardiovascular and respiratory function in adulthood. To identify markers to predict future risk for VLBW individuals, we analyzed DNA methylation at birth and at 28 years in the New Zealand (NZ) VLBW cohort (all infants born < 1500 g in NZ in 1986) compared with age-matched, normal birthweight controls. Associations between neonatal methylation and cardiac structure and function (echocardiography), vascular function and respiratory outcomes at age 28 years were documented.Genomic DNA from archived newborn heel-prick blood (n = 109 VLBW, 51 controls) and from peripheral blood at ~ 28 years (n = 215 VLBW, 96 controls) was analyzed on Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC 850 K arrays. Following quality assurance and normalization, methylation levels were compared between VLBW cases and controls at both ages by linear regression, with genome-wide significance set to p < 0.05 adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini-Hochberg). In neonates, methylation at over 16,400 CpG methylation sites differed between VLBW cases and controls and the canonical pathway most enriched for these CpGs was Cardiac Hypertrophy Signaling (p = 3.44E-11). The top 20 CpGs that differed most between VLBW cases and controls featured clusters in ARID3A, SPATA33, and PLCH1 and these 3 genes, along with MCF2L, TRBJ2-1 and SRC, led the list of 15,000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) reaching FDR-adj significance. Fifteen of the 20 top CpGs in the neonate EWAS showed associations between methylation at birth and adult cardiovascular traits (particularly LnRHI). In 28-year-old adults, twelve CpGs differed between VLBW cases and controls at FDR-adjusted significance, including hypermethylation in EBF4 (four CpGs), CFI and UNC119B and hypomethylation at three CpGs in HIF3A and one in KCNQ1. DNA methylation GrimAge scores at 28 years were significantly greater in VLBW cases versus controls and weakly associated with cardiovascular traits. Four CpGs were identified where methylation differed between VLBW cases and controls in both neonates and adults, three reversing directions with age (two CpGs in EBF4, one in SNAI1 were hypomethylated in neonates, hypermethylated in adults). Of these, cg16426670 in EBF4 at birth showed associations with several cardiovascular traits in adults.These findings suggest that methylation patterns in VLBW neonates may be informative about future adult cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes and have value in guiding early preventative care to improve adult health.© 2023.

"36958667","Methylome changes associated with functional movement/conversion disorder: Influence of biological sex and childhood abuse exposure.","Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry","Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), may represent an important mechanism implicated in the etiopathogenesis of functional movement/conversion disorder (FMD). Here, we aimed to identify methylomic variations in a case-control cohort of FMD and to uncover specific epigenetic signatures associated with female sex and childhood abuse, two key risk factors for FMD and other functional neurological disorders. Genome-wide DNAm analysis was performed from peripheral blood in 57 patients with FMD and 47 healthy controls with and without childhood abuse. Using principal component analysis, we examined the association of principal components with FMD status in abused and non-abused individuals, in the entire study sample and in female subjects only. Next, we used enrichment pathway analysis to investigate the biological significance of DNAm changes and explored differences in methylation levels of genes annotated to the top enriched biological pathways shared across comparisons. We found that FMD was associated with DNAm variation across the genome and identified a common epigenetic 'signature' enriched for biological pathways implicated in chronic stress and chronic pain. However, methylation levels of genes included in the top two shared pathways hardly overlapped, suggesting that transcriptional profiles may differ as a function of childhood abuse exposure and sex among subjects with FMD. This study is unique in providing genome-wide evidence of DNAm changes in FMD and in indicating a potential mechanism linking childhood abuse exposure and female sex to differences in FMD pathophysiology. Future studies are needed to replicate our findings in independent cohorts.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier Inc."
"36958462","Integration of Mendelian randomisation and systems biology models to identify novel blood-based biomarkers for stroke.","J Biomed Inform","Stroke is the second largest cause of mortality in the world. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified some genetic variants associated with stroke risk, but their putative functional causal genes are unknown. Hence, we aimed to identify putative functional causal gene biomarkers of stroke risk. We used a summary-based Mendelian randomisation (SMR) approach to identify the pleiotropic associations of genetically regulated traits (i.e., gene expression and DNA methylation) with stroke risk. Using SMR approach, we integrated cis-expression quantitative loci (cis-eQTLs) and cis-methylation quantitative loci (cis-mQTLs) data with GWAS summary statistics of stroke. We also utilised heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) test to distinguish pleiotropy from linkage from the observed associations identified through SMR analysis. Our integrative SMR analyses and HEIDI test revealed 45 candidate biomarker genes (FDR < 0.05; PHEIDI>0.01) that were pleiotropically or potentially causally associated with stroke risk. Of those candidate biomarker genes, 10 genes (HTRA1, PMF1, FBN2, C9orf84, COL4A1, BAG4, NEK6, SH2B3, SH3PXD2A, ACAD10) were differentially expressed in genome-wide blood transcriptomics data from stroke and healthy individuals (FDR<0.05). Functional enrichment analysis of the identified candidate biomarker genes revealed gene ontologies and pathways involved in stroke, including ""cell aging"", ""metal ion binding"" and ""oxidative damage"". Based on the evidence of genetically regulated expression of genes through SMR and directly measured expression of genes in blood, our integrative analysis suggests ten genes as blood biomarkers of stroke risk. Furthermore, our study provides a better understanding of the influence of DNA methylation on the expression of genes linked to stroke risk.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Hence, a deeper understanding of the initial populations of hiPSCs is required to instruct proficient lineage commitment.hiPSCs were generated from somatic cells by transduction of 4 human transcription factors (OCT4,SOX2,KLF4, andC-MYC) using Sendai virus vectors. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis and transcriptional analysis were performed to evaluate the pluripotent capacity and somatic memory state of hiPSCs. Flow cytometric analysis and colony assays were performed to assess the hematopoietic differentiation capacity of hiPSCs.Here, we reveal human umbilical arterial endothelial cell-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (HuA-iPSCs) exhibit indistinguishable pluripotency in comparison with human embryonic stem cells and hiPSCs derived from other tissues of origin (umbilical vein endothelial cells, cord blood, foreskin fibroblasts, and fetal skin fibroblasts). However, HuA-iPSCs retain a transcriptional memory typical of the parental human umbilical cord arterial endothelial cells, together with a strikingly similar DNA methylation signature to umbilical cord blood-derived induced pluripotent stem cells that distinguishes them from other human pluripotent stem cells. Ultimately, HuA-iPSCs are most efficient in targeted differentiation toward hematopoietic lineage among all human pluripotent stem cells based on the functional and quantitative evaluation of both flow cytometric analysis and colony assays. Application of the Rho-kinase activator significantly reduces the effects of preferential hematopoietic differentiation in HuA-iPSCs, reflected in CD34+cell percentage of day 7, hematopoietic/endothelial-associated gene expression, and even colony-forming unit numbers.Collectively, our data suggest that somatic cell memory may predispose HuA-iPSCs to differentiate more amenably into hematopoietic fate, bringing us closer to generating hematopoietic cell types in vitro from nonhematopoietic tissue for therapeutic applications."

The level of genome-wide methylation of CCGG sites was determined by methyl-sensitive restriction using MspI/HpaII endonucleases followed by densitometric analysis of electrophoregrams by ImageJ software.Incomplete cerebral ischemia on the 7th day leads to 56.3% (95% CI: 33.2-76.90) mortality. In the surviving rats of the «Cerebral ischemia» group, compared with the animals of the «Sham operation» group, a pronounced neurological deficit was observed, which was accompanied by changes in the level of whole-genome DNA methylation in the nervous tissue of brain structures (p<0.05). Incomplete cerebral ischemia in male Wistar rats was characterized by interhemispheric asymmetry in the severity and direction of the epigenomic reaction of the nervous tissue in both ischemic and non-ischemic areas of the brain.It is likely that it is precisely this dynamics of changes in the status of genome-wide DNA methylation in the nervous tissue that imparts plasticity to neuronal function during ischemic damage."
"36949572","N6-methyladenosine RNA modification regulates cotton drought response in a Ca(2+) and ABA-dependent manner.","Plant Biotechnol J","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent internal modification present in mRNAs, and is considered to participate in a range of developmental and biological processes. Drought response is highly regulated at the genomic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. However, the biological function and regulatory mechanism of m6A modification in the drought stress response is still poorly understood. We generated a transcriptome-wide m6A map using drought-resistant and drought-sensitive varieties of cotton under different water deficient conditions to uncover patterns of m6A methylation in cotton response to drought stress. The results reveal that m6A represents a common modification and exhibit dramatic changes in distribution during drought stress. More 5'UTR m6A was deposited in the drought-resistant variety and was associated with a positive effect on drought resistance by regulating mRNA abundance. Interestingly, we observed that increased m6A abundance was associated with increased mRNA abundance under drought, contributing to drought resistance, and vice versa. The demethylase GhALKBH10B was found to decrease m6A levels, facilitating the mRNA decay of ABA signal-related genes (GhZEP, GhNCED4 and GhPP2CA) and Ca2+signal-related genes (GhECA1, GhCNGC4, GhANN1 and GhCML13), and mutation of GhALKBH10B enhanced drought resistance at seedling stage in cotton. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of two Ca2+-related genes, GhECA1 and GhCNGC4, reduced drought resistance with the decreased m6A enrichment on silenced genes in cotton. Collectively, we reveal a novel mechanism of post-transcriptional modification involved in affecting drought response in cotton, by mediating m6A methylation on targeted transcripts in the ABA and Ca2+signalling transduction pathways.© 2023 The Authors.

Here, we investigated methanogenic populations inhabiting terrestrial geothermal features in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) by combining amplicon sequencing with metagenomics and mesocosm experiments. Detection of methyl-coenzyme M reductase subunit A (mcrA) gene amplicons demonstrated a wide diversity of Mcr-encoding archaea inhabit geothermal features with differing physicochemical regimes across YNP. From three selected hot springs we recovered twelve Mcr-encoding metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) affiliated with lineages of cultured methanogens as well as Candidatus (Ca.) Methanomethylicia, Ca. Hadesarchaeia, and Archaeoglobi. These MAGs encoded the potential for hydrogenotrophic, aceticlastic, hydrogen-dependent methylotrophic methanogenesis, or anaerobic short-chain alkane oxidation. While Mcr-encoding archaea represent minor fractions of the microbial community of hot springs, mesocosm experiments with methanogenic precursors resulted in the stimulation of methanogenic activity and the enrichment of lineages affiliated with Methanosaeta and Methanothermobacter as well as with uncultured Mcr-encoding archaea including Ca. Korarchaeia, Ca. Nezhaarchaeia, and Archaeoglobi. We revealed that diverse Mcr-encoding archaea with the metabolic potential to produce methane from different precursors persist in the geothermal environments of YNP and can be enriched under methanogenic conditions. This study highlights the importance of combining environmental metagenomics with laboratory-based experiments to expand our understanding of uncultured Mcr-encoding archaea and their potential impact on microbial carbon transformations in geothermal environments and beyond.© 2023.

DNA methylation, a determinant of genetic imprinting andde novosilencing of genes genome-wide, is known to be controlled by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and demethylases (TET) under disease conditions. However, the mechanism(s)/factor(s) influencing the expression and activity of DNMTs and TETs, and thus DNA methylation, in healthy vascular tissue is incompletely understood. Based on our recent studies, we hypothesized that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a modifier of DNMT and TET expression and activity and an enabler of gene expression.In aorta of CRISPR-edited rats with the Mediterranean G6PD variant we determined DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, gene expression by RNA sequencing, and large artery stiffness by echocardiography.Here, we documented higher expression ofDnmt3a, Tet2, andTet3in aortas from Mediterranean G6PDS188Fvariant (a loss-of-function single nucleotide polymorphism) rats than their wild-type littermates. Concomitantly, we identified 17,618 differentially methylated loci genome-wide (5,787 hypermethylated loci, including down-regulated genes encoding inflammation- and vasoconstriction-causing proteins, and 11,827 hypomethylated loci, including up-regulated genes encoding smooth muscle cell differentiation- and fatty acid metabolism-promoting proteins) in aorta from G6PDS188Fas compared to wild-type rats. Further, we observed less large artery (aorta) stiffness in G6PDS188Fas compared to wild-type rats.These results establish a noncanonical function of the wild-type G6PD and G6PDS188Fvariant in the regulation of DNA methylation and gene expression in healthy vascular tissue and reveals G6PDS188Fvariant contributes to reduce large artery stiffness.The wild-type G6PD and G6PDS188Fvariant regulates the expression and activity of nuclear DNMT and TET and selectively evokes hyper/hypo-methylation of loci/promoter regions genome-wide. G6PDS188Fvariant represses and activates genes detrimental and beneficial to vascular cell phenotype and function, respectively. G6PDS188Fvariant reduces large artery stiffness."
"36945560","Potentially causal associations between placental DNA methylation and schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","medRxiv","Increasing evidence supports the role of placenta in neurodevelopment and potentially, in the later onset of neuropsychiatric disorders. Recently, methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) and interaction QTL (iQTL) maps have proven useful to understand SNP-genome wide association study (GWAS) relationships, otherwise missed by conventional expression QTLs. In this context, we propose that part of the genetic predisposition to complex neuropsychiatric disorders acts through placental DNA methylation (DNAm). We constructed the first public placentalcis-mQTL database including nearly eight million mQTLs calculated in 368 fetal placenta DNA samples from the INMA project, ran cell type- and gestational age-imQTL models and combined those data with the summary statistics of the largest GWAS on 10 neuropsychiatric disorders using Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and colocalization. Finally, we evaluated the influence of the DNAm sites identified on placental gene expression in the RICHS cohort. We found that placentalcis-mQTLs are highly enriched in placenta-specific active chromatin regions, and useful to map the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders at prenatal stages. Specifically, part of the genetic burden for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder confers risk through placental DNAm. The potential causality of several of the observed associations is reinforced by secondary association signals identified in conditional analyses, regional pleiotropic methylation signals associated to the same disorder, and cell type- imQTLs, additionally associated to the expression levels of relevant immune genes in placenta. In conclusion, the genetic risk of several neuropsychiatric disorders could operate, at least in part, through DNAm and associated gene expression in placenta."

Here, using an off-line MALDI-TOF-MS approach, we have analyzed the N-glycans of mixed embryos and liquid- or plate-grown L4 larvae. Of the over 200 different annotatable N-glycan structures, variations between the stages as well as the mode of cultivation were observed. While the embryonal N-glycome appears less complicated overall, the liquid- and plate-grown larvae differ especially in terms of methylation of bisecting fucose, α-galactosylation of mannose, and di-β-galactosylation of core α1,6-fucose. Furthermore, we analyzed the O-glycans by LC-electrospray ionization-MS following β-elimination; especially the embryonal O-glycomes included a set of phosphorylcholine-modified structures, previously not shown to exist in nematodes. However, the set of glycan structures cannot be clearly correlated with levels of glycosyltransferase transcripts in developmental RNA-Seq datasets, but there is an indication for coordinated expression of clusters of potential glycosylation-relevant genes. Thus, there are still questions to be answered in terms of how and why a simple nematode synthesizes such a diverse glycome.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Little is known about the association of DNA methylation age (DNAm age) with coronary heart disease (CHD), especially in the Asian population.Methylation level of baseline blood leukocyte DNA was measured by Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip for 491 incident CHD cases and 489 controls in the prospective China Kadoorie Biobank. We calculated the methylation age using a prediction model developed among Chinese. The correlation between chronological age and DNAm age was 0.90. DNA methylation age acceleration (Δage) was defined as the residual of regressing DNA methylation age on the chronological age. After adjustment for multiple risk factors of CHD and cell type proportion, compared with participants in the bottom quartile of Δage, the OR (95% CI) for CHD was 1.84 (1.17, 2.89) for participants in the top quartile. One SD increment in Δage was associated with 30% increased risk of CHD (OR = 1.30; 95% CI 1.09, 1.56; Ptrend = 0.003). The average number of cigarette equivalents consumed per day and waist-to-hip ratio were positively associated with Δage; red meat consumption was negatively associated with Δage, characterized by accelerated aging in those who never or rarely consumed red meat (all P < 0.05). Further mediation analysis revealed that 10%, 5% and 18% of the CHD risk related to smoking, waist-to-hip ratio and never or rarely red meat consumption was mediated through methylation aging, respectively (all P for mediation effect < 0.05).We first identified the association between DNAm age acceleration and incident CHD in the Asian population, and provided evidence that unfavorable lifestyle-induced epigenetic aging may play an important part in the underlying pathway to CHD.© 2023.

This review comprehensively summarizes a variety of current topics surrounding the biological effects of adverse social determinants (i.e., the biology of adversity), linking translational and laboratory studies with epidemiologic findings. With a strong focus on the biological effects of chronic stress, we highlight an array of studies on molecular and immunological signaling in the context of social determinants of health (SDoH). The main topics covered include biomarkers of sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, and the role of inflammation in the biology of adversity focusing on glucocorticoid resistance and key inflammatory cytokines linked to psychosocial and environmental stressors (PSES). We then further discuss the effect of SDoH on immune cell distribution and characterization by subset, receptor expression, and function. Lastly, we describe epigenetic regulation of the chronic stress response and effects of SDoH on telomere length and aging. Ultimately, we highlight critical knowledge gaps for future research as we strive to develop more targeted interventions that account for SDoH to improve cardiometabolic health for at-risk, vulnerable populations.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"36973715","Ageing as a software design flaw.","Genome Biol","Ageing is inherent to all human beings, yet why we age remains a hotly contested topic. Most mechanistic explanations of ageing posit that ageing is caused by the accumulation of one or more forms of molecular damage. Here, I propose that we age not because of inevitable damage to the hardware but rather because of intrinsic design flaws in the software, defined as the DNA code that orchestrates how a single cell develops into an adult organism. As the developmental software runs, its sequence of events is reflected in shifting cellular epigenetic states. Overall, I suggest that to understand ageing we need to decode our software and the flow of epigenetic information throughout the life course.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, an incomplete understanding of how autophagy contributes to disease pathogenesis has limited progress in acting on this potential target for the development of disease modifying therapeutics. Research in the past few decades has revealed that autophagy plays a specialized role in the synapse, a site of early dysfunction in multiple neurodegenerative diseases. In this review we discuss the evidence suggesting that inadequate autophagy at the synapse may contribute to neurodegeneration, and why the functions of autophagy may be particularly relevant for synaptic function."

We aimed to estimate the association of sleeping, sedentary behavior, and physical activity with aging among adults, considering the competing nature between variables of activity status.A total of 5288 participants who were 20 years or older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were involved. The questionnaire was used to collect data regarding sociodemographics (age, sex, ethnicity/race, and education), and lifestyle behaviors (smoking, drinking). The Global Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to measure self-reported time for sedentary behavior, walking/bicycling, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The sleeping duration was obtained via interview. Phenotypic age acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel) was calculated as an aging index using nine chemistry biomarkers. Isotemporal substitution models using multivariable linear regression to examine the associations of sleeping, sedentary behavior, and physical activity with PhenoAgeAccel, stratified by MVPA (< 150 min/week, ≥ 150 min/week).Thirty minutes per day spent on sedentary behavior was positively associated with PhenoAgeAccel (β = 0.07, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.11), and 30 min/day spent on leisure-time MVPA was adversely associated with PhenoAgeAccel (β =  - 0.55, 95% CI: - 0.73, - 0.38). Replacing 30 min/day sedentary behaviors with 30 min/day of MVPA (β = -3.98, 95% CI: -6.22, -1.74) or 30 min/day of walking/bicycling (β = -0.89, 95% CI: -1.10, -0.68) was adversely associated with PhenoAgeAccel. Substituting 30 min/day of walking/bicycling for 30 min/day of leisure-time MVPA was positively associated with PhenoAgeAccel (β = 3.09, 95% CI: 0.93, 5.25).Sedentary behavior was positively associated with aging. Replacing sedentary behaviors with walking/bicycling or MVPA was adversely associated with aging among adults.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Importantly, genetic variations or environmental perturbations of epitranscriptome modifiers (that is, writers, erasers and readers) are associated with obesity and metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. The epitranscriptome is closely coupled to epigenetic signalling, adding complexity to our understanding of gene expression in both health and disease. Moreover, the epitranscriptome in the parental generation can affect organismal phenotypes in the next generation.

"36949060","BrainGENIE: The Brain Gene Expression and Network Imputation Engine.","Transl Psychiatry","In vivo experimental analysis of human brain tissue poses substantial challenges and ethical concerns. To address this problem, we developed a computational method called the Brain Gene Expression and Network-Imputation Engine (BrainGENIE) that leverages peripheral-blood transcriptomes to predict brain tissue-specific gene-expression levels. Paired blood-brain transcriptomic data collected by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project was used to train BrainGENIE models to predict gene-expression levels in ten distinct brain regions using whole-blood gene-expression profiles. The performance of BrainGENIE was compared to PrediXcan, a popular method for imputing gene expression levels from genotypes. BrainGENIE significantly predicted brain tissue-specific expression levels for 2947-11,816 genes (false-discovery rate-adjusted p < 0.05), including many transcripts that cannot be predicted significantly by a transcriptome-imputation method such as PrediXcan. BrainGENIE recapitulated measured diagnosis-related gene-expression changes in the brain for autism, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia better than direct correlations from blood and predictions from PrediXcan. We developed a convenient software toolset for deploying BrainGENIE, and provide recommendations for how best to implement models. BrainGENIE complements and, in some ways, outperforms existing transcriptome-imputation tools, providing biologically meaningful predictions and opening new research avenues.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36950384","Protein interaction studies in human induced neurons indicate convergent biology underlying autism spectrum disorders.","Cell Genom","Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have been linked to genes with enriched expression in the brain, but it is unclear how these genes converge into cell-type-specific networks. We built a protein-protein interaction network for 13 ASD-associated genes in human excitatory neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The network contains newly reported interactions and is enriched for genetic and transcriptional perturbations observed in individuals with ASDs. We leveraged the network data to show that the ASD-linked brain-specific isoform of ANK2 is important for its interactions with synaptic proteins and to characterize a PTEN-AKAP8L interaction that influences neuronal growth. The IGF2BP1-3 complex emerged as a convergent point in the network that may regulate a transcriptional circuit of ASD-associated genes. Our findings showcase cell-type-specific interactomes as a framework to complement genetic and transcriptomic data and illustrate how both individual and convergent interactions can lead to biological insights into ASDs.© 2023 The Authors."

Recent observations suggest a role for NLRC5 in metabolic traits and in transcriptional regulation beyond MHC class I genes. To understand the function of NLRC5 in metabolic disease, we subjectedNlrc5-/-mice to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. FemaleNlrc5-/-mice presented with higher weight gain and more adipose tissue (AT) compared to wild-type (WT) animals. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that NLRC5 enhanced the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ target genes in human cells. We identify Sin3A and negative elongation factor (NELF) B as two novel NLRC5 interaction partners and show that Sin3A partly modulates the synergistic transcriptional effect of NLRC5 on PPARγ. Collectively, we show that NLRC5 contributes to weight gain in mice, which involves transcriptional enhancement of PPARγ targets by NLRC5 that is co-regulated by Sin3A.© 2023 The Author(s)."

WRC has naturally low outcrossing rates and readily self-fertilizes in nature. Challenges faced in WRC breeding and propagation involve selecting trees for accelerated growth while also ensuring enhanced heartwood rot resistance and resistance to ungulate browsing, as well as mitigating potential effects of inbreeding depression. Terpenes, a large and diverse class of specialized metabolites, confer both rot and browse resistance in the wood and foliage of WRC, respectively. Using a Bayesian modelling approach, we isolated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers estimated to be associated with three different foliar terpene traits and four different heartwood terpene traits, as well as two growth traits. We found that all traits were complex, being associated with between 1700 and 3600 SNPs linked with putatively causal loci, with significant polygenic components. Growth traits tended to have a larger polygenic component while terpene traits had larger major gene components; SNPs with small or polygenic effect were spread across the genome, while larger-effect SNPs tended to be localized to specific linkage groups. To determine whether there was inbreeding depression for terpene chemistry or growth traits, we used mixed linear models for a genomic selection training population to estimate the effect of the inbreeding coefficientFon foliar terpenes, heartwood terpenes and several growth and dendrochronological traits. We did not find significant inbreeding depression for any assessed trait. We further assessed inbreeding depression across four generations of complete selfing and found that not only was inbreeding depression not significant but that selection for height growth was the only significant predictor for growth during selfing, suggesting that inbreeding depression due to selfing during operational breeding can be mitigated by increased selection intensity.© 2023 The Authors.

Here, we estimate the heritability of G×E interaction for body mass index (BMI) by subjecting genome-wide interaction study data of 331,282 participants in the UK Biobank to linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and linkage disequilibrium adjusted kinships-software for estimating SNP heritability from summary statistics (LDAK-SumHer) analyses. Among 14 obesity-related lifestyle factors, MET score, pack years of smoking, and alcohol intake frequency significantly interact with genetic factors in both analyses, accounting for the partial variance of BMI. The G×E interaction heritability (%) and standard error of these factors by LDSC and LDAK-SumHer are as follows: MET score, 0.45% (0.12) and 0.65% (0.24); pack years of smoking, 0.52% (0.13) and 0.93% (0.26); and alcohol intake frequency, 0.32% (0.10) and 0.80% (0.17), respectively. Moreover, these three factors are partially validated for their interactions with genetic factors in other obesity-related traits, including waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip ratio adjusted with BMI, and body fat percentage. Our results suggest that G×E interaction may partly explain the missing heritability in BMI, and two G×E interaction loci identified could help in understanding the genetic architecture of obesity.© 2023.

Since the origin of our species most of these nutrient-gene communication pathways have not changed. However, our genome experienced over the past 50,000 years a number of evolutionary pressures, which are based on the migration to new environments concerning geography and climate, the transition from hunter-gatherers to farmers including the zoonotic transfer of many pathogenic microbes and the rather recent change of societies to a preferentially sedentary lifestyle and the dominance of Western diet. Human populations responded to these challenges not only by specific anthropometric adaptations, such as skin color and body stature, but also through diversity in dietary intake and different resistance to complex diseases like the metabolic syndrome, cancer and immune disorders. The genetic basis of this adaptation process has been investigated by whole genome genotyping and sequencing including that of DNA extracted from ancient bones. In addition to genomic changes, also the programming of epigenomes in pre- and postnatal phases of life has an important contribution to the response to environmental changes. Thus, insight into the variation of our (epi)genome in the context of our individual's risk for developing complex diseases, helps to understand the evolutionary basis how and why we become ill. This review will discuss the relation of diet, modern environment and our (epi)genome including aspects of redox biology.

Gangliogliomas are often characterized by a rare population of immature astrocyte-appearing cells expressing CD34, a marker expressed in the neuroectoderm (neural precursor cells) during embryogenesis. New insights are needed to refine tumor classification and to identify therapeutic approaches. We evaluated five gangliogliomas with single nucleus RNA-seq, cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing, and/or spatially-resolved RNA-seq. We uncovered a population of CD34+ neoplastic cells with mixed neuroectodermal, immature astrocyte, and neuronal markers. Gene regulatory network interrogation in these neuroectoderm-like cells revealed control of transcriptional programming by TCF7L2/MEIS1-PAX6 and SOX2, similar to that found during neuroectodermal/neural development. Developmental trajectory analyses place neuroectoderm-like tumor cells as precursor cells that give rise to neuron-like and macroglia-like neoplastic cells. Spatially-resolved transcriptomics revealed a neuroectoderm-like tumor cell niche with relative lack of vascular and immune cells. We used these high resolution results to deconvolute clinically-annotated transcriptomic data, confirming that CD34+ cell-associated gene programs associate with gangliogliomas compared to other glial brain tumors. Together, these deep transcriptomic approaches characterized a ganglioglioma cellular hierarchy-confirming CD34+ neuroectoderm-like tumor precursor cells, controlling transcription programs, cell signaling, and associated immune cell states.

Early warning signals that are easy to detect and widely available can save lives. Estonia has one nation-wide Electronic Health Record (EHR) database for the storage of medical information of patients from hospitals and primary care providers.We extracted structured and unstructured data from the EHRs of participants of the Estonian Biobank (EstBB) and evaluated different formats of input data to understand how this continuously growing dataset should be prepared for best prediction. The utility of the EHR database for finding blood- and urine-based biomarkers for IS was demonstrated by applying different analytical and machine learning (ML) methods.Several early trends in common clinical laboratory parameter changes (set of red blood indices, lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio, etc.) were established for IS prediction. The developed ML models predicted the future occurrence of IS with very high accuracy and Random Forests was proved as the most applicable method to EHR data.We conclude that the EHR database and the risk factors uncovered are valuable resources in screening the population for risk of IS as well as constructing disease risk scores and refining prediction models for IS by ML.© 2023.

We assessed the individual and joint associations of each smoking exposure measure and maternal OWO with childhood OWO using multinomial logistic regressions. We used nested logistic regressions to investigate the childhood OWO prediction performance when adding maternal and cord plasma biomarkers as input covariates on top of self-reported data.Our results demonstrated thatin uterocigarette smoking exposure defined by self-report and by maternal or cord metabolites was consistently associated with increased risk of long-term child OWO. Children with cord hydroxycotinine in the 4th quartile (vs. 1st quartile) had 1.66 (95% CI 1.03-2.66) times the odds for overweight and 1.57 (95% CI 1.05-2.36) times the odds for obesity. The combined effect of maternal overweight or obesity and smoking on offspring risk of obesity is 3.66 (95% CI 2.37-5.67) if using self-reported smoking. Adding maternal and cord plasma biomarker information to self-reported data improved the prediction accuracy of long-term child OWO risk.This longitudinal birth cohort study of US BIPOC underscored the role of maternal smoking as an obesogen for offspring OWO risk. Our findings call for public health intervention strategies to focus on maternal smoking - as a highly modifiable target, including smoking cessation and countermeasures (such as optimal nutrition) that may alleviate the increasing obesity burden in the U.S. and globally."
"36959830","The shared genetic architecture of suicidal behaviour and psychiatric disorders: A genomic structural equation modelling study.","Front Genet","Background:Suicidal behaviour (SB) refers to behaviours, ranging from non-fatal suicidal behaviour, such as suicidal ideation and attempt, to completed suicide. Despite recent advancements in genomic technology and statistical methods, it is unclear to what extent the spectrum of suicidal behaviour is explained by shared genetic aetiology.Methods:We identified nine genome-wide association statistics of suicidal behaviour (sample sizes,n, ranging from 62,648 to 125,844), ten psychiatric traits [nup to 386,533] and collectively, nine summary datasets of anthropometric, behavioural and socioeconomic-related traits [nranging from 58,610 to 941,280]. We calculated the genetic correlation among these traits and modelled this using genomic structural equation modelling, identified shared biological processes and pathways between suicidal behaviour and psychiatric disorders and evaluated potential causal associations using Mendelian randomisation.Results:Among populations of European ancestry, we observed strong positive genetic correlations between suicide ideation, attempt and self-harm (rg range, 0.71-1.09) and moderate to strong genetic correlations between suicidal behaviour traits and a range of psychiatric disorders, most notably, major depression disorder (rg = 0.86,p= 1.62 × 10-36). Multivariate analysis revealed a common factor structure for suicidal behaviour traits, major depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and alcohol use disorder. The derived common factor explained 38.7% of the shared variance across the traits. We identified 2,951 genes and 98 sub-network hub genes associated with the common factor, including pathways associated with developmental biology, signal transduction and RNA degradation. We found suggestive evidence for the protective effects of higher household income level on suicide attempt [OR = 0.55 (0.44-0.70),p= 1.29 × 10-5] and while further investigation is needed, a nominal significant effect of smoking on suicide attempt [OR = 1.24 (1.04-1.44),p= 0.026].Conclusion:Our findings provide evidence of shared aetiology between suicidal behaviour and psychiatric disorders and indicate potential common molecular mechanisms contributing to the overlapping pathophysiology. These findings provide a better understanding of the complex genetic architecture of suicidal behaviour and have implications for the prevention and treatment of suicidal behaviour.Copyright © 2023 Kootbodien, London, Martin, Defo and Ramesar."
"36945610","Comparing the stability and reproducibility of brain-behaviour relationships found using Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares within the ABCD Sample.","bioRxiv","Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Partial Least Squares Correlation (PLS) detect associations between two data matrices based on computing a linear combination between the two matrices (called latent variables; LVs). These LVs maximize correlation (CCA) and covariance (PLS). These different maximization criteria may render one approach more stable and reproducible than the other when working with brain and behavioural data at the population-level. This study compared the LVs which emerged from CCA and PLS analyses of brain-behaviour relationships from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset and examined their stability and reproducibility.Structural T1-weighted imaging and behavioural data were accessed from the baseline Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development dataset (N> 9000, ages = 9-11 years). The brain matrix consisted of cortical thickness estimates in different cortical regions. The behavioural matrix consisted of 11 subscale scores from the parent-reported Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) or 7 cognitive performance measures from the NIH Toolbox. CCA and PLS models were separately applied to the brain-CBCL analysis and brain-cognition analysis. A permutation test was used to assess whether identified LVs were statistically significant. A series of resampling statistical methods were used to assess stability and reproducibility of the LVs.When examining the relationship between cortical thickness and CBCL scores, the first LV was found to be significant across both CCA and PLS models (singular value: CCA = .13, PLS = .39,p< .001). LV1from the CCA model found that covariation of CBCL scores was linked to covariation of cortical thickness. LV1from the PLS model identified decreased cortical thickness linked to lower CBCL scores. There was limited evidence of stability or reproducibility of LV1for both CCA and PLS. When examining the relationship between cortical thickness and cognitive performance, there were 6 significant LVs for both CCA and PLS (p< .01). The first LV showed similar relationships between CCA and PLS and was found to be stable and reproducible (singular value: CCA = .21, PLS = .43,p< .001).CCA and PLS identify different brain-behaviour relationships with limited stability and reproducibility when examining the relationship between cortical thickness and parent-reported behavioural measures. However, both methods identified relatively similar brain-behaviour relationships that were stable and reproducible when examining the relationship between cortical thickness and cognitive performance. The results of the current study suggest that stability and reproducibility of brain-behaviour relationships identified by CCA and PLS are influenced by characteristics of the analyzed sample and the included behavioural measurements when applied to a large pediatric dataset."

However, the statistical method is challenging and powerful mediation analyses regarding this issue are lacking.To study how the maltreatment in childhood alters long-lasting DNA methylation changes which further affect PTSD in adult, we here carried out a gene-based mediation analysis from a perspective of composite null hypothesis in the Grady Trauma Project (352 participants and 16,565 genes) with childhood maltreatment as exposure, multiple DNA methylation sites as mediators, and PTSD or its relevant scores as outcome. We effectively addressed the challenging issue of gene-based mediation analysis by taking its composite null hypothesis testing nature into consideration and fitting a weighted test statistic.We discovered that childhood maltreatment could substantially affected PTSD or PTSD-related scores, and that childhood maltreatment was associated with DNA methylation which further had significant roles in PTSD and these scores. Furthermore, using the proposed mediation method, we identified multiple genes within which DNA methylation sites exhibited mediating roles in the influence path from childhood maltreatment to PTSD-relevant scores in adult, with 13 for Beck Depression Inventory and 6 for modified PTSD Symptom Scale, respectively.Our results have the potential to confer meaningful insights into the biological mechanism for the impact of early adverse experience on adult diseases; and our proposed mediation methods can be applied to other similar analysis settings.Copyright © 2023 Xu, Shao, Zhang, Liu and Zeng."

PFAS may impact the developing epigenome, but current human evidence is limited to assessments of total DNA methylation. We assessed associations between first trimester PFAS exposures with newborn DNA methylation, including 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC). DNA methylation mediation of associations between PFAS and birth outcomes were explored in the Michigan Mother Infant Pairs cohort. Nine PFAS were measured in maternal first trimester blood. Seven were highly detected and included for analysis: PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, and MeFOSAA. Bisulfite-converted cord blood DNA (n = 141) and oxidative-bisulfite-converted cord blood (n = 70) were assayed on Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChips to measure total DNA methylation (5-mC + 5-hmC) and 5-mC/5-hmC. Correcting for multiple comparisons, beta regressions were used to assess associations between levels of PFAS and total methylation, 5-mC, or 5-hmC. Nonlinear mediation analyses were used to assess the epigenetic meditation effect between PFAS and birth outcomes.PFAS was significantly associated with total methylation (q < 0.05: PFHxS-12 sites; PFOS-19 sites; PFOA-2 sites; PFNA-3 sites; PFDA-4 sites). In 72 female infants and 69 male infants, there were sex-specific associations between five PFAS and DNA methylation. 5-mC and 5-hmC were each significantly associated with thousands of sites for PFHxS, PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnDA, and MeFOSAA (q < 0.05). Clusters of 5-mC and 5-hmC sites were significant mediators between PFNA and PFUnDA and decreased gestational age (q < 0.05).This study demonstrates the mediation role of specific types of DNA methylation on the relationship between PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. These results suggest that 5-mC and 5-hmC may be more sensitive to the developmental impacts of PFAS than total DNA methylation.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36964771","Diabetes and climate change: current evidence and implications for people with diabetes, clinicians and policy stakeholders.","Diabetologia","Climate change will be a major challenge for the world's health systems in the coming decades. Elevated temperatures and increasing frequencies of heat waves, wildfires, heavy precipitation and other weather extremes can affect health in many ways, especially if chronic diseases are already present. Impaired responses to heat stress, including compromised vasodilation and sweating, diabetes-related comorbidities, insulin resistance and chronic low-grade inflammation make people with diabetes particularly vulnerable to environmental risk factors, such as extreme weather events and air pollution. Additionally, multiple pathogens show an increased rate of transmission under conditions of climate change and people with diabetes have an altered immune system, which increases the risk for a worse course of infectious diseases. In this review, we summarise recent studies on the impact of climate-change-associated risk for people with diabetes and discuss which individuals may be specifically prone to these risk conditions due to their clinical features. Knowledge of such high-risk groups will help to develop and implement tailored prevention and management strategies to mitigate the detrimental effect of climate change on the health of people with diabetes.© 2023.

However, frequent reports of responders versus non-responders to probiotic treatment warrant a better understanding of key modifiers of host-microbe interactions. The influence of host diet on probiotic efficacy, in particular against metabolic diseases, remains elusive. We fed C57BL6/J mice a low fat reference diet or one of two energy-matched high fat and high sucrose diets for 12 weeks; a classical high fat diet (HFD) and a customized fast food-mimicking diet (FFMD). During the studies, mice fed either obesogenic diet were gavaged daily with one of two probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains previously classified asLactobaccillus, namelyLimosilactobacillus reuteri(L. reuteri)orLacticaseibacillus paracaseisubsp.paracasei(L. paracasei), or vehicle. The tested probiotics exhibited a reproducible efficacy but dichotomous response according to the obesogenic diets used. Indeed,L. paracaseiprevented weight gain, improved insulin sensitivity, and protected against NAFLD development in mice fed HFD, but not FFMD. Conversely,L. reuteriimproved glucoregulatory capacity, reduced NAFLD development, and increased distal gut bile acid levels associated with changes in predicted functions of the gut microbiota exclusively in the context of FFMD-feeding. We found that the probiotic efficacy of two LAB strains is highly dependent on experimental obesogenic diets. These findings highlight the need to carefully consider the confounding impact of diet in order to improve both the reproducibility of preclinical probiotic studies and their clinical research translatability."
"36950381","A unifying statistical framework to discover disease genes from GWASs.","Cell Genom","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) identify genomic loci associated with complex traits, but it remains a challenge to identify the genes affected by causal genetic variants in these loci. Attempts to solve this challenge are frustrated by a number of compounding problems. Here, we show how to combine solutions to these problems into a unified mathematical framework. From this synthesis, it becomes possible to compute the probability that each gene in the genome is affected by a causal variant, given a particular trait, without making assumptions about the relevant cell types or tissues. We validate each component of the framework individually and in combination. When applied to large GWASs of human disease, the resulting paradigm can rediscover the majority of well-known disease genes. Moreover, it establishes human genetics support for many genes previously implicated only by clinical or preclinical evidence, and it uncovers a plethora of novel disease genes with compelling biological rationale.© 2023 The Author(s)."

We performed single nucleus multiomics (snRNA-seq plus snATAC-seq) on 105,332 nuclei isolated from cortical tissues from 7 AD and 8 unaffected donors to identify candidatecis-regulatory elements (CREs) involved in AD-associated transcriptional changes. We detected 319,861 significant correlations, or links, between gene expression and cell type-specific transposase accessible regions enriched for active CREs. Among these, 40,831 were unique to AD tissues. Validation experiments confirmed the activity of many regions, including several candidate regulators ofAPPexpression. We identified ZEB1 and MAFB as candidate transcription factors playing important roles in AD-specific gene regulation in neurons and microglia, respectively.

Extensive analyses on seven public datasets, covering 19 polygenic traits in three plant and three livestock species, showed that SLEMM with SNP weighting had overall the best predictive ability among a variety of genomic prediction methods including GCTA's empirical BLUP, BayesR, KAML, and LDAK's BOLT and BayesR models. We also compared the methods using nine dairy traits of ∼300k genotyped cows. All had overall similar prediction accuracies, except that KAML failed to process the data. Additional simulation analyses on up to 3 million individuals and 1 million SNPs showed that SLEMM was advantageous over counterparts as for computational performance. Overall, SLEMM can do million-scale genomic predictions with an accuracy comparable to BayesR.The software is available at https://github.com/jiang18/slemm.© The Author(s) 2023.

While studies show that this latter effect is dependent on genetic vulnerability to depression, the effect of habitual tryptophan intake in the context of predisposing genetic factors has not been explored. Our aim was to investigate the effect of habitual tryptophan intake on mood symptoms and to determine the effect of risk variants on depression in those with high and low tryptophan intake in the whole genome and specifically in serotonin and kynurenine pathways. 63,277 individuals in the UK Biobank with data on depressive symptoms and tryptophan intake were included. We compared two subpopulations defined by their habitual diet of a low versus a high ratio of tryptophan to other large amino acids (TLR). A modest protective effect of high dietary TLR against depression was found. NPBWR1 among serotonin genes and POLI in kynurenine pathway genes were significantly associated with depression in the low but not in the high TLR group. Pathway-level analyses identified significant associations for both serotonin and kynurenine pathways only in the low TLR group. In addition, significant association was found in the low TLR group between depressive symptoms and biological process related to adult neurogenesis. Our findings demonstrate a markedly distinct genetic risk profile for depression in groups with low and high dietary TLR, with association with serotonin and kynurenine pathway variants only in case of habitual food intake leading to low TLR. Our results confirm the relevance of the serotonin hypothesis in understanding the neurobiological background of depression and highlight the importance of understanding its differential role in the context of environmental variables such as complexity of diet in influencing mental health, pointing towards emerging possibilities of personalised prevention and intervention in mood disorders in those who are genetically vulnerable.© 2023.

A secondary GWAS for meta-analysis was performed in a small Austrian cohort (N= 287). Results from the meta-analysis were investigated in relation with several clinical variables in BiDirect.Our discovery GWAS identified 12 genomic loci at the suggestive threshold ((p< 1 × 10-5). After meta-analysis, 7 loci were suggestive of an association with sNfL. Genotype-specific differences in sNfL were observed for the lead variants of meta-analysis loci (rs34523114, rs114956339, rs529938, rs73198093, rs34372929, rs10982883, and rs1842909) in BiDirect participants. We identified potential associations in meta-analysis loci with markers of inflammation and renal function. At least 6 protein-coding genes (ACTG2, TPRKB, DMXL1, COL23A1, NAT1, andRIMS2) were suggested as genetic factors contributing to baseline sNfL levels.Our findings suggest that polygenic regulation of neuronal processes, inflammation, metabolism and clearance modulate the variability of NfL in the circulation.

Using data from the UKBiobank, we show that corresponding symptoms endorsed through PHQ9 and CIDI-SF have low to moderate genetic correlations (rG=0.43-0.87), and this cannot be fully attributed to different severity thresholds or the use of a skip-structure in CIDI-SF. Through a combination of Mendelian Randomization (MR) and polygenic prediction analyses, we find that PHQ9 symptoms are more associated with traits which reflect general dysphoria, while the skip-structure in CIDI-SF allows for the identification of heterogeneity among likely MDD cases. This has important implications on factor analyses performed on their respective genetic covariance matrices for the purpose of identification of genetic factors behind MDD symptom dimensions and heterogeneity."

Here we reportTac1-expressing glutamatergic neurons in ventrolateral division of ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) drive intermale aggression. Aggression is increased due to increases ofUbe3agene dosage in the VMHvl neurons when modeling autism due to maternal 15q11-13 triplication. Targeted deletion of increasedUbe3acopies in VMHvl reverses the elevated aggression adult mice. VMHvl neurons form excitatory synapses onto hypothalamic arcuate nucleus AgRP/NPY neurons through a NRXN1-CBLN1-GluD1 transsynaptic complex and UBE3A impairs this synapse by decreasingCbln1gene expression. Exciting AgRP/NPY arcuate neurons leads to feedback inhibition of VMHvl neurons and inhibits aggression. Asymptomatic increases of UBE3A synergize with a heterozygous deficiency of presynapticNrxn1or postsynapticGrid1(both ASD genes) to increase aggression. Targeted deletions ofGrid1in arcuate AgRP neurons impairs the VMHvl to AgRP/NPY neuron excitatory synapses while increasing aggression. Chemogenetic/optogenetic activation of arcuate AgRP/NPY neurons inhibits VMHvl neurons and represses aggression. These data reveal that multiple autism genes converge to regulate the VMHvl-arcuate AgRP/NPY glutamatergic synapse. The hypothalamic circuitry implicated by these data suggest impaired excitation of AgRP/NPY feedback inhibitory neurons may explain the increased aggression behavior found in genetic forms of autism.A feedback circuit in the hypothalamus that inhibits aggression is impaired by converging autism genetic defects."

RBL and LCL chromatin interaction maps are compared to identify the spatial and temporal genome architectural changes during EBV B cell transformation. EBV induces global genome reorganization where contact domains frequently merge or subdivide during transformation. Repressed B compartments in RBLs frequently switch to active A compartments in LCLs. LCLs gain 40% new contact domain boundaries. Newly gained LCL boundaries have strong CTCF binding at their borders while in RBLs, the same sites have much less CTCF binding. Some LCL CTCF sites also have EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) leader protein EBNALP binding. LCLs have more local interactions than RBLs at LCL dependency factors and super-enhancer targets. RNA Pol II HiChIP and FISH of RBL and LCL further validate the Hi-C results. EBNA3A inactivation globally alters LCL genome interactions. EBNA3A inactivation reduces CTCF and RAD21 DNA binding. EBNA3C inactivation rewires the looping at the CDKN2A/B and AICDA loci. Disruption of a CTCF site at AICDA locus increases AICDA expression. These data suggest that EBV controls lymphocyte growth by globally reorganizing host genome architecture to facilitate the expression of key oncogenes.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Most importantly, PLS3 overexpression protects against spinal muscular atrophy. Despite its crucial role in F-actin dynamics in healthy cells and its involvement in many diseases, the mechanisms that regulate PLS3 expression are unknown. Interestingly, PLS3 is an X-linked gene and all asymptomatic SMN1-deleted individuals in SMA-discordant families who exhibit PLS3 upregulation are female, suggesting that PLS3 may escape X chromosome inactivation. To elucidate mechanisms contributing to PLS3 regulation, we performed a multi-omics analysis in two SMA-discordant families using lymphoblastoid cell lines and iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons originated from fibroblasts. We show that PLS3 tissue-specifically escapes X-inactivation. PLS3 is located ∼500 kb proximal to the DXZ4 macrosatellite, which is essential for X chromosome inactivation. By applying molecular combing in a total of 25 lymphoblastoid cell lines (asymptomatic individuals, individuals with SMA, control subjects) with variable PLS3 expression, we found a significant correlation between the copy number of DXZ4 monomers and PLS3 levels. Additionally, we identified chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 4 (CHD4) as an epigenetic transcriptional regulator of PLS3 and validated co-regulation of the two genes by siRNA-mediated knock-down and overexpression of CHD4. We show that CHD4 binds the PLS3 promoter by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation and that CHD4/NuRD activates the transcription of PLS3 by dual-luciferase promoter assays. Thus, we provide evidence for a multilevel epigenetic regulation of PLS3 that may help to understand the protective or disease-associated PLS3 dysregulation.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

Despite the identification of a large number of associated genes and genetic loci, the precise mechanisms by which these genes systematically influence the phenotypic heterogeneity of CVD are not well understood. In addition to DNA sequence, understanding the molecular mechanisms of CVD requires data from other omics levels, including the epigenome, the transcriptome, the proteome, as well as the metabolome. Recent advances in multiomics technologies have opened new precision medicine opportunities beyond genomics that can guide precise diagnosis and personalized treatment. At the same time, network medicine has emerged as an interdisciplinary field that integrates systems biology and network science to focus on the interactions among biological components in health and disease, providing an unbiased framework through which to integrate systematically these multiomics data. In this review, we briefly present such multiomics technologies, including bulk omics and single-cell omics technologies, and discuss how they can contribute to precision medicine.

"36949544","Evidence for the role of transcription factors in the co-transcriptional regulation of intron retention.","Genome Biol","Alternative splicing is a widespread regulatory phenomenon that enables a single gene to produce multiple transcripts. Among the different types of alternative splicing, intron retention is one of the least explored despite its high prevalence in both plants and animals. The recent discovery that the majority of splicing is co-transcriptional has led to the finding that chromatin state affects alternative splicing. Therefore, it is plausible that transcription factors can regulate splicing outcomes.We provide evidence for the hypothesis that transcription factors are involved in the regulation of intron retention by studying regions of open chromatin in retained and excised introns. Using deep learning models designed to distinguish between regions of open chromatin in retained introns and non-retained introns, we identified motifs enriched in IR events with significant hits to known human transcription factors. Our model predicts that the majority of transcription factors that affect intron retention come from the zinc finger family. We demonstrate the validity of these predictions using ChIP-seq data for multiple zinc finger transcription factors and find strong over-representation for their peaks in intron retention events.This work opens up opportunities for further studies that elucidate the mechanisms by which transcription factors affect intron retention and other forms of splicing.Source code available at https://github.com/fahadahaf/chromir.© 2023.

Using String and Cytoscape tools, we determined the hub genes of ccRCC, and then analyzed their relationship with ccRCC patient survival. Ultimately, we identified SERPINE1 as a prognostic factor in ccRCC. Meanwhile, we confirmed the role of SERPINE1 in 786-O cells by cell transfection and in vitro experiments.Our analysis yielded a total of 258 differentially expressed genes, comprising 105 down-regulated genes and 153 up-regulated genes. Survival analysis of SERPINE1 expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) confirmed its association with the increase of tumor grade, lymph node metastasis, and tumor stage, as well as with shorter survival. Furthermore, we found that SERPINE1 expression levels were associated with CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Cell experiments showed that knockdown SERPINE1 expression could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of ccRCC cells. Among the co-expressed genes with the highest correlation, ITGA5, SLC2A3, SLC2A14, SHC1, CEBPB, and ADA were overexpressed and associated with shorter overall survival (OS) in ccRCC.In this study, we identified hub genes that are strongly related to ccRCC, and highlights the potential utility of overexpressed SERPINE1 and its co-expressed genes could be used as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers in ccRCC.© 2023.

In this study, based on bioinformatics, we investigated the role of gene methylation in PAAD, evaluated relevant factors affecting patient prognosis, screened potential anti-cancer small molecule drugs, and constructed a prediction model to assess the prognosis of PAAD.Methods:Clinical and genomic data of PAAD were collected from the Tumor Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) database and gene expression profiles were obtained from the GTEX database. Analysis of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed on tumorous samples with KRAS wild-type and normal samples using the ""limma"" package and combined analysis. We selected factors significantly associated with survival from the significantly differentially methylated and expressed genes (DMEGs), and their fitting into a relatively streamlined prognostic model was validated separately from the internal training and test sets and the external ICGC database to show the robustness of the model.Results:In the TCGA database, 2,630 DMGs were identified, with the largest gap between DMGs in the gene body and TSS200 region. 318 DEGs were screened, and the enrichment analysis of DMGs and DEGs was taken to intersect DMEGs, showing that the DMEGs were mainly related to Olfactory transduction, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway, and Cytokine -cytokine receptor interaction. DMEGs were able to distinguish well between PAAD and paraneoplastic tissues. Through techniques such as drug database and molecular docking, we screened a total of 10 potential oncogenic small molecule compounds, among which felbamate was the most likely target drug for PAAD. We constructed a risk model through combining three DMEGs (S100P, LY6D, and WFDC13) with clinical factors significantly associated with prognosis, and confirmed the model robustness using external and internal validation.Conclusion:The classification model based on DMEGs was able to accurately separate normal samples from tumor samples and find potential anti-PAAD drugs by performing gene-drug interactions on DrugBank.Copyright © 2023 Cao, Wu and Ji."

These are collectively called the Mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery (MDEMs), or more broadly, Chromatinopathies. In five years, 741 clinic visits have been completed for 432 individual patients, with 153 having confirmed epigenetic diagnoses. Of these, 115 individuals have one of 26 MDEMs with every single one exhibiting global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability. This supports prior observations that intellectual disability is the most common phenotypic feature of MDEMs. Additional common phenotypes in our clinic include growth abnormalities and neurodevelopmental issues, particularly hypotonia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and anxiety, with seizures and autism being less common. Overall, our patient population is representative of the broader group of MDEMs and includes mostly autosomal dominant disorders impacting writers more so than erasers, readers, and remodelers of chromatin marks. There is an increased representation of dual function components with a reader and an enzymatic domain. As expected, diagnoses were made mostly by sequencing but were aided in some cases by DNA methylation profiling. Our clinic has helped to facilitate the discovery of two new disorders, and our providers are actively developing and implementing novel therapeutic strategies for MDEMs. These data and our high follow-up rate of over 60% suggest that we are achieving our mission to diagnose, learn from, and provide optimal care for our patients with disrupted epigenetics.© 2023.

"36968488","Human neural network activity reacts to gravity changes in vitro.","Front Neurosci","During spaceflight, humans experience a variety of physiological changes due to deviations from familiar earth conditions. Specifically, the lack of gravity is responsible for many effects observed in returning astronauts. These impairments can include structural as well as functional changes of the brain and a decline in cognitive performance. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms remain elusive. Alterations in neuronal activity play a central role in mental disorders and altered neuronal transmission may also lead to diminished human performance in space. Thus, understanding the influence of altered gravity at the cellular and network level is of high importance. Previous electrophysiological experiments using patch clamp techniques and calcium indicators have shown that neuronal activity is influenced by altered gravity. By using multi-electrode array (MEA) technology, we advanced the electrophysiological investigation covering single-cell to network level responses during exposure to decreased (micro-) or increased (hyper-) gravity conditions. We continuously recorded in real-time the spontaneous activity of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural networksin vitro. The MEA device was integrated into a custom-built environmental chamber to expose the system with neuronal cultures to up to 6 g of hypergravity on the Short-Arm Human Centrifuge at the DLR Cologne, Germany. The flexibility of the experimental hardware set-up facilitated additional MEA electrophysiology experiments under 4.7 s of high-quality microgravity (10-6to 10-5g) in the Bremen drop tower, Germany. Hypergravity led to significant changes in activity. During the microgravity phase, the mean action potential frequency across the neural networks was significantly enhanced, whereas different subgroups of neurons showed distinct behaviors, such as increased or decreased firing activity. Our data clearly demonstrate that gravity as an environmental stimulus triggers changes in neuronal activity. Neuronal networks especially reacted to acute changes in mechanical loading (hypergravity) or de-loading (microgravity). The current study clearly shows the gravity-dependent response of neuronal networks endorsing the importance of further investigations of neuronal activity and its adaptive responses to micro- and hypergravity. Our approach provided the basis for the identification of responsible mechanisms and the development of countermeasures with potential implications on manned space missions.Copyright © 2023 Striebel, Kalinski, Sturm, Drouvé, Peters, Lichterfeld, Habibey, Hauslage, El Sheikh, Busskamp and Liemersdorf."

However, current practices are limited by the availability of tissue samples for genomic profiling and the spatial and temporal molecular heterogeneity observed in many studies. Among rapidly advancing genomic sequencing technologies, non-invasive liquid biopsy has emerged as a promising diagnostic tool to reproduce tumour genomics, and has shown potential to be integrated in several aspects of clinical care. In urothelial carcinoma, liquid biopsies such as plasma circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) and urinary tumour DNA (utDNA) have been investigated as a surrogates for tumour biopsies and might bridge many shortfalls currently faced by clinicians. Both ctDNA and utDNA seem really promising in urothelial carcinoma diagnosis, staging and prognosis, response to therapy monitoring, detection of minimal residual disease and surveillance. The use of liquid biopsies in patients with urothelial carcinoma could further advance precision medicine in this population, facilitating personalized patient monitoring through non-invasive assays.© 2023.

"36968824","Application of artificial intelligence in diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer: A novel Prospect.","Front Med (Lausanne)","In the past few decades, according to the rapid development of information technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has also made significant progress in the medical field. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide, and its incidence and mortality rates are increasing yearly, especially in developing countries. This article reviews the latest progress in AI in diagnosing and treating CRC based on a systematic collection of previous literature. Most CRCs transform from polyp mutations. The computer-aided detection systems can significantly improve the polyp and adenoma detection rate by early colonoscopy screening, thereby lowering the possibility of mutating into CRC. Machine learning and bioinformatics analysis can help screen and identify more CRC biomarkers to provide the basis for non-invasive screening. The Convolutional neural networks can assist in reading histopathologic tissue images, reducing the experience difference among doctors. Various studies have shown that AI-based high-level auxiliary diagnostic systems can significantly improve the readability of medical images and help clinicians make more accurate diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Moreover, Robotic surgery systems such as da Vinci have been more and more commonly used to treat CRC patients, according to their precise operating performance. The application of AI in neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has further improved the treatment and efficacy evaluation of CRC. In addition, AI represented by deep learning in gene sequencing research offers a new treatment option. All of these things have seen that AI has a promising prospect in the era of precision medicine.Copyright © 2023 Yin, Yao, Zhang and Qi."
"36964195","Prediction model for drug response of acute myeloid leukemia patients.","NPJ Precis Oncol","Despite some encouraging successes, predicting the therapy response of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients remains highly challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Here we aim to develop and validate MDREAM, a robust ensemble-based prediction model for drug response in AML based on an integration of omics data, including mutations and gene expression, and large-scale drug testing. Briefly, MDREAM is first trained in the BeatAML cohort (n = 278), and then validated in the BeatAML (n = 183) and two external cohorts, including a Swedish AML cohort (n = 45) and a relapsed/refractory acute leukemia cohort (n = 12). The final prediction is based on 122 ensemble models, each corresponding to a drug. A confidence score metric is used to convey the uncertainty of predictions; among predictions with a confidence score >0.75, the validated proportion of good responders is 77%. The Spearman correlations between the predicted and the observed drug response are 0.68 (95% CI: [0.64, 0.68]) in the BeatAML validation set, -0.49 (95% CI: [-0.53, -0.44]) in the Swedish cohort and 0.59 (95% CI: [0.51, 0.67]) in the relapsed/refractory cohort.

However, high heterogeneity among the same cancer types and low transcriptomic variation in immune cell subsets present challenges for accurate, high-resolution confirmation of cells' identities. Here we present scATOMIC; a modular annotation tool for malignant and non-malignant cells. We trained scATOMIC on >300,000 cancer, immune, and stromal cells defining a pan-cancer reference across 19 common cancers and employ a hierarchical approach, outperforming current classification methods. We extensively confirm scATOMIC's accuracy on 225 tumour biopsies encompassing >350,000 cancer and a variety of TME cells. Lastly, we demonstrate scATOMIC's practical significance to accurately subset breast cancers into clinically relevant subtypes and predict tumours' primary origin across metastatic cancers.

Here we present RegTools ( www.regtools.org ), a computationally efficient, free, and open-source software package designed to integrate somatic variants from genomic data with splice junctions from bulk or single cell transcriptomic data to identify variants that may cause aberrant splicing. We apply RegTools to over 9000 tumor samples with both tumor DNA and RNA sequence data. RegTools discovers 235,778 events where a splice-associated variant significantly increases the splicing of a particular junction, across 158,200 unique variants and 131,212 unique junctions. To characterize these somatic variants and their associated splice isoforms, we annotate them with the Variant Effect Predictor, SpliceAI, and Genotype-Tissue Expression junction counts and compare our results to other tools that integrate genomic and transcriptomic data. While many events are corroborated by the aforementioned tools, the flexibility of RegTools also allows us to identify splice-associated variants in known cancer drivers, such as TP53, CDKN2A, and B2M, and other genes.© 2023.

Previous work suggested defective nuclear translocation of active caspase-3 in observed resistance to cell death. We have identified mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2; encoded by the geneMAPKAPK2) is required for caspase-3 nuclear translocation in the execution of apoptosis in endothelial cells. The objective was to determine MK2 expression in NSCLCs and the association between MK2 and clinical outcomes in patients with NSCLC. Clinical and MK2 mRNA data were extracted from two demographically distinct NSCLC clinical cohorts, North American (The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA) and East Asian (EA). Tumor responses following first round of chemotherapy were dichotomized as clinical response (complete response, partial response, and stable disease) or progression of disease. Multivariable survival analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier curves. NSCLC exhibited lower MK2 expression than SCLC cell lines. In patients, lower tumor MK2 transcript levels were observed in those presenting with late-stage NSCLC. Higher MK2 expression was associated with clinical response following initial chemotherapy and independently associated with improved 2-yr survival in two distinct cohorts, 0.52 (0.28-0.98) and 0.1 (0.01-0.81), TCGA and EA, respectively, even after adjusting for common oncogenic driver mutations. Survival benefit of higher MK2 expression was unique to lung adenocarcinoma when comparing across various cancers. This study implicates MK2 in apoptosis resistance in NSCLC and suggests prognostic value of MK2 transcript levels in patients with lung adenocarcinoma."
"36952446","Characterization of methylation profiles in spontaneous preterm birth placental villous tissue.","PLoS One","Preterm birth is a global public health crisis which results in significant neonatal and maternal mortality. Yet little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms of idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth, and we have few diagnostic markers for adequate assessment of placental development and function. Previous studies of placental pathology and our transcriptomics studies suggest a role for placental maturity in idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth. It is known that placental DNA methylation changes over gestation. We hypothesized that if placental hypermaturity is present in our samples, we would observe a unique idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth DNA methylation profile potentially driving the gene expression differences we previously identified in our placental samples. Our results indicate the idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth DNA methylation pattern mimics the term birth methylation pattern suggesting hypermaturity. Only seven significant differentially methylated regions fitting the idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth specific (relative to the controls) profile were identified, indicating unusually high similarity in DNA methylation between idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth and term birth samples. We identified an additional 1,718 significantly methylated regions in our gestational age matched controls where the idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth DNA methylation pattern mimics the term birth methylation pattern, again indicating a striking level of similarity between the idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth and term birth samples. Pathway analysis of these regions revealed differences in genes within the WNT and Cadherin signaling pathways, both of which are essential in placental development and maturation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth samples display a hypermature methylation signature than expected given their respective gestational age which likely impacts birth timing.Copyright: © 2023 Brockway et al.

However, the early detection of vascular damage in those patients is still difficult to ascertain. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recognized to play a critical role in initiation and pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction. Herein, we aimed to identify circulating miRNA biomarkers of vascular dysfunction as early predictors of CVDs. We have recruited 23 middle-aged Emiratis patients with the following criteria: A healthy control group with vitamin D ≥ 20ng, and BMI < 30 (C1 group = 11 individuals); A vitamin D deficiency (Vit D level ≤ 20 ng) and obese (BMI ≥ 30) group (A1 group = 9 patients); A vitamin D deficiency, obese, plus DM (A2 group = 3 patients). Arterial stiffness via pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured and the whole transcriptome analysis with qPCR validation for miRNA in plasma samples were tested. PWV relative to age was significantly higher in A1 group 19.4 ± 4.7 m/s and A2 group 18.3 ± 1.3 m/s compared to controls 14.7 ± 2.1 m/s (p < 0.05). Similar patterns were also observed in the Augmentation pressure (AP) and Alx%. Whole RNA-Sequencing revealed miR-182-5p; miR-199a-5p; miR-193a-5p; and miR-155-5p were differentially over-expressed (logFC > 1.5) in high-risk patients for CVDs vs healthy controls. Collectively, our result indicates that four specific circulating miRNA signature, may be utilized as non-invasive, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for early vascular damage in patients suffering from vitamin D deficiency, obesity and DM.Copyright: © 2023 Elmoselhi et al.

We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), RNA sequencing, and metabolic profiling on a population comprising wild tomatoes, landraces, and cultivars. A total of 8,375 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified, with methylation levels progressively decreasing from domestication to improvement. We found that over 20% of DMRs overlapped with selective sweeps. Moreover, more than 80% of DMRs in tomato were not significantly associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and DMRs had strong linkages with adjacent SNPs. We additionally profiled 339 metabolites from 364 diverse accessions and further performed a metabolic association study based on SNPs and DMRs. We detected 971 and 711 large-effect loci via SNP and DMR markers, respectively. Combined with multi-omics, we identified 13 candidate genes and updated the polyphenol biosynthetic pathway. Our results showed that DNA methylation variants could complement SNP profiling of metabolite diversity. Our study thus provides a DNA methylome map across diverse accessions and suggests that DNA methylation variation can be the genetic basis of metabolic diversity in plants.© 2023.

We have previously demonstrated mutagenic consequences of Long-Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE1s/L1) retrotransposition. However, the role of L1 in HCC, besides somatic mutagenesis, is not well understood.We analysed L1 expression in the TCGA-HCC RNAseq dataset (n = 372) and explored potential relationships between L1 expression and clinical features. The findings were confirmed by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of an independent human HCC cohort (n = 48) and functional mechanisms explored using in vitro and in vivo model systems.We observed positive associations between L1 and activated TGFβ-signalling, TP53 mutation, alpha-fetoprotein and tumour invasion. IHC confirmed a positive association between pSMAD3, a surrogate for TGFβ-signalling status, and L1 ORF1p (P < 0.0001, n = 32). Experimental modulation of L1 ORF1p levels revealed an influence of L1 ORF1p on key hepatocarcinogenesis-related pathways. Reduction in cell migration and invasive capacity was observed upon L1 ORF1 knockdown, both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, L1 ORF1p increased PIN1 cytoplasmic localisation. Blocking PIN1 activity abrogated L1 ORF1p-induced NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response genes while further activated TGFβ-signalling confirming differential alteration of PIN1 activity in cellular compartments by L1 ORF1p.Our data demonstrate a causal link between L1 ORF1p and key oncogenic pathways mediated by PIN1, presenting a novel therapeutic avenue.© 2023.

Additionally, CD127+CD94+ILC1s were preferentially enriched in inflamed ileum from patients with Crohn's disease.These analyses depicted a comprehensive characterization of ILC anatomical distribution and subset heterogeneity, and provided a base line for future temporal or spatial studies focused on tissue-specific ILC-mediated immunity.Copyright © 2023 Song, Cao, Mao, Ai, Sun, Hu, Liu, Wang, Lu, Guan and Shen."
"36865247","Differentially Expressed Heterogeneous Overdispersion Genes Testing for Count Data.","bioRxiv","The mRNA-seq data analysis is a powerful technology for inferring information from biological systems of interest. Specifically, the sequenced RNA fragments are aligned with genomic reference sequences, and we count the number of sequence fragments corresponding to each gene for each condition. A gene is identified as differentially expressed (DE) if the difference in its count numbers between conditions is statistically significant. Several statistical analysis methods have been developed to detect DE genes based on RNA-seq data. However, the existing methods could suffer decreasing power to identify DE genes arising from overdispersion and limited sample size. We propose a new differential expression analysis procedure: heterogeneous overdispersion genes testing (DEHOGT) based on heterogeneous overdispersion modeling and a post-hoc inference procedure. DEHOGT integrates sample information from all conditions and provides a more flexible and adaptive overdispersion modeling for the RNA-seq read count. DEHOGT adopts a gene-wise estimation scheme to enhance the detection power of differentially expressed genes. DEHOGT is tested on the synthetic RNA-seq read count data and outperforms two popular existing methods, DESeq and EdgeR, in detecting DE genes. We apply the proposed method to a test dataset using RNAseq data from microglial cells. DEHOGT tends to detect more differently expressed genes potentially related to microglial cells under different stress hormones treatments."

Cognitive performance was assessed using neuropsychological tests. Plasma levels of 92 neurology-related proteins were assessed using a proximity extension assay. An elastic net regression analysis was used to identify proteins more associated with cognitive performance. Additionally, the protein expression levels were compared between the two groups by means of a t-test with false discovery rate correction. Pearson correlations were used to assess associations between the protein levels and scores from the neurocognitive tests. Six proteins (alpha-2-MRAP, HAGH, Siglec-9, MDGA1, IL12, and EDA2R) were identified as potential contributors to cognitive performance, remaining significantly increased in l-GCF compared to h-GCF participants after correction for multiple testing. Negative correlations (r= -0.23 to -0.18, i.e., lower protein levels, higher cognitive function) were found between global cognitive function and Siglec-9, NMNAT1, HAGH, LXN, gal-8, alpha-2-MRAP, IL12, PDGF-R-alpha, NAAA, EDA2R, CLEC1B, and LAT.

Body Mass Index and Visceral Fat% exhibited comparable association with all the other anthropometric parameters (e.g. Whole body Subcutaneous fat%: male-Linear Regression Comparison: F = 11.68; P < 0.001; female-F = 6.11; P < 0.01). Therefore, VF% acts as a risk factor alongside BMI in instances where BMI fails alone. The presence of T2DM, hypertension, and hypothyroidism in the case groups confirmed their obesity-associated longitudinal pattern of inheritance. Unhealthy diet pattern indicates improper liver function, vitamin D deficiency, and increased erythrocytic inflammation. An overall sedentary lifestyle with parental history of obesity was found to be significant in the longitudinal transmission of the disease.© 2023. The Author(s)."

It is also one of the main causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which has a complex pathophysiological process. Timely prevention and treatment are of great significance for delaying DKD. This study aimed to use bioinformatics analysis to find key diagnostic markers that could be possible therapeutic targets for DKD.We downloaded DKD datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Overexpression enrichment analysis (ORA) was used to explore the underlying biological processes in DKD. Algorithms such as WGCNA, LASSO, RF, and SVM_RFE were used to screen DKD diagnostic markers. The reliability and practicability of the the diagnostic model were evaluated by the calibration curve, ROC curve, and DCA curve. GSEA analysis and correlation analysis were used to explore the biological processes and significance of candidate markers. Finally, we constructed a mouse model of DKD and diabetes mellitus (DM), and we further verified the reliability of the markers through experiments such as PCR, immunohistochemistry, renal pathological staining, and ELISA.Biological processes, such as immune activation, T-cell activation, and cell adhesion were found to be enriched in DKD. Based on differentially expressed oxidative stress and inflammatory response-related genes (DEOIGs), we divided DKD patients into C1 and C2 subtypes. Four potential diagnostic markers for DKD, including tenascin C, peroxidasin, tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases 1, and tropomyosin (TNC, PXDN, TIMP1, and TPM1, respectively) were identified using multiple bioinformatics analyses. Further enrichment analysis found that four diagnostic markers were closely related to various immune cells and played an important role in the immune microenvironment of DKD. In addition, the results of the mouse experiment were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis, further confirming the reliability of the four markers.In conclusion, we identified four reliable and potential diagnostic markers through a comprehensive and systematic bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation, which could serve as potential therapeutic targets for DKD.

How adult muscle stem cells contribute to this decrease in regenerative capacity is incompletely understood. We investigated mechanisms of age-related changes in myogenic progenitor cells using the tissue-specific microRNA 501.Young and old C57Bl/6 mice were used (3 months or 24 months of age, respectively) with or without global or tissue-specific genetic deletion of miR-501. Muscle regeneration was induced using intramuscular cardiotoxin injection or treadmill exercise and analysed using single cell and bulk RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. Muscle fiber damage was assessed with Evan`s blue dye (EBD). In vitro analysis was performed in primary muscle cells obtained from mice and humans.Single cell sequencing revealed myogenic progenitor cells in miR-501 knockout mice at day 6 after muscle injury that are characterized by high levels of myogenin and CD74. In control mice these cells were less in number and already downregulated after day 3 of muscle injury. Muscle from knockout mice had reduced myofiber size and reduced myofiber resilience to injury and exercise. miR-501 elicits this effect by regulating sarcomeric gene expression through its target gene estrogen-related receptor gamma (Esrrg). Importantly, in aged skeletal muscle where miR-501 was significantly downregulated and its target Esrrg significantly upregulated, the number of myog+/CD74+cells during regeneration was upregulated to similar levels as observed in 501 knockout mice. Moreover, myog+/CD74+-aged skeletal muscle exhibited a similar decrease in the size of newly formed myofibers and increased number of necrotic myofibers after injury as observed in mice lacking miR-501.miR-501 and Esrrg are regulated in muscle with decreased regenerative capacity and loss of miR-501 is permissive to the appearance of CD74+myogenic progenitors. Our data uncover a novel link between the metabolic transcription factor Esrrg and sarcomere formation and demonstrate that stem cell heterogeneity in skeletal muscle during aging is under miRNA control. Targeting Esrrg or myog+/CD74+progenitor cells might improve fiber size and myofiber resilience to exercise in aged skeletal muscle.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH..

The TME is a dynamic environment which is heavily influenced by alterations in cellular composition, cell-to-cell contact and cellular metabolic products as well as other chemical factors, such as pH and oxygen levels. Emerging evidence suggests that GBM cells appear to reprogram their the TME, and hijack microenvironmental elements to facilitate rapid proliferation, invasion, migration, and survival thus generating treatment resistance. GBM cells interact with their microenvironment directly through cell-to-cell by interaction mediated by cell-surface molecules, or indirectly through apocrine or paracrine signaling via cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular vehicles. The recent discovery of neuron-glioma interfaces and neurotransmitter-based interactions has uncovered novel mechanisms that favor tumor cell survival and growth.

"36949308","Early Life Stress, Neuroinflammation, and Psychiatric Illness of Adulthood.","Adv Exp Med Biol","Stress exposure during early stages of life elevates the risk of developing psychopathologies and psychiatric illness in later life. The brain and immune system are not completely developed by birth and therefore continue develop after birth; this post birth development is influenced by several psychosocial factors; hence, early life stress (ELS) exposure can alter brain structural development and function. A growing number of experimental animal and observational human studies have investigated the link between ELS exposure and increased risk of psychopathology through alternations in the immune system, by evaluating inflammation biomarkers. Recent studies, including brain imaging, have also shed light on the mechanisms by which both the innate and adaptive immune systems interact with neural circuits and neurotransmitters, which affect psychopathology. Herein, we discuss the link between the experience of stress in early life and lifelong alterations in the immune system, which subsequently lead to the development of various psychiatric illnesses.© 2023.

"36973386","Exploiting machine learning models to identify novel Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and potential targets.","Sci Rep","We still do not have an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) despite it being the most common cause of dementia and impaired cognitive function. Thus, research endeavors are directed toward identifying AD biomarkers and targets. In this regard, we designed a computational method that exploits multiple hub gene ranking methods and feature selection methods with machine learning and deep learning to identify biomarkers and targets. First, we used three AD gene expression datasets to identify 1/ hub genes based on six ranking algorithms (Degree, Maximum Neighborhood Component (MNC), Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC), Betweenness Centrality (BC), Closeness Centrality, and Stress Centrality), 2/ gene subsets based on two feature selection methods (LASSO and Ridge). Then, we developed machine learning and deep learning models to determine the gene subset that best distinguishes AD samples from the healthy controls. This work shows that feature selection methods achieve better prediction performances than the hub gene sets. Beyond this, the five genes identified by both feature selection methods (LASSO and Ridge algorithms) achieved an AUC = 0.979. We further show that 70% of the upregulated hub genes (among the 28 overlapping hub genes) are AD targets based on a literature review and six miRNA (hsa-mir-16-5p, hsa-mir-34a-5p, hsa-mir-1-3p, hsa-mir-26a-5p, hsa-mir-93-5p, hsa-mir-155-5p) and one transcription factor, JUN, are associated with the upregulated hub genes. Furthermore, since 2020, four of the six microRNA were also shown to be potential AD targets. To our knowledge, this is the first work showing that such a small number of genes can distinguish AD samples from healthy controls with high accuracy and that overlapping upregulated hub genes can narrow the search space for potential novel targets.© 2023.

"36959935","Application of third-generation sequencing to herbal genomics.","Front Plant Sci","There is a long history of traditional medicine use. However, little genetic information is available for the plants used in traditional medicine, which limits the exploitation of these natural resources. Third-generation sequencing (TGS) techniques have made it possible to gather invaluable genetic information and develop herbal genomics. In this review, we introduce two main TGS techniques, PacBio SMRT technology and Oxford Nanopore technology, and compare the two techniques against Illumina, the predominant next-generation sequencing technique. In addition, we summarize the nuclear and organelle genome assemblies of commonly used medicinal plants, choose several examples from genomics, transcriptomics, and molecular identification studies to dissect the specific processes and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of the two TGS techniques when applied to medicinal organisms. Finally, we describe how we expect that TGS techniques will be widely utilized to assemble telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genomes and in epigenomics research involving medicinal plants.Copyright © 2023 Gao, Xu, Xin and Song."

The specific mechanims that epigenetic factors rely on to mediate tumor aggressiveness remain unclear. We aimed to elucidate the roles of epigenetic protein PHF6 in breast tumorigenesis.Published datasets and tissue samples with PHF6 staining were used to investigate the clinical relevance of PHF6 in Bca. CCK-8, clony formation assays were used to assess cell growth capacity. Cell migration and invasion abilities were measured by Transwell assay. The gene mRNA and protein levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assays were used to investigate transcriptional relationships among genes. The Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was used to validate interactions between proteins. The CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology was used to construct double HIF knockout (HIF-DKO) cells. The subcutaneous xenograft model and orthotopic implantation tumor model were used to asess in vivo tumor growth.In this study, we utilized MTT assay to screen that PHF6 is required for Bca growth. PHF6 promotes Bca proliferation and migration. By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas breast cancer (TCGA-Bca) cohort, we found that PHF6 was significantly higher in tumor versus normal tissues. Mechanistically, PHF6 physically interacts with HIF-1α and HIF-2α to potentiate HIF-driven transcriptional events to initiate breast tumorigenesis. HIF-DKO abolished PHF6-mediated breast tumor growth, and PHF6 deficiency in turn impaired HIF transcriptional effects. Besides, hypoxia could also rely on YAP activation, but not HIF, to sustain PHF6 expressions in Bca cells. In addition, PHF6 recuits BPTF to mediate epigenetic remodeling to augment HIF transcriptional activity. Targeting PHF6 or BPTF inhibitor (AU1) is effective in mice models. Lastly, PHF6 correlated with HIF target gene expression in human breast tumors, which is an independent prognostic regulator.Collectively, this study identified PHF6 as a prognostic epigenetic regulator for Bca, functioning as a HIF coactivator. The fundamental mechanisms underlying YAP/PHF6/HIF axis in breast tumors endowed novel epigenegtic targets for Bca treatment.© 2023. The Author(s)."

However, biomarkers can be more objective and accurate for diagnosis and evaluating treatment efficacy. Thus, this review aimed to identify potential biomarkers for ADHD. Search terms ""ADHD,"" and ""biomarker"" combined with one of ""protein,"" ""blood/serum,"" ""gene,"" and ""neuro"" were used to identify human and animal studies in PubMed, Ovid Medline, and Web of Science. Only papers in English were included. Potential biomarkers were categorized into radiographic, molecular, physiologic, or histologic markers. The radiographic analysis can identify specific activity changes in several brain regions in individuals with ADHD. Several molecular biomarkers in peripheral blood cells and some physiologic biomarkers were found in a small number of participants. There were no published histologic biomarkers for ADHD. Overall, most associations between ADHD and potential biomarkers were properly controlled. In conclusion, a series of biomarkers in the literature are promising as objective parameters to more accurately diagnose ADHD, especially in those with comorbidities that prevent the use of DSM-5. However, more research is needed to confirm the reliability of the biomarkers in larger cohort studies.Copyright © 2023 Chen, Yang, Odisho, Wu, Yi and Oliver."
"36964522","Sex-biased molecular differences in lung adenocarcinoma are ethnic and smoking specific.","BMC Pulm Med","Sex-related differences in cancer epidemiology, tumor biology, immune system activity, and pharmacogenomics have been suggested to be important considerations for precision cancer control. Here we elucidated systematically sex biases in genetic variants, gene expression profiles, and immunological landscapes of lung adenocarcinoma patients (LUADs) with different ancestry and smoking status.Somatic mutation and mRNA expression data of Asian and Non-Asian LUADs were obtained from public databases. Sex-biased genetic mutations, gene expression, biological pathways, and immune infiltration were identified in the context of smoking status and race.Among nonsmokers, male-biased mutations were prevalent in Asian LUADs, while few sex-biased mutations were detected in Non-Asian LUADs. EGFR was the only mutation whose frequency was significantly higher in females than males in both Asian and Non-Asian nonsmokers. More genes exhibited sex-biased expression in Non-Asian LUADs compared to Asian LUADs. Moreover, genes distinctly expressed in females were mainly related to immune-related pathways, whereas those in males were more involved in activation of DNA repair, E2F_targets, and MYC_targets pathways. We also detected sex-specific immune infiltration in the context of genetic variation. In EGFR-mutant LUADs, males had a significantly increased infiltration of CD8 + T cells, whereas resting CD4 + memory T cells were more abundant in females. Additionally, in KRAS-mutant LUADs, CD8 + and CD4 + T cells were more abundant in females than males. In addition, we detected all female patients with high SCGB3A2 expression were exclusively sensitive to immunotherapy, while this phenomenon was not observed in male patients.Our findings provided evidence that sex-related molecular and cellular components are involved in shaping tumor distinct genetic and immune features, which might have important impact on personalized targeted and immune therapy.© 2023.

Complexes of one cell paired with one barcoded bead are stabilized by a chemical linker and dispersed in a hydrogel in the liquid state. Upon gelation on ice the complexes are immobilized and physically separated without requiring nanowells or droplets. Cell lysis is triggered by detergent diffusion, and RNA molecules are captured on the adjacent barcoded beads for further processing with reverse transcription and preparation for cDNA sequencing. As a proof of concept, analysis of PBMC using RevGel-seq achieves results similar to microfluidic-based technologies when using the same original sample and the same data analysis software. In addition, a clinically relevant application of RevGel-seq is presented for pancreatic islet cells. Furthermore, characterizations carried out on cardiomyocytes demonstrate that the hydrogel technology readily accommodates very large cells. Standard analyses are in the 10,000-input cell range with the current gelation device, in order to satisfy common requirements for single-cell research. A convenient stopping point after two hours has been established by freezing at the cell lysis step, with full preservation of gene expression profiles. Overall, our results show that RevGel-seq represents an accessible and efficient instrument-free alternative, enabling flexibility in terms of experimental design and timing of sample processing, while providing broad coverage of cell types.© 2023.

"36969624","The neighborhood context and all-cause mortality among older adults in Puerto Rico.","Front Public Health","Recent efforts have been made to collect data on neighborhood-level attributes and link them to longitudinal population-based surveys. These linked data have allowed researchers to assess the influence of neighborhood characteristics on the health of older adults in the US. However, these data exclude Puerto Rico. Because of significantly differing historical and political contexts, and widely ranging structural factors between the island and the mainland, it may not be appropriate to apply current knowledge on neighborhood health effects based on studies conducted in the US to Puerto Rico. Thus, we aim to (1) examine the types of neighborhood environments older Puerto Rican adults reside in and (2) explore the association between neighborhood environments and all-cause mortality.We linked data from the 2000 US Census to the longitudinal Puerto Rican Elderly Health Conditions Project (PREHCO) with mortality follow-up through 2021 to examine the effects of the baseline neighborhood environment on all-cause mortality among 3,469 participants. Latent profile analysis, a model-based clustering technique, classified Puerto Rican neighborhoods based on 19 census block group indicators related to the neighborhood constructs of socioeconomic status, household composition, minority status, and housing and transportation. The associations between the latent classes and all-cause mortality were assessed using multilevel mixed-effects parametric survival models with a Weibull distribution.A five-class model was fit on 2,477 census block groups in Puerto Rico with varying patterns of social (dis)advantage. Our results show that older adults residing in neighborhoods classified asUrban High DeprivationandUrban High-Moderate Deprivationin Puerto Rico were at higher risk of death over the 19-year study period relative to theUrban Low Deprivationcluster, controlling for individual-level covariates.Considering Puerto Rico's socio-structural reality, we recommend that policymakers, healthcare providers, and leaders across industries to (1) understand how individual health and mortality is embedded within larger social, cultural, structural, and historical contexts, and (2) make concerted efforts to reach out to residents living in disadvantaged community contexts to understand better what they need to successfully age in place in Puerto Rico.Copyright © 2023 García, Garcia, McEniry and Crowe."

Gene methylation in peripheral blood leukocytes was detected by a methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting method, and the Helicobacter pylori antibody presence was semi-quantified in serum by ELISA.Individuals with total methylation of CDKN2B/P15 had a 1.883-fold (95%CI: 1.166-3.040, P = 0.010) risk of gastric cancer compared with unmethylated individuals. Individuals with both CDKN2B/P15 and NEUROG1 methylation had a higher risk of gastric cancer (OR = 2.147, 95% CI: 1.137-4.073, P = 0.019). The interaction between CDKN2B/P15 and NEUROG1 total methylation on gastric cancer risk was affected by the pattern of adjustment. In addition, the joint effects between CDKN2B/P15 total methylation and environmental factors, such as freshwater fish intake (OR = 6.403, 95% CI = 2.970-13.802, P < 0.001), irregular diet (OR = 5.186, 95% CI = 2.559-10.510, P < 0.001), unsanitary water intake (OR = 2.238, 95% CI = 1.144-4.378, P = 0.019), smoking (OR = 2.421, 95% CI = 1.456-4.026, P = 0.001), alcohol consumption(OR = 2.163, 95% CI = 1.309-3.576, P = 0.003), and garlic intake(OR = 0.373, 95% CI = 0.196-0.709, P = 0.003) on GC risk were observed, respectively. However, CDKN2B/P15 and NEUROG1 total methylation were not associated with gastric cancer prognosis.CDKN2B/P15 methylation in peripheral blood may be a potential biomarker for evaluating susceptibility to gastric cancer.

"36968020","Strand asymmetries across genomic processes.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Across biological systems, a number of genomic processes, including transcription, replication, DNA repair, and transcription factor binding, display intrinsic directionalities. These directionalities are reflected in the asymmetric distribution of nucleotides, motifs, genes, transposon integration sites, and other functional elements across the two complementary strands. Strand asymmetries, including GC skews and mutational biases, have shaped the nucleotide composition of diverse organisms. The investigation of strand asymmetries often serves as a method to understand underlying biological mechanisms, including protein binding preferences, transcription factor interactions, retrotransposition, DNA damage and repair preferences, transcription-replication collisions, and mutagenesis mechanisms. Research into this subject also enables the identification of functional genomic sites, such as replication origins and transcription start sites. Improvements in our ability to detect and quantify DNA strand asymmetries will provide insights into diverse functionalities of the genome, the contribution of different mutational mechanisms in germline and somatic mutagenesis, and our knowledge of genome instability and evolution, which all have significant clinical implications in human disease, including cancer. In this review, we describe key developments that have been made across the field of genomic strand asymmetries, as well as the discovery of associated mechanisms.© 2023 The Authors."

The enormous differences in morphology, lifespan, physiology, and behavior between queens and workers are caused by a complicated set of factors. Epigenetic modifications are considered to play an important role in this process. In this study, we analyzed the differences in chromosome interactions and H3K27ac and H3K4me1 modifications between the queens and workers using high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) technologies. We found that the queens contain more chromosome interactions and more unique H3K27ac modifications than workers; in contrast, workers have more H3K4me1 modifications than queens. Moreover, we identifiedMap3k15as a potential caste gene in queen-worker differentiation. Our results suggest that chromosomal conformation and H3K27ac and H3K4me1 modifications are involved in regulating queen-worker differentiation, which reveals that the queen-worker phenotypic dimorphism is regulated by multiple epigenetic modifications.© 2023 The Author(s)."

Is this health advantage transferred from parents to children in the form of higher birth weight relative to children of natives?Western Europe and Australia.We use data from nine birth cohorts participating in the LifeCycle Project, including five studies with large samples of immigrants' children: Etude Longitudinale Française depuis l'Enfance-France (N=12 494), the Raine Study-Australia (N=2283), Born in Bradford-UK (N=4132), Amsterdam Born Children and their Development study-Netherlands (N=4030) and the Generation R study-Netherlands (N=4877). We include male and female babies born to immigrant and native parents.The primary outcome is birth weight measured in grams. Different specifications were tested: birth weight as a continuous variable including all births (DV1), the same variable but excluding babies born with over 4500 g (DV2), low birth weight as a 0-1 binary variable (1=birth weight below 2500 g) (DV3). Results using these three measures were similar, only results using DV1 are presented. Parental migration status is measured in four categories: both parents natives, both born abroad, only mother born abroad and only father born abroad.Two patterns in children's birth weight by parental migration status emerged: higher birth weight among children of immigrants in France (+12 g, p<0.10) and Australia (+40 g, p<0.10) and lower birth weight among children of immigrants in the UK (-82 g, p<0.05) and the Netherlands (-80 g and -73 g, p<0.001) compared with natives' children. Smoking during pregnancy emerged as a mechanism explaining some of the birth weight gaps between children of immigrants and natives.The immigrant health advantage is not universally transferred to children in the form of higher birth weight in all host countries. Further research should investigate whether this cross-national variation is due to differences in immigrant communities, social and healthcare contexts across host countries.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

"36897933","Nanopore Detection Using Supercharged Polypeptide Molecular Carriers.","J Am Chem Soc","The analysis at the single-molecule level of proteins and their interactions can provide critical information for understanding biological processes and diseases, particularly for proteins present in biological samples with low copy numbers. Nanopore sensing is an analytical technique that allows label-free detection of single proteins in solution and is ideally suited to applications, such as studying protein-protein interactions, biomarker screening, drug discovery, and even protein sequencing. However, given the current spatiotemporal limitations in protein nanopore sensing, challenges remain in controlling protein translocation through a nanopore and relating protein structures and functions with nanopore readouts. Here, we demonstrate that supercharged unstructured polypeptides (SUPs) can be genetically fused with proteins of interest and used as molecular carriers to facilitate nanopore detection of proteins. We show that cationic SUPs can substantially slow down the translocation of target proteins due to their electrostatic interactions with the nanopore surface. This approach enables the differentiation of individual proteins with different sizes and shapes via characteristic subpeaks in the nanopore current, thus facilitating a viable route to use polypeptide molecular carriers to control molecular transport and as a potential system to study protein-protein interactions at the single-molecule level."

Here we present single-cell aggregation of cell states (SEACells), an algorithm for identifying metacells that overcome the sparsity of single-cell data while retaining heterogeneity obscured by traditional cell clustering. SEACells outperforms existing algorithms in identifying comprehensive, compact and well-separated metacells in both RNA and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) modalities across datasets with discrete cell types and continuous trajectories. We demonstrate the use of SEACells to improve gene-peak associations, compute ATAC gene scores and infer the activities of critical regulators during differentiation. Metacell-level analysis scales to large datasets and is particularly well suited for patient cohorts, where per-patient aggregation provides more robust units for data integration.

AAV (adeno-associated virus)-based expression systems are powerful tools for in vivo gene delivery in glia-to-neuron reprogramming, however, recent studies show that AAV-based gene delivery of Neurod1 into the mouse brain can cause severe leaky expression into endogenous neurons leading to misinterpretation of glia-to-neuron conversion.AAV-based delivery systems were modified for improved in vivo delivery of Neurod1, Math5, Ascl1, and Neurog2 in the adult mouse retina and brain. To examine whether bona fide glia-to-neuron conversion occurs, stringent fate mapping experiments were performed to trace the lineage of glial cells.The neuronal leakage is prevalent after AAV-GFAP-mediated delivery of Neurod1, Math5, Ascl1, and Neurog2. The transgene-dependent leakage cannot be corrected after lowering the AAV doses, using alterative AAV serotypes or injection routes. Importantly, we report the development of two new AAV-based tools that can significantly reduce neuronal leakage. Using the new AAV-based tools, we provide evidence that Neurod1 gene transfer fails to convert lineage traced glial cells into neurons.Stringent fate mapping techniques independently of an AAV-based expression system are the golden standard for tracing the fate of glia cells during neuronal reprogramming.

"36978081","The CLDN5 gene at the blood-brain barrier in health and disease.","Fluids Barriers CNS","The CLDN5 gene encodes claudin-5 (CLDN-5) that is expressed in endothelial cells and forms tight junctions which limit the passive diffusions of ions and solutes. The blood-brain barrier (BBB), composed of brain microvascular endothelial cells and associated pericytes and end-feet of astrocytes, is a physical and biological barrier to maintain the brain microenvironment. The expression of CLDN-5 is tightly regulated in the BBB by other junctional proteins in endothelial cells and by supports from pericytes and astrocytes. The most recent literature clearly shows a compromised BBB with a decline in CLDN-5 expression increasing the risks of developing neuropsychiatric disorders, epilepsy, brain calcification and dementia. The purpose of this review is to summarize the known diseases associated with CLDN-5 expression and function. In the first part of this review, we highlight the recent understanding of how other junctional proteins as well as pericytes and astrocytes maintain CLDN-5 expression in brain endothelial cells. We detail some drugs that can enhance these supports and are being developed or currently in use to treat diseases associated with CLDN-5 decline. We then summarise mutagenesis-based studies which have facilitated a better understanding of the physiological role of the CLDN-5 protein at the BBB and have demonstrated the functional consequences of a recently identified pathogenic CLDN-5 missense mutation from patients with alternating hemiplegia of childhood. This mutation is the first gain-of-function mutation identified in the CLDN gene family with all others representing loss-of-function mutations resulting in mis-localization of CLDN protein and/or attenuated barrier function. Finally, we summarize recent reports about the dosage-dependent effect of CLDN-5 expression on the development of neurological diseases in mice and discuss what cellular supports for CLDN-5 regulation are compromised in the BBB in human diseases.© 2023.

We develop a method, EnsembleTR, to integrate genotypes from four separate methods resulting in high-quality genotypes at more than 1.7 million TR loci. Our catalog reveals novel sequence features influencing TR heterozygosity, identifies population-specific trinucleotide expansions, and finds hundreds of novel eQTL signals. Finally, we generate a phased haplotype panel which can be used to impute most TRs from nearby single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with high accuracy. Overall, the TR genotypes and reference haplotype panel generated here will serve as valuable resources for future genome-wide and population-wide studies of TRs and their role in human phenotypes."

"36959262","The DREAM complex functions as conserved master regulator of somatic DNA-repair capacities.","Nat Struct Mol Biol","The DNA-repair capacity in somatic cells is limited compared with that in germ cells. It has remained unknown whether not only lesion-type-specific, but overall repair capacities could be improved. Here we show that the DREAM repressor complex curbs the DNA-repair capacities in somatic tissues of Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutations in the DREAM complex induce germline-like expression patterns of multiple mechanisms of DNA repair in the soma. Consequently, DREAM mutants confer resistance to a wide range of DNA-damage types during development and aging. Similarly, inhibition of the DREAM complex in human cells boosts DNA-repair gene expression and resistance to distinct DNA-damage types. DREAM inhibition leads to decreased DNA damage and prevents photoreceptor loss in progeroid Ercc1-/-mice. We show that the DREAM complex transcriptionally represses essentially all DNA-repair systems and thus operates as a highly conserved master regulator of the somatic limitation of DNA-repair capacities.© 2023.

However, the mechanisms underlying the Leydig cell aging and the effects of obesity on Leydig cell aging remain unclear.Natural aging mice and diet-induced obese mice were used to assess the process of testicular Leydig cell senescence with age or obesity. Bioinformatic analysis of the young and aged human testes was used to explore key genes related Leydig cell aging. Leydig cell-specific p38 MAPK knockout (p38LCKO) mice were used to further analyze the roles of p38 MAPK in Leydig cell aging. The levels of testosterone and steroidogenic enzymes, activity of p38 MAPK, aging status of Leydig cells, and oxidative stress and inflammation of testes or Leydig cells were detected by ELISA, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining analysis, respectively.The serum testosterone level was significantly reduced in aged mice compared with young mice. In the testis of aged mice, the reduced mRNA and protein levels of LHCGR, SRB1, StAR, CYP11A1, and CYP17A1 and the elevated oxidative stress and inflammation were observed. KEGG analysis showed that MAPK pathway was changed in aged Leydig cells, and immunoblotting displayed that p38 MAPK was activated in aged Leydig cells. The intensity of SA-β-Gal staining on Leydig cells and the number of p21-postive Leydig cells in aged mice were more than those of young mice. Similar to aged mice, the testosterone-related indexes decreased, and the age-related indexes increased in the testicular Leydig cells of high fat diet (HFD) mice. Aged p38LCKO mice had higher levels of testosterone and steroidogenic enzymes than those of age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates, with reduced the intensity of SA-β-Gal staining and the expression of p21 protein.Our study suggested that obesity was an important risk factor for Leydig cell aging. p38 MAPK was involved in Leydig cell aging induced by age and obesity. The inhibition of p38 MAPK could delay Leydig cell aging and alleviate decline in testosterone.Copyright © 2023 Luo, Qi, Xu, Yang, Yu and Guan."
"36959810","The role of artificial intelligence based on PET/CT radiomics in NSCLC: Disease management, opportunities, and challenges.","Front Oncol","Lung cancer has been widely characterized through radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI). This review aims to summarize the published studies of AI based on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) radiomics in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).A comprehensive search of literature published between 2012 and 2022 was conducted on the PubMed database. There were no language or publication status restrictions on the search. About 127 articles in the search results were screened and gradually excluded according to the exclusion criteria. Finally, this review included 39 articles for analysis.Classification is conducted according to purposes and several studies were identified at each stage of disease:1) Cancer detection (n=8), 2) histology and stage of cancer (n=11), 3) metastases (n=6), 4) genotype (n=6), 5) treatment outcome and survival (n=8). There is a wide range of heterogeneity among studies due to differences in patient sources, evaluation criteria and workflow of radiomics. On the whole, most models show diagnostic performance comparable to or even better than experts, and the common problems are repeatability and clinical transformability.AI-based PET/CT Radiomics play potential roles in NSCLC clinical management. However, there is still a long way to go before being translated into clinical application. Large-scale, multi-center, prospective research is the direction of future efforts, while we need to face the risk of repeatability of radiomics features and the limitation of access to large databases.Copyright © 2023 Hu, Li, Yang, Wang, Huang, Gu, Xiao, Huang and Chen."

We evaluated temporal changes in plasma proteins following SARS-CoV-2 infection and identified pre-infection proteomic markers associated with future COVID-19.We leveraged data from the global Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV (REPRIEVE). Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated PWH with clinical, antibody-confirmed COVID-19 as of September 2021 were matched on geographic region, age, and sample timing to antibody negative controls. For cases and controls, pre COVID-19 pandemic specimens were obtained prior to January 2020 to assess change over time and relationship to COVID-19 severity, using false-discovery adjusted mixed effects modeling.We compared 257 unique plasma proteins in 94 COVID-19 antibody-confirmed clinical cases and 113 matched antibody-negative controls, excluding COVID-19 vaccinated participants (age 50 years, 73% male). 40% of cases were characterized as mild; 60% moderate to severe. Median time from COVID-19 infection to follow-up sampling was 4 months. Temporal patterns of protein changes differed based on COVID-19 disease severity. Among those experiencing moderate to severe disease vs. controls, NOS3 increased whereas ANG, CASP-8, CD5, GZMH, GZMB, ITGB2, and KLRD1 decreased. Higher pre-pandemic levels of granzymes A, B and H (GZMA, GZMB and GZMH) were associated with the future development of moderate-severe COVID-19 and were related to immune function.We identified temporal changes in proteins closely linked to inflammatory, immune, and fibrotic pathways which may relate to COVID-19-related morbidity among ART-treated PWH. Further we identified key granzyme proteins associated with future COVID-19 in PWH.This study is supported through NIH grants U01HL123336, U01HL123336-06 and 3U01HL12336-06S3, to the clinical coordinating center, and U01HL123339, to the data coordinating center as well as funding from Kowa Pharmaceuticals, Gilead Sciences, and a grant award through ViiV Healthcare.

"36940317","Integrated Physiology of the Exocrine and Endocrine Compartments in Pancreatic Diseases: Workshop Proceedings.","Diabetes","The Integrated Physiology of the Exocrine and Endocrine Compartments in Pancreatic Diseases workshop was a 1.5-day scientific conference at the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) that engaged clinical and basic science investigators interested in diseases of the pancreas. This report provides a summary of the proceedings from the workshop. The goals of the workshop were to forge connections and identify gaps in knowledge that could guide future research directions. Presentations were segregated into six major theme areas, including 1) pancreas anatomy and physiology, 2) diabetes in the setting of exocrine disease, 3) metabolic influences on the exocrine pancreas, 4) genetic drivers of pancreatic diseases, 5) tools for integrated pancreatic analysis, and 6) implications of exocrine-endocrine cross talk. For each theme, multiple presentations were followed by panel discussions on specific topics relevant to each area of research; these are summarized here. Significantly, the discussions resulted in the identification of research gaps and opportunities for the field to address. In general, it was concluded that as a pancreas research community, we must more thoughtfully integrate our current knowledge of normal physiology as well as the disease mechanisms that underlie endocrine and exocrine disorders so that there is a better understanding of the interplay between these compartments.© 2023 by the American Diabetes Association."

Recent studies have shown that the DNA methylation state can be used in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis prediction of diseases. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the DNA methylation state can affect the function of immune cells. However, whether DNA methylation-related genes can be used for prognosis and immune response prediction in OC remains unclear.In this study, DNA methylation-related genes in OC were identified by an integrated analysis of DNA methylation and transcriptome data. Prognostic values of the DNA methylation-related genes were investigated through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and Cox progression analyses. Immune characteristics were investigated by CIBERSORT, correlation analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).Twelve prognostic genes (CA2, CD3G, HABP2, KCTD14, PI3, SERPINB5, SLAMF7, SLC9A2, STC2, TBP, TREML2 and TRIM27) were identified and a risk score signature and a nomogram based on prognostic genes and clinicopathological features were constructed for the survival prediction of OC patients in the training and two validation cohorts. Subsequently, the differences in the immune landscape between the high- and low-risk score groups were systematically investigated.Taken together, our study explored a novel efficient risk score signature and a nomogram for the survival prediction of OC patients. In addition, the differences of the immune characteristics between the two risk groups were clarified preliminarily, which will guide the further exploration of synergistic targets to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in OC patients.© 2023.

Data from multidimensional omics analyses, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, T cell receptor-repertoire profiling, proteomics, metabolomics and/or microbiomics, provide unique opportunities to dissect the complex and dynamic multifactorial phenotypes, processes and responses of CAR T cells as well as to discover novel tumour targets and pathways of resistance. In this Review, we summarize the multidimensional cellular and molecular profiling technologies that have been used to advance our mechanistic understanding of CAR T cell therapies. In addition, we discuss current applications and potential strategies leveraging multi-omics data to identify optimal target antigens and other molecular features that could be exploited to enhance the antitumour activity and minimize the toxicity of CAR T cell therapy. Indeed, fully utilizing multi-omics data will provide new insights into the biology of CAR T cell therapy, further accelerate the development of products with improved efficacy and safety profiles, and enable clinicians to better predict and monitor patient responses.© 2023.

Interestingly, the trio exome sequencing analysis also detected eight apparent de novo mosaic variants with variant allele fraction (VAF) ranging between 11.5%-37%. Here, using whole genome sequencing and a 'home-brew' variant filtering pipeline and DeepMosaic module, we investigated the number and signature of de novo heterozygous and mosaic variants and the rare phenomenon of hypermutation. Eight-hundred-thirty apparentdnSNVsand 21de novoindels had VAFs below 37.41% and were considered postzygotic somatic mosaic variants. The VAFs showed a bimodal distribution, with one component with an average VAF of 25% (range: 18.7-37.41%) (n=446), representing potential postzygotic first mitotic events, and the other component with an average VAF of 12.5% (range: 9.55-18.69%) (n=384), describing potential second mitotic events. No increased rate of CNV formation was observed. The mutational pattern analysis for somatic single base substitution showed SBS40, SBS5, and SBS3 as the top recognized signatures. SBS3 is a known signature associated with homologous recombination-based DNA damage repair error. Our data demonstrate that biallelicRAD51Cvariants show evidence for defective genomic DNA damage repair and thereby result in a hypermutator phenotype with the accumulation of postzygoticde novomutations, at least in the prenatal period. This 'genome hypermutator phenomenon' might contribute to the observed hematological manifestations and the predisposition to tumors in patients with FA, and pregnancy loss in general. We propose that other FA groups should be investigated for genome-widede novovariants."

Biobanks with extensive genomic and environmental data offer opportunities to elucidate the complex gene-environment interactions underlying their aetiology. Genome-wide genotyping array remains an efficient approach for large-scale genomic data collection. However, most commercial arrays have reduced performance for biobanking in the Chinese population.Deep whole-genome sequencing data from 2 641 Chinese individuals were used as a reference to develop the CAS array, a custom-designed genotyping array for precision medicine. Evaluation of the array was performed by comparing data from 384 individuals assayed both by the array and whole-genome sequencing. Validation of its mitochondrial copy number estimating capacity was conducted by examining its association with established covariates among 10 162 Chinese elderly.The CAS Array adopts the proven Axiom technology and is restricted to 652 429 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Its call rate of 99.79% and concordance rate of 99.89% are both higher than for commercial arrays. Its imputation-based genome coverage reached 98.3% for common SNPs and 63.0% for low-frequency SNPs, both comparable to commercial arrays with larger SNP capacity. After validating its mitochondrial copy number estimates, we developed a publicly available software tool to facilitate the array utility.Based on recent advances in genomic science, we designed and implemented a high-throughput and low-cost genotyping array. It is more cost-effective than commercial arrays for large-scale Chinese biobanking.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36967753","Complex clinical manifestations and new insights in RNA sequencing of children with diabetes and WFS1 variants.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","WFS1-related disorders involve a wide range of clinical phenotypes, including diabetes mellitus and neurodegeneration. Inheritance patterns of pathogenic variants of this gene can be autosomal recessive or dominant, and differences in penetrance present challenges for accurate diagnosis and genetic counselling.Three probands and one elder brother from three families were systematically evaluated and the clinical data of other family members were collected from the medical history. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the probands, and RNA sequencing was performed on four patients, their parents withWFS1variants, and four gender- and age-matched children with type 1 diabetes mellitus.There were six patients with diabetes. Dilated cardiomyopathy, a rare manifestation ofWFS1-related disease, was identified in one patient, along with MRI findings of brain atrophy at age 7 years and 3 months, the earliest age of discovery we know of. Whole-exome sequencing revealed five pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in theWFS1gene, including c.1348dupC (p.His450Profs*93), c.1381A>C (p.Thr461pro), c.1329C>G (p.Ser443Arg), c.2081delA (p.Glu694Glyfs*16), c.1350-1356delinsGCA (p.His450Glnfs*26), of which 3 variants (c.1348dupC, c.2081delA, c.1350-1356delinsGCA) were novel that have not been previously reported. The differentially expressed genes were mainly associated with immune-related pathways according to the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the RNA sequencing data. The exon 1 region ofHLA-DRB1in two patients was not transcribed, while the transcription of the region in their parents was normal.This study emphasizes the clinical and genetic heterogeneity in patients, even in the same family withWFS1variants.

"36949158","A genome-wide association study identifies a possible role for cannabinoid signalling in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease.","Sci Rep","Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), also known as diabetic nephropathy, is the leading cause of renal impairment and end-stage renal disease. Patients with diabetes are at risk for DKD because of poor control of their blood glucose, as well as nonmodifiable risk factors including age, ethnicity, and genetics. This genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted for the first time in the Emirati population to investigate possible genetic factors associated with the development and progression of DKD. We included data on 7,921,925 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in 258 cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who developed DKD and 938 control subjects with T2DM who did not develop DKD. GWAS suggestive results (P < 1 × 10-5) were further replicated using summary statistics from three cohorts with T2DM-induced DKD (Bio Bank Japan data, UK Biobank, and FinnGen Project data) and T1DM-induced DKD (UK-ROI cohort data from Belfast, UK). When conducting a multiple linear regression model for gene-set analyses, the CNR2 gene demonstrated genome-wide significance at 1.46 × 10-6. SNPs in CNR2 gene, encodes cannabinoid receptor 2 or CB2, were replicated in Japanese samples with the leading SNP rs2501391 showing a Pcombined = 9.3 × 10-7, and odds ratio = 0.67 in association with DKD associated with T2DM, but not with T1DM, without any significant association with T2DM itself. The allele frequencies of our cohort and those of the replication cohorts were in most cases markedly different. In addition, we replicated the association between rs1564939 in the GLRA3 gene and DKD in T2DM (P = 0.016, odds ratio = 0.54 per allele C). Our findings suggest evidence that cannabinoid signalling may be involved in the development of DKD through CB2, which is expressed in different kidney regions and known to be involved in insulin resistance, inflammation, and the development of kidney fibrosis.© 2023.

We have identified 16 patients from 10 families spanning three continents with a profound phenotype of early-life onset allergic immune dysregulation, widespread treatment-resistant atopic dermatitis, hypereosinophilia with esosinophilic gastrointestinal disease, asthma, elevated serum IgE, IgE-mediated food allergies, and anaphylaxis. The cases were either sporadic (seven kindreds) or followed an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (three kindreds). All patients carried monoallelic rare variants in STAT6 and functional studies established their gain-of-function (GOF) phenotype with sustained STAT6 phosphorylation, increased STAT6 target gene expression, and TH2 skewing. Precision treatment with the anti-IL-4Rα antibody, dupilumab, was highly effective improving both clinical manifestations and immunological biomarkers. This study identifies heterozygous GOF variants in STAT6 as a novel autosomal dominant allergic disorder. We anticipate that our discovery of multiple kindreds with germline STAT6 GOF variants will facilitate the recognition of more affected individuals and the full definition of this new primary atopic disorder.© 2023 Sharma et al."
"36959794","The innovative model based on artificial intelligence algorithms to predict recurrence risk of patients with postoperative breast cancer.","Front Oncol","This study aimed to develop a machine learning model to retrospectively study and predict the recurrence risk of breast cancer patients after surgery by extracting the clinicopathological features of tumors from unstructured clinical electronic health record (EHR) data.This retrospective cohort included 1,841 breast cancer patients who underwent surgical treatment. To extract the principal features associated with recurrence risk, the clinical notes and histopathology reports of patients were collected and feature engineering was used. Predictive models were next conducted based on this important information. All algorithms were implemented using Python software. The accuracy of prediction models was further verified in the test cohort. The area under the curve (AUC), precision, recall, and F1 score were adopted to evaluate the performance of each model.A training cohort with 1,289 patients and a test cohort with 552 patients were recruited. From 2011 to 2019, a total of 1,841 textual reports were included. For the prediction of recurrence risk, both LSTM, XGBoost, and SVM had favorable accuracies of 0.89, 0.86, and 0.78. The AUC values of the micro-average ROC curve corresponding to LSTM, XGBoost, and SVM were 0.98 ± 0.01, 0.97 ± 0.03, and 0.92 ± 0.06. Especially the LSTM model achieved superior execution than other models. The accuracy, F1 score, macro-avg F1 score (0.87), and weighted-avg F1 score (0.89) of the LSTM model produced higher values. AllPvalues were statistically significant. Patients in the high-risk group predicted by our model performed more resistant to DNA damage and microtubule targeting drugs than those in the intermediate-risk group. The predicted low-risk patients were not statistically significant compared with intermediate- or high-risk patients due to the small sample size (188 low-risk patients were predictedviaour model, and only two of them were administered chemotherapy alone after surgery). The prognosis of patients predicted by our model was consistent with the actual follow-up records.The constructed model accurately predicted the recurrence risk of breast cancer patients from EHR data and certainly evaluated the chemoresistance and prognosis of patients. Therefore, our model can help clinicians to formulate the individualized management of breast cancer patients.Copyright © 2023 Zeng, Liu, Chen, Lu, Xue, Bi and Yang."

Therefore, there should be a correlation between depth features extracted from pathology-based full-scan images using deep learning and disease-associated gene expression. This study tried to provides preliminary evidence that long-term differentially expressed (disease-associated) genes lead to subtle changes in disease pathology by exploring their correlation, and offer a new ideas for precise analysis of pathomics and combined analysis of pathomics and genomics.Full pathological scans, gene sequencing data, and clinical data of patients with mucinous gastric carcinoma were downloaded from TCGA data. The VGG-16 network architecture was used to construct a binary classification model to explore the potential of VGG-16 applications and extract the deep features of the pathology-based full-scan map. Differential gene expression analysis was performed and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed to screen disease-related core genes. Differential, Lasso regression, and extensive correlation analyses were used to screen for valuable deep features. Finally, a correlation analysis was used to determine whether there was a correlation between valuable deep features and disease-related core genes.The accuracy of the binary classification model was 0.775 ± 0.129. A total of 24 disease-related core genes were screened, includingASPM, AURKA, AURKB, BUB1, BUB1B, CCNA2, CCNB1, CCNB2, CDCA8, CDK1, CENPF, DLGAP5, KIF11, KIF20A, KIF2C, KIF4A, MELK, PBK, RRM2, TOP2A, TPX2, TTK, UBE2C, andZWINT.In addition, differential, Lasso regression, and extensive correlation analyses were used to screen eight valuable deep features, including features 51, 106, 109, 118, 257, 282, 326, and 487. Finally, the results of the correlation analysis suggested that valuable deep features were either positively or negatively correlated with core gene expression.The preliminary results of this study support our hypotheses. Deep learning may be an important bridge for the joint analysis of pathomics and genomics and provides preliminary evidence for long-term abnormal expression of genes leading to subtle changes in pathology.© 2023 The Authors.

Since the relationship between structure and function is an almost universal rule not only in biology, appropriate methods are required to parameterize the relationship between the structure and function of biomolecules and their networks, the mechanisms of the processes in which they are involved, and the mechanisms of regulation of these processes. Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), which we focus on here, offers a significant advantage for the quantitative parametrization of molecular organization: it provides matrices of coordinates of fluorescently labeled biomolecules that can be directly subjected to advanced mathematical analytical procedures without the need for laborious and sometimes misleading image processing. Here, we propose mathematical tools for comprehensive quantitative computer data analysis of SMLM point patterns that include Ripley distance frequency analysis, persistent homology analysis, persistent 'imaging', principal component analysis and co-localization analysis. The application of these methods is explained using artificial datasets simulating different, potentially possible and interpretatively important situations. Illustrative analyses of real complex biological SMLM data are presented to emphasize the applicability of the proposed algorithms. This manuscript demonstrated the extraction of features and parameters quantifying the influence of chromatin (re)organization on genome function, offering a novel approach to study chromatin architecture at the nanoscale. However, the ability to adapt the proposed algorithms to analyze essentially any molecular organizations, e.g., membrane receptors or protein trafficking in the cytosol, offers broad flexibility of use.© 2023 The Authors."
"36978128","X chromosome dosage and the genetic impact across human tissues.","Genome Med","Sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs) give rise to a broad range of phenotypic traits and diseases. Previous studies based on peripheral blood samples have suggested the presence of ripple effects, caused by altered X chromosome number, affecting the methylome and transcriptome. Whether these alterations can be connected to disease-specific tissues, and thereby having clinical implication for the phenotype, remains to be elucidated.We performed a comprehensive analysis of X chromosome number on the transcriptome and methylome in blood, fat, and muscle tissue from individuals with 45,X, 46,XX, 46,XY, and 47,XXY.X chromosome number affected the transcriptome and methylome globally across all chromosomes in a tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, 45,X and 47,XXY demonstrated a divergent pattern of gene expression and methylation, with overall gene downregulation and hypomethylation in 45,X and gene upregulation and hypermethylation in 47,XXY. In fat and muscle, a pronounced effect of sex was observed. We identified X chromosomal genes with an expression pattern different from what would be expected based on the number of X and Y chromosomes. Our data also indicate a regulatory function of Y chromosomal genes on X chromosomal genes. Fourteen X chromosomal genes were downregulated in 45,X and upregulated in 47,XXY, respectively, in all three tissues (AKAP17A, CD99, DHRSX, EIF2S3, GTPBP6, JPX, KDM6A, PP2R3B, PUDP, SLC25A6, TSIX, XIST, ZBED1, ZFX). These genes may be central in the epigenetic and genomic regulation of sex chromosome aneuploidies.We highlight a tissue-specific and complex effect of X chromosome number on the transcriptome and methylome, elucidating both shared and non-shared gene-regulatory mechanism between SCAs.© 2023.

DNA methylation is a well-known epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression, and our previous study demonstrated that S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a methylome modulator, was a neuroprotectant against perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND). However, the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we integrated an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin by sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify the key genes and pathways involved in the neuroprotection of SAM against PND. Our RNA-seq data demonstrated that genes involved in biological processes such as Wnt signaling, inflammatory response, transcription and long-term potentiation likely mediate the neuroprotection of SAM. Our ATAC-seq data provided comprehensive maps of chromatin accessibility changes induced by laparotomy and laparotomy + SAM treatment, and functional annotation of the regions with high variations in chromatin accessibility highlighted the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in PND pathogenesis and SAM treatment. Further motif analysis identified key transcription factors (e.g., CTCF, TFDP1, TCFL5, KLF15, ZBTB14, TFAP2E) that may participate in the neuroprotection of SAM. In conclusion, the current study provides an epigenomic perspective to understand the pathogenesis of PND and its treatment by SAM.© 2023 The Author(s)."

The scale and complexity of epigenetic data pose significant challenges for biologists to identify the regulatory events controlling cell differentiation.To reduce the complexity, we developed a package, called Snapshot, for clustering and visualizing candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) based on their epigenetic signals during cell differentiation. This package first introduces a binarized indexing strategy for clustering the cCREs. It then provides a series of easily interpretable figures for visualizing the signal and epigenetic state patterns of the cCREs clusters during the cell differentiation. It can also use different hierarchies of cell types to highlight the epigenetic history specific to any particular cell lineage. We demonstrate the utility of Snapshot using data from a consortium project for ValIdated Systematic IntegratiON (VISION) of epigenomic data in hematopoiesis.The package Snapshot can identify all distinct clusters of genomic locations with unique epigenetic signal patterns during cell differentiation.

"36952129","Restriction of access to the central cavity is a major contributor to substrate selectivity in plant ABCG transporters.","Cell Mol Life Sci","ABCG46 of the legume Medicago truncatula is an ABC-type transporter responsible for highly selective translocation of the phenylpropanoids, 4-coumarate, and liquiritigenin, over the plasma membrane. To investigate molecular determinants of the observed substrate selectivity, we applied a combination of phylogenetic and biochemical analyses, AlphaFold2 structure prediction, molecular dynamics simulations, and mutagenesis. We discovered an unusually narrow transient access path to the central cavity of MtABCG46 that constitutes an initial filter responsible for the selective translocation of phenylpropanoids through a lipid bilayer. Furthermore, we identified remote residue F562 as pivotal for maintaining the stability of this filter. The determination of individual amino acids that impact the selective transport of specialized metabolites may provide new opportunities associated with ABCGs being of interest, in many biological scenarios.© 2023.

"36968610","Leveraging transcriptomics for precision diagnosis: Lessons learned from cancer and sepsis.","Front Genet","Diagnostics require precision and predictive ability to be clinically useful. Integration of multi-omic with clinical data is crucial to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and diagnosis. However, interpretation of overwhelming amounts of information at the individual level requires sophisticated computational tools for extraction of clinically meaningful outputs. Moreover, evolution of technical and analytical methods often outpaces standardisation strategies. RNA is the most dynamic component of all -omics technologies carrying an abundance of regulatory information that is least harnessed for use in clinical diagnostics. Gene expression-based tests capture genetic and non-genetic heterogeneity and have been implemented in certain diseases. For example patients with early breast cancer are spared toxic unnecessary treatments with scores based on the expression of a set of genes (e.g., Oncotype DX). The ability of transcriptomics to portray the transcriptional status at a moment in time has also been used in diagnosis of dynamic diseases such as sepsis. Gene expression profiles identify endotypes in sepsis patients with prognostic value and a potential to discriminate between viral and bacterial infection. The application of transcriptomics for patient stratification in clinical environments and clinical trials thus holds promise. In this review, we discuss the current clinical application in the fields of cancer and infection. We use these paradigms to highlight the impediments in identifying useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and propose approaches to overcome them and aid efforts towards clinical implementation.Copyright © 2023 Tsakiroglou, Evans and Pirmohamed."
"36950678","Multigenerational mistimed feeding drives circadian reprogramming with an impaired unfolded protein response.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Mistimed food intake in relation to the day/night cycle disrupts the synchrony of circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues and increases the risk of metabolic diseases. However, the health effects over generations have seldom been explored. Here, we established a 10-generation mouse model that was continuously fed with daytime-restricted feeding (DRF). We performed RNA-seq analysis of mouse liver samples obtained every 4 h over a 24 h period from F2, F5 and F10 generations exposed to DRF. Multigenerational DRF programs the diurnal rhythmic transcriptome through a gain or loss of diurnal rhythmicity over generations. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the differential rhythmic transcriptome revealed that adaptation to persistent DRF is accompanied by impaired endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Consistently, a substantially higher level of folding-deficient proinsulin was observed in F10 liver tissues than in F2 and F5 liver tissues following tail vein injection. Subsequently, tunicamycin induced more hepatocyte death in F10 samples than in F2 and F5 samples. These data demonstrate that mistimed food intake could produce cumulative effects over generations on ER stress sensitivity in mice.Copyright © 2023 Huang, Zhang, Zhang, Gu, Yu, Sun, Liu, Wang and Xu."
"36964157","Pathogenesis of allergic diseases and implications for therapeutic interventions.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis (AR), allergic asthma (AAS), atopic dermatitis (AD), food allergy (FA), and eczema are systemic diseases caused by an impaired immune system. Accompanied by high recurrence rates, the steadily rising incidence rates of these diseases are attracting increasing attention. The pathogenesis of allergic diseases is complex and involves many factors, including maternal-fetal environment, living environment, genetics, epigenetics, and the body's immune status. The pathogenesis of allergic diseases exhibits a marked heterogeneity, with phenotype and endotype defining visible features and associated molecular mechanisms, respectively. With the rapid development of immunology, molecular biology, and biotechnology, many new biological drugs have been designed for the treatment of allergic diseases, including anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE), anti-interleukin (IL)-5, and anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)/IL-4, to control symptoms. For doctors and scientists, it is becoming more and more important to understand the influencing factors, pathogenesis, and treatment progress of allergic diseases. This review aimed to assess the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and therapeutic interventions of allergic diseases, including AR, AAS, AD, and FA. We hope to help doctors and scientists understand allergic diseases systematically.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36947184","A review of cardiovascular effects and underlying mechanisms of legacy and emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).","Arch Toxicol","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) poses the leading threats to human health and life, and their occurrence and severity are associated with exposure to environmental pollutants. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of widely used industrial chemicals, are characterized by persistence, long-distance migration, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. Some PFAS, particularly perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), have been banned, leaving only legacy exposure to the environment and human body, while a number of novel PFAS alternatives have emerged and raised concerns, such as polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic and carboxylic acid (PFESA and PFECA) and sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate (OBS). Overall, this review systematically elucidated the adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects of legacy and emerging PFAS, emphasized the dose/concentration-dependent, time-dependent, carbon chain length-dependent, sex-specific, and coexposure effects, and discussed the underlying mechanisms and possible prevention and treatment. Extensive epidemiological and laboratory evidence suggests that accumulated serum levels of legacy PFAS possibly contribute to an increased risk of CVD and its subclinical course, such as cardiac toxicity, vascular disorder, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The underlying biological mechanisms may include oxidative stress, signaling pathway disturbance, lipid metabolism disturbance, and so on. Various emerging alternatives to PFAS also play increasingly prominent toxic roles in CV outcomes that are milder, similar to, or more severe than legacy PFAS. Future research is recommended to conduct more in-depth CV toxicity assessments of legacy and emerging PFAS and explore more effective surveillance, prevention, and treatment strategies, accordingly.© 2023.

"36913406","First passage time analysis of spatial mutation patterns reveals sub-clonal evolutionary dynamics in colorectal cancer.","PLoS Comput Biol","The signature of early cancer dynamics on the spatial arrangement of tumour cells is poorly understood, and yet could encode information about how sub-clones grew within the expanding tumour. Novel methods of quantifying spatial tumour data at the cellular scale are required to link evolutionary dynamics to the resulting spatial architecture of the tumour. Here, we propose a framework using first passage times of random walks to quantify the complex spatial patterns of tumour cell population mixing. First, using a simple model of cell mixing we demonstrate how first passage time statistics can distinguish between different pattern structures. We then apply our method to simulated patterns of mutated and non-mutated tumour cell population mixing, generated using an agent-based model of expanding tumours, to explore how first passage times reflect mutant cell replicative advantage, time of emergence and strength of cell pushing. Finally, we explore applications to experimentally measured human colorectal cancer, and estimate parameters of early sub-clonal dynamics using our spatial computational model. We infer a wide range of sub-clonal dynamics, with mutant cell division rates varying between 1 and 4 times the rate of non-mutated cells across our sample set. Some mutated sub-clones emerged after as few as 100 non-mutant cell divisions, and others only after 50,000 divisions. The majority were consistent with boundary driven growth or short-range cell pushing. By analysing multiple sub-sampled regions in a small number of samples, we explore how the distribution of inferred dynamics could inform about the initial mutational event. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of first passage time analysis as a new methodology in spatial analysis of solid tumour tissue, and suggest that patterns of sub-clonal mixing can provide insights into early cancer dynamics.Copyright: © 2023 Haughey et al.

"36942106","Integration of transcriptomics data into agent-based models of solid tumor metastasis.","Comput Struct Biotechnol J","Recent progress in our understanding of cancer mostly relies on the systematic profiling of patient samples with high-throughput techniques like transcriptomics. With this approach, one can find gene signatures and networks underlying cancer aggressiveness and therapy resistance. However, omics data alone cannot generate insights into the spatiotemporal aspects of tumor progression. Here, multi-level computational modeling is a promising approach that would benefit from protocols to integrate the data generated by the high-throughput profiling of patient samples. We present a computational workflow to integrate transcriptomics data from tumor patients into hybrid, multi-scale cancer models. In the method, we conduct transcriptomics analysis to select key differentially regulated pathways in therapy responders and non-responders and link them to agent-based model parameters. We then determine global and local sensitivity through systematic model simulations that assess the relevance of parameter variations in triggering therapy resistance. We illustrate the methodology with ade novogenerated agent-based model accounting for the interplay between tumor and immune cells in a melanoma micrometastasis. The application of the workflow identifies three distinct scenarios of therapy resistance.© 2023 The Authors."
"36945836","Homocysteine exchange across skeletal muscle in patients with chronic kidney disease.","Physiol Rep","Sites and mechanisms regulating the supply of homocysteine (Hcy) to the circulation are unexplored in humans. We studied the exchange of Hcy across the forearm in CKD patients (n = 17, eGFR 20 ± 2 ml/min), in hemodialysis (HD)-treated patients (n = 14) and controls (n = 9). Arterial Hcy was ~ 2.5 folds increased in CKD and HD patients (p < 0.05-0.03 vs. controls). Both in controls and in patients Hcy levels in the deep forearm vein were consistently greater (+~7%, p < 0.05-0.01) than the corresponding arterial levels, indicating the occurrence of Hcy release from muscle. The release of Hcy from the forearm was similar among groups. In all groups arterial Hcy varied with its release from muscle (p < 0.03-0.02), suggesting that muscle plays an important role on plasma Hcy levels. Forearm Hcy release was inversely related to folate plasma level in all study groups but neither to vitamin B12 and IL-6 levels nor to muscle protein net balance. These data indicate that the release of Hcy from peripheral tissue metabolism plays a major role in influencing its Hcy plasma levels in humans and patients with CKD, and that folate is a major determinant of Hcy release.© 2023 The Authors.

"36976498","DNA 6mA demethylase ALKBH1 regulates DDX18 expression to promote proliferation of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.","Cell Oncol (Dordr)","Human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide. Currently, surgical resection plus a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the standard treatment for HNSCC, and the 5-year survival rate of patients with HNSCC remains very low because of the higher incidence of metastasis with consequent recurrence. Here, we aimed to investigate the potential role of DNA N6-methyladenine (6mA) demethylase ALKBH1 in tumor cell proliferation in HNSCC.The expression of ALKBH1 in 10 pairs of HNSCC/normal tissues and 3 HNSCC cell lines were measured by qRT‒PCR and western blotting. Colony formation, flow cytometry, patient-derived HNSCC organoid assays were used to assess the role of ALKBH1 in HNSCC cell proliferation in cell lines and human HNSCC patients. MeDIP-seq, RNA sequencing, Dot blotting and western blotting were used to evaluate the regulatory effect of ALKBH1 on the expression of DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX18. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to assess the putative effect of DNA 6mA levels on DDX18 transcription.ALKBH1 was highly expressed in HNSCC cells and patient tissues. Functional experiments revealed that ALKBH1 knockdown in SCC9, SCC25, and CAL27 cells inhibited their proliferation in vitro. Using patient-derived HNSCC organoid assay, we found that knockdown of ALKBH1 inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of HNSCC patients-derived organoids. Moreover, we found that ALKBH1 can enhance DDX18 expression by erasing DNA 6mA level and regulating its promoter activity. ALKBH1 deficiency blocked tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting DDX18 expression. Exogenous overexpression of DDX18 rescued the cell proliferation arrest caused by ALKBH1 knockdown.Our data reveal the important role of ALKBH1 in regulating proliferation of HNSCC.© 2023.

"36950380","Systematic assessment of prognostic molecular features across cancers.","Cell Genom","Precision oncology promises accurate prediction of disease trajectories by utilizing molecular features of tumors. We present a systematic analysis of the prognostic potential of diverse molecular features across large cancer cohorts. We find that the mRNA expression of biologically coherent sets of genes (modules) is substantially more predictive of patient survival than single-locus genomic and transcriptomic aberrations. Extending our analysis beyond existing curated gene modules, we find a large novel class of highly prognostic DNA/RNAcis-regulatory modules associated with dynamic gene expression within cancers. Remarkably, in more than 82% of cancers, modules substantially improve survival stratification compared with conventional clinical factors and prominent genomic aberrations. The prognostic potential of cancer modules generalizes to external cohorts better than conventionally used single-gene features. Finally, a machine-learning framework demonstrates the combined predictive power of multiple modules, yielding prognostic models that perform substantially better than existing histopathological and clinical factors in common use.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"36320451","Regular smoking of male ancestors in adolescence and fat mass in young adult grandchildren and great-grandchildren.","Wellcome Open Res","Background: Previous studies using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) have shown that if men commenced smoking prior to the onset of puberty their sons, their granddaughters and great-granddaughters were more likely to have excess fat (but not lean) mass during childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. In this study we assess associations between ancestral smoking during adolescence (ages 11-16 years) with fat and lean mass of subsequent generations at two ages.Methods:We analysed data on exposures of grandparents and great-grandparents collected by ALSPAC. The outcomes were the fat masses of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren measured at ages 17 and 24. Measures of lean mass were used as controls. Adjustment was made for 8-10 demographic factors using multiple regression.Results:We found associations between adolescent smoking of thepaternalgrandfathers and the adjusted fat mass of their grandchildren, but no associations with the grandchildren's lean mass. Grandchildren at age 17 had an average excess fat mass of +1.65 [95% CI +0.04, +3.26] Kg, and at age 24 an average excess of +1.55 [95% CI -0.27, +3.38] Kg. Adolescent smoking by thematernalgrandfather showed similar, but weaker, associations: at 17 an average excess fat mass of +1.02 Kg [95% CI -0.20, +2.25] Kg, and at 24 an average excess of +1.28 [95% CI -0.11, +2.66] Kg. There were no pronounced differences between the sexes of the children. For the great-grandparents there were few convincing results, although numbers were small.Conclusions:We have shown associations between grandfathers' smoking in adolescence and increased fat (but not lean) mass in their children. Confirmation of these associations is required, either in a further data set or by demonstrating the presence of supportive biomarkers.Copyright: © 2023 Gregory S et al."
"36949887","Dissecting insect cell heterogeneity during influenza VLP production using single-cell transcriptomics.","Front Bioeng Biotechnol","The insect cell-baculovirus expression vector system (IC-BEVS) has been widely used to produce recombinant protein at high titers, including complex virus-like particles (VPLs). However, cell-to-cell variability upon infection is yet one of the least understood phenomena in virology, and little is known about its impact on production of therapeutic proteins. This study aimed at dissecting insect cell population heterogeneity during production of influenza VLPs in IC-BEVS using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). High Five cell population was shown to be heterogeneous even before infection, with cell cycle being one of the factors contributing for this variation. In addition, infected insect cells were clustered according to the timing and level of baculovirus genes expression, with each cluster reporting similar influenza VLPs transgenes (i.e., hemagglutinin and M1) transcript counts. Trajectory analysis enabled to track infection progression throughout pseudotime. Specific pathways such as translation machinery, protein folding, sorting and degradation, endocytosis and energy metabolism were identified as being those which vary the most during insect cell infection and production of Influenza VLPs. Overall, this study lays the ground for the application of scRNA-seq in IC-BEVS processes to isolate relevant biological mechanisms during recombinant protein expression towards its further optimization.Copyright © 2023 Silvano, Virgolini, Correia, Clarke, Isidro, Alves and Roldão."
"36941264","A comprehensive benchmarking with practical guidelines for cellular deconvolution of spatial transcriptomics.","Nat Commun","Spatial transcriptomics technologies are used to profile transcriptomes while preserving spatial information, which enables high-resolution characterization of transcriptional patterns and reconstruction of tissue architecture. Due to the existence of low-resolution spots in recent spatial transcriptomics technologies, uncovering cellular heterogeneity is crucial for disentangling the spatial patterns of cell types, and many related methods have been proposed. Here, we benchmark 18 existing methods resolving a cellular deconvolution task with 50 real-world and simulated datasets by evaluating the accuracy, robustness, and usability of the methods. We compare these methods comprehensively using different metrics, resolutions, spatial transcriptomics technologies, spot numbers, and gene numbers. In terms of performance, CARD, Cell2location, and Tangram are the best methods for conducting the cellular deconvolution task. To refine our comparative results, we provide decision-tree-style guidelines and recommendations for method selection and their additional features, which will help users easily choose the best method for fulfilling their concerns.© 2023.

"36909570","A data-fusion approach to identifying developmental dyslexia from multi-omics datasets.","bioRxiv","This exploratory study tested and validated the use of data fusion and machine learning techniques to probe high-throughput omics and clinical data with a goal of exploring the etiology of developmental dyslexia. Developmental dyslexia is the leading learning disability in school aged children affecting roughly 5-10% of the US population. The complex biological and neurological phenotype of this life altering disability complicates its diagnosis. Phenome, exome, and metabolome data was collected allowing us to fully explore this system from a behavioral, cellular, and molecular point of view. This study provides a proof of concept showing that data fusion and ensemble learning techniques can outperform traditional machine learning techniques when provided small and complex multi-omics and clinical datasets. Heterogenous stacking classifiers consisting of single-omic experts/models achieved an accuracy of 86%, F1 score of 0.89, and AUC value of 0.83. Ensemble methods also provided a ranked list of important features that suggests exome single nucleotide polymorphisms found in the thalamus and cerebellum could be potential biomarkers for developmental dyslexia and heavily influenced the classification of DD within our machine learning models."
"36968139","Mouse Stromal Cells Confound Proteomic Characterization and Quantification of Xenograft Models.","Cancer Res Commun","Xenografts are essential models for studying cancer biology and developing oncology drugs, and are more informative with omics data. Most reported xenograft proteomics projects directly profiled tumors comprising human cancer cells and mouse stromal cells, followed by computational algorithms for assigning peptides to human and mouse proteins. We evaluated the performance of three main algorithms by carrying out benchmark studies on a series of human and mouse cell line mixtures and a set of liver patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Our study showed that approximately half of the characterized peptides are common between human and mouse proteins, and their allocations to human or mouse proteins cannot be satisfactorily achieved by any algorithm. As a result, many human proteins are erroneously labeled as differentially expressed proteins (DEP) between samples from the same human cell line mixed with different percentages of mouse cells, and the number of such false DEPs increases superquadratically with the mouse cell percentage. When mouse stromal cells are not removed from PDX tumors, about 30%-40% of DEPs from pairwise comparisons of PDX models are false positives, and about 20% of real DEPs cannot be identified irrespective of the threshold for calling differential expression. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that it is advisable to separate human and mouse cells in xenograft tumors before proteomic profiling to obtain more accurate measurement of species-specific protein expression.This study advocates the separate-then-run over the run-then-separate approach as a better strategy for more reliable proteomic profiling of xenografts.© 2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research."
