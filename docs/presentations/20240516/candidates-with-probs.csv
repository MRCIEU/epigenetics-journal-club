38746367,regionalpcs : improved discovery of DNA methylation associations with complex traits.,bioRxiv,"We have developed the regional principal components (rPCs) method, a novel approach for summarizing gene-level methylation. rPCs address the challenge of deciphering complex epigenetic mechanisms in diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast to traditional averaging, rPCs leverage principal components analysis to capture complex methylation patterns across gene regions. Our method demonstrated a 54% improvement in sensitivity over averaging in simulations, offering a robust framework for identifying subtle epigenetic variations. Applying rPCs to the AD brain methylation data in ROSMAP, combined with cell type deconvolution, we uncovered 838 differentially methylated genes associated with neuritic plaque burden-significantly outperforming conventional methods. Integrating methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified 17 genes with potential causal roles in AD, includingMS4A4AandPI-CALM. Our approach is available in the Bioconductor packageregionalpcs, opening avenues for research and facilitating a deeper understanding of the epigenetic landscape in complex diseases.",3.586713403579339e-06
38741204,Early detection and prognosis evaluation for hepatocellular carcinoma by circulating tumour DNA methylation: A multicentre cohort study.,Clin Transl Med,"Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can significantly improve patient survival. We aimed to develop a blood-based assay to aid in the diagnosis, detection and prognostic evaluation of HCC.A three-phase multicentre study was conducted to screen, optimise and validate HCC-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using next-generation sequencing and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP).Genome-wide methylation profiling was conducted to identify DMRs distinguishing HCC tumours from peritumoural tissues and healthy plasmas. The twenty most effective DMRs were verified and incorporated into a multilocus qMSP assay (HepaAiQ). The HepaAiQ model was trained to separate 293 HCC patients (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0/A, 224) from 266 controls including chronic hepatitis B (CHB) or liver cirrhosis (LC) (CHB/LC, 96), benign hepatic lesions (BHL, 23), and healthy controls (HC, 147). The model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.944 with a sensitivity of 86.0% in HCC and a specificity of 92.1% in controls. Blind validation of the HepaAiQ model in a cohort of 523 participants resulted in an AUC of 0.940 with a sensitivity of 84.4% in 205 HCC cases (BCLC stage 0/A, 167) and a specificity of 90.3% in 318 controls (CHB/LC, 100; BHL, 102; HC, 116). When evaluated in an independent test set, the HepaAiQ model exhibited a sensitivity of 70.8% in 65 HCC patients at BCLC stage 0/A and a specificity of 89.5% in 124 patients with CHB/LC. Moreover, HepaAiQ model was assessed in paired pre- and postoperative plasma samples from 103 HCC patients and correlated with 2-year patient outcomes. Patients with high postoperative HepaAiQ score showed a higher recurrence risk (Hazard ratio, 3.33, p < .001).HepaAiQ, a noninvasive qMSP assay, was developed to accurately measure HCC-specific DMRs and shows great potential for the diagnosis, detection and prognosis of HCC, benefiting at-risk populations.© 2024 The Author(s).

38741114,DNA methylation signatures of youth-onset type 2 diabetes and exposure to maternal diabetes.,Clin Epigenetics,"Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) is physiologically distinct from adult-onset, but it is not clear how the two diseases differ at a molecular level. In utero exposure to maternal type 2 diabetes (T2D) is known to be a specific risk factor for youth-onset T2D. DNA methylation (DNAm) changes associated with T2D but which differ between youth- and adult-onset might delineate the impacts of T2D development at different ages and could also determine the contribution of exposure to in utero diabetes.We performed an epigenome-wide analysis of DNAm on whole blood from 218 youth with T2D and 77 normoglycemic controls from the iCARE (improving renal Complications in Adolescents with type 2 diabetes through REsearch) cohort. Associations were tested using multiple linear regression models while adjusting for maternal diabetes, sex, age, BMI, smoking status, second-hand smoking exposure, cell-type proportions and genetic ancestry.We identified 3830 differentially methylated sites associated with youth T2D onset, of which 3794 were moderately (adjusted p-value < 0.05 and effect size estimate > 0.01) associated and 36 were strongly (adjusted p-value < 0.05 and effect size estimate > 0.05) associated. A total of 3725 of these sites were not previously reported in the EWAS Atlas as associated with T2D, adult obesity or youth obesity. Moreover, three CpGs associated with youth-onset T2D in the PFKFB3 gene were also associated with maternal T2D exposure (FDR < 0.05 and effect size > 0.01). This is the first study to link PFKFB3 and T2D in youth.Our findings support that T2D in youth has different impacts on DNAm than adult-onset, and suggests that changes in DNAm could provide an important link between in utero exposure to maternal diabetes and the onset of T2D.© 2024.

38737319,"Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of TIFY genes under MeJA, cold and PEG-induced drought stress treatment in Dendrobium huoshanense.",Physiol Mol Biol Plants,"TheTIFYfamily consists of plant-specific genes that regulates multiple plant functions, including developmental and defense responses. Here, we performed a comprehensive genomic analysis ofTIFYgenes inDendrobium huoshanense. Our analysis encompassed their phylogenetic relationships, gene structures, chromosomal distributions, promoter regions, and patterns of collinearity. A total of 16DhTIFYgenes were identified, and classified into distinct clusters named JAZ, PPD, ZIM, and TIFY based on their phylogenetic relationship. TheseDhTIFYs exhibited an uneven distribution across 7 chromosomes. The expansion of theDhTIFYgene family appears to have been significantly influenced by whole-genome and segmental duplication events. The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks) implies that the purifying selection has been predominant, maintaining a constrained functional diversification after duplication events. Gene structure analysis indicated thatDhTIFYs exhibited significant structural variation, particularly in terms of gene organization and intron numbers. Moreover, numerouscis-acting elements related to hormone signaling, developmental processes, and stress responses were identified within the promoter regions. Subsequently, qRT-PCR experiments demonstrated that the expression ofDhTIFYsis modulated in response to MeJA (Methyl jasmonate), cold, and drought treatment. Collectively, these results enhance our understanding of the functional dynamics ofTIFYgenes inD. huoshanenseand may pinpoint potential candidates for detailed examination of the biological roles ofTIFYgenes.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12298-024-01442-9.© Prof. H.S.

38730337,"Hyper-physiologic mechanical cues, as an osteoarthritis disease-relevant environmental perturbation, cause a critical shift in set points of methylation at transcriptionally active CpG sites in neo-cartilage organoids.",Clin Epigenetics,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex, age-related multifactorial degenerative disease of diarthrodial joints marked by impaired mobility, joint stiffness, pain, and a significant decrease in quality of life. Among other risk factors, such as genetics and age, hyper-physiological mechanical cues are known to play a critical role in the onset and progression of the disease (Guilak in Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol 25:815-823, 2011). It has been shown that post-mitotic cells, such as articular chondrocytes, heavily rely on methylation at CpG sites to adapt to environmental cues and maintain phenotypic plasticity. However, these long-lasting adaptations may eventually have a negative impact on cellular performance. We hypothesize that hyper-physiologic mechanical loading leads to the accumulation of altered epigenetic markers in articular chondrocytes, resulting in a loss of the tightly regulated balance of gene expression that leads to a dysregulated state characteristic of the OA disease state.We showed that hyper-physiological loading evokes consistent changes in CpGs associated with expression changes (ML-tCpGs) in ITGA5, CAV1, and CD44, among other genes, which together act in pathways such as anatomical structure morphogenesis (GO:0009653) and response to wound healing (GO:0042060). Moreover, by comparing the ML-tCpGs and their associated pathways to tCpGs in OA pathophysiology (OA-tCpGs), we observed a modest but particular interconnected overlap with notable genes such as CD44 and ITGA5. These genes could indeed represent lasting detrimental changes to the phenotypic state of chondrocytes due to mechanical perturbations that occurred earlier in life. The latter is further suggested by the association between methylation levels of ML-tCpGs mapped to CD44 and OA severity.Our findings confirm that hyper-physiological mechanical cues evoke changes to the methylome-wide landscape of chondrocytes, concomitant with detrimental changes in positional gene expression levels (ML-tCpGs). Since CAV1, ITGA5, and CD44 are subject to such changes and are central and overlapping with OA-tCpGs of primary chondrocytes, we propose that accumulation of hyper-physiological mechanical cues can evoke long-lasting, detrimental changes in set points of gene expression that influence the phenotypic healthy state of chondrocytes. Future studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.8515306387201737e-56
38723642,Placental DNA methylation signatures of prenatal air pollution exposure and potential effects on birth outcomes: an analysis of three prospective cohorts.,Lancet Planet Health,"Pregnancy air pollution exposure (PAPE) has been linked to a wide range of adverse birth and childhood outcomes, but there is a paucity of data on its influence on the placental epigenome, which can regulate the programming of physiological functions and affect child development. This study aimed to investigate the association between prenatal air pollutant exposure concentrations and changes in placental DNA methylation patterns, and to explore the potential windows of susceptibility and sex-specific alterations.This multi-site study used three prospective population-based mother-child cohorts: EDEN, PELAGIE, and SEPAGES, originating from four French geographical regions (Nancy, Poitiers, Brittany, and Grenoble). Pregnant women were included between 2003 and 2006 for EDEN and PELAGIE, and between 2014 and 2017 for SEPAGES. The main eligibility criteria were: being older than 18 years, having a singleton pregnancy, and living and planning to deliver in one of the maternity clinics in one of the study areas. A total of 1539 mother-child pairs were analysed, measuring placental DNA methylation using Illumina BeadChips. We used validated spatiotemporally resolved models to estimate PM2·5, PM10, and NO2exposure over each trimester of pregnancy at the maternal residential address. We conducted a pooled adjusted epigenome-wide association study to identify differentially methylated 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) sites and regions (assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip array, n=871), including sex-specific and sex-linked alterations, and independently validated our results (assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array, n=668).We identified four CpGs and 28 regions associated with PAPE in the total population, 469 CpGs and 87 regions in male infants, and 150 CpGs and 66 regions in female infants. We validated 35% of the CpGs available. More than 30% of the identified CpGs were related to one (or more) birth outcome and most significant alterations were enriched for neural development, immunity, and metabolism related genes. The 28 regions identified for both sexes overlapped with imprinted genes (four genes), and were associated with neurodevelopment (nine genes), immune system (seven genes), and metabolism (five genes). Most associations were observed for the third trimester for female infants (134 of 150 CpGs), and throughout pregnancy (281 of 469 CpGs) and the first trimester (237 of 469 CpGs) for male infants.These findings highlight the molecular pathways through which PAPE might affect child health in a widespread and sex-specific manner, identifying the genes involved in the major physiological functions of a developing child. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether these epigenetic changes persist and affect health later in life.French Agency for National Research, Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale, Fondation de France, and the Plan Cancer.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

38723422,Age- and sex- divergent translatomic responses of the mouse retinal pigmented epithelium.,Neurobiol Aging,"Aging is the main risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a retinal neurodegenerative disease that leads to irreversible blindness, particularly in people over 60 years old. Retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) atrophy is an AMD hallmark. Genome-wide chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and gene expression studies of AMD and control RPE demonstrate epigenomic/transcriptomic changes occur during AMD onset and progression. However, mechanisms by which molecular alterations of normal aging impair RPE function and contribute to AMD pathogenesis are unclear. Here, we specifically interrogate the RPE translatome with advanced age and across sexes in a novel RPE reporter mouse model. We find differential age- and sex- associated transcript expression with overrepresentation of pathways related to inflammation in the RPE. Concordant with impaired RPE function, the phenotypic changes in the aged translatome suggest that aged RPE becomes immunologically active, in both males and females, with some sex-specific signatures, which supports the need for sex representation for in vivo studies.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

38722176,Comparison of CcrM-dependent methylation in Caulobacter crescentus and Brucella abortus by nanopore sequencing.,J Bacteriol,"Bacteria rely on DNA methylation for restriction-modification systems and epigenetic control of gene expression. Here, we use direct detection of methylated bases by nanopore sequencing to monitor global DNA methylation in Alphaproteobacteria, where use of this technique has not yet been reported. One representative of this order,Caulobacter crescentus, relies on DNA methylation to control cell cycle progression, but it is unclear whether other members of this order, such asBrucella abortus, depend on the same systems. We addressed these questions by first measuring CcrM-dependent DNA methylation inCaulobacterand showing excellent correlation between nanopore-based detection and previously published results. We then directly measure the impact of Lon-mediated CcrM degradation on the epigenome, verifying that loss of Lon results in pervasive methylation. We also show that the AlkB demethylase has no global impact on DNA methylation during normal growth. Next, we report on the global DNA methylation inB. abortusfor the first time and find that CcrM-dependent methylation is reliant on Lon but impacts the two chromosomes differently. Finally, we explore the impact of the MucR transcription factor, known to compete with CcrM methylation, on theBrucellamethylome and share the results with a publicly available visualization package. Our work demonstrates the utility of nanopore-based sequencing for epigenome measurements in Alphaproteobacteria and reveals new features of CcrM-dependent methylation in a zoonotic pathogen.IMPORTANCEDNA methylation plays an important role in bacteria, maintaining genome integrity and regulating gene expression. We used nanopore sequencing to directly measure methylated bases inCaulobacter crescentusandBrucella abortus. InCaulobacter, we showed that stabilization of the CcrM methyltransferase upon loss of the Lon protease results in prolific methylation and discovered that the putative methylase AlkB is unlikely to have a global physiological effect. We measured genome-wide methylation inBrucellafor the first time, revealing a similar role for CcrM in cell-cycle methylation but a more complex regulation by the Lon protease than in Caulobacter. Finally, we show how the virulence factor MucR impacts DNA methylation patterns inBrucella.",4.777655216189924e-25
38721773,Neuroimaging and epigenetic analysis reveal novel epigenetic loci in major depressive disorder.,Psychol Med,"Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, contribute to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to identify novel MDD-associated epigenetic loci using DNA methylation profiles and explore the correlations between epigenetic loci and cortical thickness changes in patients with MDD.A total of 350 patients with MDD and 161 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). We analyzed methylation, copy number alteration (CNA), and gene network profiles in the MDD group. A total of 234 patients with MDD and 135 HCs were included in neuroimaging methylation analysis. Pearson's partial correlation analysis was used to estimate the correlation between cortical thickness of brain regions and DNA methylation levels of the loci.In total, 2018 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and 351 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified. DMP-related genes were enriched in two networks involved in the central nervous system. In neuroimaging analysis, patients with MDD showed cortical thinning in the prefrontal regions and cortical thickening in several occipital regions. Cortical thickness of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC, i.e. pars triangularis) was negatively correlated with eight DMPs associated with six genes (EML6,ZFP64,CLSTN3,KCNMA1,TAOK2, andNT5E).Through combining DNA methylation and neuroimaging analyses, negative correlations were identified between the cortical thickness of the left VLPFC and DNA methylation levels of eight DMPs. Our findings could improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD.",0.5095055285180291

L-2-HGA patients have a significantly increased lifetime risk of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Here, we present a 16-year-old girl with L-2-HGA who developed a tumor in the right cerebral hemisphere, which was discovered after left-sided neurological deficits of the patient. Histologically, the tumor had a high-grade diffuse glioma phenotype. DNA sequencing revealed the inactivating homozygous germlineL2HGDHmutation as well as inactivating mutations inTP53,BCORandNF1. Genome-wide DNA-methylation analysis was unable to classify the tumor with high confidence. More detailed analysis revealed that this tumor clustered amongst IDH-wildtype gliomas by methylation profiling and did not show the glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) in contrast to IDH-mutant diffuse gliomas with accumulated levels of D-2-HG, the stereoisomer of L-2-HD. These findings were against all our expectations given the inhibitory potential of 2-HG on DNA-demethylation enzymes. Our final integrated histomolecular diagnosis of the tumor was diffuse pediatric-type high-grade glioma, H3-wildtype and IDH-wildtype. Due to rapid tumor progression the patient died nine months after initial diagnosis.

38715099,Prenatal nicotine exposure leads to epigenetic alterations in peripheral nervous system signaling genes in the testis of the rat.,Epigenetics Chromatin,"Prenatal nicotine exposure (PNE) has been documented to cause numerous deleterious effects on fetal development. However, the epigenetic changes promoted by nicotine exposure on germ cells are still not well understood.In this study, we focused on elucidating the impact of prenatal nicotine exposure on regulatory epigenetic mechanisms important for germ cell development.Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to nicotine during pregnancy and male progeny was analyzed at 11 weeks of age. Testis morphology was analyzed using frozen testis sections and expression of germ cell markers was examined by RT-qPCR; histone modifications were assessed by Western Blot (WB). DNA methylation analysis was performed by methylation-specific PCR of bisulfite converted DNA. Genome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed using Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)-seq. We also carried out transcriptomics analysis of pituitary glands by RNA-seq.We show that gestational exposure to nicotine reduces germ cell numbers, perturbs meiosis, affects the expression of germ line reprogramming responsive genes, and impacts the DNA methylation of nervous system genes in the testis. PNE also causes perturbation of gene expression in the pituitary gland of the brain.Our data demonstrate that PNE leads to perturbation of male spermatogenesis, and the observed effects are associated with changes of peripheral nervous system signaling pathways. Alterations in the expression of genes associated with diverse biological activities such as cell migration, cell adhesion and GABA signaling in the pituitary gland underscore the complexity of the effects of nicotine exposure during pregnancy.© 2024.

The DNA from the N. fowleri clinical isolate was sequenced for circular extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA (CERE - rDNA). The CERE contains 18 S, 5.8 S, and 28 S ribosomal subunits separated by internal transcribed spacers, 5 open reading frames (ORFs), and mostly repeat elements comprising 7268 bp out of 15,786 bp (46%). A wide variety of variations and recombination events were observed. Finally, the ORFs that comprised only 4 hypothetical proteins were modeled and screened against Zinc drug-like compounds. Two compounds [ZINC77564275 (ethyl 2-(((4-isopropyl-4 H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl) methyl) (methyl)amino) oxazole-4-carboxylate) and ZINC15022129 (5-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-[2,2'-bipyrimidine]-4,6(1 H,5 H)-dione)] were finalized as potential druggable compounds based on ADME toxicity analysis.

Early intervention can significantly improve prognosis. DNA methylation could occur in the early stage of tumor. Comprehensive understanding the epigenetic landscape of early-stage LUAD is crucial in understanding tumorigenesis.Enzymatic methyl sequencing (EM-seq) was performed on 23 tumors and paired normal tissue to reveal distinct epigenetic landscape, for compared with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 450K methylation microarray data. Then, an integrative analysis was performed combined with TCGA LUAD RNA-seq data to identify significant differential methylated and expressed genes. Subsequently, the prognostic risk model was constructed and cellular composition was analyzed.Methylome analysis of EM-seq comparing tumor and normal tissues identified 25 million cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites and 30,187 differentially methylated regions (DMR) with a greater number of untraditional types. EM-seq identified a significantly higher number of CpG sites and DMRs compared to the 450K microarray. By integrating the differentially methylated genes (DMGs) with LUAD-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the TCGA database, we constructed prognostic model based on six differentially methylated-expressed genes (MEGs) and verified our prognostic model in GSE13213 and GSE42127 dataset. Finally, cell deconvolution based on the in-house EM-seq methylation profile was used to estimate cellular composition of early-stage LUAD.This study firstly delves into novel pattern of epigenomic DNA methylation and provides a multidimensional analysis of the role of DNA methylation revealed by EM-seq in early-stage LUAD, providing distinctive insights into its potential epigenetic mechanisms.© 2024.

38711090,Comprehensive analysis of the REST transcription factor regulatory networks in IDH mutant and IDH wild-type glioma cell lines and tumors.,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"The RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) acts either as a repressor or activator of transcription depending on the genomic and cellular context. REST is a key player in brain cell differentiation by inducing chromatin modifications, including DNA methylation, in a proximity of its binding sites. Its dysfunction may contribute to oncogenesis. Mutations in IDH1/2 significantly change the epigenome contributing to blockade of cell differentiation and glioma development. We aimed at defining how REST modulates gene activation and repression in the context of the IDH mutation-related phenotype in gliomas. We studied the effects of REST knockdown, genome wide occurrence of REST binding sites, and DNA methylation of REST motifs in IDH wild type and IDH mutant gliomas. We found that REST target genes, REST binding patterns, and TF motif occurrence proximal to REST binding sites differed in IDH wild-type and mutant gliomas. Among differentially expressed REST targets were genes involved in glial cell differentiation and extracellular matrix organization, some of which were differentially methylated at promoters or gene bodies. REST knockdown differently impacted invasion of the parental or IDH1 mutant glioma cells. The canonical REST-repressed gene targets showed significant correlation with the GBM NPC-like cellular state. Interestingly, results of REST or KAISO silencing suggested the interplay between these TFs in regulation of REST-activated and repressed targets. The identified gene regulatory networks and putative REST cooperativity with other TFs, such as KAISO, show distinct REST target regulatory networks in IDH-WT and IDH-MUT gliomas, without concomitant DNA methylation changes. We conclude that REST could be an important therapeutic target in gliomas.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.8717650088598384e-63

Despite extensive research on POD families in various plant species, the knowledge regarding the POD family in Chinese pear (Pyrus bretschenedri) is notably limited.We systematically characterized 113 POD family genes, designated as PbPOD1 to PbPOD113 based on their chromosomal locations. Phylogenetic analysis categorized these genes into seven distinct subfamilies (I to VII). The segmental duplication events were identified as a prevalent mechanism driving the expansion of the POD gene family. Microsynteny analysis, involving comparisons with Pyrus bretschenedri, Fragaria vesca, Prunus avium, Prunus mume and Prunus persica, highlighted the conservation of duplicated POD regions and their persistence through purifying selection during the evolutionary process. The expression patterns of PbPOD genes were performed across various plant organs and diverse fruit development stages using transcriptomic data. Furthermore, we identified stress-related cis-acting elements within the promoters of PbPOD genes, underscoring their involvement in hormonal and environmental stress responses. Notably, qRT-PCR analyses revealed distinctive expression patterns of PbPOD genes in response to melatonin (MEL), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), reflecting their responsiveness to abiotic stress and their role in fruit growth and development.In this study, we investigated the potential functions and evolutionary dynamics of PbPOD genes in Pyrus bretschenedri, positioning them as promising candidates for further research and valuable indicators for enhancing fruit quality through molecular breeding strategies.© 2024.

38710471,Genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptomic analysis of liver tissues subjected to early ischemia/reperfusion injury upon human liver transplantation.,Ann Hepatol,"Epigenetic changes represent a mechanism connecting external stresses with long-term modifications of gene expression programs. In solid organ transplantation, ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) appears to induce epigenomic changes in the graft, although the currently available data are extremely limited. The present study aimed to characterize variations in DNA methylation and their effects on the transcriptome in liver transplantation from brain-dead donors.12 liver grafts were evaluated through serial biopsies at different timings in the procurement-transplantation process: T0 (warm procurement, in donor), T1 (bench surgery), and T2 (after reperfusion, in recipient). DNA methylation (DNAm) and transcriptome profiles of biopsies were analyzed using microarrays and RNAseq.Significant variations in DNAm were identified, particularly between T2 and T0. Functional enrichment of the best 1000 ranked differentially methylated promoters demonstrated that 387 hypermethylated and 613 hypomethylated promoters were involved in spliceosomal assembly and response to biotic stimuli, and inflammatory immune responses, respectively. At the transcriptome level, T2 vs. T0 showed an upregulation of 337 and downregulation of 61 genes, collectively involved in TNF-α, NFKB, and interleukin signaling. Cell enrichment analysis individuates macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils as the most significant tissue-cell type in the response.In the process of liver graft procurement-transplantation, IRI induces significant epigenetic changes that primarily act on the signaling pathways of inflammatory responses dependent on TNF-α, NFKB, and interleukins. Our DNAm datasets are the early IRI methylome literature and will serve as a launch point for studying the impact of epigenetic modification in IRI.Copyright © 2024.

38702658,Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of the SET domain-containing gene family in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.).,BMC Genomics,"Genes containing the SET domain can catalyse histone lysine methylation, which in turn has the potential to cause changes to chromatin structure and regulation of the transcription of genes involved in diverse physiological and developmental processes. However, the functions of SET domain-containing (StSET) genes in potato still need to be studied. The objectives of our study can be summarized as in silico analysis to (i) identify StSET genes in the potato genome, (ii) systematically analyse gene structure, chromosomal distribution, gene duplication events, promoter sequences, and protein domains, (iii) perform phylogenetic analyses, (iv) compare the SET domain-containing genes of potato with other plant species with respect to protein domains and orthologous relationships, (v) analyse tissue-specific expression, and (vi) study the expression of StSET genes in response to drought and heat stresses. In this study, we identified 57 StSET genes in the potato genome, and the genes were physically mapped onto eleven chromosomes. The phylogenetic analysis grouped these StSET genes into six clades. We found that tandem duplication through sub-functionalisation has contributed only marginally to the expansion of the StSET gene family. The protein domain TDBD (PFAM ID: PF16135) was detected in StSET genes of potato while it was absent in all other previously studied species. This study described three pollen-specific StSET genes in the potato genome. Expression analysis of four StSET genes under heat and drought in three potato clones revealed that these genes might have non-overlapping roles under different abiotic stress conditions and durations. The present study provides a comprehensive analysis of StSET genes in potatoes, and it serves as a basis for further functional characterisation of StSET genes towards understanding their underpinning biological mechanisms in conferring stress tolerance.© 2024.

H3K4me3 relies on prior monoubiquitination at the histone H2B (H2Bub) by Rad6 and Bre1. Swd2/Cps35, a Set1/COMPASS component, has been proposed as a key player in facilitating H2Bub-dependent H3K4me3. However, a more comprehensive investigation regarding the relationship among Rad6, Swd2, and Set1 is required to further understand the mechanisms and functions of the H3K4 methylation.We investigated the genome-wide occupancy patterns of Rad6, Swd2, and Set1 under various genetic conditions, aiming to clarify the roles of Set1 and Rad6 for occupancy of Swd2. Swd2 peaks appear on both the 5' region and 3' region of genes, which are overlapped with its tightly bound two complexes, Set1 and cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF), respectively. In the absence of Rad6/H2Bub, Set1 predominantly localized to the 5' region of genes, while Swd2 lost all the chromatin binding. However, in the absence of Set1, Swd2 occupancy near the 5' region was impaired and rather increased in the 3' region.This study highlights that the catalytic activity of Rad6 is essential for all the ways of Swd2's binding to the transcribed genes and Set1 redistributes the Swd2 to the 5' region for accomplishments of H3K4me3 in the genome-wide level.© 2024.

38702197,Navigating the landscape of epitranscriptomics and host immunity.,Genome Res,"RNA modifications, also termed epitranscriptomic marks, encompass chemical alterations to individual nucleotides, including processes such as methylation and editing. These marks contribute to a wide range of biological processes, many of which are related to host immune system defense. The functions of immune-related RNA modifications can be categorized into three main groups: regulation of immunogenic RNAs, control of genes involved in innate immune response, and facilitation of adaptive immunity. Here, we provide an overview of recent research findings that elucidate the contributions of RNA modifications to each of these processes. We also discuss relevant methods for genome-wide identification of RNA modifications and their immunogenic substrates. Finally, we highlight recent advances in cancer immunotherapies that aim to reduce cancer cell viability by targeting the enzymes responsible for RNA modifications. Our presentation of these dynamic research avenues sets the stage for future investigations in this field.© 2024 Huang et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",7.393897409998855e-36
38702190,"Epigenome-wide association study of lung cancer among never smokers in two prospective cohorts in Shanghai, China.",Thorax,"The aetiology of lung cancer among individuals who never smoked remains elusive, despite 15% of lung cancer cases in men and 53% in women worldwide being unrelated to smoking. Epigenetic alterations, particularly DNA methylation (DNAm) changes, have emerged as potential drivers. Yet, few prospective epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), primarily focusing on peripheral blood DNAm with limited representation of never smokers, have been conducted.We conducted a nested case-control study of 80 never-smoking incident lung cancer cases and 83 never-smoking controls within the Shanghai Women's Health Study and Shanghai Men's Health Study. DNAm was measured in prediagnostic oral rinse samples using Illumina MethylationEPIC array. Initially, we conducted an EWAS to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with lung cancer in the discovery sample of 101 subjects. The top 50 DMPs were further evaluated in a replication sample of 62 subjects, and results were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis.Our study identified three DMPs significantly associated with lung cancer at the epigenome-wide significance level of p<8.22×10-8. These DMPs were identified as cg09198866 (MYH9;TXN2), cg01411366 (SLC9A10) and cg12787323. Furthermore, examination of the top 1000 DMPs indicated significant enrichment in epithelial regulatory regions and their involvement in small GTPase-mediated signal transduction pathways. Additionally, GrimAge acceleration was identified as a risk factor for lung cancer (OR=1.19 per year; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.34).While replication in a larger sample size is necessary, our findings suggest that DNAm patterns in prediagnostic oral rinse samples could provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of lung cancer in never smokers.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

38699366,A novel multi-omics mendelian randomization method for gene set enrichment and its application to psychiatric disorders.,medRxiv,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of psychiatric disorders (PD) yield numerous loci with significant signals, but often do not implicate specific genes. Because GWAS risk loci are enriched in expression/protein/methylation quantitative loci (e/p/mQTL, hereafter xQTL), transcriptome/proteome/methylome-wide association studies (T/P/MWAS, hereafter XWAS) that integrate xQTL and GWAS information, can link GWAS signals to effects on specific genes. To further increase detection power, gene signals are aggregated within relevant gene sets (GS) by performing gene set enrichment (GSE) analyses. Often GSE methods test for enrichment of ""signal"" genes in curated GS while overlooking their linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure, allowing for the possibility of increased false positive rates. Moreover, no GSE tool uses xQTL information to perform mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. To make causal inference on association between PD and GS, we develop a novel MR GSE (MR-GSE) procedure. First, we generate a ""synthetic"" GWAS for each MSigDB GS by aggregating summary statistics for x-level (mRNA, protein or DNA methylation (DNAm) levels) from the largest xQTL studies available) of genes in a GS. Second, we use synthetic GS GWAS as exposure in a generalized summary-data-based-MR analysis of complex trait outcomes. We applied MR-GSE to GWAS of nine important PD. When applied to the underpowered opioid use disorder GWAS, none of the four analyses yielded any signals, which suggests a good control of false positive rates. For other PD, MR-GSE greatly increased the detection of GO terms signals (2,594) when compared to the commonly used (non-MR) GSE method (286). Some of the findings might be easier to adapt for treatment, e.g., our analyses suggest modest positive effects for supplementation with certain vitamins and/or omega-3 for schizophrenia, bipolar and major depression disorder patients. Similar to other MR methods, when applying MR-GSE researchers should be mindful of the confounding effects of horizontal pleiotropy on statistical inference.",6.335410221240711e-09
38699335,Association analysis between an epigenetic risk score and blood pressure.,Res Sq,"Epigenome-wide association studies have revealed multiple DNA methylation sites (CpGs) associated with alcohol consumption, an important lifestyle risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.We generated an alcohol consumption epigenetic risk score (ERS) based on previously reported 144 alcohol-associated CpGs and examined the association of the ERS with systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and hypertension (HTN) in 3,898 Framingham Heart Study (FHS) participants. We found an association of alcohol intake with the ERS in the meta-analysis with 0.09 units higher ERS per drink consumed per day (p< 0.0001). Cross-sectional analyses in FHS revealed that a one-unit increment of the ERS was associated with 1.93 mm Hg higher SBP (p= 4.64E-07), 0.68 mm Hg higher DBP (p = 0.006), and an odds ratio of 1.78 for HTN (p< 2E-16). Meta-analysis of the cross-sectional association of the ERS with BP traits in eight independent external cohorts (n = 11,544) showed similar relationships with blood pressure levels, i.e., a one-unit increase in ERS was associated with 0.74 (p= 0.002) and 0.50 (p= 0.0006) mm Hg higher SBP and DBP, but could not confirm the association with hypertension. Longitudinal analyses in FHS (n = 3,260) and five independent external cohorts (n = 4,021) showed that the baseline ERS was not associated with a change in blood pressure over time or with incident HTN.Our findings provide proof-of-concept that utilizing an ERS is a useful approach to capture the recent health consequences of lifestyle behaviors such as alcohol consumption.",0.9999999999999998
38692281,Blood-based epigenome-wide analyses of chronic low-grade inflammation across diverse population cohorts.,Cell Genom,"Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of age-related disease states. The effectiveness of inflammatory proteins including C-reactive protein (CRP) in assessing long-term inflammation is hindered by their phasic nature. DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of CRP may act as more reliable markers of chronic inflammation. We show that inter-individual differences in DNAm capture 50% of the variance in circulating CRP (N = 17,936, Generation Scotland). We develop a series of DNAm predictors of CRP using state-of-the-art algorithms. An elastic-net-regression-based predictor outperformed competing methods and explained 18% of phenotypic variance in the Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936 (LBC1936) cohort, doubling that of existing DNAm predictors. DNAm predictors performed comparably in four additional test cohorts (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, Health for Life in Singapore, Southall and Brent Revisited, and LBC1921), including for individuals of diverse genetic ancestry and different age groups. The best-performing predictor surpassed assay-measured CRP and a genetic score in its associations with 26 health outcomes.

38686348,CRISPR/dCas9-Tet1-Mediated DNA Methylation Editing.,Bio Protoc,"DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism underlying many biological processes, and its aberrant regulation has been tightly associated with various human diseases. Precise manipulation of DNA methylation holds the promise to advance our understanding of this critical mechanism and to develop novel therapeutic methods. Previously, we were only able to alter genome-wide DNA methylation by treating with small molecules (e.g., 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine) or perturbing relevant genes (e.g., DNA methyltransferase) targetlessly, which makes it challenging to investigate the functional significance of this epigenetic mark at specific genomic loci. By fusing the catalytic domain of a key enzyme in the DNA demethylation process (Ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases 1, Tet1) with a reprogrammable sequence-specific DNA-targeting molecular protein, dCas9, we developed a DNA methylation editing tool (dCas9-Tet1) to demethylate specific genomic loci in a targeted manner. This dCas9-Tet1 system allows us to study the role of DNA methylation at almost any given loci with only the replacement of a single-guide RNA. Here, we describe a protocol that enables modular and scalable manipulation of DNA methylation at specific genomic loci in various cell cultures with high efficiency and specificity using the dCas9-Tet1 system. Key features • Precisely editing the DNA methylation of specific genomic loci in a targeted manner. • Fine-tuning gene expression without changing DNA sequence. • Applicable to many types of cell cultures and with the potential for ex vitro and in vivo applications.©Copyright : © 2024 The Authors; This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC license.",1.2126848233491964e-43
38685121,Genome- and epigenome-wide association studies identify susceptibility of CpG sites and regions for metabolic syndrome in a Korean population.,Clin Epigenetics,"While multiple studies have investigated the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its related traits (fasting glucose, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, waist circumference) and DNA methylation, our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms in MetS remains limited. Therefore, we performed an epigenome-wide meta-analysis of blood DNA methylation to identify differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with MetS and its components using two independent cohorts comprising a total of 2,334 participants. We also investigated the specific genetic effects on DNA methylation, identified methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) through genome-wide association studies and further utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess how these meQTLs subsequently influence MetS status.We identified 40 DMPs and 27 DMRs that are significantly associated with MetS. In addition, we identified many novel DMPs and DMRs underlying inflammatory and steroid hormonal processes. The most significant associations were observed in 3 DMPs (cg19693031, cg26974062, cg02988288) and a DMR (chr1:145440444-145441553) at the TXNIP, which are involved in lipid metabolism. These CpG sites were identified as coregulators of DNA methylation in MetS, TG and FAG levels. We identified a total of 144 cis-meQTLs, out of which only 13 were found to be associated with DMPs for MetS. Among these, we confirmed the identified causal mediators of genetic effects at CpG sites cg01881899 at ABCG1 and cg00021659 at the TANK genes for MetS.This study observed whether specific CpGs and methylated regions act independently or are influenced by genetic effects for MetS and its components in the Korean population. These associations between the identified DNA methylation and MetS, along with its individual components, may serve as promising targets for the development of preventive interventions for MetS.© 2024.

38684796,Integration of multi-omics summary data reveals the role of N6-methyladenosine in neuropsychiatric disorders.,Mol Psychiatry,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation regulates gene expression/protein by influencing numerous aspects of mRNA metabolism and contributes to neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, we integrated multi-omics data and genome-wide association study summary data of schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BP), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), major depressive disorder (MDD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD) to reveal the role of m6A in neuropsychiatric disorders by using transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) tool and Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). Our investigation identified 86 m6A sites associated with seven neuropsychiatric diseases and then revealed 7881 associations between m6A sites and gene expressions. Based on these results, we discovered 916 significant m6A-gene associations involving 82 disease-related m6A sites and 606 genes. Further integrating the 58 disease-related genes from TWAS and SMR analysis, we obtained 61, 8, 7, 3, and 2 associations linking m6A-disease, m6A-gene, and gene-disease for SCZ, BP, AD, MDD, and PD separately. Functional analysis showed the m6A mapped genes were enriched in ""response to stimulus"" pathway. In addition, we also analyzed the effect of gene expression on m6A and the post-transcription effect of m6A on protein. Our study provided new insights into the genetic component of m6A in neuropsychiatric disorders and unveiled potential pathogenic mechanisms where m6A exerts influences on disease through gene expression/protein regulation.© 2024.

38679724,Differences in DNA methylation status explain phenotypic variability in patients with 5p- syndrome.,BMC Res Notes,"Cri Du Chat syndrome, or 5p- syndrome, is characterized by a terminal or interstitial deletion on the short arm of chromosome 5 that causes variable clinical manifestations, including high-pitched cry in newborns, delayed growth, and global development. Different cytogenomic rearrangements, family history, and environmental factors may hinder the genotype-phenotype association. Thus, the phenotypic variability of this syndrome may not be limited only to variations in gene structure, such as deletions and duplications. It is possible that other mechanisms related to the activation or inactivation of promoters and/or exons of actively transcribed genes, such as DNA methylation are involved. Therefore, we studied the genome-wide methylation status profile of peripheral blood samples from fifteen patients with Cri du Chat Syndrome and nine control samples through the array method to look for Differentially Methylated Regions. We found that Differentially Methylated Regions outside the 5p region are mainly associated with regulating gene transcription, splicing, and chromatin remodeling. Most biological pathways are related to transcription, histone and chromatin binding, spliceosome and ribosomal complex, and RNA processing. Our results suggest that changes in the 5p region can cause an imbalance in other chromosomal regions capable of affecting gene modulation and thus explain the phenotypic differences in patients with 5p-.© 2024.

38676941,Simultaneous profiling of chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation in complete plant genomes using long-read sequencing.,Nucleic Acids Res,"Epigenetic regulations, including chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning and DNA methylation intricately shape genome function. However, current chromatin profiling techniques relying on short-read sequencing technologies fail to characterise highly repetitive genomic regions and cannot detect multiple chromatin features simultaneously. Here, we performed Simultaneous Accessibility and DNA Methylation Sequencing (SAM-seq) of purified plant nuclei. Thanks to the use of long-read nanopore sequencing, SAM-seq enables high-resolution profiling of m6A-tagged chromatin accessibility together with endogenous cytosine methylation in plants. Analysis of naked genomic DNA revealed significant sequence preference biases of m6A-MTases, controllable through a normalisation step. By applying SAM-seq to Arabidopsis and maize nuclei we obtained fine-grained accessibility and DNA methylation landscapes genome-wide. We uncovered crosstalk between chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation within nucleosomes of genes, TEs, and centromeric repeats. SAM-seq also detects DNA footprints over cis-regulatory regions. Furthermore, using the single-molecule information provided by SAM-seq we identified extensive cellular heterogeneity at chromatin domains with antagonistic chromatin marks, suggesting that bivalency reflects cell-specific regulations. SAM-seq is a powerful approach to simultaneously study multiple epigenetic features over unique and repetitive sequences, opening new opportunities for the investigation of epigenetic mechanisms.© The Author(s) 2024.

38671530,Reinforcement of repressive marks in the chicken primordial germ cell epigenetic signature: divergence from basal state resetting in mammals.,Epigenetics Chromatin,"In mammals, primordial germ cells (PGCs), the embryonic precursors of the germline, arise from embryonic or extra-embryonic cells upon induction by the surrounding tissues during gastrulation, according to mechanisms which are elucidated in mice but remain controversial in primates. They undergo genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming, consisting of extensive DNA demethylation and histone post-translational modification (PTM) changes, toward a basal, euchromatinized state. In contrast, chicken PGCs are specified by preformation before gastrulation based on maternally-inherited factors. They can be isolated from the bloodstream during their migration to the genital ridges. Our prior research highlighted differences in the global epigenetic profile of cultured chicken PGCs compared with chicken somatic cells and mammalian PGCs. This study investigates the acquisition and evolution of this profile during development.Quantitative analysis of global DNA methylation and histone PTMs, including their distribution, during key stages of chicken early development revealed divergent PGC epigenetic changes compared with mammals. Unlike mammalian PGCs, chicken PGCs do not undergo genome-wide DNA demethylation or exhibit a decrease in histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation. However, chicken PGCs show 5‑hydroxymethylcytosine loss, macroH2A redistribution, and chromatin decompaction, mirroring mammalian processes. Chicken PGCs initiate their epigenetic signature during migration, progressively accumulating high global levels of H3K9me3, with preferential enrichment in inactive genome regions. Despite apparent global chromatin decompaction, abundant heterochromatin marks, including repressive histone PTMs, HP1 variants, and DNA methylation, persists in chicken PGCs, contrasting with mammalian PGCs.Chicken PGCs' epigenetic signature does not align with the basal chromatin state observed in mammals, suggesting a departure from extensive epigenetic reprogramming. Despite disparities in early PGC development, the persistence of several epigenetic features shared with mammals implies their involvement in chromatin-regulated germ cell properties, with the distinctive elevation of chicken-specific H3K9me3 potentially participating in these processes.© 2024.

38671229,Combinatorial quantification of 5mC and 5hmC at individual CpG dyads and the transcriptome in single cells reveals modulators of DNA methylation maintenance fidelity.,Nat Struct Mol Biol,"Inheritance of 5-methylcytosine from one cell generation to the next by DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) plays a key role in regulating cellular identity. While recent work has shown that the activity of DNMT1 is imprecise, it remains unclear how the fidelity of DNMT1 is tuned in different genomic and cell state contexts. Here we describe Dyad-seq, a method to quantify the genome-wide methylation status of cytosines at the resolution of individual CpG dinucleotides to find that the fidelity of DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation is related to the local density of DNA methylation and the landscape of histone modifications. To gain deeper insights into methylation/demethylation turnover dynamics, we first extended Dyad-seq to quantify all combinations of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at individual CpG dyads. Next, to understand how cell state transitions impact maintenance methylation, we scaled the method down to jointly profile genome-wide methylation levels, maintenance methylation fidelity and the transcriptome from single cells (scDyad&T-seq). Using scDyad&T-seq, we demonstrate that, while distinct cell states can substantially impact the activity of the maintenance methylation machinery, locally there exists an intrinsic relationship between DNA methylation density, histone modifications and DNMT1-mediated maintenance methylation fidelity that is independent of cell state.© 2024.

38670415,Multi-omics data integration and drug screening of AML cancer using Generative Adversarial Network.,Methods,"In the era of precision medicine, accurate disease phenotype prediction for heterogeneous diseases, such as cancer, is emerging due to advanced technologies that link genotypes and phenotypes. However, it is difficult to integrate different types of biological data because they are so varied. In this study, we focused on predicting the traits of a blood cancer called Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) by combining different kinds of biological data. We used a recently developed method called Omics Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to better classify cancer outcomes. The primary advantages of a GAN include its ability to create synthetic data that is nearly indistinguishable from real data, its high flexibility, and its wide range of applications, including multi-omics data analysis. In addition, the GAN was effective at combining two types of biological data. We created synthetic datasets for gene activity and DNA methylation. Our method was more accurate in predicting disease traits than using the original data alone. The experimental results provided evidence that the creation of synthetic data through interacting multi-omics data analysis using GANs improves the overall prediction quality. Furthermore, we identified the top-ranked significant genes through statistical methods and pinpointed potential candidate drug agents through in-silico studies. The proposed drugs, also supported by other independent studies, might play a crucial role in the treatment of AML cancer.

38669938,Lithium response in bipolar disorder: Epigenome-wide DNA methylation signatures and epigenetic aging.,Eur Neuropsychopharmacol,"Lithium (Li) is the first-line treatment for bipolar disorder (BD) even though only 30 % of BD patients are considered excellent responders. The mechanisms by which Li exerts its action are not clearly understood, but it has been suggested that specific epigenetic mechanisms, such as methylation processes, may play a role. In this regard, DNA methylation patterns can be used to estimate epigenetic age (EpiAge), which is accelerated in BD patients and reversed by Li treatment. Our first aim was to compare the DNA methylation profile in peripheral blood between BD patients categorized as excellent responders to Li (Ex-Rp) and non-responders (N-Rp). Secondly, EpiAge was estimated to detect differential age acceleration between the two groups. A total of 130 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and 16 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between Ex-Rp (n = 26) and N-Rp (n = 37) were identified (FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05). We found 122 genes mapping the DMPs and DMRs, nine of which (HOXB6, HOXB3, HOXB-AS3, TENM2, CACNA1B, ANK3, EEF2K, CYP1A1, and SORCS2) had previously been linked to Li response. We found genes related to the GSK3β pathway to be highly represented. Using FUMA, we found enrichment in Gene Ontology Cell Component for the synapse. Gene network analysis highlighted functions related to the cell cycle, nervous system development and function, and gene expression. No significant differences in age acceleration were found between Ex-Rp and N-Rp for any of the epigenetic clocks analysed. Our findings indicate that a specific methylation pattern could determine the response to Li in BD patients. We also found that a significant portion of the differentially methylated genes are closely associated with the GSK3β pathway, reinforcing the role of this system in Li response. Future longitudinal studies with larger samples will help to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying Li response.Copyright © 2024. Published by Elsevier B.V.",1.2791515416177605e-16
38668807,"Histone H2B lysine 122 and lysine 130, as the putative targets of Penicillium oxalicum LaeA, play important roles in asexual development, expression of secondary metabolite gene clusters, and extracellular glycoside hydrolase synthesis.",World J Microbiol Biotechnol,"Core histones in the nucleosome are subject to a wide variety of posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and acetylation, all of which are crucial in shaping the structure of the chromatin and the expression of the target genes. A putative histone methyltransferase LaeA/Lae1, which is conserved in numerous filamentous fungi, functions as a global regulator of fungal growth, virulence, secondary metabolite formation, and the production of extracellular glycoside hydrolases (GHs). LaeA's direct histone targets, however, were not yet recognized. Previous research has shown that LaeA interacts with core histone H2B. Using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as a methyl group donor and recombinant human histone H2B as the substrate, it was found that Penicillium oxalicum LaeA can transfer the methyl groups to the C-terminal lysine (K) 108 and K116 residues in vitro. The H2BK108 and H2BK116 sites on recombinant histone correspond to P. oxalicum H2BK122 and H2BK130, respectively. H2BK122Aand H2BK130A, two mutants with histone H2B K122 or K130 mutation to alanine (A), were constructed in P. oxalicum. The mutants H2BK122Aand H2BK130Ademonstrated altered asexual development and decreased extracellular GH production, consistent with the findings of the laeA gene deletion strain (ΔlaeA). The transcriptome data showed that when compared to wild-type (WT) of P. oxalicum, 38 of the 47 differentially expressed (fold change ≥ 2, FDR ≤ 0.05) genes that encode extracellular GHs showed the same expression pattern in the three mutants ΔlaeA, H2BK122A, and H2BK130A. The four secondary metabolic gene clusters that considerably decreased expression in ΔlaeA also significantly decreased in H2BK122Aor H2BK130A. The chromatin of promotor regions of the key cellulolytic genes cel7A/cbh1 and cel7B/eg1 compacted in the ΔlaeA, H2BK122A, and H2BK130Amutants, according to the results of chromatin accessibility real-time PCR (CHART-PCR). The chromatin accessibility index dropped. The histone binding pocket of the LaeA-methyltransf_23 domain is compatible with particular histone H2B peptides, providing appropriate electrostatic and steric compatibility to stabilize these peptides, according to molecular docking. The findings of the study demonstrate that H2BK122 and H2BK130, which are histone targets of P. oxalicum LaeA in vitro, are crucial for fungal conidiation, the expression of gene clusters encoding secondary metabolites, and the production of extracellular GHs.© 2024.

38668455,Perfluorooctanesulfonic Acid Alters Pro-Cancer Phenotypes and Metabolic and Transcriptional Signatures in Testicular Germ Cell Tumors.,Toxics,"The potential effects of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a recently emergent human and environmental health concern. There is a consistent link between PFAS exposure and cancer, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Although epidemiological evidence supporting PFAS exposure and cancer in general is conflicting, there is relatively strong evidence linking PFAS and testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs). However, no mechanistic studies have been performed to date concerning PFAS and TGCTs. In this report, the effects of the legacy PFAS perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and the newer ""clean energy"" PFAS lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSi, called HQ-115), on the tumorigenicity of TGCTs in mice, TGCT cell survival, and metabolite production, as well as gene regulation were investigated. In vitro, the proliferation and survival of both chemo-sensitive and -resistant TGCT cells were minimally affected by a wide range of PFOS and HQ-115 concentrations. However, both chemicals promoted the growth of TGCT cells in mouse xenografts at doses consistent with human exposure but induced minimal acute toxicity, as assessed by total body, kidney, and testis weight. PFOS, but not HQ-115, increased liver weight. Transcriptomic alterations of PFOS-exposed normal mouse testes were dominated by cancer-related pathways and gene expression alterations associated with the H3K27me3 polycomb pathway and DNA methylation, epigenetic pathways that were previously showed to be critical for the survival of TGCT cells after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Similar patterns of PFOS-mediated gene expression occurred in PFOS-exposed cells in vitro. Metabolomic studies revealed that PFOS also altered metabolites associated with steroid biosynthesis and fatty acid metabolism in TGCT cells, consistent with the proposed ability of PFAS to mimic fatty acid-based ligands controlling lipid metabolism and the proposed role of PFAS as endocrine disrupters. Our data, is the first cell and animal based study on PFAS in TGCTs, support a pro-tumorigenic effect of PFAS on TGCT biology and suggests epigenetic, metabolic, and endocrine disruption as potential mechanisms of action that are consistent with the non-mutagenic nature of the PFAS class.",8.622293398447327e-44
38664746,xWAS analysis in neuropsychiatric disorders by integrating multi-molecular phenotype quantitative trait loci and GWAS summary data.,J Transl Med,"Integrating quantitative trait loci (QTL) data related to molecular phenotypes with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data is an important post-GWAS strategic approach employed to identify disease-associated molecular features. Various types of molecular phenotypes have been investigated in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, these findings pertaining to distinct molecular features are often independent of each other, posing challenges for having an overview of the mapped genes.In this study, we comprehensively summarized published analyses focusing on four types of risk-related molecular features (gene expression, splicing transcriptome, protein abundance, and DNA methylation) across five common neuropsychiatric disorders. Subsequently, we conducted supplementary analyses with the latest GWAS dataset and corresponding deficient molecular phenotypes using Functional Summary-based Imputation (FUSION) and summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). Based on the curated and supplemented results, novel reliable genes and their functions were explored.Our findings revealed that eQTL exhibited superior ability in prioritizing risk genes compared to the other QTL, followed by sQTL. Approximately half of the genes associated with splicing transcriptome, protein abundance, and DNA methylation were successfully replicated by eQTL-associated genes across all five disorders. Furthermore, we identified 436 novel reliable genes, which enriched in pathways related with neurotransmitter transportation such as synaptic, dendrite, vesicles, axon along with correlations with other neuropsychiatric disorders. Finally, we identified ten multiple molecular involved regulation patterns (MMRP), which may provide valuable insights into understanding the contribution of molecular regulation network targeting these disease-associated genes.The analyses prioritized novel and reliable gene sets related with five molecular features based on published and supplementary results for five common neuropsychiatric disorders, which were missed in the original GWAS analysis. Besides, the involved MMRP behind these genes could be given priority for further investigation to elucidate the pathogenic molecular mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders in future studies.© 2024.

38663907,The association between neighborhood deprivation and DNA methylation in an autopsy cohort.,Aging (Albany NY),"Previous research has found that living in a disadvantaged neighborhood is associated with poor health outcomes. Living in disadvantaged neighborhoods may alter inflammation and immune response in the body, which could be reflected in epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation (DNAm). We used robust linear regression models to conduct an epigenome-wide association study examining the association between neighborhood deprivation (Area Deprivation Index; ADI), and DNAm in brain tissue from 159 donors enrolled in the Emory Goizueta Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Georgia, USA). We found one CpG site (cg26514961, genePLXNC1) significantly associated with ADI after controlling for covariates and multiple testing (p-value=5.0e-8). Effect modification byAPOEε4 was statistically significant for the top ten CpG sites from the EWAS of ADI, indicating that the observed associations between ADI and DNAm were mainly driven by donors who carried at least oneAPOEε4 allele. Four of the top ten CpG sites showed a significant concordance between brain tissue and tissues that are easily accessible in living individuals (blood, buccal cells, saliva), including DNAm in cg26514961 (PLXNC1). Our study identified one CpG site (cg26514961,PLXNC1gene) that was significantly associated with neighborhood deprivation in brain tissue.PLXNC1is related to immune response, which may be one biological pathway how neighborhood conditions affect health. The concordance between brain and other tissues for our top CpG sites could make them potential candidates for biomarkers in living individuals.",0.9999999999971825
38663690,Genome-wide identification and analysis of DEAD-box RNA helicases in Gossypium hirsutum.,Gene,"DEAD-box RNA helicases, a prominent subfamily within the RNA helicase superfamily 2 (SF2), play crucial roles in the growth, development, and abiotic stress responses of plants. This study identifies 146 DEAD-box RNA helicase genes (GhDEADs) and categorizes them into four Clades (Clade A-D) through phylogenetic analysis. Promoter analysis reveals cis-acting elements linked to plant responses to light, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), abscisic acid (ABA), low temperature, and drought. RNA-seq data demonstrate that Clade C GhDEADs exhibit elevated and ubiquitous expression across different tissues, validating their connection to leaf development through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. Notably, over half of GhDEADs display up-regulation in the leaves of virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) plants of GhVIR-A/D (members of m6A methyltransferase complex, which regulate leaf morphogenesis). In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive insight into GhDEADs, emphasizing their potential involvement in leaf development.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

38662722,Chromodomain mutation in S. pombe Kat5/Mst1 affects centromere dynamics and DNA repair.,PLoS One,"KAT5 (S. pombe Mst1, human TIP60) is a MYST family histone acetyltransferase conserved from yeast to humans that is involved in multiple cellular activities. This family is characterized in part by containing a chromodomain, a motif associated with binding methylated histones. We show that a chromodomain mutation in the S. pombe Kat5, mst1-W66R, has defects in pericentromere silencing. mst1-W66R is sensitive to camptothecin (CPT) but only at an increased temperature of 36°C, although it is proficient for growth at this temperature. We also describe a de-silencing effect at the pericentromere by CPT that is independent of RNAi and methylation machinery. We also show that mst1-W66R disrupts recruitment of proteins to repair foci in response to camptothecin-induced DNA damage. Our data suggest a function of Mst1 chromodomain in centromere heterochromatin formation and a separate role in genome-wide damage repair in CPT.Copyright: © 2024 Li et al.

38661228,Associations of Heavy Metals with Cognitive Function: An Epigenome-Wide View of DNA Methylation and Mediation Analysis.,Ann Neurol,"Exposure to heavy metals has been reported to be associated with impaired cognitive function, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This pilot study aimed to identify key heavy metal elements associated with cognitive function and further explore the potential mediating role of metal-related DNA methylation.Blood levels of arsenic, cadmium, lead, copper, manganese, and zinc and genome-wide DNA methylations were separately detected in peripheral blood in 155 older adults. Cognitive function was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalized regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression were used to identify metals associated with cognitive function. An epigenome-wide association study examined the DNA methylation profile of the identified metal, and mediation analysis investigated its mediating role.The MMSE scores showed a significant decrease of 1.61 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.64, -0.59) with each 1 standard deviation increase in ln-transformed arsenic level; this association was significant in multiple-metal models and dominated the overall negative effect of 6 heavy metal mixture on cognitive function. Seventy-three differentially methylated positions were associated with blood arsenic (p < 1.0 × 10-5). The methylation levels at cg05226051 (annotated to TDRD3) and cg18886932 (annotated to GAL3ST3) mediated 24.8% and 25.5% of the association between blood arsenic and cognitive function, respectively (all p < 0.05).Blood arsenic levels displayed a negative association with the cognitive function of older adults. This finding shows that arsenic-related DNA methylation alterations are critical partial mediators that may serve as potential biomarkers for further mechanism-related studies.

38660759,Methylation profiles at birth linked to early childhood obesity.,J Dev Orig Health Dis,"Childhood obesity represents a significant global health concern and identifying its risk factors is crucial for developing intervention programs. Many ""omics"" factors associated with the risk of developing obesity have been identified, including genomic, microbiomic, and epigenomic factors. Here, using a sample of 48 infants, we investigated how the methylation profiles in cord blood and placenta at birth were associated with weight outcomes (specifically, conditional weight gain, body mass index, and weight-for-length ratio) at age six months. We characterized genome-wide DNA methylation profiles using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEpic chip, and incorporated information on child and maternal health, and various environmental factors into the analysis. We used regression analysis to identify genes with methylation profiles most predictive of infant weight outcomes, finding a total of 23 relevant genes in cord blood and 10 in placenta. Notably, in cord blood, the methylation profiles of three genes (PLIN4, UBE2F, and PPP1R16B) were associated with all three weight outcomes, which are also associated with weight outcomes in an independent cohort suggesting a strong relationship with weight trajectories in the first six months after birth. Additionally, we developed a Methylation Risk Score (MRS) that could be used to identify children most at risk for developing childhood obesity. While many of the genes identified by our analysis have been associated with weight-related traits (e.g., glucose metabolism, BMI, or hip-to-waist ratio) in previous genome-wide association and variant studies, our analysis implicated several others, whose involvement in the obesity phenotype should be evaluated in future functional investigations.",0.9999947727937487
38656449,Association of Cadherin-Related Family Member 1 with Traumatic Brain Injury.,Cell Mol Neurobiol,"The cadherin family plays a pivotal role in orchestrating synapse formation in the central nervous system. Cadherin-related family member 1 (CDHR1) is a photoreceptor-specific calmodulin belonging to the expansive cadherin superfamily. However, its role in traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains largely unknown. CDHR1 expression across various brain tissue sites was analyzed using the GSE104687 dataset. Employing a summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) approach, integrated analyses were performed by amalgamating genome-wide association study abstracts from TBI with public data on expressed quantitative trait loci and DNA methylation QTL from both blood and diverse brain tissues. CDHR1 expression and localization in different brain tissues were meticulously delineated using western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CDHR1 expression was consistently elevated in the TBI group compared to that in the sham group across multiple tissues. The inflammatory response emerged as a crucial biological mechanism, and pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors were not expressed in either group. Integrated SMR analyses encompassing both blood and brain tissues substantiated the heightened CDHR1 expression profiles, with methylation modifications emerging as potential contributing factors for increased TBI risk. This was corroborated by western blotting and immunohistochemistry, confirming augmented CDHR1 expression following TBI. This multi-omics-based genetic association study highlights the elevated TBI risk associated with CDHR1 expression coupled with putative methylation modifications. These findings provide compelling evidence for future targeted investigations and offer promising avenues for developing interventional therapies for TBI.© 2024.

38654405,Developmental epigenomic effects of maternal financial problems.,Dev Psychopathol,"Early-life adversity as neglect or low socioeconomic status is associated with negative physical/mental health outcomes and plays an important role in health trajectories through life. The early-life environment has been shown to be encoded as changes in epigenetic markers that are retained for many years.We investigated the effect of maternal major financial problems (MFP) and material deprivation (MD) on their children's epigenome in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Epigenetic aging, measured with epigenetic clocks, was weakly accelerated with increased MFP. In subsequent EWAS, MFP, and MD showed strong, independent programing effects on children's genomes. MFP in the period from birth to age seven was associated with genome-wide epigenetic modifications on children's genome visible at age 7 and partially remaining at age 15.These results support the hypothesis that physiological processes at least partially explain associations between early-life adversity and health problems later in life. Both maternal stressors (MFP/MD) had similar effects on biological pathways, providing preliminary evidence for the mechanisms underlying the effects of low socioeconomic status in early life and disease outcomes later in life. Understanding these associations is essential to explain disease susceptibility, overall life trajectories and the transition from health to disease.",0.999999045779728
38653019,Genome-wide DNA methylation changes in Oryzias melastigma embryos exposed to the water accommodated fraction of crude oil.,Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,"The water accommodated fraction (WAF) of crude oil exerts considerable impacts on marine fish during embryonic stage. Clarifying changes in epigenetic modifications is helpful for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the toxicity of embryonic WAF exposure. The aim of this study was to explore genome-wide DNA methylation changes in Oryzias melastigma embryos after exposure to the nominal total petroleum hydrocarbon concentration of 500 μg/L in WAF for 7 days. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed that 8.47 % and 8.46 % of all the genomic C sites were methylated in the control and WAF-exposed groups, respectively. Among the three sequence contexts, methylated CG site had the largest number in both the two groups. The sequence preferences of nearby methylated cytosines were consistent between the two groups. A total of 4798 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified in the promoter region. Furthermore, Gene Ontology analysis revealed that DMR-related genes were enriched mainly for functions related to development and nervous system. Additionally, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways enriched in DMR-related genes were related to nervous system and endocrine system. These novel findings provide comprehensive insights into the genome-wide DNA methylation landscape of O. melastigma following embryonic WAF exposure, shedding light on the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying WAF-induced toxicity.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

We aimed to uncover aspects of AD's pathogenesis that may contribute to drug repurposing efforts by integrating DNA methylation and genetic data. Implementing the network-based tool, a dense module search of genome-wide association studies (dmGWAS), we integrated a large-scale GWAS dataset with DNA methylation data to identify gene network modules associated with AD. Our analysis yielded 286 significant gene network modules. Notably, the foremost module included the BIN1 gene, showing the largest GWAS signal, and the GNAS gene, the most significantly hypermethylated. We conducted Web-based Cell-type-Specific Enrichment Analysis (WebCSEA) on genes within the top 10% of dmGWAS modules, highlighting monocyte as the most significant cell type (p< 5 × 10-12). Functional enrichment analysis revealed Gene Ontology Biological Process terms relevant to AD pathology (adjustedp< 0.05). Additionally, drug target enrichment identified five FDA-approved targets (p-value = 0.03) for further research. In summary, dmGWAS integration of genetic and epigenetic signals unveiled new gene interactions related to AD, offering promising avenues for future studies.",2.315750894832227e-18
38650309,Leveraging DNA methylation to predict treatment response in major depressive disorder: A critical review.,Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating and prevalent mental disorder with a high disease burden. Despite a wide array of different treatment options, many patients do not respond to initial treatment attempts. Selection of the most appropriate treatment remains a significant clinical challenge in psychiatry, highlighting the need for the development of biomarkers with predictive utility. Recently, the epigenetic modification DNA methylation (DNAm) has emerged to be of great interest as a potential predictor of MDD treatment outcomes. Here, we review efforts to date that seek to identify DNAm signatures associated with treatment response in individuals with MDD. Searches were conducted in the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science with the concepts and keywords MDD, DNAm, antidepressants, psychotherapy, cognitive behavior therapy, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and brain stimulation therapies. We identified 32 studies implicating DNAm patterns associated with MDD treatment outcomes. The majority of studies (N = 25) are focused on selected target genes exploring treatment outcomes in pharmacological treatments (N = 22) with a few studies assessing treatment response to electroconvulsive therapy (N = 3). Additionally, there are few genome-scale efforts (N = 7) to characterize DNAm patterns associated with treatment outcomes. There is a relative dearth of studies investigating DNAm patterns in relation to psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, or transcranial magnetic stimulation; importantly, most existing studies have limited sample sizes. Given the heterogeneity in both methods and results of studies to date, there is a need for additional studies before existing findings can inform clinical decisions.© 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",6.891345240880734e-20
38650040,"Clinical, pathologic, and genomic characteristics of two pediatric glioneuronal tumors with a CLIP2::MET fusion.",Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Integration of molecular data with histologic, radiologic, and clinical features is imperative for accurate diagnosis of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNAseq), a genome-wide and non-targeted approach, allows for the detection of novel or rare oncogenic fusion events that contribute to the tumorigenesis of a substantial portion of pediatric low- and high-grade glial and glioneuronal tumors. We present two cases of pediatric glioneuronal tumors occurring in the occipital region with a CLIP2::MET fusion detected by RNAseq. Chromosomal microarray studies revealed copy number alterations involving chromosomes 1, 7, and 22 in both tumors, with Case 2 having an interstitial deletion breakpoint in the CLIP2 gene. By methylation profiling, neither tumor had a match result, but both clustered with the low-grade glial/glioneuronal tumors in the UMAP. Histologically, in both instances, our cases displayed characteristics of a low-grade tumor, notably the absence of mitotic activity, low Ki-67 labeling index and the lack of necrosis and microvascular proliferation. Glial and neuronal markers were positive for both tumors. Clinically, both patients achieved clinical stability post-tumor resection and remain under regular surveillance imaging without adjuvant therapy at the last follow-up, 6 months and 3 years, respectively. This is the first case report demonstrating the presence of a CLIP2::MET fusion in two pediatric low-grade glioneuronal tumors (GNT). Conservative clinical management may be considered for patients with GNT and CLIP2:MET fusion in the context of histologically low-grade features.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.96022700879477e-49

Epigenetics might provide insight on its molecular mechanisms. We aimed to analyze the association between differential DNA methylation (DNAm) and development of vasospasm. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study in 282 patients with aSAH admitted to our hospital. DNAm was assessed with the EPIC Illumina chip (> 850 K CpG sites) in whole-blood samples collected at hospital admission. We identified differentially methylated positions (DMPs) at the CpG level using Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders, and then we used the DMP results to find differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and enriched biological pathways. A total of 145 patients (51%) experienced vasospasm. In the DMP analysis, we identified 31 CpGs associated with vasospasm at p-value < 10-5. One of them (cg26189827) was significant at the genome-wide level (p-value < 10-8), being hypermethylated in patients with vasospasm and annotated to SUGCT gene, mainly expressed in arteries. Region analysis revealed 13 DMRs, some of them annotated to interesting genes such as POU5F1, HLA-DPA1, RUFY1, and CYP1A1. Functional enrichment analysis showed the involvement of biological processes related to immunity, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, endothelial nitric oxide, and apoptosis. Our findings show, for the first time, a distinctive epigenetic signature of vasospasm in aSAH, establishing novel links with essential biological pathways, including inflammation, immune responses, and oxidative stress. Although further validation is required, our results provide a foundation for future research into the complex pathophysiology of vasospasm.© 2024.

38649436,Mediation role of DNA methylation in association between handgrip strength and cognitive function in monozygotic twins.,J Hum Genet,"Handgrip strength is a crucial indicator to monitor the change of cognitive function over time, but its mechanism still needs to be further explored. We sampled 59 monozygotic twin pairs to explore the potential mediating effect of DNA methylation (DNAm) on the association between handgrip strength and cognitive function. The initial step was the implementation of an epigenome-wide association analysis (EWAS) in the study participants, with the aim of identifying DNAm variations that are associated with handgrip strength. Following that, we conducted an assessment of the mediated effect of DNAm by the use of mediation analysis. In order to do an ontology enrichment study for CpGs, the GREAT program was used. There was a significant positive association between handgrip strength and cognitive function (β = 0.194, P < 0.001). The association between handgrip strength and DNAm of 124 CpGs was found to be statistically significant at a significance level of P < 1 × 10-4. Fifteen differentially methylated regions (DMRs) related to handgrip strength were found in genes such as SNTG2, KLB, CDH11, and PANX2. Of the 124 CpGs, 4 within KRBA1, and TRAK1 mediated the association between handgrip strength and cognitive function: each 1 kg increase in handgrip strength was associated with a potential decrease of 0.050 points in cognitive function scores, mediated by modifications in DNAm. The parallel mediating effect of these 4 CpGs was -0.081. The presence of DNAm variation associated with handgrip strength may play a mediated role in the association between handgrip strength and cognitive function.© 2024.

38647050,Genome-wide screening and functional validation of methylation barriers near promoters.,Nucleic Acids Res,"CpG islands near promoters are normally unmethylated despite being surrounded by densely methylated regions. Aberrant hypermethylation of these CpG islands has been associated with the development of various human diseases. Although local genetic elements have been speculated to play a role in protecting promoters from methylation, only a limited number of methylation barriers have been identified. In this study, we conducted an integrated computational and experimental investigation of colorectal cancer methylomes. Our study revealed 610 genes with disrupted methylation barriers. Genomic sequences of these barriers shared a common 41-bp sequence motif (MB-41) that displayed homology to the chicken HS4 methylation barrier. Using the CDKN2A (P16) tumor suppressor gene promoter, we validated the protective function of MB-41 and showed that loss of such protection led to aberrant hypermethylation. Our findings highlight a novel sequence signature of cis-acting methylation barriers in the human genome that safeguard promoters from silencing.© The Author(s) 2024.

38645113,Nitric oxide inhibits ten-eleven translocation DNA demethylases to regulate 5mC and 5hmC across the genome.,Res Sq,"DNA methylation at cytosine bases of eukaryotic DNA (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) is a heritable epigenetic mark that can regulate gene expression in health and disease. Enzymes that metabolize 5mC have been well-characterized, yet the discovery of endogenously produced signaling molecules that regulate DNA methyl-modifying machinery have not been described. Herein, we report that the free radical signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) can directly inhibit the Fe(II)/2-OG-dependent DNA demethylases ten-eleven translocation (TET) and human AlkB homolog 2 (ALKBH2). Physiologic NO concentrations reversibly inhibited TET and ALKBH2 demethylase activity by binding to the mononuclear non-heme iron atom which formed a dinitrosyliron complex (DNIC) preventing cosubstrates (2-OG and O2) from binding. In cancer cells treated with exogenous NO, or cells endogenously synthesizing NO, there was a global increase in 5mC and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in DNA, the substrates for TET, that could not be attributed to increased DNA methyltransferase activity. 5mC was also elevated in NO-producing cell-line-derived mouse xenograft and patient-derived xenograft tumors. Genome-wide DNA methylome analysis of cells chronically treated with NO (10 days) demonstrated enrichment of 5mC and 5hmC at gene-regulatory loci which correlated to changes in the expression of NO-regulated tumor-associated genes. Regulation of DNA methylation is distinctly different from canonical NO signaling and represents a novel epigenetic role for NO.",1.0861489927726897e-37

They are also more likely to develop chronic respiratory diseases in later childhood. This study investigated the feasibility of epigenetic profiling to reveal endotype-specific molecular pathways with potential for early identification and immuno-modulation. Peripharal immune cells from respiratory infection allergy/asthma prone (IAP) infants were retrospectively selected for genome-wide DNA methylation and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. The IAP infants were enriched for the low vaccine responsiveness (LVR) phenotype (Fishers Exact p-value = 0.01).An endotype signature of 813 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) comprising 238 lead CpG associations (FDR < 0.05) emerged, implicating pathways related to asthma, mucin production, antigen presentation and inflammasome activation. Allelic variation explained only a minor portion of this signature.

38640971,The association analysis of DNA methylation and transcriptomics identified BpCYCD3;2 as a participant in influencing cell division in autotetraploid birch (Betula pendula) leaves.,Plant Sci,"Polyploidization plays a crucial role in plant breeding and genetic improvement. Although the phenomenon of polyploidization affecting the area and number of plant epidermal pavement cells is well described, the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon is still largely unknown. In this study, we found that the leaves of autotetraploid birch (Betula pendula) stopped cell division earlier and had a larger cell area. In addition, compared to diploids, tetraploids have a smaller stomatal density and fewer stomatal numbers. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed no significant difference in global DNA methylation levels between diploids and tetraploids. A total of 9154 differential methylation regions (DMRs) were identified between diploids and tetraploids, with CHH-type DMRs accounting for 91.73% of all types of DMRs. Further research has found that there are a total of 2105 differentially methylated genes (DMEGs) with CHH-type DMRs in birch. The GO functional enrichment results of DMEGs showed that differentially methylated genes were mainly involved in terms such as cellular process and metabolic process. The analysis of differentially methylated genes and differentially expressed genes suggests that hyper-methylation in the promoter region may inhibit the gene expression level of BpCYCD3;2 in tetraploids. To investigate the function of BpCYCD3;2 in birch, we obtained overexpression and repressed expression lines of BpCYCD3;2 through genetic transformation. The morphogenesis of both BpCYCD3;2-OE and BpCYCD3;2-RE lines was not affected. However, low expression of BpCYCD3;2 can lead to inhibition of cell division in leaves, and this inhibition of cell proliferation can be compensated for by an increase in cell size. Additionally, we found that the number and density of stomata in the BpCYCD3;2-RE lines were significantly reduced, consistent with the tetraploid. These data indicate that changes in cell division ability and stomatal changes in tetraploid birch can be partially attributed to low expression of the BpCYCD3;2 gene, which may be related to hyper-methylation in its promoter region. These results will provide new insights into the mechanism by which polyploidization affects plant development.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1.7172349405851327e-43

All patients exhibit heterozygous de novo nonsense or frameshift stop mutations in the Activity-Dependent Neuroprotective Protein (ADNP) gene, accounting for a prevalence of 0.2% of all autism cases worldwide. ADNP fulfills an essential chromatin remodeling function during brain development. In this study, we investigated the cerebellum of a died 6-year-old male patient with the c.1676dupA/p.His559Glnfs*3 ADNP mutation.The clinical presentation of the patient was representative of the Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome. During his lifespan, he underwent two liver transplantations after which the child died because of multiple organ failure. An autopsy was performed, and various tissue samples were taken for further analysis. We performed a molecular characterization of the cerebellum, a brain region involved in motor coordination, known for its highest ADNP expression and compared it to an age-matched control subject. Importantly, epigenome-wide analysis of the ADNP cerebellum identified CpG methylation differences and expression of multiple pathways causing neurodevelopmental delay. Interestingly, transcription factor motif enrichment analysis of differentially methylated genes showed that the ADNP binding motif was the most significantly enriched. RNA sequencing of the autopsy brain further identified downregulation of the WNT signaling pathway and autophagy defects as possible causes of neurodevelopmental delay. Ultimately, label-free quantification mass spectrometry identified differentially expressed proteins involved in mitochondrial stress and sirtuin signaling pathways amongst others. Protein-protein interaction analysis further revealed a network including chromatin remodelers (ADNP, SMARCC2, HDAC2 and YY1), autophagy-related proteins (LAMP1, BECN1 and LC3) as well as a key histone deacetylating enzyme SIRT1, involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism. The protein interaction of ADNP with SIRT1 was further biochemically validated through the microtubule-end binding proteins EB1/EB3 by direct co-immunoprecipitation in mouse cerebellum, suggesting important mito-epigenetic crosstalk between chromatin remodeling and mitochondrial energy metabolism linked to autophagy stress responses. This is further supported by mitochondrial activity assays and stainings in patient-derived fibroblasts which suggest mitochondrial dysfunctions in the ADNP deficient human brain.This study forms the baseline clinical and molecular characterization of an ADNP autopsy cerebellum, providing novel insights in the disease mechanisms of the Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome. By combining multi-omic and biochemical approaches, we identified a novel SIRT1-EB1/EB3-ADNP protein complex which may contribute to autophagic flux alterations and impaired mitochondrial metabolism in the Helsmoortel-Van der Aa syndrome and holds promise as a new therapeutic target.© 2024.

38634798,Examining chromatin heterogeneity through PacBio long-read sequencing of M.EcoGII methylated genomes: an m6A detection efficiency and calling bias correcting pipeline.,Nucleic Acids Res,"Recent studies have combined DNA methyltransferase footprinting of genomic DNA in nuclei with long-read sequencing, resulting in detailed chromatin maps for multi-kilobase stretches of genomic DNA from one cell. Theoretically, nucleosome footprints and nucleosome-depleted regions can be identified using M.EcoGII, which methylates adenines in any sequence context, providing a high-resolution map of accessible regions in each DNA molecule. Here, we report PacBio long-read sequence data for budding yeast nuclei treated with M.EcoGII and a bioinformatic pipeline which corrects for three key challenges undermining this promising method. First, detection of m6A in individual DNA molecules by the PacBio software is inefficient, resulting in false footprints predicted by random gaps of seemingly unmethylated adenines. Second, there is a strong bias against m6A base calling as AT content increases. Third, occasional methylation occurs within nucleosomes, breaking up their footprints. After correcting for these issues, our pipeline calculates a correlation coefficient-based score indicating the extent of chromatin heterogeneity within the cell population for every gene. Although the population average is consistent with that derived using other techniques, we observe a wide range of heterogeneity in nucleosome positions at the single-molecule level, probably reflecting cellular chromatin dynamics.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research 2024.",1.0857684792844285e-19
38634782,Climate-related naturally occurring epimutation and their roles in plant adaptation in A. thaliana.,Mol Ecol,"DNA methylation has been proposed to be an important mechanism that allows plants to respond to their environments sometimes entirely uncoupled from genetic variation. To understand the genetic basis, biological functions and climatic relationships of DNA methylation at a population scale in Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed a genome-wide association analysis with high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and found that ~56% on average, especially in the CHH sequence context (71%), of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are not tagged by SNPs. Among them, a total of 3235 DMRs are significantly associated with gene expressions and potentially heritable. 655 of the 3235 DMRs are associated with climatic variables, and we experimentally verified one of them, HEI10 (HUMAN ENHANCER OF CELL INVASION NO.10). Such epigenetic loci could be subjected to natural selection thereby affecting plant adaptation, and would be expected to be an indicator of accessions at risk. We therefore incorporated these climate-related DMRs into a gradient forest model, and found that the natural A. thaliana accessions in Southern Europe that may be most at risk under future climate change. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating DNA methylation that is independent of genetic variations, and climatic data to predict plants' vulnerability to future climate change.© 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",5.824119137419963e-34
38633133,Profiling genome-wide methylation in two maples: Fine-scale approaches to detection with nanopore technology.,Evol Appl,"DNA methylation is critical to the regulation of transposable elements and gene expression and can play an important role in the adaptation of stress response mechanisms in plants. Traditional methods of methylation quantification rely on bisulfite conversion that can compromise accuracy. Recent advances in long-read sequencing technologies allow for methylation detection in real time. The associated algorithms that interpret these modifications have evolved from strictly statistical approaches to Hidden Markov Models and, recently, deep learning approaches. Much of the existing software focuses on methylation in the CG context, but methylation in other contexts is important to quantify, as it is extensively leveraged in plants. Here, we present methylation profiles for two maple species across the full range of 5mC sequence contexts using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-reads. Hybrid and reference-guided assemblies were generated for two newAceraccessions:Acer negundo(box elder; 65x ONT and 111X Illumina) andAcer saccharum(sugar maple; 93x ONT and 148X Illumina). The ONT reads generated for these assemblies were re-basecalled, and methylation detection was conducted in a custom pipeline with the publishedAcerreferences (PacBio assemblies) and hybrid assemblies reported herein to generate four epigenomes. Examination of the transposable element landscape revealed the dominance ofLTR Copiaelements and patterns of methylation associated with different classes of TEs. Methylation distributions were examined at high resolution across gene and repeat density and described within the broader angiosperm context, and more narrowly in the context of gene family dynamics and candidate nutrient stress genes.© 2024 The Authors.

38627952,Genome-wide methylation landscape during somatic embryogenesis in Medicago truncatula reveals correlation between Tnt1 retrotransposition and hyperactive methylation regions.,Plant J,"Medicago truncatula is a model legume for fundamental research on legume biology and symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Tnt1, a retrotransposon from tobacco, was used to generate insertion mutants in M. truncatula R108. Approximately 21 000 insertion lines have been generated and publicly available. Tnt1 retro-transposition event occurs during somatic embryogenesis (SE), a pivotal process that triggers massive methylation changes. We studied the SE of M. truncatula R108 using leaf explants and explored the dynamic shifts in the methylation landscape from leaf explants to callus formation and finally embryogenesis. Higher cytosine methylation in all three contexts of CG, CHG, and CHH patterns was observed during SE compared to the controls. Higher methylation patterns were observed in assumed promoter regions (~2-kb upstream regions of transcription start site) of the genes, while lowest was recorded in the untranslated regions. Differentially methylated promoter region analysis showed a higher CHH methylation in embryogenesis tissue samples when compared to CG and CHG methylation. Strong correlation (89.71%) was identified between the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and the site of Tnt1 insertions in M. truncatula R108 and stronger hypermethylation of genes correlated with higher number of Tnt1 insertions in all contexts of CG, CHG, and CHH methylation. Gene ontology enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis identified genes and pathways enriched in the signal peptide processing, ATP hydrolysis, RNA polymerase activity, transport, secondary metabolites, and nitrogen metabolism pathways. Combined gene expression analysis and methylation profiling showed an inverse relationship between methylation in the DMRs (regions spanning genes) and the expression of genes. Our results show that a dynamic shift in methylation happens during the SE process in the context of CG, CHH and CHG methylation, and the Tnt1 retrotransposition correlates with the hyperactive methylation regions.© 2024 Society for Experimental Biology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2.311541005127868e-29
38627856,Comprehensive DNA methylation profiling by MeDIP-NGS identifies potential genes and pathways for epithelial ovarian cancer.,J Ovarian Res,"Ovarian cancer, among all gynecologic malignancies, exhibits the highest incidence and mortality rate, primarily because it is often presents with non-specific or no symptoms during its early stages. For the advancement of Ovarian Cancer Diagnosis, it is crucial to identify the potential molecular signatures that could significantly differentiate between healthy and ovarian cancerous tissues and can be used further as a diagnostic biomarker for detecting ovarian cancer. In this study, we investigated the genome-wide methylation patterns in ovarian cancer patients using Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP-Seq) followed by NGS. Identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were further validated by targeted bisulfite sequencing for CpG site-specific methylation profiles. Furthermore, expression validation of six genes by Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR was also performed. Out of total 120 differentially methylated genes (DMGs), 68 genes were hypermethylated, and 52 were hypomethylated in their promoter region. After analysis, we identified the top 6 hub genes, namely POLR3B, PLXND1, GIGYF2, STK4, BMP2 and CRKL. Interestingly we observed Non-CpG site methylation in the case of POLR3B and CRKL which was statistically significant in discriminating ovarian cancer samples from normal controls. The most significant pathways identified were focal adhesion, the MAPK signaling pathway, and the Ras signaling pathway. Expression analysis of hypermethylated genes was correlated with the downregulation of the genes. POLR3B and GIGYF2 turned out to be the novel genes associated with the carcinogenesis of EOC. Our study demonstrated that methylation profiling through MeDIP-sequencing has effectively identified six potential hub genes and pathways that might exacerbate our understanding of underlying molecular mechanisms of ovarian carcinogenesis.© 2024.

Many factors are involved in the etiology of tic disorders, and the genetic and epigenetic factors of tic disorders are considered complex and heterogeneous.: In this study, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between normal controls (n = 24; aged 6-15; 7 females) and patients with tic disorders (n = 16; aged 6-15; 5 females) were analyzed. We performed an epigenome-wide association study of tic disorders in Korean children. The tics were assessed using Yale Global Tic Severity Scale. The DNA methylation data consisted of 726,945 cytosine phosphate guanine (CpG) sites, assessed using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC (850k) BeadChip. The DNA methylation data of the 40 participants were retrieved, and DMRs between the four groups based on sex and tic disorder were identified. From 28 male and 16 female samples, 37 and 38 DMRs were identified, respectively. We analyzed the enriched terms and visualized the network, heatmap, and upset plot.: In male, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed hypomethylated patterns in the ligand, receptor, and second signal transductors of the PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathway (most cells were indicated as green color), and in female, the opposite patterns were revealed (most cells were indicated as red color). Five mental disorder-related enriched terms were identified in the network analysis.: Here, we provide insights into the epigenetic mechanisms of tic disorders.

38623319,Association between lipid-lowering drugs and allergic diseases: A Mendelian randomization study.,World Allergy Organ J,"Several observational studies suggest a possible link between lipid-lowering drugs and allergic diseases. However, inferring causality from these studies can be challenging due to issues such as bias, reverse causation, and residual confounding. To investigate the potential causal effect of lipid-lowering drugs, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors, on allergic diseases (allergic asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and allergic urticaria), we performed a Mendelian randomization (MR)-based study.We employed MR and summary-data-based MR (SMR), analyzing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from people of European descent. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were employed as instrumental variables. We selected 2 types of genetic measures to represent the impact of lipid-lowering drugs, including genetic variants near or within drug target genes correlated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and expression quantitative trait loci of drug target genes. The inverse-variance weighted (IVW)-MR approach was the primary utilized MR method, while sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of the results. We used SMR analysis as a supplementary analytical method, applying the heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) test to assess if the observed correlation between gene expression and outcome was due to a linkage situation.The IVW-MR analysis revealed significant evidence for an association between PCSK9-mediated LDL-C reduction and a decrease in the risk of allergic asthma (odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11-1.56; P < 0.01). Likewise, SMR analysis discovered an augmented expression of PCSK9 being linked with a heightened susceptibility to allergic asthma (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.03-1.43; P = 0.02). No consistent evidence was found for other associations in either analysis.Our findings support a potential causal relationship between PCSK9 activity and an increased risk of allergic asthma. Thus, PCSK9 inhibitors, which reduce PCSK9 activity, might be considered a priority in future clinical trials investigating drugs for allergic asthma prevention or treatment.© 2024 The Authors.",9.045148501975258e-38
38613866,Phosphoproteomic profiling identifies DNMT1 as a key substrate of beta IV spectrin-dependent ERK/MAPK signaling in suppressing angiogenesis.,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,"βIV-spectrin is a membrane-associated cytoskeletal protein that maintains the structural stability of cell membranes and integral proteins such as ion channels and transporters. Its biological functions are best characterized in the brain and heart, although recently we discovered a fundamental new role in the vascular system. Using cellular and genetic mouse models, we reported that βIV-spectrin acts as a critical regulator of developmental and tumor-associated angiogenesis. βIV-spectrin was shown to selectively express in proliferating endothelial cells (EC) and suppress VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling by enhancing receptor internalization and degradation. Here we examined how these events impact the downstream kinase signaling cascades and target substrates. Based on quantitative phosphoproteomics, we found that βIV-spectrin significantly affects the phosphorylation of epigenetic regulatory enzymes in the nucleus, among which DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was determined as a top substrate. Biochemical and immunofluorescence results showed that βIV-spectrin inhibits DNMT1 function by activating ERK/MAPK, which in turn phosphorylates DNMT1 at S717 to impede its nuclear localization. Given that DNMT1 controls the DNA methylation patterns genome-wide, and is crucial for vascular development, our findings suggest that epigenetic regulation is a key mechanism by which βIV-spectrin suppresses angiogenesis.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

38601260,An Epigenome-Wide Association Study of DNA Methylation and Proliferative Retinopathy over 28 Years in Type 1 Diabetes.,Ophthalmol Sci,"To perform a prospective epigenome-wide association study of DNA methylation (DNAm) and 28-year proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) incidence in type 1 diabetes (T1D).Prospective observational cohort study.The Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) study of childhood-onset (< 17 years) T1D.Stereoscopic fundus photographs were taken in fields 1, 2, and 4 at baseline, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 23, and 28 years after DNAm measurements. The photos were graded using the modified Airlie House System. In those free of PDR at baseline (n = 265; mean T1D duration of 18 years at baseline), whole blood DNAm (EPIC array) at 683 597 CpGs was analyzed in Cox models for time to event. Associations between significant CpGs and clinical risk factors were assessed; genetic variants associated with DNAm were identified (methylation quantitative trait loci [meQTLs]). Mendelian randomization was used to examine evidence of causal associations between DNAm and PDR. Post hoc regional and functional analyses were performed.Proliferative diabetic retinopathy was defined as the first instance of a grade of ≥ 60 in at least 1 eye or pan-retinal photocoagulation for PDR. Follow-up time was calculated from the study visit at which DNAm data were available (baseline) until PDR incidence or censoring (December 31, 2018 or last follow-up).PDR incidence was 53% over 28-years' follow-up. Greater DNAm of cg27512687 (KIF16B) was associated with reduced PDR incidence (P = 6.3 × 10-9; false discovery rate [FDR]: < 0.01); 113 cis-meQTLs (P < 5 × 10-8) were identified. Mendelian randomization analysis using the sentinel meQTL as the instrumental variable supported a potentially causal association between cg27512687 and PDR. Cg27512687 was also associated with lower pulse rate and albumin excretion rate and higher estimated glomerular filtration rate, but its association with PDR remained independently significant after adjustment for those factors. In regional analyses, DNAm ofFUT4,FKBP1A, andRIN2was also associated with PDR incidence.DNA methylation ofKIF16B, FUT4, FKBP1A, andRIN2was associated with PDR incidence, supporting roles for epigenetic regulation of iron clearance, developmental pathways, and autophagy in PDR pathogenesis. Further study of those loci may provide insight into novel targets for interventions to prevent or delay PDR in T1D.Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found in the Footnotes and Disclosures at the end of this article.© 2024 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",0.99999963219466

Their utilization in agriculture practices is being increased that is giving positive results. The purpose of the current study was to use plant-derived smoke (SMK) solution and biogas digestate (BGD) slurry as biostimulant to elucidate their impact on potato (Solanum tuberosum) performance. The experiment was conducted in lab as well as field conditions, and SMK and BGD solutions were prepared in varying concentrations such as SMK 1:500, SMK 1:250, BGD 50:50, and BGD 75:25. Foliar applications were performed thrice during experiments and data were collected related to photosynthesis, growth, pigments, and genome-wide methylation profiling. Net photosynthesis rate (A) and water use efficiency (WUE) were found higher in SMK- and BGD-treated lab and field grown plants. Among pigments, BGD-treated plants depicted higher levels of Chl a and Chl b while SMK-treated plants showed higher carotenoid levels. Alongside, enhancement in growth-related parameters like leaf number and dry weight was also observed in both lab- and field-treated plants. Furthermore, DNA methylation profile of SMK- and BGD-treated plants depicted variation compared to control. DNA methylation events increased in all the treatments compared to control except for SMK 1:500. These results indicate that smoke and slurry both act as efficient biostimulants which result in better performance of plants. Biostimulants also affected the genome-wide DNA methylation profile that resultantly might have changed the plant gene expression profiling and played its role in plant responsiveness to these biostimulants. However, there is need to elucidate a possible synergistic effect of SMK and BGD on plant growth along with gene expression profiling.",1.1005861162269852e-42
38600622,Epigenetic/circadian clocks and PCOS.,Hum Reprod,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 6-20% of reproductive-aged women. It is associated with increased risks of metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, mood disorders, endometrial cancer and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Although various susceptibility loci have been identified through genetic studies, they account for ∼10% of PCOS heritability. Therefore, the etiology of PCOS remains unclear. This review explores the role of epigenetic changes and modifications in circadian clock genes as potential contributors to PCOS pathogenesis. Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA changes, have been described in diseases related to PCOS, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity. Furthermore, several animal models have illustrated a link between prenatal exposure to androgens or anti-Müllerian hormone and PCOS-like phenotypes in subsequent generations, illustrating an epigenetic programming in PCOS. In humans, epigenetic changes have been reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), adipose tissue, granulosa cells (GC), and liver from women with PCOS. The genome of women with PCOS is globally hypomethylated compared to healthy controls. However, specific hypomethylated or hypermethylated genes have been reported in the different tissues of these women. They are mainly involved in hormonal regulation and inflammatory pathways, as well as lipid and glucose metabolism. Additionally, sleep disorders are present in women with PCOS and disruptions in clock genes' expression patterns have been observed in their PBMC or GCs. While epigenetic changes hold promise as diagnostic biomarkers, the current challenge lies in distinguishing whether these changes are causes or consequences of PCOS. Targeting epigenetic modifications potentially opens avenues for precision medicine in PCOS, including lifestyle interventions and drug therapies. However, data are still lacking in large cohorts of well-characterized PCOS phenotypes. In conclusion, understanding the interplay between genetics, epigenetics, and circadian rhythms may provide valuable insights for early diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in PCOS in the future.© The Author(s) 2024.

38598835,NSD2 drives t(4;14) myeloma cell dependence on adenylate kinase 2 by diverting one-carbon metabolism to the epigenome.,Blood,"Chromosomal translocation (4;14), an adverse prognostic factor in multiple myeloma (MM), drives overexpression of the histone methyltransferase NSD2. A genome-wide CRISPR screen in MM cells identified adenylate kinase 2 (AK2), an enzyme critical for high energy phosphate transfer from the mitochondria, as an NSD2-driven vulnerability. AK2 suppression in t(4;14) MM cells decreased NADP(H) critical for conversion of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleosides, leading to replication stress, DNA damage and apoptosis. Driving a large genome-wide increase in chromatin methylation, NSD2 overexpression depletes S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), compromising synthesis of creatine from its precursor guanidinoacetate. Creatine supplementation restored NADP(H) levels, reduced DNA damage and rescued AK2-deficient t(4;14) MM cells. As the creatine phosphate shuttle constitutes an alternative means for mitochondrial high energy phosphate transport, these results indicate that NSD2-driven creatine depletion underlies the hypersensitivity of t(4;14) MM cells to AK2 loss. Furthermore, AK2 depletion in t(4;14) cells impaired protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum consistent with impaired utilization of mitochondrial ATP. Accordingly, AK2 suppression increased sensitivity of MM cells to proteasome inhibition. These findings delineate a novel mechanism in which aberrant transfer of carbon to the epigenome creates a metabolic vulnerability, with direct therapeutic implications for t(4;14) MM.Copyright © 2024 American Society of Hematology.",3.788465159552448e-50
38594575,Differential DNA methylation associated with delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a systematic review.,Neurosurg Rev,"Recent studies suggest that differential DNA methylation could play a role in the mechanism of cerebral vasospasm (CVS) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Considering the significance of this matter and a lack of effective prophylaxis against DCI, we aim to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding their associations with DNA methylation and identify the gaps for a future trial. PubMed MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched by two authors in three waves for relevant DNA methylation association studies in DCI after aSAH. PRISMA checklist was followed for a systematic structure. STROBE statement was used to assess the quality and risk of bias within studies. This research was funded by the National Science Centre, Poland (grant number 2021/41/N/NZ2/00844). Of 70 records, 7 peer-reviewed articles met the eligibility criteria. Five studies used a candidate gene approach, three were epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), one utilized bioinformatics of the previous EWAS, with two studies using more than one approach. Methylation status of four cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) related to four distinct genes (ITPR3, HAMP, INSR, CDHR5) have been found significantly or suggestively associated with DCI after aSAH. Analysis of epigenetic clocks yielded significant association of lower age acceleration with radiological CVS but not with DCI. Hub genes for hypermethylation (VHL, KIF3A, KIFAP3, RACGAP1, OPRM1) and hypomethylation (ALB, IL5) in DCI have been indicated through bioinformatics analysis. As none of the CpGs overlapped across the studies, meta-analysis was not applicable. The identified methylation sites might potentially serve as a biomarker for early diagnosis of DCI after aSAH in future. However, a lack of overlapping results prompts the need for large-scale multicenter studies. Challenges and prospects are discussed.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.9493156561668322e-10
38591222,Exploring Genetic Associations of 3 Types of Risk Factors With Ischemic Stroke: An Integrated Bioinformatics Study.,Stroke,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is a major cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests a strong association between blood pressure, blood glucose, circulating lipids, and IS. Nonetheless, the genetic association of these 3 risk factors with IS remains elusive.We screened genetic instruments related to blood pressure, blood glucose, and circulating lipids and paired them with IS genome-wide association study data to conduct Mendelian randomization analysis. Positive Mendelian randomization findings were then subjected to colocalization analysis. Subsequently, we utilized the Gene Expression Omnibus data set to perform differential expression analysis, aiming to identify differentially expressed associated genes. We determined the importance scores of these differentially expressed associated genes through 4 machine learning models and constructed a nomogram based on these findings.The combined results of the Mendelian randomization analysis indicate that blood pressure (systolic blood pressure: odds ratio [OR], 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01-1.02]; diastolic blood pressure: OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.03-1.04]) and some circulating lipids (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: OR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.01-1.12]; apoA1: OR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92-0.98]; apoB: OR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.01-1.09]; eicosapentaenoic acid: OR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.41-3.96]) have causal relationships with the risk of IS onset. We identified 73 genes that are linked to blood pressure and circulating lipids in the context of IS, and 16 are differentially expressed associated genes.FURIN,MAN2A2,HDDC3,ALDH2, andTOMM40were identified as feature genes for constructing the nomogram that provides a quantitative prediction of the risk of IS onset.This study indicates that there are causal links between blood pressure, certain circulating lipids, and the development of IS.

Here, we aimed to identify genes associated with breast cancer and analyze their pathophysiological mechanisms based on multi-omics Mendelian randomization (MR). Summary-data-based MR (SMR) was performed to estimate the causal effects of blood and breast mammary tissue expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) on BC. External validation analysis was used to validate the identified genes. Integration analyses BC GWAS summaries with eQTLs and DNA methylation QTLs (mQTLs) from the blood were conducted using SMR to prioritize putative blood genes and their regulatory elements associated with BC risk. Finally, two prior genes (ATG10 and RCCD1) from blood tissue reached significant levels in both BCAC (ATG10: ORBRCR= 0.91, PBRCR= 1.29 × 10-11; RCCD1: ORBRCR= 0.90, PBRCR= 3.72 × 10-15) and FinnGen cohorts (ATG10: ORFinnGen= 0.89, PFinnGen= 8.55 × 10-5; RCCD1: ORFinnGen= 0.89, PFinnGen= 2.38 × 10-8). Additionally, those two genes from breast tissues also replicated in both BCAC (ATG10: ORBRCR= 0.95, PBRCR= 1.02 × 10-9; RCCD1: ORBRCR= 0.87, PBRCR= 4.70 × 10-10) and FinnGen cohorts (ATG10: ORFinnGen= 0.93, PFinnGen= 2.38 × 10-4; RCCD1: ORFinnGen= 0.85, PFinnGen= 3.81 × 10-6). Sensitive analysis and external validation analysis validated those two identified genes. Multi-omics MR analysis showed that the SNP signals associated with ATG10 and RCCD1 were significant across the data from BC Genome-wide association study (GWAS), eQTL, and mQTL studies.

In this study, the mucosal bacterial community, host genome-wide transcriptome and DNA CpG methylation were simultaneously profiled in tumors and their adjacent normal tissues of OSCC patients. Significant enrichment in the relative abundance of seven bacteria species (Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema medium, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Gemella morbillorum, Catonella morbi, Peptoanaerobacter yurli and Peptococcus simiae) were observed in OSCC tumor microenvironment. These tumor-enriched bacteria formed 254 positive correlations with 206 up-regulated host genes, mainly involving signaling pathways related to cell adhesion, migration and proliferation. Integrative analysis of bacteria-transcriptome and bacteria-methylation correlations identified at least 20 dysregulated host genes with inverted CpG methylation in their promoter regions associated with enrichment of bacterial pathogens, implying a potential of pathogenic bacteria to regulate gene expression, in part, through epigenetic alterations. An in vitro model further confirmed that Fusobacterium nucleatum might contribute to cellular invasion via crosstalk with E-cadherin/β-catenin signaling, TNFα/NF-κB pathway and extracellular matrix remodeling by up-regulating SNAI2 gene, a key transcription factor of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our work using multi-omics approaches explored complex host-microbiota interactions and provided important insights into genetic and functional basis in OSCC tumorigenesis, which may serve as a precursor for hypothesis-driven study to better understand the causational relationship of pathogenic bacteria in this deadly cancer.© 2024.

AS results from loss of maternal UBE3A in neurons, where the paternal allele is silenced by a convergent antisense transcript UBE3A-ATS, a lncRNA that normally terminates at PWAR1 in non-neurons. qRTPCR analysis confirmed the exclusive and progressive increase in UBE3A-ATS in differentiating LUHMES neurons, validating their use for studying UBE3A silencing. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses revealed changes to 11,834 genes during neuronal differentiation, including the upregulation of most genes within the 15q11-q13 locus. To identify dynamic changes in chromatin loops linked to transcriptional activity, we performed a HiChIP validated by 4C, which identified two neuron-specific CTCF loops between MAGEL2-SNRPN and PWAR1-UBE3A. To determine if allele-specific differentially methylated regions (DMR) may be associated with CTCF loop anchors, whole genome long-read nanopore sequencing was performed. We identified a paternally hypomethylated DMR near the SNRPN upstream loop anchor exclusive to neurons and a paternally hypermethylated DMR near the PWAR1 CTCF anchor exclusive to undifferentiated cells, consistent with increases in neuronal transcription. Additionally, DMRs near CTCF loop anchors were observed in both cell types, indicative of allele-specific differences in chromatin loops regulating imprinted transcription. These results provide an integrated view of the 15q11-q13 epigenetic landscape during LUHMES neuronal differentiation, underscoring the complex interplay of transcription, chromatin looping, and DNA methylation. They also provide insights for future therapeutic approaches for AS and PWS.",2.3364433816225643e-22
38585774,Network medicine informed multi-omics integration identifies drug targets and repurposable medicines for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,bioRxiv,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating, immensely complex neurodegenerative disease by lack of effective treatments. To date, the challenge to establishing effective treatment for ALS remains formidable, partly due to inadequate translation of existing human genetic findings into actionable ALS-specific pathobiology for subsequent therapeutic development. This study evaluates the feasibility of network medicine methodology via integrating human brain-specific multi-omics data to prioritize drug targets and repurposable treatments for ALS. Using human brain-specific genome-wide quantitative trait loci (x-QTLs) under a network-based deep learning framework, we identified 105 putative ALS-associated genes enriched in various known ALS pathobiological pathways, including regulation of T cell activation, monocyte differentiation, and lymphocyte proliferation. Specifically, we leveraged non-coding ALS loci effects from genome-wide associated studies (GWAS) on brain-specific expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) (eQTL), protein QTLs (pQTL), splicing QTL (sQTL), methylation QTL (meQTL), and histone acetylation QTL (haQTL). Applying network proximity analysis of predicted ALS-associated gene-coding targets and existing drug-target networks under the human protein-protein interactome (PPI) model, we identified a set of potential repurposable drugs (including Diazoxide, Gefitinib, Paliperidone, and Dimethyltryptamine) for ALS. Subsequent validation established preclinical and clinical evidence for top-prioritized repurposable drugs. In summary, we presented a network-based multi-omics framework to identify potential drug targets and repurposable treatments for ALS and other neurodegenerative disease if broadly applied.",1.813687686463692e-38
38583963,[Postnatal epigenome-mediated aging control and global trends].,Nihon Ronen Igakkai Zasshi,"The epigenome can adequately regulate the on/off states of genes in response to external environmental factors and stress. In recent years, it has been observed that the epigenome, which is modulated through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling, changes with age. Alterations in the epigenome lead to the loss of cell-specific epigenome/identity, which in turn triggers a decline in tissue function. In mammals, postnatal epigenomic variations are not only caused by metabolic diseases, such as diabetes or DNA damage, but also by social stress and infectious diseases. Unlike Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), dynamically changing epigenomes, along with their cellular roles, need to be established as objective biomarkers in conjunction with various biological signals, such as walking speed, brain waves, and clinical data. The biological age/aging clock, determined by methylated DNA, has attracted attention, and calorie restriction not only slows the progression of aging, but also seems to suppress it. However, as indicated by gene expression analysis in aging mice, aging is not a linear model, but is represented by nonlinear dynamic changes. Consequently, the development of experimental models and analytical methods that enhance temporal resolution through time-series analysis, tailored to spatial resolution, such as cell distribution and organ specificity, is progressing. Moreover, in recent years, in addition to anti-aging efforts targeting epigenomic variations, global attention has increasingly focused on research and development aimed at rejuvenating treatments, thus leading to the birth of many biotech companies. Aging Hallmarks such as inflammation, stem cells, metabolism, genomic instability, and autophagy, interact closely with the epigenome. Various postnatal and reversible epigenomic controls of aging, including Yamanaka factors (OKSM and OSK), are now entering a new phase. In the future, the development of aging control using diverse modalities, such as mRNA, artificial peptides, and genome editing, is expected, along with an improved molecular understanding of aging and identification of useful biomarkers.",8.241934860922882e-39
38583102,Metabologenomic characterization uncovers a clinically aggressive IDH mutant glioma subtype.,Acta Neuropathol,"Mutations in the pivotal metabolic isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes are recognized to drive the molecular footprint of diffuse gliomas, and patients with IDH mutant gliomas have overall favorable outcomes compared to patients with IDH wild-type tumors. However, survival still varies widely among patients with IDH mutated tumors. Here, we aimed to characterize molecular signatures that explain the range of IDH mutant gliomas. By integrating matched epigenome-wide methylome, transcriptome, and global metabolome data in 154 patients with gliomas, we identified a group of IDH mutant gliomas with globally altered metabolism that resembled IDH wild-type tumors. IDH-mutant gliomas with altered metabolism have significantly shorter overall survival from their IDH mutant counterparts that is not fully accounted for by recognized molecular prognostic markers of CDKN2A/B loss and glioma CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (GCIMP) status. IDH-mutant tumors with dysregulated metabolism harbored distinct epigenetic alterations that converged to drive proliferative and stem-like transcriptional profiles, providing a window to target novel dependencies in gliomas.© 2024.

38582121,Genome-wide profiling of DNA methylome and transcriptome reveals epigenetic regulation of Urechis unicinctus response to sulfide stress.,Sci Total Environ,"Sulfide is a well-known environmental pollutant that can have detrimental effects on most organisms. However, few metazoans living in sulfide-rich environments have developed mechanisms to tolerate and adapt to sulfide stress. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, have been shown to play a vital role in environmental stress adaptation. Nevertheless, the precise function of DNA methylation in biological sulfide adaptation remains unclear. Urechis unicinctus, a benthic organism inhabiting sulfide-rich intertidal environments, is an ideal model organism for studying adaptation to sulfide environments. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the DNA methylome and transcriptome of U. unicinctus after exposure to 50 μM sulfide. The results revealed dynamic changes in the DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine) landscape in response to sulfide stress, with U. unicinctus exhibiting elevated DNA methylation levels following stress exposure. Integrating differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we identified a crucial role of gene body methylation in predicting gene expression. Furthermore, using a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, we validated the involvement of DNA methylation in the sulfide stress response and the gene regulatory network influenced by DNA methylation. The results indicated that by modulating DNA methylation levels during sulfide stress, the expression of glutathione S-transferase, glutamyl aminopeptidase, and cytochrome c oxidase could be up-regulated, thereby facilitating the metabolism and detoxification of exogenous sulfides. Moreover, DNA methylation was found to regulate and enhance the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, including NADH dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and ATP synthase. Additionally, DNA methylation influenced the regulation of Cytochrome P450 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor, both of which are closely associated with oxidative stress and stress resistance. Our findings not only emphasize the role of DNA methylation in sulfide adaptation but also provide novel insights into the potential mechanisms through which marine organisms adapt to environmental changes.Copyright © 2024.

38581717,Cyclin B1: A potential prognostic and immunological biomarker in pan-cancer.,Biomol Biomed,"Cyclin B1 (CCNB1) encodes a regulatory protein essential for the regulation of cell mitosis, particularly in controlling the G2/M transition phase of the cell cycle. Current research has implicated CCNB1 in the progression of various types of cancer, including gastric cancer, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. In this study, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis of CCNB1 to investigate its prognostic significance and immunological aspects. Our comprehensive investigation covered a wide range of analyses, including gene expression, promoter methylation, genetic alterations, immune infiltration, immune regulators, and enrichment studies. We utilized multiple databases and tools for this purpose, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), the University of Alabama at Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal (UALCAN), the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), the DNA Methylation Interactive Visualization Database (DNMIVD), the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING), Sangerbox, and cBioPortal. Data analyses were executed using GraphPad Prism software, R software, and various online tools. Our findings demonstrated a significant increase in CCNB1 expression across 28 cancer types. Elevated CCNB1 expression correlated with decreased overall survival (OS) in 11 cancer types and disease-free survival (DFS) in 12 cancer types. Additionally, DNA promoter methylation levels were significantly decreased in 14 cancer types. Furthermore, the study verified a significant association between CCNB1 expression and immune infiltration, immune modulators, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB). Enrichment analysis indicated that CCNB1 is involved in multiple cellular pathways. Collectively, our results suggested that CCNB1 has the potential to serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker and may be a promising target for immunotherapy in various cancer types.",4.7833991612758234e-45

38580899,DPPA3 facilitates genome-wide DNA demethylation in mouse primordial germ cells.,BMC Genomics,"Genome-wide DNA demethylation occurs in mammalian primordial germ cells (PGCs) as part of the epigenetic reprogramming important for gametogenesis and resetting the epigenetic information for totipotency. Dppa3 (also known as Stella or Pgc7) is highly expressed in mouse PGCs and oocytes and encodes a factor essential for female fertility. It prevents excessive DNA methylation in oocytes and ensures proper gene expression in preimplantation embryos: however, its role in PGCs is largely unexplored. In the present study, we investigated whether or not DPPA3 has an impact on CG methylation/demethylation in mouse PGCs.We show that DPPA3 plays a role in genome-wide demethylation in PGCs even before sex differentiation. Dppa3 knockout female PGCs show aberrant hypermethylation, most predominantly at H3K9me3-marked retrotransposons, which persists up to the fully-grown oocyte stage. DPPA3 works downstream of PRDM14, a master regulator of epigenetic reprogramming in embryonic stem cells and PGCs, and independently of TET1, an enzyme that hydroxylates 5-methylcytosine.The results suggest that DPPA3 facilitates DNA demethylation through a replication-coupled passive mechanism in PGCs. Our study identifies DPPA3 as a novel epigenetic reprogramming factor in mouse PGCs.© 2024. The Author(s).",5.236249739345021e-32
38580022,Novel insights into drought-induced regulation of ribosomal genes through DNA methylation in chickpea.,Int J Biol Macromol,"Modifications within the epigenome of an organism in response to external environmental conditions allow it to withstand the hostile stress factors. Drought in chickpea is a severely limiting abiotic stress factor which is known to cause huge yield loss. To analyse the methylome of chickpea in response to drought stress conditions and how it affects gene expression, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-seq of two chickpea genotypes which contrast for drought tolerance. It was observed that the mCHH was most variable under drought stress and the drought tolerant (DT) genotype exhibited substantial genome-wide hypomethylation as compared to the drought sensitive (DS) genotype. Specifically, there was substantial difference in gene expression and methylation for the ribosomal genes for the tolerant and sensitive genotypes. The differential expression of these genes was in complete agreement with earlier reported transcriptomes in chickpea. Many of these genes were hypomethylated (q < 0.01) and downregulated under drought stress (p < 0.01) in the sensitive genotype. The gene RPS6 (ribosomal protein small subunit) was found to be downregulated and hypomethylated in the drought sensitive genotype which could possibly lead to reduced ribosomal biosynthesis. This study provides novel insights into regulation of drought-responsive genes in chickpea.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1.7512218096105353e-39

Our study aims to investigate the genetic basis of this disease in the Chinese Han population.We performed a genome-wide association study and fine-mapping study within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region of 413 Chinese patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis recruited from 6 large tertiary hospitals and 7,127 healthy controls.Our genome-wide association analysis identified a strong association at the IFIH1 locus on chromosome 2q24.2 (rs3747517,p= 1.06 × 10-8, OR = 1.55, 95% CI, 1.34-1.80), outside of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. Furthermore, through a fine-mapping study of the MHC region, we discovered associations for 3 specific HLA class I and II alleles. Notably, HLA-DQB1*05:02 (p= 1.43 × 10-12; OR, 2.10; 95% CI 1.70-2.59) demonstrates the strongest association among classical HLA alleles, closely followed by HLA-A*11:01 (p= 4.36 × 10-7; OR, 1.52; 95% CI 1.29-1.79) and HLA-A*02:07 (p= 1.28 × 10-8; OR, 1.87; 95% CI 1.50-2.31). In addition, we uncovered 2 main HLA amino acid variation associated with anti-NMDAR encephalitis including HLA-DQβ1-126H (p= 1.43 × 10-12; OR, 2.10; 95% CI 1.70-2.59), exhibiting a predisposing effect, and HLA-B-97R (p= 3.40 × 10-8; OR, 0.63; 95% CI 0.53-0.74), conferring a protective effect. Computational docking analysis suggested a close relationship between the NR1 subunit of NMDAR and DQB1*05:02.Our findings indicate that genetic variation in IFIH1, involved in the type I interferon signaling pathway and innate immunity, along with variations in the HLA class I and class II genes, has substantial implications for the susceptibility to anti-NMDAR encephalitis in the Chinese Han population.",1.0506260042730037e-25
38576030,EpiDiP/NanoDiP: a versatile unsupervised machine learning edge computing platform for epigenomic tumour diagnostics.,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"DNA methylation analysis based on supervised machine learning algorithms with static reference data, allowing diagnostic tumour typing with unprecedented precision, has quickly become a new standard of care. Whereas genome-wide diagnostic methylation profiling is mostly performed on microarrays, an increasing number of institutions additionally employ nanopore sequencing as a faster alternative. In addition, methylation-specific parallel sequencing can generate methylation and genomic copy number data. Given these diverse approaches to methylation profiling, to date, there is no single tool that allows (1) classification and interpretation of microarray, nanopore and parallel sequencing data, (2) direct control of nanopore sequencers, and (3) the integration of microarray-based methylation reference data. Furthermore, no software capable of entirely running in routine diagnostic laboratory environments lacking high-performance computing and network infrastructure exists. To overcome these shortcomings, we present EpiDiP/NanoDiP as an open-source DNA methylation and copy number profiling suite, which has been benchmarked against an established supervised machine learning approach using in-house routine diagnostics data obtained between 2019 and 2021. Running locally on portable, cost- and energy-saving system-on-chip as well as gpGPU-augmented edge computing devices, NanoDiP works in offline mode, ensuring data privacy. It does not require the rigid training data annotation of supervised approaches. Furthermore, NanoDiP is the core of our public, free-of-charge EpiDiP web service which enables comparative methylation data analysis against an extensive reference data collection. We envision this versatile platform as a useful resource not only for neuropathologists and surgical pathologists but also for the tumour epigenetics research community. In daily diagnostic routine, analysis of native, unfixed biopsies by NanoDiP delivers molecular tumour classification in an intraoperative time frame.© 2024. The Author(s).",5.613947947441584e-29
38574408,Enhanced resolution profiling in twins reveals differential methylation signatures of type 2 diabetes with links to its complications.,EBioMedicine,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Previous findings suggest DNA methylation as a potential mechanism in T2D pathogenesis and progression.We profiled DNA methylation in 248 blood samples from participants of European ancestry from 7 twin cohorts using a methylation sequencing platform targeting regulatory genomic regions encompassing 2,048,698 CpG sites.We find and replicate 3 previously unreported T2D differentially methylated CpG positions (T2D-DMPs) at FDR 5% in RGL3, NGB and OTX2, and 20 signals at FDR 25%, of which 14 replicated. Integrating genetic variation and T2D-discordant monozygotic twin analyses, we identify both genetic-based and genetic-independent T2D-DMPs. The signals annotate to genes with established GWAS and EWAS links to T2D and its complications, including blood pressure (RGL3) and eye disease (OTX2).The results help to improve our understanding of T2D disease pathogenesis and progression and may provide biomarkers for its complications.Funding acknowledgements for each cohort can be found in the Supplementary Note.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a common biomarker of inflammation and used as an indicator of disease risk; however, the role of inflammation in disease is not completely understood. Methylation is an epigenetic modification in the DNA which plays a pivotal role in gene expression. In this study we evaluated differential DNA methylation patterns associated with blood CRP level to elucidate biological pathways and genetic regulatory mechanisms to improve the understanding of chronic inflammation. The racially and ethnically diverse participants in this study were included as 50% White, 41% Black or African American, 7% Hispanic or Latino/a, and 2% Native Hawaiian, Asian American, American Indian, or Alaska Native (totaln = 13,433) individuals. We replicated 113 CpG sites from 87 unique loci, of which five were novel (CADM3,NALCN, NLRC5, ZNF792, and cg03282312), across a discovery set of 1,150 CpG sites associated with CRP level (p < 1.2E-7). The downstream pathways affected by DNA methylation included the identification ofIFI16andIRF7CpG-gene transcript pairs which contributed to the innate immune response gene enrichment pathway along withNLRC5,NOD2, andAIM2. Gene enrichment analysis also identified the nuclear factor-kappaB transcription pathway. Using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) we inferred methylation at three CpG sites as causal for CRP levels using both White and Black or African American MR instrument variables. Overall, we identified novel CpG sites and gene transcripts that could be valuable in understanding the specific cellular processes and pathogenic mechanisms involved in inflammation.",0.09447449003490559
38564759,Critical evaluation of the reliability of DNA methylation probes on the Illumina MethylationEPIC v1.0 BeadChip microarrays.,Epigenetics,"DNA methylation (DNAm) plays a crucial role in a number of complex diseases. However, the reliability of DNAm levels measured using Illumina arrays varies across different probes. Previous research primarily assessed probe reliability by comparing duplicate samples between the 450k-450k or 450k-EPIC platforms, with limited investigations on Illumina EPIC v1.0 arrays. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the EPIC v1.0 array probe reliability using 69 blood DNA samples, each measured twice, generated by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. We observed higher reliability in probes with average methylation beta values of 0.2 to 0.8, and lower reliability in type I probes or those within the promoter and CpG island regions. Importantly, we found that probe reliability has significant implications in the analyses of Epigenome-wide Association Studies (EWAS). Higher reliability is associated with more consistent effect sizes in different studies, the identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTLs), and significant correlations with downstream gene expression. Moreover, blood DNAm measurements obtained from probes with higher reliability are more likely to show concordance with brain DNAm measurements. Our findings, which provide crucial reliability information for probes on the EPIC v1.0 array, will serve as a valuable resource for future DNAm studies.",1.0
38562779,Association between Maternal Perinatal Stress and Depression on Infant DNA Methylation in the First Year of Life.,Res Sq,"Maternal stress and depression during pregnancy and the first year of the infant's life affect a large percentage of mothers. Maternal stress and depression have been associated with adverse fetal and childhood outcomes as well as differential child DNA methylation (DNAm). However, the biological mechanisms connecting maternal stress and depression to poor health outcomes in children are still largely unknown. Here we aim to determine whether prenatal stress and depression are associated with changes in cord blood mononuclear cell DNAm (CBMC-DNAm) in newborns (n = 119) and whether postnatal stress and depression are associated with changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNAm (PBMC-DNAm) in children of 12 months of age (n = 113) from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) cohort. Stress was measured using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Questionnaire (CESD). Both stress and depression were measured at 18 weeks and 36 weeks of pregnancy and six months and 12 months postpartum. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) using robust linear regression followed by a sensitivity analysis in which we bias-adjusted for inflation and unmeasured confounding using the bacon and cate methods. To investigate the cumulative effect of maternal stress and depression, we created composite prenatal and postnatal adversity scores. We identified a significant association between prenatal stress and differential CBMC-DNAm at 8 CpG sites and between prenatal depression and differential CBMC-DNAm at 2 CpG sites. Additionally, we identified a significant association between postnatal stress and differential PBMC-DNAm at 8 CpG sites and between postnatal depression and differential PBMC-DNAm at 11 CpG sites. Using our composite scores, we further identified 2 CpG sites significantly associated with prenatal adversity and 7 CpG sites significantly associated with postnatal adversity. Several of the associated genes, includingPLAGL1, HYMAI, BRD2, andERC2have been implicated in adverse fetal outcomes and neuropsychiatric disorders. This suggested that differential DNAm may play a role in the relationship between maternal mental health and child health.",1.0
38561465,Differential DNA methylation in iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons: a step forward on the role of SNORD116 microdeletion in the pathophysiology of addictive behavior in Prader-Willi syndrome.,Mol Psychiatry,"A microdeletion including the SNORD116 gene (SNORD116 MD) has been shown to drive the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) features. PWS is a neurodevelopmental disorder clinically characterized by endocrine impairment, intellectual disability and psychiatric symptoms such as a lack of emotional regulation, impulsivity, and intense temper tantrums with outbursts. In addition, this syndrome is associated with a nutritional trajectory characterized by addiction-like behavior around food in adulthood. PWS is related to the genetic loss of expression of a minimal region that plays a potential role in epigenetic regulation. Nevertheless, the role of the SNORD116 MD in DNA methylation, as well as the impact of the oxytocin (OXT) on it, have never been investigated in human neurons.We studied the methylation marks in induced pluripotent stem-derived dopaminergic neurons carrying a SNORD116 MD in comparison with those from an age-matched adult healthy control. We also performed identical neuron differentiation in the presence of OXT. We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis from the iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons by reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing. In addition, we performed RNA sequencing analysis in these iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons differentiated with or without OXT.The analysis revealed that 153,826 cytosines were differentially methylated between SNORD116 MD neurons and control neurons. Among the differentially methylated genes, we determined a list of genes also differentially expressed. Enrichment analysis of this list encompassed the dopaminergic system with COMT and SLC6A3. COMT displayed hypermethylation and under-expression in SNORD116 MD, and SLC6A3 displayed hypomethylation and over-expression in SNORD116 MD. RT-qPCR confirmed significant over-expression of SLC6A3 in SNORD116 MD neurons. Moreover, the expression of this gene was significantly decreased in the case of OXT adjunction during the differentiation.SNORD116 MD dopaminergic neurons displayed differential methylation and expression in the COMT and SLC6A3 genes, which are related to dopaminergic clearance.© 2024.

In this review, we aim to synthesize the latest findings in this field to highlight: (1) the shifting understanding of the genomic localization of altered DNA methylation in response to acute and chronic aerobic and resistance exercise in skeletal muscle (e.g., promoter, gene bodies, enhancers, intergenic regions, un-annotated regions, and genome-wide methylation); (2) how these global/regional methylation changes relate to transcriptional activity following exercise; and (3) the factors (e.g., individual demographic or genetic features, dietary, training history, exercise parameters, local epigenetic characteristics, circulating hormones) demonstrated to alter both the pattern of DNA methylation after exercise, and the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression. Finally, we discuss the changes in non-CpG methylation and 5-hydroxymethylation after exercise, as well as the importance of emerging single-cell analyses to future studies-areas of increasing focus in the field of epigenetics. We anticipate that this review will help generate a framework for clinicians and researchers to begin developing and testing exercise interventions designed to generate targeted changes in DNA methylation as part of a personalized exercise regimen.© 2024.

38561336,The PTM profiling of CTCF reveals the regulation of 3D chromatin structure by O-GlcNAcylation.,Nat Commun,"CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a ubiquitously expressed and highly conserved protein, is known to play a critical role in chromatin structure. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) diversify the functions of protein to regulate numerous cellular processes. However, the effects of PTMs on the genome-wide binding of CTCF and the organization of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure have not been fully understood. In this study, we uncovered the PTM profiling of CTCF and demonstrated that CTCF can be O-GlcNAcylated and arginine methylated. Functionally, we demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation inhibits CTCF binding to chromatin. Meanwhile, deficiency of CTCF O-GlcNAcylation results in the disruption of loop domains and the alteration of chromatin loops associated with cellular development. Furthermore, the deficiency of CTCF O-GlcNAcylation increases the expression of developmental genes and negatively regulates maintenance and establishment of stem cell pluripotency. In conclusion, these results provide key insights into the role of PTMs for the 3D chromatin structure.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.819950966607111e-39
38559088,Copy number variants underlie the major selective sweeps in insecticide resistance genes in Anopheles arabiensis from Tanzania.,bioRxiv,"To keep ahead of the evolution of resistance to insecticides in mosquitoes, national malaria control programmes must make use of a range of insecticides, both old and new, while monitoring resistance mechanisms. Knowledge of the mechanisms of resistance remains limited inAnopheles arabiensis, which in many parts of Africa is of increasing importance because it is apparently less susceptible to many indoor control interventions. Furthermore, comparatively little is known in general about resistance to non-pyrethroid insecticides such as pirimiphos-methyl (PM), which are crucial for effective control in the context of resistance to pyrethroids. We performed a genome-wide association study to determine the molecular mechanisms of resistance to deltamethrin (commonly used in bednets) and PM, inAn. arabiensisfrom two regions in Tanzania. Genomic regions of positive selection in these populations were largely driven by copy number variants (CNVs) in gene families involved in resistance to these two insecticides. We found evidence of a new gene cluster involved in resistance to PM, identifying a strong selective sweep tied to a CNV in theCoeae2g-Coeae6gcluster of carboxylesterase genes. Using complementary data fromAn. coluzziiin Ghana, we show that copy number at this locus is significantly associated with PM resistance. Similarly, for deltamethrin, resistance was strongly associated with a novel CNV allele in theCyp6aa/Cyp6pcluster. Against this background of metabolic resistance, target site resistance was very rare or absent for both insecticides. Mutations in the pyrethroid target siteVgscwere at very low frequency in Tanzania, yet combining these samples with threeAn. arabiensisindividuals from West Africa revealed a startling diversity of evolutionary origins of target site resistance, with up to 5 independent origins ofVgsc-995 mutations found within just 8 haplotypes. Thus, despite having been first recorded over 10 years ago,Vgscresistance mutations in TanzanianAn. arabiensishave remained at stable low frequencies. Overall, our results provide a new copy number marker for monitoring resistance to PM in malaria mosquitoes, and reveal the complex picture of resistance patterns inAn. arabiensis.",6.086261884401219e-31
38558216,Genome-wide analysis of hepatic DNA methylation reveals impact of epigenetic aging on xenobiotic metabolism and transport genes in an aged mouse model.,Geroscience,"Hepatic xenobiotic metabolism and transport decline with age, while intact xenobiotic metabolism is associated with longevity. However, few studies have examined the genome-wide impact of epigenetic aging on these processes. We used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to map DNA methylation changes in liver DNA from mice ages 4 and 24 months. We identified several thousand age-associated differentially methylated sites (a-DMS), many of which overlapped genes encoding Phase I and Phase II drug metabolizing enzymes, in addition to ABC and SLC classes of transporters. Notable genes harboring a-DMS were Cyp1a2, Cyp2d9, and Abcc2 that encode orthologs of the human drug metabolizing enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, and the multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) transporter. Cyp2d9 hypermethylation with age was significantly associated with reduced gene expression, while Abcc2 expression was unchanged with age. Cyp1a2 lost methylation with age while, counterintuitively, its expression also reduced with age. We hypothesized that age-related dysregulation of the hepatic transcriptional machinery caused down-regulation of genes despite age-related hypomethylation. Bioinformatic analysis of hypomethylated a-DMS in our sample found them to be highly enriched for hepatic nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α) binding sites. HNF4α promotes Cyp1a2 expression and is downregulated with age, which could explain the reduction in Cyp1a2 expression. Overall, our study supports the broad impact of epigenetic aging on xenobiotic metabolism and transport. Future work should evaluate the interplay between hepatic nuclear receptor function and epigenetic aging. These results may have implications for studies of longevity and healthy aging.© 2024.

38558186,Identification and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) analysis of methyltransferase affecting tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit ripening.,Planta,"Six methyltransferase genes affecting tomato fruit ripening were identified through genome-wide screening, VIGS assay, and expression pattern analysis. The data provide the basis for understanding new mechanisms of methyltransferases. Fruit ripening is a critical stage for the formation of edible quality and seed maturation, which is finely modulated by kinds of factors, including genetic regulators, hormones, external signals, etc. Methyltransferases (MTases), important genetic regulators, play vital roles in plant development through epigenetic regulation, post-translational modification, or other mechanisms. However, the regulatory functions of numerous MTases except DNA methylation in fruit ripening remain limited so far. Here, six MTases, which act on different types of substrates, were identified to affect tomato fruit ripening. First, 35 MTase genes with relatively high expression at breaker (Br) stage of tomato fruit were screened from the tomato MTase gene database encompassing 421 genes totally. Thereafter, six MTase genes were identified as potential regulators of fruit ripening via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), including four genes with a positive regulatory role and two genes with a negative regulatory role, respectively. The expression of these six MTase genes exhibited diverse patterns during the fruit ripening process, and responded to various external ripening-related factors, including ethylene, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), temperature, and light exposure. These results help to further elaborate the biological mechanisms of MTase genes in tomato fruit ripening and enrich the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of fruit ripening involving MTases, despite of DNA MTases.© 2024.

38556721,An integrated molecular risk score early in life for subsequent childhood asthma risk.,Clin Exp Allergy,"Numerous children present with early wheeze symptoms, yet solely a subgroup develops childhood asthma. Early identification of children at risk is key for clinical monitoring, timely patient-tailored treatment, and preventing chronic, severe sequelae. For early prediction of childhood asthma, we aimed to define an integrated risk score combining established risk factors with genome-wide molecular markers at birth, complemented by subsequent clinical symptoms/diagnoses (wheezing, atopic dermatitis, food allergy).Three longitudinal birth cohorts (PAULINA/PAULCHEN, n = 190 + 93 = 283, PASTURE, n = 1133) were used to predict childhood asthma (age 5-11) including epidemiological characteristics and molecular markers: genotype, DNA methylation and mRNA expression (RNASeq/NanoString). Apparent (ap) and optimism-corrected (oc) performance (AUC/R2) was assessed leveraging evidence from independent studies (Naïve-Bayes approach) combined with high-dimensional logistic regression models (LASSO).Asthma prediction with epidemiological characteristics at birth (maternal asthma, sex, farm environment) yielded an ocAUC = 0.65. Inclusion of molecular markers as predictors resulted in an improvement in apparent prediction performance, however, for optimism-corrected performance only a moderate increase was observed (upto ocAUC = 0.68). The greatest discriminate power was reached by adding the first symptoms/diagnosis (up to ocAUC = 0.76; increase of 0.08, p = .002). Longitudinal analysis of selected mRNA expression in PASTURE (cord blood, 1, 4.5, 6 years) showed that expression at age six had the strongest association with asthma and correlation of genes getting larger over time (r = .59, p < .001, 4.5-6 years).Applying epidemiological predictors alone showed moderate predictive abilities. Molecular markers from birth modestly improved prediction. Allergic symptoms/diagnoses enhanced the power of prediction, which is important for clinical practice and for the design of future studies with molecular markers.© 2024 The Authors.

38555074,"Decreased vitamin D bio-availability with altered DNA methylation of its metabolism genes in association with the metabolic disorders among the school-aged children with degree I, II, and III obesity.",J Nutr Biochem,"Obesity is strongly associated with disturbances of vitamin D (VD) metabolites in the animal models. However, the related epidemiological evidence is still controversial, especially the different degrees of obesity children. Hence, in this present representative case-control study, 106 obesity school-age children aged 7-12 years were included and divided into different subgroups as degree I (the age- and sex-specific BMI≥95th percentile, n=45), II (BMI ≥120% percentile, n=34) and III (BMI ≥140% percentile, n=27) obesity groups across the ranges of body mass index (BMI). While the age- and sex-matched subjects without obesity were as the control group. Notably, it was significantly different of body composition, anthropological and clinical characteristics among the above four subgroups with the dose-response relationships (P<.05). Moreover, comparing with the control group, the serum VD concentrations were higher, VD metabolites like 25(OH)D, 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D, and related hydroxylases as CYP27A1, CYP2R1 and CYP27B1 were lower in the degree I, II, and III obesity subgroups (P<.05), which were more disorder with the anthropological and clinical characteristics as the obesity was worsen in a BMI-independent manner (P<.05). However, there was a significant increase of CYP27B1 in the degree III obesity group than those in the degree I and II obesity subgroups. Furthermore, the methylation patterns on the genome-wide (Methylation/Hydroxymethylation) and VD metabolism genes (CYP27A1, CYP2R1 and CYP27B1) were negatively correlated with the worse obesity and their related expressions (P<.05). In summary, these results indicated that obesity could affect the homeostasis of VD metabolism related genes such as CYP27A1, CYP2R1, CYP27B1 and etc through abnormal DNA methylation, resulting in the disorders of VD related metabolites to decrease VD bio-availability with the BMI-independent manner. In turn, the lower levels of VD metabolites would affect the liver function to exacerbate the progression of obesity, as the Degree II and III obesity subgroups.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

38553851,Menke-Hennekam syndrome; delineation of domain-specific subtypes with distinct clinical and DNA methylation profiles.,HGG Adv,"CREB-binding protein (CBP, encoded by CREBBP) and its paralog E1A-associated protein (p300, encoded by EP300) are involved in histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation. Variants that produce a null allele or disrupt the catalytic domain of either protein cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS), while pathogenic missense and in-frame indel variants in parts of exons 30 and 31 cause phenotypes recently described as Menke-Hennekam syndrome (MKHK). To distinguish MKHK subtypes and define their characteristics, molecular and extended clinical data on 82 individuals (54 unpublished) with variants affecting CBP (n = 71) or p300 (n = 11) (NP_004371.2 residues 1,705-1,875 and NP_001420.2 residues 1,668-1,833, respectively) were summarized. Additionally, genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were assessed in DNA extracted from whole peripheral blood from 54 individuals. Most variants clustered closely around the zinc-binding residues of two zinc-finger domains (ZZ and TAZ2) and within the first α helix of the fourth intrinsically disordered linker (ID4) of CBP/p300. Domain-specific methylation profiles were discerned for the ZZ domain in CBP/p300 (found in nine out of 10 tested individuals) and TAZ2 domain in CBP (in 14 out of 20), while a domain-specific diagnostic episignature was refined for the ID4 domain in CBP/p300 (in 21 out of 21). Phenotypes including intellectual disability of varying degree and distinct physical features were defined for each of the regions. These findings demonstrate existence of at least three MKHK subtypes, which are domain specific (MKHK-ZZ, MKHK-TAZ2, and MKHK-ID4) rather than gene specific (CREBBP/EP300). DNA methylation episignatures enable stratification of molecular pathophysiologic entities within a gene or across a family of paralogous genes.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

38553412,The effect of low birth weight as an intrauterine exposure on the early onset of sarcopenia through possible molecular pathways.,J Cachexia Sarcopenia Muscle,"Sarcopenia, a musculoskeletal disease characterized by the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and physical performance, presents significant challenges to global public health due to its adverse effects on mobility, morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. This comprehensive review explores the intricate connections between sarcopenia and low birth weight (LBW), emphasizing the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis, inflammatory processes (inflammaging), mitochondrial dysfunction, circadian rhythm disruptions, epigenetic mechanisms, and genetic variations revealed through genome-wide studies (GWAS). A systematic search strategy was developed using PubMed to identify relevant English-language publications on sarcopenia, LBW, DOHaD, inflammaging, mitochondrial dysfunction, circadian disruption, epigenetic mechanisms, and GWAS. The publications consist of 46.2% reviews, 21.2% cohort studies, 4.8% systematic reviews, 1.9% cross-sectional studies, 13.4% animal studies, 4.8% genome-wide studies, 5.8% epigenome-wide studies, and 1.9% book chapters. The review identified key factors contributing to sarcopenia development, including the DOHaD hypothesis, LBW impact on muscle mass, inflammaging, mitochondrial dysfunction, the influence of clock genes, the role of epigenetic mechanisms, and genetic variations revealed through GWAS. The DOHaD theory suggests that LBW induces epigenetic alterations during foetal development, impacting long-term health outcomes, including the early onset of sarcopenia. LBW correlates with reduced muscle mass, grip strength, and lean body mass in adulthood, increasing the risk of sarcopenia. Chronic inflammation (inflammaging) and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to sarcopenia, with LBW linked to increased oxidative stress and dysfunction. Disrupted circadian rhythms, regulated by genes such as BMAL1 and CLOCK, are associated with both LBW and sarcopenia, impacting lipid metabolism, muscle mass, and the ageing process. Early-life exposures, including LBW, induce epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation (DNAm) and histone changes, playing a pivotal role in sarcopenia development. Genome-wide studies have identified candidate genes and variants associated with lean body mass, muscle weakness, and sarcopenia, providing insights into genetic factors contributing to the disorder. LBW emerges as a potential early predictor of sarcopenia development, reflecting the impact of intrauterine exposures on long-term health outcomes. Understanding the complex interplay between LBW with inflammaging, mitochondrial dysfunction, circadian disruption, and epigenetic factors is essential for elucidating the pathogenesis of sarcopenia and developing targeted interventions. Future research on GWAS and the underlying mechanisms of LBW-associated sarcopenia is warranted to inform preventive strategies and improve public health outcomes.© 2024 The Authors.

38549526,"Gallic Acid Derived 1, 2-Diarylindole as a Potential Antifungal Agent against Candida Strain.",Curr Top Med Chem,"In recent decades, Candida albicans has become a serious issue for public health. The worldwide rapid rise in drug resistance to conventional therapies is the main contributing reason. Moreover, because of their potent activity at low concentrations and apparent lack of toxicity, compounds originating from plants are used in therapeutic treatments because of their potent activity at low concentrations and apparent lack of toxicity. Particularly in immunocompromised people, Candida species can result in a wide range of ailments.Present manuscript describes antifungal activity of an indole derivative 1-(4-((5- methoxy-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1H-indol-1-yl) methyl) phenoxy)-N,N-dimethylethan-1- amine (7, 100DL-6) by using an in-silico and in-vitro anti-candidal activity against two Candida strains; Candida kefyr-DS-02 (ATCC-204093) and Candida albicans (AI-clinical isolate, AIIMS- Delhi).The synthetic strategy for the preparation of indole derivatives was modified through Fischer indole reaction. Antifungal activity of an indole derivative 1-(4-((5-methoxy-2-(3,4,5- trimethoxyphenyl)-1H-indol-1-yl) methyl) phenoxy)-N,N-dimethylethan-1-amine (7, 100DL-6) was done by using an in-silico and in-vitro anti-candidal activity against two Candida strains; Candida kefyr-DS-02 (ATCC-204093) and Candida albicans (AI-clinical isolate, AIIMS-Delhi). Compound 100DL-6 efficacy was determined by Combination synergy study, ergosterol binding assay, MTT toxicity study and Mutagenicity.Compound 100DL-6 was obtained in 65% yield on desired motifs. Docking scores found were 100DL-6 (-8.7 kcal/mol) and Fluconazole (-7.6 kcal/mol). Further, RMSD were shown for 100DL6 (0.26 ± 0.23 nm) and fluconazole (1.2 ± 0.62 nm). Indole derivative 100DL-6 was active against the tested fungal pathogens and the total zone of inhibition was measured between 13-14 mm in diameter and MIC values between 31.25 μg/mL to 250 μg/mL and MFC values between 62.5 μg/mL to 500 μg/mL. In checkerboard assay synergistic mode of interaction of 100DL-6 with known antifungal drugs was observed. In the presence of ergosterol 100DL-6 and standard drug (s) increased their MIC values, demonstrating a considerable affinity for ergosterol. Compound 100DL-6 was considered to be less-cytotoxic to the cells as determined by MTT assay. Lead compound 100DL-6 was found to be non-mutagenic.In the present study, 100DL6 (indole derivatives) significantly abrupted the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway and showed moderate anti-candidal effects. These studies suggest that 100DL6 significantly enhances antifungal effect of clinical drug fluconazole synergistically and may be considered as in clinical trial prior to some extensive in-vivo validations.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.",4.9762165091640255e-48
38548728,Genetic control of DNA methylation is largely shared across European and East Asian populations.,Nat Commun,"DNA methylation is an ideal trait to study the extent of the shared genetic control across ancestries, effectively providing hundreds of thousands of model molecular traits with large QTL effect sizes. We investigate cis DNAm QTLs in three European (n = 3701) and two East Asian (n = 2099) cohorts to quantify the similarities and differences in the genetic architecture across populations. We observe 80,394 associated mQTLs (62.2% of DNAm probes with significant mQTL) to be significant in both ancestries, while 28,925 mQTLs (22.4%) are identified in only a single ancestry. mQTL effect sizes are highly conserved across populations, with differences in mQTL discovery likely due to differences in allele frequency of associated variants and differing linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and assayed SNPs. This study highlights the overall similarity of genetic control across ancestries and the value of ancestral diversity in increasing the power to detect associations and enhancing fine mapping resolution.© 2024.

38545780,Genetic and Epigenetic Mechanisms Regulating Blood Pressure and Kidney Dysfunction.,Hypertension,"The pioneering work of Dr Lewis K. Dahl established a relationship between kidney, salt, and high blood pressure (BP), which led to the major genetic-based experimental model of hypertension. BP, a heritable quantitative trait affected by numerous biological and environmental stimuli, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and is considered to be a primary modifiable factor in renal, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases. Genome-wide association studies have identified monogenic and polygenic variants affecting BP in humans. Single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in genome-wide association studies have quantified the heritability of BP and the effect of genetics on hypertensive phenotype. Changes in the transcriptional program of genes may represent consequential determinants of BP, so understanding the mechanisms of the disease process has become a priority in the field. At the molecular level, the onset of hypertension is associated with reprogramming of gene expression influenced by epigenomics. This review highlights the specific genetic variants, mutations, and epigenetic factors associated with high BP and how these mechanisms affect the regulation of hypertension and kidney dysfunction.",9.185480248224416e-21
38541726,Breast Cancer Exposomics.,Life (Basel),"We are exposed to a mixture of environmental man-made and natural xenobiotics. We experience a wide spectrum of environmental exposure in our lifetime, including the effects of xenobiotics on gametogenesis and gametes that undergo fertilization as the starting point of individual development and, moreover, in utero exposure, which can itself cause the first somatic or germline mutation necessary for breast cancer (BC) initiation. Most xenobiotics are metabolized or/and bioaccumulate and biomagnify in our tissues and cells, including breast tissues, so the xenobiotic metabolism plays an important role in BC initiation and progression. Many considerations necessitate a more valuable explanation regarding the molecular mechanisms of action of xenobiotics which act as genotoxic and epigenetic carcinogens. Thus, exposomics and the exposome concept are based on the diversity and range of exposures to physical factors, synthetic chemicals, dietary components, and psychosocial stressors, as well as their associated biologic processes and molecular pathways. Existing evidence for BC risk (BCR) suggests that food-borne chemical carcinogens, air pollution, ionizing radiation, and socioeconomic status are closely related to breast carcinogenesis. The aim of this review was to depict the dynamics and kinetics of several xenobiotics involved in BC development, emphasizing the role of new omics fields related to BC exposomics, such as environmental toxicogenomics, epigenomics and interactomics, metagenomics, nutrigenomics, nutriproteomics, and nutrimiRomics. We are mainly focused on food and nutrition, as well as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), involved in BC development. Overall, cell and tissue accumulation and xenobiotic metabolism or biotransformation can lead to modifications in breast tissue composition and breast cell morphology, DNA damage and genomic instability, epimutations, RNA-mediated and extracellular vesicle effects, aberrant blood methylation, stimulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), disruption of cell-cell junctions, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, metabolic reprogramming, and overexpression of mesenchymal genes. Moreover, the metabolism of xenobiotics into BC cells impacts almost all known carcinogenic pathways. Conversely, in our food, there are many bioactive compounds with anti-cancer potential, exerting pro-apoptotic roles, inhibiting cell cycle progression and proliferation, migration, invasion, DNA damage, and cell stress conditions. We can conclude that exposomics has a high potential to demonstrate how environmental exposure to xenobiotics acts as a double-edged sword, promoting or suppressing tumorigenesis in BC.",4.0933064066020194e-63
38541258,"The Impact of Environmental Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene, and Xylene Exposure on Blood-Based DNA Methylation Profiles in Pregnant African American Women from Detroit.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,"African American women in the United States have a high risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. DNA methylation is a potential mechanism by which exposure to BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. Data are from the Maternal Stress Study, which recruited African American women in the second trimester of pregnancy from February 2009 to June 2010. DNA methylation was measured in archived DNA from venous blood collected in the second trimester. Trimester-specific exposure to airshed BTEX was estimated using maternal self-reported addresses and geospatial models of ambient air pollution developed as part of the Geospatial Determinants of Health Outcomes Consortium. Among the 64 women with exposure and outcome data available, 46 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were associated with BTEX exposure (FDR adjustedp-value < 0.05) using a DMR-based epigenome-wide association study approach. Overall, 89% of DMRs consistently exhibited hypomethylation with increasing BTEX exposure. Biological pathway analysis identified 11 enriched pathways, with the top 3 involving gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor signaling, oxytocin in brain signaling, and the gustation pathway. These findings highlight the potential impact of BTEX on DNA methylation in pregnant women.",0.9999999999994953
38526030,Causal effect of gut microbiota on pancreatic cancer: A Mendelian randomization and colocalization study.,J Cell Mol Med,"The causal relationship between gut microbiota (GM) and pancreatic cancer (PC) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential genes underlying this mechanism. GM Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data were from the MiBioGen consortium. PC GWAS data were from the National Human Genome Research Institute-European Bioinformatics Institute (NHGRI-EBI) GWAS Catalogue. To detect the causal relationship between GM and PC, we implemented three complementary Mendelian randomization (MR) methods: Inverse Variance Weighting (IVW), MR-Egger and Weighted Median, followed by sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, we integrated GM GWAS data with blood cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and blood cis-DNA methylation QTL (mQTLs) using Summary data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) methods. This integration aimed to prioritize potential GM-affecting genes through SMR analysis of two molecular traits. PC cis-eQTLs and cis-mQTLs were summarized from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Through colocalization analysis of GM cis-QTLs and PC cis-QTLs data, we identified common genes that influence both GM and PC. Our study found a causal association between GM and PC, including four protective and five risk-associated GM [Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW), p < 0.05]. No significant heterogeneity of instrumental variables (IVs) or horizontal pleiotropy was found. The gene SVBP was identified as a GM-affecting gene using SMR analysis of two molecular traits (FDR<0.05, P_HEIDI>0.05). Additionally, two genes, MCM6 and RPS26, were implicated in the interaction between GM and PC based on colocalization analysis (PPH4>0.5). In summary, this study provides evidence for future research aimed at developing suitable therapeutic interventions and disease prevention.© 2024 The Authors.

38525798,Comparative genomic analyses reveal evidence for adaptive A-to-I RNA editing in insect Adar gene.,Epigenetics,"Although A-to-I RNA editing leads to similar effects to A-to-G DNA mutation, nonsynonymous RNA editing (recoding) is believed to confer its adaptiveness by 'epigenetically' regulating proteomic diversity in a temporospatial manner, avoiding the pleiotropic effect of genomic mutations. Recent discoveries on the evolutionary trajectory of Ser>Gly auto-editing site in insectAdargene demonstrated a selective advantage to having an editable codon compared to uneditable ones. However, apart from pure observations, quantitative approaches for justifying the adaptiveness of individual RNA editing sites are still lacking. We performed a comparative genomic analysis on 113 Diptera species, focusing on theAdarSer>Gly auto-recoding site inDrosophila. We only found one species having a derived Gly at the corresponding site, and this occurrence was significantly lower than genome-wide random expectation. This suggests that theAdarSer>Gly site is unlikely to be genomically replaced with G during evolution, and thus indicating the advantage of editable status over hardwired genomic alleles. Similar trends were observed for the conserved Ile>Met recoding in geneSyt1. In the light of evolution, we established a comparative genomic approach for quantitatively justifying the adaptiveness of individual editing sites. Priority should be given to such adaptive editing sites in future functional studies.",2.0897632505479984e-27

Existing literature regarding the establishment, stability and consequences of the methylation pattern, as well as the nature and function of thenc886RNAs transcribed from the locus, are contradictory. For example, the methylation status of the locus has been reported to be stable through life and across somatic tissues, but also susceptible to environmental effects. The nature of the producednc886RNA(s) has been redefined multiple times, and in carcinogenesis, these RNAs have been reported to have conflicting roles. In addition, due to the bimodal methylation pattern of thenc886locus, traditional genome-wide methylation analyses can lead to false-positive results, especially in smaller datasets. Herein, we aim to summarize the existing literature regardingnc886, discuss how the characteristics ofnc886give rise to contradictory results, as well as to reinterpret, reanalyse and, where possible, replicate the results presented in the current literature. We also introduce novel findings on how the distribution of thenc886methylation pattern is associated with the geographical origins of the population and describe the methylation changes in a large variety of human tumours. Through the example of this one peculiar genetic locus and RNA, we aim to highlight issues in the analysis of DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs in general and offer our suggestions for what should be taken into consideration in future analyses.",1.2638974628012158e-23
38524912,A Systematic Review of Epigenetics of Endometriosis.,F S Rev,"To assess the current literature evaluating the epigenetics of endometriosis in humans.A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines within PubMed, EBSCOhost, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection. A comprehensive search strategy was developed by a data informationist. Observational and interventional studies assessing epigenetics in humans published in English up to January 15th, 2023, were included. Two reviewers independently screened studies evaluating the role of epigenetics in endometriosis. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Extracted data were analyzed descriptively.We identified 18.639 studies, of which 57 were included, comprising 1.623 patients with endometriosis and 1.243 controls. Among the 57 studies included, 50 (88%) were case-control studies, and 7 (12%) were cross-sectional. Fifty-nine percent of the studies were Asian, 25% were from America, 14% were European, and 2% were from Africa. Acetylation and methylation were the two main key histone modifications that were centered in this review. Accordingly, we classified the studies as those focusing on genome-wide methylation and those on histone acetylation. Several studies identified an association between endometriosis and hypermethylated genes, including the PGR-B, SF-1, and RASSF1A. The genes HOXA10, COX-2, IL-12B, and GATA6 were found to be hypomethylated in endometriotic tissue by several studies. In regards to histone modification, multiple studies reported that the acetylation levels of histones H3 and H4 affect multiple genes associated with endometriosis. In addition, HDAC2 was found to be elevated in endometriosis patients in two studies.Several studies reported a significant difference between specific genes' methylation levels in endometrial biopsies and normal tissue, which suggests that DNA methylation may play an important role in the modulation of the genotype in endometriotic tissue. Acetylation and methylation are the two key histone modifications leading to differential gene expression in endometriotic tissues. The alterations in gene expression reported by the 57 studies can have direct implications on cell cycle growth, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis and, therefore, might play a key role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. This review offers insight that histone modifications need further research to evaluate their role as potential biomarkers and treatment targets for endometriosis. Although several key similarities were reported, there were some disagreements among the results, which might be attributable to the heterogeneity between studies. Further research with a more robust standardization is needed to validate the epigenetic changes in endometriosis.",1.3184010758783372e-41
38523595,"Alcohol drinking, DNA methylation and psychiatric disorders: A multi-omics Mendelian randomization study to investigate causal pathways.",Addiction,"Whether alcohol-related DNA methylation has a causal effect on psychiatric disorders has not been investigated. Furthermore, a comprehensive investigation into the causal relationship and underlying mechanisms linking alcohol consumption and psychiatric disorders has been lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the causal effect of general alcohol intake and pathological drinking behaviors on psychiatric disorders, alcohol-associated DNA methylation on gene expression and psychiatric disorders, and gene expression on psychiatric disorders.Two-sample design Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Various sensitivity and validation analyses, including colocalization analysis, were conducted to test the robustness of the results.Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data mainly from GWAS and Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine use (GSCAN), Genetics of DNA Methylation Consortium (GoDMC) and Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) with European ancestry.The GWAS summary data on general alcohol intake (drinks per week, n = 941 280), pathological drinking behaviors (including alcohol use disorder [AUD, n = 313 959] and problematic alcohol use [PAU, n = 435 563]) and psychiatric disorders (including schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, n = 51 710-500 199) were included. Alcohol-related DNA methylation CpG sites (n = 9643) and mQTL data from blood (n = 27 750) and brain (n = 1160), BrainMeta v2 and GTEx V8 eQTL summary data (n = 73-2865) were also included.Genetic variants were selected as instrumental variables for exposures, including drinks per week, AUD, PAU, alcohol-related DNA methylation CpG sites (mQTL) and genes selected (eQTL).Pathological drinking behaviors were associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders after removing outliers or controlling for alcohol consumption. MR analysis identified 10 alcohol-related CpG sites with colocalization evidence that were causally associated with psychiatric disorders (P = 1.65 × 10-4-7.52 × 10-22). Furthermore, the expression of genes (RERE, PTK6, GATAD2B, COG8, PDF and GAS5) mapped to these CpG sites in the brain, led by the cortex, were significantly associated with psychiatric disorders (P = 1.19 × 10-2-3.51 × 10-7).Pathological drinking behavior and alcohol-related DNA methylation appear to have a causal effect on psychiatric disorders.

In a cohort of 126 patients (57 female, 69 male; mean age at surgery 53.0 years) with pathologically confirmed meningeal SFTs with extended clinical follow-up (median 9.9 years; range 15 days-43 years), we performed extensive molecular characterization including genome-wide DNA methylation profiling (n = 80) and targeted TERT promoter mutation testing (n = 98). Associations were examined with NAB2::STAT6 fusion status (n = 101 cases; 51 = ex5-7::ex16-17, 26 = ex4::ex2-3; 12 = ex2-3::exANY/other and 12 = no fusion) and placed in the context of 2021 Central Nervous System (CNS) WHO grade. NAB2::STAT6 fusion breakpoints (fusion type) were significantly associated with metastasis-free survival (MFS) (p = 0.03) and, on multivariate analysis, disease-specific survival (DSS) when adjusting for CNS WHO grade (p = 0.03). DNA methylation profiling revealed three distinct clusters: Cluster 1 (n = 38), Cluster 2 (n = 22), and Cluster 3 (n = 20). Methylation clusters were significantly associated with fusion type (p < 0.001), with Cluster 2 harboring ex4::ex2-3 fusion in 16 (of 20; 80.0%), nearly all TERT promoter mutations (7 of 8; 87.5%), and predominantly an ""SFT"" histologic phenotype (15 of 22; 68.2%). Clusters 1 and 3 were less distinct, both dominated by tumors having ex5-7::ex16-17 fusion (respectively, 25 of 33; 75.8%, and 12 of 18; 66.7%) and with variable histological phenotypes. Methylation clusters were significantly associated with MFS (p = 0.027), but not overall survival (OS). In summary, NAB2::STAT6 fusion type was significantly associated with MFS and DSS, suggesting that tumors with an ex5::ex16-17 fusion may have inferior patient outcomes. Methylation clusters were significantly associated with fusion type, TERT promoter mutation status, histologic phenotype, and MFS.© 2024 The Authors.

Until very recently, risk assessments have ushered in a new era with the emergence of omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and so on, which potentially advance the ability of biomarkers to aid prediction models. While risk prediction has achieved great success, there are still some challenges and limitations. We reviewed the general process of omics-based disease risk model construction and the applications in four typical diseases. Meanwhile, we highlighted the problems in current studies and explored the potential opportunities and challenges for future clinical practice.© 2024 Wiley‐VCH GmbH.",1.7162564822250442e-20
38521405,"Hypermethylation leads to the loss of HOXA5, resulting in JAG1 expression and NOTCH signaling contributing to kidney fibrosis.",Kidney Int,"Epigenetic regulations, including DNA methylation, are critical to the development and progression of kidney fibrosis, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that fibrosis of the mouse kidney was associated with the induction of DNA methyltransferases and increases in global DNA methylation and was alleviated by the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza). Genome-wide analysis demonstrated the hypermethylation of 94 genes in mouse unilateral ureteral obstruction kidneys, which was markedly reduced by 5-Aza. Among these genes, Hoxa5 was hypermethylated at its gene promoter, and this hypermethylation was associated with reduced HOXA5 expression in fibrotic mouse kidneys after ureteral obstruction or unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury. 5-Aza prevented Hoxa5 hypermethylation, restored HOXA5 expression, and suppressed kidney fibrosis. Downregulation of HOXA5 was verified in human kidney biopsies from patients with chronic kidney disease and correlated with the increased kidney fibrosis and DNA methylation. Kidney fibrosis was aggravated by conditional knockout of Hoxa5 and alleviated by conditional knockin of Hoxa5 in kidney proximal tubules of mice. Mechanistically, we found that HOXA5 repressed Jag1 transcription by directly binding to its gene promoter, resulting in the suppression of JAG1-NOTCH signaling during kidney fibrosis. Thus, our results indicate that loss of HOXA5 via DNA methylation contributes to fibrogenesis in kidney diseases by inducing JAG1 and consequent activation of the NOTCH signaling pathway.Copyright © 2024 International Society of Nephrology.

38521043,Mixtures of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) alter sperm methylation and long-term reprogramming of offspring liver and fat transcriptome.,Environ Int,"Male fertility has been declining worldwide especially in countries with high levels of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl Substances (PFAS) have been classified as EDCs and have been linked to adverse male reproductive health. The mechanisms of these associations and their implications on offspring health remain unknown. The aims of the current study were to assess the effect of PFAS mixtures on the sperm methylome and transcriptional changes in offspring metabolic tissues (i.e., liver and fat). C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to a mixture of PFAS (PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, Genx; 20 µg/L each) for 18-weeks or water as a control. Genome-wide methylation was assessed on F0 epidydimal sperm using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and Illumina mouse methylation array, while gene expression was assessed by bulk RNA sequencing in 8-week-old offspring derived from unexposed females. PFAS mixtures resulted in 2,861 (RRBS) and 83 (Illumina) sperm DMRs (q < 0.05). Functional enrichment revealed that PFAS-induced sperm DMRs were associated with behavior and developmental pathways in RRBS, while Illumina DMRs were related to lipid metabolism and cell signaling. Additionally, PFAS mixtures resulted in 40 and 53 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the liver and fat of males, and 9 and 31 DEGs in females, respectively. Functional enrichment of DEGs revealed alterations in cholesterol metabolism and mitotic cell cycle regulation in the liver and myeloid leukocyte migration in fat of male offspring, while in female offspring, erythrocyte development and carbohydrate catabolism were affected in fat. Our results demonstrate that exposure to a mixture of legacy and newly emerging PFAS chemicals in adult male mice result in aberrant sperm methylation and altered gene expression of offspring liver and fat in a sex-specific manner. These data indicate that preconception PFAS exposure in males can be transmitted to affect phenotype in the next generation.Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

38520019,LINC00115 promotes chemoresistant breast cancer stem-like cell stemness and metastasis through SETDB1/PLK3/HIF1α signaling.,Mol Cancer,"Cancer stem-like cell is a key barrier for therapeutic resistance and metastasis in various cancers, including breast cancer, yet the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. Through a genome-wide lncRNA expression profiling, we identified that LINC00115 is robustly upregulated in chemoresistant breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSCs).LncRNA microarray assay was performed to document abundance changes of lncRNAs in paclitaxel (PTX)-resistant MDA-MB-231 BCSC (ALDH+) and non-BCSC (ALDH-). RNA pull-down and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were performed to determine the binding proteins of LINC00115. The clinical significance of the LINC00115 pathway was examined in TNBC metastatic lymph node tissues. The biological function of LINC00115 was investigated through gain- and loss-of-function studies. The molecular mechanism was explored through RNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, and the CRISPR/Cas9-knockout system. The therapeutic potential of LINC00115 was examined through xenograft animal models.LINC00115 functions as a scaffold lncRNA to link SETDB1 and PLK3, leading to enhanced SETDB1 methylation of PLK3 at both K106 and K200 in drug-resistant BCSC. PLK3 methylation decreases PLK3 phosphorylation of HIF1α and thereby increases HIF1α stability. HIF1α, in turn, upregulates ALKBH5 to reduce m6A modification of LINC00115, resulting in attenuated degradation of YTHDF2-dependent m6A-modified RNA and enhanced LINC00115 stability. Thus, this positive feedback loop provokes BCSC phenotypes and enhances chemoresistance and metastasis in triple-negative breast cancer. SETDB1 inhibitor TTD-IN with LINC00115 ASO sensitizes PTX-resistant cell response to chemotherapy in a xenograft animal model. Correlative expression of LINC00115, methylation PLK3, SETDB1, and HIF1α are prognostic for clinical triple-negative breast cancers.Our findings uncover LINC00115 as a critical regulator of BCSC and highlight targeting LINC00115 and SETDB1 as a potential therapeutic strategy for chemotherapeutic resistant breast cancer.© 2024.

38517106,Spindle cell neoplasms with novel LTK fusion - Expanding the spectrum of kinase fusion-positive soft tissue tumors.,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Kinase fusion-positive soft tissue tumors represent an emerging, molecularly defined group of mesenchymal tumors with a wide morphologic spectrum and diverse activating kinases. Here, we present two cases of soft tissue tumors with novel LTK fusions.Both cases presented as acral skin nodules (big toe and middle finger) in pediatric patients (17-year-old girl and 2-year-old boy). The tumors measured 2 and 3 cm in greatest dimension. Histologically, both cases exhibited bland-looking spindle cells infiltrating adipose tissue and accompanied by collagenous stroma. One case additionally displayed perivascular hyalinization and band-like stromal collagen. Both cases exhibited focal S100 staining, and one case had patchy coexpression of CD34. Targeted RNA-seq revealed the presence of novel in-frame MYH9::LTK and MYH10::LTK fusions, resulting in upregulation of LTK expression. Of interest, DNA methylation-based unsupervised clustering analysis in one case showed that the tumor clustered with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). One tumor was excised with amputation with no local recurrence or distant metastasis at 18-month follow-up. The other case was initially marginally excised with local recurrence after one year, followed by wide local excision, with no evidence of disease at 10 years of follow-up.This is the first reported case series of soft tissue tumors harboring LTK fusion, expanding the molecular landscape of soft tissue tumors driven by activating kinase fusions. Furthermore, studies involving a larger number of cases and integrated genomic analyses will be warranted to fully elucidate the pathogenesis and classification of these tumors.© 2024 The Authors.

38511186,Identification of m(6)A RNA methylation genes in Oryza sativa and expression profiling in response to different developmental and environmental stimuli.,Biochem Biophys Rep,"Eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) transcend their predominant function of protein encoding by incorporating auxiliary components that ultimately contribute to their processing, transportation, translation, and decay. In doing so, additional layers of modifications are incorporated in mRNAs at post-transcriptional stage. Among them, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most frequently found mRNA modification that plays crucial roles in plant development and stress response. In the overall mechanism of m6A methylation, key proteins classified based on their functions such as writers, readers, and erasers dynamically add, read, and subtract methyl groups respectively to deliver relevant functions in response to external stimuli. In this study, we identified 30 m6A regulatory genes (9 writers, 5 erasers, and 16 readers) in rice that encode 53 proteins (13 writers, 7 erasers, and 33 readers) where segmental duplication was found in one writer and four reader gene pairs. Reproductive cells such as sperm, anther and panicle showed high levels of expression for most of the m6A regulatory genes. Notably, writers likeOsMTA,OsMTD, andOsMTCshowed varied responses in different stress and infection contexts, with initial upregulation in response to early exposure followed by downregulation later.OsALKBH9A, a noteworthy eraser, displayed varied expression in response to different stresses at different time intervals, but upregulation in certain infections. Reader genes likeOsECT5,OsCPSF30-L3, andOsECT8showed continuous upregulation in exertion of all kinds of stress relevant here. Conversely, other reader genes along withOsECT11andOsCPSF30-L2were observed to be consistently downregulated. The apparent correlation between the expression patterns of m6A regulatory genes and stress modulation pathways in this study underscores the need for additional research to unravel their intricate regulatory mechanisms that could ultimately contribute to the substantial development of enhanced stress tolerance in rice through mRNA modification.© 2024 The Authors.",6.64434889643158e-68
38509601,Mother adversity and co-residence time impact mother-child similarity in genome-wide and gene-specific methylation profiles.,Clin Epigenetics,"The effects of adverse life events on physical and psychological health, with DNA methylation (DNAm) as a critical underlying mechanism, have been extensively studied. However, the epigenetic resemblance between mother and child in the context of neglectful caregiving, and whether it may be shaped by the emotional impact of maternal stressful events and the duration of co-residence (indexed by child age), remains unknown. The present study examined mother-child similarity in methylation profiles, considering the potential effect of mother adversity, mother empathy, neglect-control group, child age (an index of years of mother-child co-residence), and mother age. Using Illumina Epic arrays, we quantified DNAm in 115 mother-child saliva samples. We obtained a methylation similarity index by computing correlation coefficients between methylation profiles within dyads, for the entire epigenome, and five specific genes related to stress and empathy: NR3C1, FKPB5, OXTR, SCL6A4, and BDNF.The methylation profiles of the mother-child familial pairs significantly correlated as compared to mother-child random pairs for the entire epigenome and NR3C1, FKBP5, OXTR and BDNF genes. Next, multiple linear regression models observed associations of mother adversity, child age, and neglect-control group on mother-child methylation similarity, only significant in mother-child familial pairs, after correcting for multiple comparisons. Higher mother adversity was associated with lower mother-child methylation similarity for the epigenome-wide analysis, for the BDNF gene, and in the neglect-control group for the OXTR gene. In turn, being an older child (longer co-residence) was associated with higher mother-child methylation similarity.Mother adversity and co-residence time are modulating factors in the intergenerational methylation process that offer a window into development-dependent adaptations that can be affected by both hereditary and environmental factors, significantly observed only in biological dyads. A twofold implication for child well-being emerges, one is positive in that children of mothers exposed to life adversity or neglect did not necessarily inherit their methylation patterns. The other is concerning due to the influence of time spent living together, which affects similarity with the mother and potentially increases the risk of inheriting an epigenetic profile associated with future dysfunctional parenting patterns. This underscores the importance of the 'the earlier, the better' recommendation by the Child Protection System, which is not always followed.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.9999999065095014
38508332,Periodic magnetic modulation enhanced electrochemical analysis for highly sensitive determination of genomic DNA methylation.,Anal Biochem,"DNA methylation aberrations have a strong correlation with cancer in early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis, which make them possible candidate biomarkers. Electrochemical biosensors offer rapid protocols for detecting DNA methylation status with minimal pretreatment of samples. However, the inevitable presence of background current in the time domain, including electrochemical noise and variations, limits the detection performance of these biosensors, especially for low concentration analytes. Here, we propose an ultrasensitive frequency-domain electrochemical analysis strategy to effectively separate the weak signals from background current. To achieve this, we employed periodic magnetic field modulation of magnetic beads (MBs) on and off the electrode surface to generate a periodic electrochemical signal for subsequent frequency-domain analysis. By capturing labeled MBs with as low as 0.5 pg of DNA, we successfully demonstrated a highly sensitive electrochemical method for determination of genome-wide DNA methylation levels. We also validated the effectiveness of this methodology using DNA samples extracted from three types of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. The results revealed varying genomic methylation levels among different HCC cell lines, indicating the potential application of this approach for early-stage cancer detection in terms of DNA methylation status.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

38507065,DNA methylation profiling identifies epigenetic signatures of early gastric cancer.,Virchows Arch,"Research on the DNA methylation status of gastric cancer (GC) has primarily focused on identifying invasive GC to develop biomarkers for diagnostic. However, DNA methylation in noninvasive GC remains unclear. We conducted a comprehensive DNA methylation profiling study of differentiated-type intramucosal GCs (IMCs). Illumina 850K microarrays were utilized to assess the DNA methylation profiles of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from eight patients who were Epstein-Barr virus-negative and DNA mismatch repair proficient, including IMCs and paired adjacent nontumor mucosa. Gene expression profiling microarray data from the GEO database were analyzed via bioinformatics to identify candidate methylation genes. The final validation was conducted using quantitative real-time PCR, the TCGA methylation database, and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling revealed a global decrease in methylation in IMCs compared with nontumor tissues. Differential methylation analysis between IMCs and nontumor tissues identified 449 differentially methylated probes, with a majority of sites showing hypomethylation in IMCs compared with nontumor tissues (66.1% vs 33.9%). Integrating two RNA-seq microarray datasets, we found one hypomethylation-upregulated gene: eEF1A2, overlapped with our DNA methylation data. The mRNA expression of eEF1A2 was higher in twenty-four IMC tissues than in their paired adjacent nontumor tissues. GSEA indicated that the functions of eEF1A2 were associated with the development of IMCs. Furthermore, TCGA data indicated that eEF1A2 is hypomethylated in advanced GC. Our study illustrates the implications of DNA methylation alterations in IMCs and suggests that aberrant hypomethylation and high mRNA expression of eEF1A2 might play a role in IMCs development.© 2024.

38507014,The association between DNA methylation and human height and a prospective model of DNA methylation-based height prediction.,Hum Genet,"As a vital anthropometric characteristic, human height information not only helps to understand overall developmental status and genetic risk factors, but is also important for forensic DNA phenotyping. We utilized linear regression analysis to test the association between each CpG probe and the height phenotype. Next, we designed a methylation sequencing panel targeting 959 CpGs and subsequent height inference models were constructed for the Chinese population. A total of 11,730 height-associated sites were identified. By employing KPCA and deep neural networks, a prediction model was developed, of which the cross-validation RMSE, MAE and R2were 5.62 cm, 4.45 cm and 0.64, respectively. Genetic factors could explain 39.4% of the methylation level variance of sites used in the height inference models. Collectively, we demonstrated an association between height and DNA methylation status through an EWAS analysis. Targeted methylation sequencing of only 959 CpGs combined with deep learning techniques could provide a model to estimate human height with higher accuracy than SNP-based prediction models.© 2024.

38505948,A subtype of schizophrenia patients with altered methylation level of genes related to immune cell activity.,Psychol Med,"Epigenetic changes are plausible molecular sources of clinical heterogeneity in schizophrenia. A subgroup of schizophrenia patients with elevated inflammatory or immune-dysregulation has been reported by previous studies. However, little is known about epigenetic changes in genes related to immune activation in never-treated first-episode patients with schizophrenia (FES) and its consistency with that in treated long-term ill (LTS) patients.In this study, epigenome-wide profiling with a DNA methylation array was applied using blood samples of both FES and LTS patients, as well as their corresponding healthy controls. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) andk-means clustering were performed to parse heterogeneity of schizophrenia, and the consistency of subtyping results from two cohorts. was tested.This study identified a subtype of patients in FES participants (47.5%) that exhibited widespread methylation level alterations of genes enriched in immune cell activity and a significantly higher proportion of neutrophils. This clustering of FES patients was validated in LTS patients, with high correspondence in epigenetic and clinical features across two cohorts.In summary, this study demonstrated a subtype of schizophrenia patients across both FES and LTS cohorts, defined by widespread alterations in methylation profile of genes related to immune function and distinguishing clinical features. This finding illustrates the promise of novel treatment strategies targeting immune dysregulation for a subpopulation of schizophrenia patients.",1.9049909340113713e-21
38505098,Alterations of DNA methylation profile in peripheral blood of children with simple obesity.,Health Inf Sci Syst,"To investigate the association between DNA methylation and childhood simple obesity.Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation was conducted on peripheral blood samples from 41 children with simple obesity and 31 normal controls to identify differentially methylated sites (DMS). Subsequently, gene functional analysis of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) was carried out. After screening the characteristic DMGs based on specific conditions, the methylated levels of these DMS were evaluated and verified by pyrosequencing. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis assessed the predictive efficacy of corresponding DMGs. Finally, Pearson correlation analysis revealed the correlation between specific DMS and clinical data.The overall DNA methylation level in the obesity group was significantly lower than in normal. A total of 241 DMS were identified. Functional pathway analysis revealed that DMGs were primarily involved in lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, human diseases, among other pathways. The characteristic DMS within the genes Transcription factor A mitochondrial (TFAM) and Piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1(PIEZO1) were recognized as CpG-cg05831083 and CpG-cg14926485, respectively. Furthermore, the methylation level of CpG-cg05831083 significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI) and vitamin D.Abnormal DNA methylation is closely related to childhood simple obesity. The altered methylation of CpG-cg05831083 and CpG-cg14926485 could potentially serve as biomarkers for childhood simple obesity.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13755-024-00275-w.© The Author(s) 2024.",4.0722729531288556e-05
38503926,Sex effects on DNA methylation affect discovery in epigenome-wide association study of schizophrenia.,Mol Psychiatry,"Sex differences in the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of schizophrenia are well-known; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. Further, the potential advantages of sex-stratified meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of schizophrenia have not been investigated. Here, we performed sex-stratified EWAS meta-analyses to investigate whether sex stratification improves discovery, and to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in schizophrenia. Peripheral blood-derived DNA methylation data from 1519 cases of schizophrenia (male n = 989, female n = 530) and 1723 controls (male n = 997, female n = 726) from three publicly available datasets, and the TOP cohort were meta-analyzed to compare sex-specific, sex-stratified, and sex-adjusted EWAS. The predictive power of each model was assessed by polymethylation score (PMS). The number of schizophrenia-associated differentially methylated positions identified was higher for the sex-stratified model than for the sex-adjusted one. We identified 20 schizophrenia-associated DMRs in the sex-stratified analysis. PMS from sex-stratified analysis outperformed that from sex-adjusted analysis in predicting schizophrenia. Notably, PMSs from the sex-stratified and female-only analyses, but not those from sex-adjusted or the male-only analyses, significantly predicted schizophrenia in males. The findings suggest that sex-stratified EWAS meta-analyses improve the identification of schizophrenia-associated epigenetic changes and highlight an interaction between sex and schizophrenia status on DNA methylation. Sex-specific DNA methylation may have potential implications for precision psychiatry and the development of stratified treatments for schizophrenia.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.9999999999999998
38502355,Genome-wide analyses reveal the regulatory roles of DNA methylation-regulated alternative promoter transcripts in breast cancer.,Hum Genet,"A certain proportion of genes are regulated by multiple, distinct promoters, revealing a dynamic landscape of the cancer transcriptome. However, the contribution of alternative promoters (APs) in breast cancer (BRCA) remains largely unexplored. Here, we identified 3654 genes with multiple promoters in BRCA patients, and 53 of them could generate distinct AP transcripts that are dysregulated and prognosis-related in BRCA, namely prognosis-related dysregulated AP (prdeAP) transcripts. Interestingly, when we searched for the genomic signatures of these prdeAP genes, we found that the promoter regions of 92% of the prdeAP genes were enriched with abundant DNA methylation signals. Through further bioinformatic analysis and experimental validation, we showed that AP selections of TANK, UNKL, CCL28, and MAP1LC3A were regulated by DNA methylation upon their corresponding promoter regions. Functionally, by overexpressing AP variants of TANK, we found that TANK|55731 could dramatically suppress MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation and migration. Meanwhile, pan-cancer survival analyses suggested that AP variants of TANK provided more accurate prognostic predictive ability than TANK gene in a variety of tumor types, including BRCA. Together, by uncovering the DNA methylation-regulated AP transcripts with tumor prognostic features, our work revealed a novel layer of regulators in BRCA progression and provided potential targets that served as effective biomarkers for anti-BRCA treatment.© 2024.

38499886,Severe induction of aberrant DNA methylation by nodular gastritis in adults.,J Gastroenterol,"Nodular gastritis (NG) is characterized by marked antral lymphoid follicle formation, and is a strong risk factor for diffuse-type gastric cancer in adults. However, it is unknown whether aberrant DNA methylation, which is induced by atrophic gastritis (AG) and is a risk for gastric cancer, is induced by NG. Here, we analyzed methylation induction by NG.Gastric mucosal samples were obtained from non-cancerous antral tissues of 16 NG and 20 AG patients with gastric cancer and 5 NG and 6 AG patients without, all age- and gender-matched. Genome-wide methylation analysis and expression analysis were conducted by a BeadChip array and RNA-sequencing, respectively.Clustering analysis of non-cancerous antral tissues of NG and AG patients with gastric cancer was conducted using methylation levels of 585 promoter CpG islands (CGIs) of methylation-resistant genes, and a large fraction of NG samples formed a cluster with strong methylation induction. Promoter CGIs of CDH1 and DAPK1 tumor-suppressor genes were more methylated in NG than in AG. Notably, methylation levels of these genes were also higher in the antrum of NG patients without cancer. Genes related to lymphoid follicle formation, such as CXCL13/CXCR5 and CXCL12/CXCR4, had higher expression in NG, and genes involved in DNA demethylation TET2 and IDH1, had only half the expression in NG.Severe aberrant methylation, involving multiple tumor-suppressor genes, was induced in the gastric antrum and body of patients with NG, in accordance with their high gastric cancer risk.© 2024.

38497317,Global level of methylation in the sea lamprey (jawless vertebrate) genome is intermediate between invertebrate and jawed vertebrate genomes.,J Exp Zool B Mol Dev Evol,"In eukaryotes, cytosine methylation is a primary heritable epigenetic modification of the genome that regulates many cellular processes. In invertebrate, methylated cytosine generally located on specific genomic elements (e.g., gene bodies and silenced repetitive elements) to show a ""mosaic"" pattern. While in jawed vertebrate (teleost and tetrapod), highly methylated cytosine located genome-wide but only absence at regulatory regions (e.g., promoter and enhancer). Many studies imply that the evolution of DNA methylation reprogramming may have helped the transition from invertebrates to jawed vertebrates, but the detail remains largely elusive. In this study, we used the whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing technology to investigate the genome-wide methylation in three tissues (heart, muscle, and sperm) from the sea lamprey, an extant agnathan (jawless) vertebrate. Strikingly, we found that the methylation level of the sea lamprey is very similar to that in sea urchin (a deuterostome) and sea squirt (a chordate) invertebrates. In sum, the global pattern in sea lamprey is intermediate methylation level (around 30%), that is higher than methylation level in the genomes of pre-bilaterians and protostomes (1%-10%), but lower than methylation level appeared in jawed vertebrates (around 70%, teleost and tetrapod). We anticipate that, in addition to genetic dynamics such as genome duplications, epigenetic dynamics such as global methylation reprograming was also orchestrated toward the emergence and evolution of vertebrates.© 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",4.407661232923558e-09
38496462,An integrative multi-context Mendelian randomization method for identifying risk genes across human tissues.,medRxiv,"Mendelian randomization (MR) provides valuable assessments of the causal effect of exposure on outcome, yet the application of conventional MR methods for mapping risk genes encounters new challenges. One of the issues is the limited availability of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as instrumental variables (IVs), hampering the estimation of sparse causal effects. Additionally, the often context/tissue-specific eQTL effects challenge the MR assumption of consistent IV effects across eQTL and GWAS data. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-context multivariable integrative MR framework, mintMR, for mapping expression and molecular traits as joint exposures. It models the effects of molecular exposures across multiple tissues in each gene region, while simultaneously estimating across multiple gene regions. It uses eQTLs with consistent effects across more than one tissue type as IVs, improving IV consistency. A major innovation of mintMR involves employing multi-view learning methods to collectively model latent indicators of disease relevance across multiple tissues, molecular traits, and gene regions. The multi-view learning captures the major patterns of disease-relevance and uses these patterns to update the estimated tissue relevance probabilities. The proposed mintMR iterates between performing a multi-tissue MR for each gene region and joint learning the disease-relevant tissue probabilities across gene regions, improving the estimation of sparse effects across genes. We apply mintMR to evaluate the causal effects of gene expression and DNA methylation for 35 complex traits using multi-tissue QTLs as IVs. The proposed mintMR controls genome-wide inflation and offers new insights into disease mechanisms.",6.223245666892934e-25

Motivated by the multi-tissue methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) and expression QTLs (eQTLs) analysis, we propose X-ING (Cross-INtegrative Genomics) for cross-omics and cross-context integrative analysis. X-ING takes as input multiple matrices of association statistics, each obtained from different omics data types across multiple cellular contexts. It models the latent binary association status of each statistic, captures the major association patterns among omics data types and contexts, and outputs the posterior mean and probability for each input statistic. X-ING enables the integration of effects from different omics data with varying effect distributions. In the multi-tissue cis-association analysis, X-ING shows improved detection and replication of mQTLs by integrating eQTL maps. In the trans-association analysis, X-ING reveals an enrichment of trans-associations in many disease/trait-relevant tissues.© 2024. The Author(s).",5.96055823106144e-11
38490207,The association of cigarette smoking with DNA methylation and gene expression in human tissue samples.,Am J Hum Genet,"Cigarette smoking adversely affects many aspects of human health, and epigenetic responses to smoking may reflect mechanisms that mediate or defend against these effects. Prior studies of smoking and DNA methylation (DNAm), typically measured in leukocytes, have identified numerous smoking-associated regions (e.g., AHRR). To identify smoking-associated DNAm features in typically inaccessible tissues, we generated array-based DNAm data for 916 tissue samples from the GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) project representing 9 tissue types (lung, colon, ovary, prostate, blood, breast, testis, kidney, and muscle). We identified 6,350 smoking-associated CpGs in lung tissue (n = 212) and 2,735 in colon tissue (n = 210), most not reported previously. For all 7 other tissue types (sample sizes 38-153), no clear associations were observed (false discovery rate 0.05), but some tissues showed enrichment for smoking-associated CpGs reported previously. For 1,646 loci (in lung) and 22 (in colon), smoking was associated with both DNAm and local gene expression. For loci detected in both lung and colon (e.g., AHRR, CYP1B1, CYP1A1), top CpGs often differed between tissues, but similar clusters of hyper- or hypomethylated CpGs were observed, with hypomethylation at regulatory elements corresponding to increased expression. For lung tissue, 17 hallmark gene sets were enriched for smoking-associated CpGs, including xenobiotic- and cancer-related gene sets. At least four smoking-associated regions in lung were impacted by lung methylation quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that co-localize with genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals for lung function (FEV1/FVC), suggesting epigenetic alterations can mediate the effects of smoking on lung health. Our multi-tissue approach has identified smoking-associated regions in disease-relevant tissues, including effects that are shared across tissue types.Copyright © 2024 American Society of Human Genetics.

Previously, we identified multiple differentially methylated single CpG sites in offspring of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but whether stretches of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) can also be identified in adolescent GDM offspring is unknown. Here, we investigate which DNA regions in adolescent offspring are differentially methylated in blood by exposure to diabetes in pregnancy. The secondary aim was to characterize the RNA expression of the identified DMR, which contained the nc886 non-coding RNA.To identify DMRs, we employed the bump hunter method in samples from young (9-16 yr, n = 92) offspring of women with GDM (O-GDM) and control offspring (n = 94). Validation by pyrosequencing was performed in an adult offspring cohort (age 28-33 years) consisting of O-GDM (n = 82), offspring exposed to maternal type 1 diabetes (O-T1D, n = 67) and control offspring (O-BP, n = 57). RNA-expression was measured using RT-qPCR in subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.One significant DMR represented by 10 CpGs with a bimodal methylation pattern was identified, located in the nc886/VTRNA2-1 non-coding RNA gene. Low methylation status across all CpGs of the nc886 in the young offspring was associated with maternal GDM. While low methylation degree in adult offspring in blood, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle was not associated with maternal GDM, adipose tissue nc886 expression was increased in O-GDM compared to O-BP, but not in O-T1D. In addition, adipose tissue nc886 expression levels were positively associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (p = 0.006), but not with the offspring's own adiposity.Our results highlight that nc886 is a metastable epiallele, whose methylation in young offspring is negatively correlated with maternal obesity and GDM status. The physiological effect of nc886 may be more important in adipose tissue than in skeletal muscle. Further research should aim to investigate how nc886 regulation in adipose tissue by exposure to GDM may contribute to development of metabolic disease.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.020015879522563756
38654298,Immune escape of multiple myeloma cells results from low miR29b and the ensuing epigenetic silencing of proteasome genes.,Biomark Res,"Activation of CD28 on multiple myeloma (MM) plasma cells, by binding to CD80 and CD86 on dendritic cells, decreases proteasome subunit expression in the tumor cells and thereby helps them evade being killed by CD8+T cells. Understanding how CD28 activation leads to proteasome subunit downregulation is needed to design new MM therapies.This study investigates the molecular pathway downstream of CD28 activation, using an in vitro model consisting of myeloma cell lines stimulated with anti-CD28-coated beads.We show that CD28 engagement on U266 and RPMI 8226 cells activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, reduces miR29b expression, increases the expression of DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B, a target of miR29b), and decreases immunoproteasome subunit expression. In vitro transfection of U266 and RPMI 8226 cells with a miR29b mimic downregulates the PI3K/AKT pathway and DNMT3B expression, restores proteasome subunit levels, and promotes myeloma cell killing by bone marrow CD8+T cells from MM patients. Freshly purified bone marrow plasma cells (CD138+) from MM patients have lower miR29b and higher DNMT3B (mRNA and protein) than do cells from patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Finally, in MM patients, high DNMT3B levels associate with shorter overall survival.Altogether, this study describes a novel molecular pathway in MM. This pathway starts from CD28 expressed on tumor plasma cells and, through the PI3K-miR29b-DNMT3B axis, leads to epigenetic silencing of immunoproteasome subunits, allowing MM plasma cells to elude immunosurveillance. This discovery has implications for the design of innovative miR29b-based therapies for MM.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.1633477210519556e-69
38559770,Exposure to air pollution is associated with DNA methylation changes in sperm.,Environ Epigenet,"Exposure to air pollutants has been associated with adverse health outcomes in adults and children who were prenatally exposed. In addition to reducing exposure to air pollutants, it is important to identify their biologic targets in order to mitigate the health consequences of exposure. One molecular change associated with prenatal exposure to air pollutants is DNA methylation (DNAm), which has been associated with changes in placenta and cord blood tissues at birth. However, little is known about how air pollution exposure impacts the sperm epigenome, which could provide important insights into the mechanism of transmission to offspring. In the present study, we explored whether exposure to particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter, particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), or ozone (O3) was associated with DNAm in sperm contributed by participants in the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation prospective pregnancy cohort. Air pollution exposure measurements were calculated as the average exposure for each pollutant measured within 4 weeks prior to the date of sample collection. Using array-based genome-scale methylation analyses, we identified 80, 96, 35, and 67 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) significantly associated with particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter, particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter, NO2, and O3,respectively. While no DMRs were associated with exposure to all four pollutants, we found that genes overlapping exposure-related DMRs had a shared enrichment for gene ontology biological processes related to neurodevelopment. Together, these data provide compelling support for the hypothesis that paternal exposure to air pollution impacts DNAm in sperm, particularly in regions implicated in neurodevelopment.© The Author(s) 2024.

38571311,DNA methylation episignature and comparative epigenomic profiling for Pitt-Hopkins syndrome caused by TCF4 variants.,HGG Adv,"Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by pathogenic variants in TCF4, leading to intellectual disability, specific morphological features, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Epigenetic dysregulation has been implicated in PTHS, prompting the investigation of a DNA methylation (DNAm) ""episignature"" specific to PTHS for diagnostic purposes and variant reclassification and functional insights into the molecular pathophysiology of this disorder. A cohort of 67 individuals with genetically confirmed PTHS and three individuals with intellectual disability and a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) in TCF4 were studied. The DNAm episignature was developed with an Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip array analysis using peripheral blood cells. Support vector machine (SVM) modeling and clustering methods were employed to generate a DNAm classifier for PTHS. Validation was extended to an additional cohort of 11 individuals with PTHS. The episignature was assessed in relation to other neurodevelopmental disorders and its specificity was examined. A specific DNAm episignature for PTHS was established. The classifier exhibited high sensitivity for TCF4 haploinsufficiency and missense variants in the basic-helix-loop-helix domain. Notably, seven individuals with TCF4 variants exhibited negative episignatures, suggesting complexities related to mosaicism, genetic factors, and environmental influences. The episignature displayed degrees of overlap with other related disorders and biological pathways. This study defines a DNAm episignature for TCF4-related PTHS, enabling improved diagnostic accuracy and VUS reclassification. The finding that some cases scored negatively underscores the potential for multiple or nested episignatures and emphasizes the need for continued investigation to enhance specificity and coverage across PTHS-related variants.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

38566132,Conserved methylation signatures associate with the tumor immune microenvironment and immunotherapy response.,Genome Med,"Aberrant DNA methylation is a major characteristic of cancer genomes. It remains unclear which biological processes determine epigenetic reprogramming and how these processes influence the variants in the cancer methylome, which can further impact cancer phenotypes.We performed pairwise permutations of 381,900 loci in 569 paired DNA methylation profiles of cancer tissue and matched normal tissue from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and defined conserved differentially methylated positions (DMPs) based on the resulting null distribution. Then, we derived independent methylation signatures from 2,465 cancer-only methylation profiles from the TCGA and 241 cell line-based methylation profiles from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) cohort using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). We correlated DNA methylation signatures with various clinical and biological features, including age, survival, cancer stage, tumor immune microenvironment factors, and immunotherapy response. We inferred the determinant genes of these methylation signatures by integrating genomic and transcriptomic data and evaluated the impact of these signatures on cancer phenotypes in independent bulk and single-cell RNA/methylome cohorts.We identified 7,364 differentially methylated positions (2,969 Hyper-DMPs and 4,395 Hypo-DMPs) in nine cancer types from the TCGA. We subsequently retrieved three highly conserved, independent methylation signatures (Hyper-MS1, Hypo-MS1, and Hypo-MS4) from cancer tissues and cell lines based on these Hyper and Hypo-DMPs. Our data suggested that Hypo-MS4 activity predicts poor survival and is associated with immunotherapy response and distant tumor metastasis, and Hypo-MS4 activity is related to TP53 mutation and FOXA1 binding specificity. In addition, we demonstrated a correlation between the activities of Hypo-MS4 in cancer cells and the fractions of regulatory CD4 + T cells with the expression levels of immunological genes in the tumor immune microenvironment.Our findings demonstrated that the methylation signatures of distinct biological processes are associated with immune activity in the cancer microenvironment and predict immunotherapy response.© 2024.

38594674,"Proteomic studies of VEGFR2 in human placentas reveal protein associations with preeclampsia, diabetes, gravidity, and labor.",Cell Commun Signal,"VEGFR2 (Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2) is a central regulator of placental angiogenesis. The study of the VEGFR2 proteome of chorionic villi at term revealed its partners MDMX (Double minute 4 protein) and PICALM (Phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein). Subsequently, the oxytocin receptor (OT-R) and vasopressin V1aR receptor were detected in MDMX and PICALM immunoprecipitations. Immunogold electron microscopy showed VEGFR2 on endothelial cell (EC) nuclei, mitochondria, and Hofbauer cells (HC), tissue-resident macrophages of the placenta. MDMX, PICALM, and V1aR were located on EC plasma membranes, nuclei, and HC nuclei. Unexpectedly, PICALM and OT-R were detected on EC projections into the fetal lumen and OT-R on 20-150 nm clusters therein, prompting the hypothesis that placental exosomes transport OT-R to the fetus and across the blood-brain barrier. Insights on gestational complications were gained by univariable and multivariable regression analyses associating preeclampsia with lower MDMX protein levels in membrane extracts of chorionic villi, and lower MDMX, PICALM, OT-R, and V1aR with spontaneous vaginal deliveries compared to cesarean deliveries before the onset of labor. We found select associations between higher MDMX, PICALM, OT-R protein levels and either gravidity, diabetes, BMI, maternal age, or neonatal weight, and correlations only between PICALM-OT-R (p < 2.7 × 10-8), PICALM-V1aR (p < 0.006), and OT-R-V1aR (p < 0.001). These results offer for exploration new partnerships in metabolic networks, tissue-resident immunity, and labor, notably for HC that predominantly express MDMX.© 2024.

The incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is also on the rise. AD is a kind of neurodegenerative disease that can be found in any age group. For years, scientists have been committing to discovering the cause of AD. DNA methylation is one of the most common epigenetic mechanisms in mammals and plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including tumors. Studying chemical changes in the epigenome, or DNA methylation can help us understand the effects of our environment and life on diseases, such as smoking, depression, and menopause, which may affect people's chances of developing Alzheimer's or other diseases. Recent studies have identified some crucial genes likeANK1,RHBDF2,ABCA7, andBIN1, linking DNA methylation to AD. This review focuses on elucidating the relationship between DNA methylation and the pathogenesis of AD and provides an outlook on possible targeted therapeutic modalities.© 2023 The Authors.

38689990,"Preterm birth, a consequence of immune deviation mediated hyperinflammation.",Heliyon,"Preterm birth represents a multifaceted syndrome with intricacies still present in our comprehension of its etiology. In the context of a semi-allograft, the prosperity from implantation to pregnancy to delivery hinges on the establishment of a favorable maternal-fetal immune microenvironment and a successful trilogy of immune activation, immune tolerance and then immune activation transitions. The occurrence of spontaneous preterm birth could be related to abnormalities within the immune trilogy, stemming from deviation in maternal and fetal immunity. These immune deviations, characterized by insufficient immune tolerance and early immune activation, ultimately culminated in an unsustainable pregnancy. In this review, we accentuated the role of both innate and adaptive immune reason in promoting spontaneous preterm birth, reviewed the risk of preterm birth from vaginal microbiome mediated by immune changes and the potential of vaginal microbiomes and metabolites as a new predictive marker, and discuss the changes in the role of progesterone and its interaction with immune cells in a preterm birth population. Our objective was to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the field, shedding light on the immunologic reason of spontaneous preterm birth and effective biomarkers for early prediction, providing a roadmap for forthcoming investigations.© 2024 The Authors.",9.916849851886644e-30
38580766,Epigenetic Responses to Nonchemical Stressors: Potential Molecular Links to Perinatal Health Outcomes.,Curr Environ Health Rep,"We summarize the recent literature investigating exposure to four nonchemical stressors (financial stress, racism, psychosocial stress, and trauma) and DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and mRNA expression. We also highlight the relationships between these epigenetic changes and six critical perinatal outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, childhood allergic disease, and childhood neurocognition).Multiple studies have found financial stress, psychosocial stress, and trauma to be associated with DNA methylation and/or miRNA and mRNA expression. Fewer studies have investigated the effects of racism. The majority of studies assessed epigenetic or genomic changes in maternal blood, cord blood, or placenta. Several studies included multi-OMIC assessments in which DNA methylation and/or miRNA expression were associated with gene expression. There is strong evidence for the role of epigenetics in driving the health outcomes considered. A total of 22 biomarkers, including numerous HPA axis genes, were identified to be epigenetically altered by both stressors and outcomes. Epigenetic changes related to inflammation, the immune and endocrine systems, and cell growth and survival were highlighted across numerous studies. Maternal exposure to nonchemical stressors is associated with epigenetic and/or genomic changes in a tissue-specific manner among inflammatory, immune, endocrine, and cell growth-related pathways, which may act as mediating pathways to perinatal health outcomes. Future research can test the mediating role of the specific biomarkers identified as linked with both stressors and outcomes. Understanding underlying epigenetic mechanisms altered by nonchemical stressors can provide a better understanding of how chemical and nonchemical exposures interact.© 2024.

In 1967, Dr. Bixler published a case report on a chimpanzee with implanted brain electrodes while working at an Air Force base in New Mexico. A few years later, in 1971, he published on the sleep effects of flurazepam in individuals with insomnia together with Dr. Anthony Kales, data that he had collected when the Sleep Research & Treatment Center (SRTC) was housed at the University of California Los Angeles. Dr. Bixler, a meticulous scientist, learned from Dr. Kales, a devoted clinician, to study ""the whole patient, and all aspects of sleep,"" a legacy that continued when the SRTC moved to Penn State in Hershey. Indeed, Dr. Bixler's tenure at Penn State from 1971 until 2019 kept the science of the SRTC focused on that premise and helped translate scientific evidence into clinical care. He not only contributed early to the pharmacology of sleep and the effects of hypnotics, but he was also a pioneer in ""sleep epidemiology."" His ""Prevalence of sleep disorders in the Los Angeles metropolitan area"" study of 1979 was the first rigorous epidemiological study on sleep disturbances. Starting in 1990, he established the Penn State Adult Cohort to estimate the prevalence and natural history of sleep-disordered breathing and other sleep disorders in adults. Inspired by life-course epidemiology, he established in 2001 the Penn State Child Cohort to estimate the same phenomena in children.

38589929,"Meta-analysis of epigenetic aging in schizophrenia reveals multifaceted relationships with age, sex, illness duration, and polygenic risk.",Clin Epigenetics,"The study of biological age acceleration may help identify at-risk individuals and reduce the rising global burden of age-related diseases. Using DNA methylation (DNAm) clocks, we investigated biological aging in schizophrenia (SCZ), a mental illness that is associated with an increased prevalence of age-related disabilities and morbidities. In a whole blood DNAm sample of 1090 SCZ cases and 1206 controls across four European cohorts, we performed a meta-analysis of differential aging using three DNAm clocks (i.e., Hannum, Horvath, and Levine). To dissect how DNAm aging contributes to SCZ, we integrated information on duration of illness and SCZ polygenic risk, as well as stratified our analyses by chronological age and biological sex.We found that blood-based DNAm aging is significantly altered in SCZ independent from duration of the illness since onset. We observed sex-specific and nonlinear age effects that differed between clocks and point to possible distinct age windows of altered aging in SCZ. Most notably, intrinsic cellular age (Horvath clock) is decelerated in SCZ cases in young adulthood, while phenotypic age (Levine clock) is accelerated in later adulthood compared to controls. Accelerated phenotypic aging was most pronounced in women with SCZ carrying a high polygenic burden with an age acceleration of + 3.82 years (CI 2.02-5.61, P = 1.1E-03). Phenotypic aging and SCZ polygenic risk contributed additively to the illness and together explained up to 14.38% of the variance in disease status.Our study contributes to the growing body of evidence of altered DNAm aging in SCZ and points to intrinsic age deceleration in younger adulthood and phenotypic age acceleration in later adulthood in SCZ. Since increased phenotypic age is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, our findings indicate that specific and identifiable patient groups are at increased mortality risk as measured by the Levine clock. Our study did not find that DNAm aging could be explained by the duration of illness of patients, but we did observe age- and sex-specific effects that warrant further investigation. Finally, our results show that combining genetic and epigenetic predictors can improve predictions of disease outcomes and may help with disease management in schizophrenia.© 2024.

38736015,Reliable detection of stochastic epigenetic mutations and associations with cardiovascular aging.,Geroscience,"Stochastic epigenetic mutations (SEMs) have been proposed as novel aging biomarkers to capture heterogeneity in age-related DNA methylation changes. SEMs are defined as outlier methylation patterns at cytosine-guanine dinucleotide sites, categorized as hypermethylated (hyperSEM) or hypomethylated (hypoSEM) relative to a reference. Because SEMs are defined by their outlier status, it is critical to differentiate extreme values due to technical noise or data artifacts from those due to real biology. Using technical replicate data, we found SEM detection is not reliable: across 3 datasets, 24 to 39% of hypoSEM and 46 to 67% of hyperSEM are not shared between replicates. We identified factors influencing SEM reliability-including blood cell type composition, probe beta-value statistics, genomic location, and presence of SNPs. We used these factors in a training dataset to build a machine learning-based filter that removes unreliable SEMs, and found this filter enhances reliability in two independent validation datasets. We assessed associations between SEM loads and aging phenotypes in the Framingham Heart Study and discovered that associations with aging outcomes were in large part driven by hypoSEMs at baseline methylated probes and hyperSEMs at baseline unmethylated probes, which are the same subsets that demonstrate highest technical reliability. These aging associations were preserved after filtering out unreliable SEMs and were enhanced after adjusting for blood cell composition. Finally, we utilized these insights to formulate best practices for SEM detection and introduce a novel R package, SEMdetectR, which uses parallel programming for efficient SEM detection with comprehensive options for detection, filtering, and analysis.© 2024.

38724736,Aging clocks based on accumulating stochastic variation.,Nat Aging,"Aging clocks have provided one of the most important recent breakthroughs in the biology of aging, and may provide indicators for the effectiveness of interventions in the aging process and preventive treatments for age-related diseases. The reproducibility of accurate aging clocks has reinvigorated the debate on whether a programmed process underlies aging. Here we show that accumulating stochastic variation in purely simulated data is sufficient to build aging clocks, and that first-generation and second-generation aging clocks are compatible with the accumulation of stochastic variation in DNA methylation or transcriptomic data. We find that accumulating stochastic variation is sufficient to predict chronological and biological age, indicated by significant prediction differences in smoking, calorie restriction, heterochronic parabiosis and partial reprogramming. Although our simulations may not explicitly rule out a programmed aging process, our results suggest that stochastically accumulating changes in any set of data that have a ground state at age zero are sufficient for generating aging clocks.© 2024.

Here, to clarify the nature of epigenetic aging, we juxtapose the dynamics of tissue and single-cell DNAm in mice. We compare these changes during early development with those observed during adult aging in mice, and corroborate our analyses with a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis within the same multiomics dataset. We show that epigenetic aging involves co-regulated changes as well as a major stochastic component, and this is consistent with transcriptional patterns. We further support the finding of stochastic epigenetic aging by direct tissue and single-cell DNAm analyses and modeling of aging DNAm trajectories with a stochastic process akin to radiocarbon decay. Finally, we describe a single-cell algorithm for the identification of co-regulated and stochastic CpG clusters showing consistent transcriptomic coordination patterns. Together, our analyses increase our understanding of the basis of epigenetic clocks and highlight potential opportunities for targeting aging and evaluating longevity interventions.© 2024.

38724732,Quantifying the stochastic component of epigenetic aging.,Nat Aging,"DNA methylation clocks can accurately estimate chronological age and, to some extent, also biological age, yet the process by which age-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) changes are acquired appears to be quasi-stochastic, raising a fundamental question: how much of an epigenetic clock's predictive accuracy could be explained by a stochastic process of DNAm change? Here, using DNAm data from sorted immune cells, we build realistic simulation models, subsequently demonstrating in over 22,770 sorted and whole-blood samples from 25 independent cohorts that approximately 66-75% of the accuracy underpinning Horvath's clock could be driven by a stochastic process. This fraction increases to 90% for the more accurate Zhang's clock, but is lower (63%) for the PhenoAge clock, suggesting that biological aging is reflected by nonstochastic processes. Confirming this, we demonstrate that Horvath's age acceleration in males and PhenoAge's age acceleration in severe coronavirus disease 2019 cases and smokers are not driven by an increased rate of stochastic change but by nonstochastic processes.

Recent advances in epigenomic array technologies have made it possible to generate DNA methylation-based biomarkers of biological aging, which may be useful in predicting a myriad of cognitive abilities and functional brain network organization across older individuals. It is currently unclear which cognitive domains are negatively correlated with epigenetic age above and beyond chronological age, and it is unknown if functional brain organization is an important mechanism for explaining these associations.

As assessed by DunedinPACE, female veterans were aging faster than male veterans (β = 0.39, 95 % CI [0.29, 0.48], p < .001), non-Hispanic Black veterans were aging faster than non-Hispanic White veterans (β = 0.58, 95 % CI [0.50, 0.66], p < .001), and older veterans were biologically aging faster than younger veterans (β = 0.21, 95 % CI [0.18, 0.25], p < .001). In secondary analyses, these differences in rates of aging were not explained by a variety of biopsychosocial covariates. In addition, the percentage of European genetic admixture in non-Hispanic Black veterans was not associated with DunedinPACE.

This gap highlights the need for comprehensive solutions that can handle the complexity and variety of data in aging research.To address this gap, I introduce pyaging, a comprehensive open-source Python package designed to facilitate aging research. pyaging harmonizes dozens of aging clocks, covering a range of molecular data types such as DNA methylation, transcriptomics, histone mark ChIP-Seq, and ATAC-Seq. The package is not limited to traditional model types; it features a diverse array, from linear and principal component models to neural networks and automatic relevance determination models. Thanks to a PyTorch-based backend that enables GPU acceleration, pyaging is capable of rapid inference, even when dealing with large datasets and complex models. In addition, the package's support for multi-species analysis extends its utility across various organisms, including humans, various mammals, and Caenorhabditis elegans.pyaging is accessible on GitHub, at https://github.com/rsinghlab/pyaging, and the distribution is available on PyPi, at https://pypi.org/project/pyaging/.

38601732,DNA methylation-based biomarkers for cardiometabolic-related traits and their importance for risk stratification.,Curr Opin Epidemiol Public Health,"The prevalence of cardiometabolic syndrome in adults is increasing worldwide, highlighting the importance of biomarkers for individuals' classification based on their health status. Although cardiometabolic risk scores and diagnostic criteria have been developed aggregating adverse health effects of individual conditions on the overall syndrome, none of them has gained unanimous acceptance. Therefore, novel molecular biomarkers have been developed to better understand the risk, onset and progression of both individual conditions and the overall cardiometabolic syndrome.Consistent associations between whole blood DNA methylation (DNAm) levels at several single genomic (i.e. CpG) sites and both individual and aggregated cardiometabolic conditions supported the creation of second-generation DNAm-based cardiometabolic-related biomarkers. These biomarkers linearly combine individual DNAm levels from key CpG sites, selected by a two-step machine learning procedures. They can be used, even retrospectively, in populations with extant whole blood DNAm levels and without observed cardiometabolic phenotypes.Here we offer an overview of the second-generation DNAm-based cardiometabolic biomarkers, discussing methodological advancements and implications on the interpretation and generalizability of the findings. We finally emphasize the contribution of DNAm-based biomarkers for risk stratification beyond traditional factors and discuss limitations and future directions of the field.",1.466928200360062e-07
38596364,The embodiment of parental death in early life through accelerated epigenetic aging: Implications for understanding how parental death before 18 shapes age-related health risk among older adults.,SSM Popul Health,"Parental death in early life has been linked to various adverse health outcomes in older adulthood. This study extends prior research to evaluate how parental death in early life is tied to accelerated epigenetic aging, a potentially important biological mechanism from which social and environmental exposures impact age-related health. We used data from the 2016 Venous Blood Study (VBS), a component of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), to examine the association between parental death in early life and accelerated epigenetic aging as measured by three widely used epigenetic clocks (PCPhenoAge, PCGrimAge, and DunedinPACE). We also assessed whether some of the association is explained by differences in educational attainment, depressive symptoms, and smoking behavior. Methods included a series of linear regression models and formal mediation analysis. Findings indicated that parental death in early life is associated with accelerated epigenetic aging for PCPhenoAge and DunedinPACE. The inclusion of educational attainment, depressive symptoms, and smoking behavior attenuated this association, with formal mediation analysis providing additional support for these observations. Parental death in early life may be one of the most difficult experiences an individual may face. The elevated biological risk associated with parental death in early life may operate through immediate changes but also through more downstream risk factors. This study highlights how early life adversity can set in motion biological changes that have lifelong consequences.© 2024 The Authors.",0.12956097936760233
38589672,The association between blood biological age at rehabilitation admission and physical activity during rehabilitation in geriatric inpatients: RESORT.,Geroscience,"Geriatric rehabilitation inpatients have high levels of sedentary behaviour (SB) and low levels of physical activity (PA). Biological age predicted by blood biomarkers is indicative of adverse outcomes. The objective was to determine the association between blood biological age at rehabilitation admission and levels of SB and PA during rehabilitation in geriatric inpatients. Inpatients admitted to geriatric rehabilitation wards at the Royal Melbourne Hospital (Melbourne, Australia) from October 22, 2019, to March 29, 2020, in the REStORing health of acute unwell adulTs (RESORT) observational cohort were included. Blood biological age was predicted using SenoClock-BloodAge, a hematological ageing clock. Patients wore an inertial sensor to measure SB and PA. Logistic regression analyses were conducted. A total of 111 patients (57.7% female) with mean age 83.3 ± 7.5 years were included in the analysis. The mean blood biological age was 82.7 ± 8.4 years. Patients with 1-year higher blood biological age had higher odds of having high SB measured as non-upright time greater than 23 h/day (odds ratio (OR): 1.050, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.000-1.102). Individuals having 1-year higher age deviation trended towards lower odds of having high levels of PA measured as stepping time greater than 7.4 min/day (OR: 0.916, CI: 0.836-1.005) and as greater than 19.5 sit-to-stand transitions/day (OR: 0.915, CI: 0.836-1.002). In conclusion, higher biological age was associated with higher levels of SB and trended towards lower PA. Incorporating blood biological age could facilitate resource allocation and the development of more tailored rehabilitation plans.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.9999999891504926
38588424,Pregnancy is linked to faster epigenetic aging in young women.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"A central prediction of evolutionary theory is that energy invested into reproduction comes at the expense of somatic maintenance and repair, accelerating biological aging. Supporting this prediction are findings that high fertility among women predicts shorter lifespan and poorer health later in life. However, biological aging is thought to begin before age-related health declines, limiting the applicability of morbidity and mortality for studying the aging process earlier in life. Here, we examine the relationship between reproductive history and biological aging in a sample of young (20 to 22yo) men and women from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, located in the Philippines (n = 1,735). We quantify biological aging using six measures, collectively known as epigenetic clocks, reflecting various facets of cellular aging, health, and mortality risk. In a subset of women, we test whether longitudinal changes in gravidity between young and early-middle adulthood (25 to 31yo) are associated with changes in epigenetic aging during that time. Cross-sectionally, gravidity was associated with all six measures of accelerated epigenetic aging in women (n = 825). Furthermore, longitudinal increases in gravidity were linked to accelerated epigenetic aging in two epigenetic clocks (n = 331). In contrast, the number of pregnancies a man reported fathering was not associated with epigenetic aging among same-aged cohort men (n = 910). These effects were robust to socioecological, environmental, and immunological factors, consistent with the hypothesis that pregnancy accelerates biological aging and that these effects can be detected in young women in a high-fertility context.",0.9999224043062532

Regular exercise has been proven to make intervention plans more successful and prolong adherence to them. When it comes to epigenetic changes, there are four primary components. This includes changes to the DNA, histones, expression of particular non-coding RNAs and DNA methylation. External triggers, such as physical activity, can lead to modifications in the epigenetic components, resulting in changes in the transcription process.

38586008,Linked emergence of racial disparities in mental health and epigenetic biological aging across childhood and adolescence.,bioRxiv,"Marginalization due to structural racism may confer an increased risk for aging-related diseases - in part - via effects on people's mental health. Here we leverage a prospective birth cohort study to examine whether the emergence of racial disparities in mental health and DNA-methylation measures of biological aging (i.e.,DunedinPACE, GrimAge Acceleration, PhenoAge Acceleration) are linked across childhood and adolescence. We further consider to what extent racial disparities are statistically accounted for by perinatal and postnatal factors in preregistered analyses of N=4,898 participants from the Future of Families & Child Wellbeing Study, of which N=2,039 had repeated saliva DNA methylation at ages 9 and 15 years. We find that racially marginalized children had higher levels of externalizing and internalizing behaviors and diverging longitudinal internalizing slopes. Black compared to White identifying children, children living in more racially segregated neighborhoods, and racially marginalized children more affected by colorism tended to have higher age-9 levels of biological aging and more biological age acceleration over adolescence. Notably, longitudinal increases in internalizing and externalizing behavior were correlated with longitudinal increases in biological aging. While racial and ethnic disparities in mental health were largely statistically accounted for by socioeconomic variables, racial differences in biological aging were often still visible beyond covariate controls. Our findings indicate that racial disparities in mental health and biological aging are linked and emerge early in life. Programs promoting racial health equity must address the psychological and physical impacts of structural racism in children. Comprehensive measures of racism are lacking in current population cohorts.",0.9999999999998981
38581608,The AccelerAge framework: a new statistical approach to predict biological age based on time-to-event data.,Eur J Epidemiol,"Aging is a multifaceted and intricate physiological process characterized by a gradual decline in functional capacity, leading to increased susceptibility to diseases and mortality. While chronological age serves as a strong risk factor for age-related health conditions, considerable heterogeneity exists in the aging trajectories of individuals, suggesting that biological age may provide a more nuanced understanding of the aging process. However, the concept of biological age lacks a clear operationalization, leading to the development of various biological age predictors without a solid statistical foundation. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a comprehensive operationalization of biological age, introducing the ""AccelerAge"" framework for predicting biological age, and introducing previously underutilized evaluation measures for assessing the performance of biological age predictors. The AccelerAge framework, based on Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) models, directly models the effect of candidate predictors of aging on an individual's survival time, aligning with the prevalent metaphor of aging as a clock. We compare predictors based on the AccelerAge framework to a predictor based on the GrimAge predictor, which is considered one of the best-performing biological age predictors, using simulated data as well as data from the UK Biobank and the Leiden Longevity Study. Our approach seeks to establish a robust statistical foundation for biological age clocks, enabling a more accurate and interpretable assessment of an individual's aging status.© 2024.

38559237,What makes clocks tick? Characterizing developmental dynamics of adult epigenetic clock sites.,bioRxiv,"DNA methylation (DNAm) at specific sites can be used to calculate 'epigenetic clocks', which in adulthood are used as indicators of age(ing). However, little is known about how these clock sites 'behave' during development and what factors influence their variability in early life. This knowledge could be used to optimize healthy aging well before the onset of age-related conditions. Here, we leveraged results from two longitudinal population-based cohorts (N=5,019 samples from 2,348 individuals) to characterize trajectories of adult clock sites from birth to early adulthood. We find that clock sites (i) diverge widely in their developmental trajectories, often showing non-linear change over time; (ii) are substantially more likely than non-clock sites to vary between individuals already from birth, differences that are predictive of DNAm variation at later ages; and (iii) show enrichment for genetic and prenatal environmental exposures, supporting an early-origins perspective to epigenetic aging.",0.9999682832366287
38553617,Associations of seven measures of biological age acceleration with frailty and all-cause mortality among adult survivors of childhood cancer in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort.,Nat Cancer,"Survivors of childhood cancer may experience accelerated biological aging, resulting in premature frailty and death. We used seven measures of biological age in the St. Jude Lifetime (SJLIFE) Cohort to compare biological age acceleration between the SJLIFE Cohort and the third United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey controls, explore trajectories of biological age according to cancer treatment and type, and test associations of biological age acceleration with frailty and death (mean follow-up of 26.5 years) among survivors. Survivors of cancer aged 5% faster per year and measured, on average, 0.6-6.44 years biologically older compared to controls and 5-16 years biologically older compared to age-matched individuals at the population level. Survivors treated with hematopoietic cell transplant and vinca alkaloid chemotherapy evidenced the fastest trajectories of biological aging. Biologically, older and faster-aging survivors consistently and robustly had a higher risk of frailty and died earlier than those with slower biological aging, suggesting a potential opportunity to intervene on excess aging.© 2024.

38546907,Combined aerobic and strength exercise training on biological ageing in Singaporean breast cancer patients: protocol for the Breast Cancer Exercise Intervention (BREXINT) Pilot Study.,Geroscience,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most prominent cancer amongst women, but fortunately, early diagnosis and advances in multimodality treatments have improved patient survivability. Cancer survivors, however, experience increased biological ageing which may accelerate other co-morbidities. Exercise intervention is a promising clinical adjuvant approach to improve BC patients' physiological function, recovery from treatment, and quality of life. However, the effects of combined aerobic and strength exercise training on biological ageing in BC patients have not been studied. The Breast Cancer Exercise Intervention (BREXINT) Pilot Study will evaluate the effects of a 24-week combined aerobic and strength exercise intervention against usual care in 50 BC patients' post-treatment randomised to either group. The primary outcomes include changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, cancer-related symptoms, and rate of biological ageing following exercise intervention period. The secondary outcomes include habitual physical activity measured with tri-axial accelerometery and supporting questionnaires, including physical activity, food diary, and quality of life questionnaires. This study will identify the effects of combined aerobic exercise strength training on biological ageing in BC patients from Singapore. Results from this study could further support the implementation of regular exercise programmes as routine care for cancer patients.© 2024.

38517750,Multi-omics characterization of partial chemical reprogramming reveals evidence of cell rejuvenation.,Elife,"Partial reprogramming by cyclic short-term expression of Yamanaka factors holds promise for shifting cells to younger states and consequently delaying the onset of many diseases of aging. However, the delivery of transgenes and potential risk of teratoma formation present challenges for in vivo applications. Recent advances include the use of cocktails of compounds to reprogram somatic cells, but the characteristics and mechanisms of partial cellular reprogramming by chemicals remain unclear. Here, we report a multi-omics characterization of partial chemical reprogramming in fibroblasts from young and aged mice. We measured the effects of partial chemical reprogramming on the epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, phosphoproteome, and metabolome. At the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome levels, we saw widescale changes induced by this treatment, with the most notable signature being an upregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, at the metabolome level, we observed a reduction in the accumulation of aging-related metabolites. Using both transcriptomic and epigenetic clock-based analyses, we show that partial chemical reprogramming reduces the biological age of mouse fibroblasts. We demonstrate that these changes have functional impacts, as evidenced by changes in cellular respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, these results illuminate the potential for chemical reprogramming reagents to rejuvenate aged biological systems and warrant further investigation into adapting these approaches for in vivo age reversal.© 2023, Mitchell et al.",2.4341124702244447e-38
38509146,Utilizing epigenetics to study the shared nature of development and biological aging across the lifespan.,NPJ Sci Learn,"Recently, biological aging has been quantified in DNA-methylation samples of older adults and applied as so-called ""methylation profile scores"" (MPSs) in separate target samples, including samples of children. This nascent research indicates that (1) biological aging can be quantified early in the life course, decades before the onset of aging-related disease, (2) is affected by common environmental predictors of childhood development, and (3) shows overlap with ""developmental processes"" (e.g., puberty). Because the MPSs were computed using algorithms developed in adults, these studies indicate a molecular link between childhood environments, development, and adult biological aging. Yet, if MPSs can be used to connect development and aging, previous research has only traveled one way, deriving MPSs developed in adults and applying them to samples of children. Researchers have not yet quantified epigenetic measures that reflect the pace of child development, and tested whether resulting MPSs are associated with physical and psychological aging. In this perspective I posit that combining measures of biological aging with new quantifications of child development has the power to address fundamental questions about life span: How are development and experience in childhood related to biological aging in adulthood?

38494514,Maternal obesity and placental function: impaired maternal-fetal axis.,Arch Gynecol Obstet,"The prevalence of maternal obesity rapidly increases, which represents a major public health concern worldwide. Maternal obesity is characteristic by metabolic dysfunction and chronic inflammation. It is associated with health problems in both mother and offspring. Increasing evidence indicates that the placenta is an axis connecting maternal obesity with poor outcomes in the offspring. In this brief review, we have summarized the current data regarding deregulated placental function in maternal obesity. The data show that maternal obesity induces numerous placental defects, including lipid and glucose metabolism, stress response, inflammation, immune regulation and epigenetics. These placental defects affect each other and result in a stressful intrauterine environment, which transduces and mediates the adverse effects of maternal obesity to the fetus. Further investigations are required to explore the exact molecular alterations in the placenta in maternal obesity, which may pave the way to develop specific interventions for preventing epigenetic and metabolic programming in the fetus.© 2024.

38699338,The peripheral epigenome predicts white matter volume contingent on developmental stage: An ECHO study.,Res Sq,"Epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, are emerging as key areas of interest for their potential roles as biomarkers and contributors to the risk of neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, and other brain-based disorders. Despite this growing focus, there remains a notable gap in our understanding of how DNA methylation correlates with individual variations in brain function and structure. Additionally, the dynamics of these relationships during developmental periods, which are critical windows during which many disorders first appear, are still largely unexplored. The current study extends the field by examining if peripheral DNA methylation of myelination-related genes predicts white matter volume in a healthy pediatric population [N = 250; females = 113; age range 2 months-14 years;Mage= 5.14,SDage= 3.60]. We assessed if DNA methylation of 17 myelin-related genes predict white matter volume and if age moderates these relationships. Results highlight low variability in myelin-related epigenetic variance at birth, which rapidly increases non-linearly with age, and that DNA methylation, measured at both the level of a CpG site or gene, is highly predictive of white matter volume, in early childhood but not late childhood. These novel findings propel the field forward by establishing that DNA methylation of myelin-related genes from a peripheral tissue is a predictive marker of white matter volume in children and is influenced by developmental stage. The research underscores the significance of peripheral epigenetic patterns as a proxy for investigating the effects of environmental factors, behaviors, and disorders associated with white matter.",2.062848287181701e-05

This article will describe genomic analytic methods to be utilized in this longitudinal, randomized clinical trial of older adult AA women in Chicago and NYC that examines the effect of the RiSE intervention on DNAm pre- and post-intervention, and its overall influence on inflammatory burden. Salivary DNAm will be measured at baseline and 6 months following the intervention, using the Oragene-DNA kit. Measures of perceived stress, depressive symptoms, fatigue, sleep, inflammatory burden, and coping strategies will be assessed at 4 time points including at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 6 months. Genomic data analysis will include the use of pre-processed and quality-controlled methylation data expressed as beta (β) values. Association analyses will be performed to detect differentially methylated sites on the targeted candidate genes between the intervention and non-intervention groups using the Δβ (changes in methylation) with adjustment for age, health behaviors, early life adversity, hybridization batch, and top principal components of the probes as covariates. To account for multiple testing, we will use FDR adjustment with a corrected p-value of <0.05 regarded as statistically significant. To assess the relationship between inflammatory burden and Δβ among the study samples, we will repeat association analyses with the inclusion of individual inflammation protein measures. ANCOVA will be used because it is more statistically powerful to detect differences.Copyright: © 2024 Taylor et al.

38516039,Correlation of telomere length in brain tissue with peripheral tissues in living human subjects.,Front Mol Neurosci,"Telomeres are important to chromosomal stability, and changes in their length correlate with disease, potentially relevant to brain disorders. Assessing telomere length in human brain is invasive, but whether peripheral tissue telomere length correlates with that in brain is not known. Saliva, buccal, blood, and brain samples were collected at time points before, during, and after subjects undergoing neurosurgery (n= 35) for intractable epilepsy. DNA was isolated from samples and average telomere length assessed by qPCR. Correlations of telomere length between tissue samples were calculated across subjects. When data were stratified by sex, saliva telomere length correlated with brain telomere length in males only. Buccal telomere length correlated with brain telomere length when males and females were combined. These findings indicate that in living subjects, telomere length in peripheral tissues variably correlates with that in brain and may be dependent on sex. Peripheral tissue telomere length may provide insight into brain telomere length, relevant to assessment of brain disorder pathophysiology.Copyright © 2024 Carver, Hing, Elser, Lussier, Yamanashi, Howard, Kawasaki, Shinozaki and Stevens.",5.774676979638292e-05
38581061,Increased DNA methylation contributes to the early ripening of pear fruits during domestication and improvement.,Genome Biol,"DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic modification. However, its contribution to trait changes and diversity in the domestication of perennial fruit trees remains unknown.Here, we investigate the variation in DNA methylation during pear domestication and improvement using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in 41 pear accessions. Contrary to the significant decrease during rice domestication, we detect a global increase in DNA methylation during pear domestication and improvement. We find this specific increase in pear is significantly correlated with the downregulation of Demeter-like1 (DML1, encoding DNA demethylase) due to human selection. We identify a total of 5591 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Methylation in the CG and CHG contexts undergoes co-evolution during pear domestication and improvement. DMRs have higher genetic diversity than selection sweep regions, especially in the introns. Approximately 97% of DMRs are not associated with any SNPs, and these DMRs are associated with starch and sucrose metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. We also perform correlation analysis between DNA methylation and gene expression. We find genes close to the hypermethylated DMRs that are significantly associated with fruit ripening. We further verify the function of a hyper-DMR-associated gene, CAMTA2, and demonstrate that overexpression of CAMTA2 in tomato and pear callus inhibits fruit ripening.Our study describes a specific pattern of DNA methylation in the domestication and improvement of a perennial pear tree and suggests that increased DNA methylation plays an essential role in the early ripening of pear fruits.© 2024.

Few dynamic molecular signatures have gained widespread acceptance in mainstream clinical testing despite the discovery of many potential candidates. These unmet needs with respect to biomarker and drug discovery of AMI necessitate a prioritization. We enrolled patients with AMI aged between 30 and 70. RNA-seq analysis was performed on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from the patients at three time points: 1 day, 7 days, and 3 months after AMI. PLC/LC-MS analysis was conducted on the peripheral blood plasma collected from these patients at the same three time points. Differential genes and metabolites between groups were screened by bio-informatics methods to understand the dynamic changes of AMI in different periods. We obtained 15 transcriptional and 95 metabolite expression profiles at three time points after AMI through high-throughput sequencing. AMI-1d: enrichment analysis revealed the biological features of 1 day after AMI primarily included acute inflammatory response, elevated glycerophospholipid metabolism, and decreased protein synthesis capacity. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) might stand promising biomarkers to differentiate post-AMI stage. Anti-inflammatory therapy during the acute phase is an important direction for preventing related pathology. AMI-7d: the biological features of this stage primarily involved the initiation of cardiac fibrosis response and activation of platelet adhesion pathways. Accompanied by upregulated TGF-beta signaling pathway and ECM receptor interaction, GP5 help assess platelet activation, a potential therapeutic target to improve haemostasis. AMI-3m: the biological features of 3 months after AMI primarily showed a vascular regeneration response with VEGF signaling pathway, NOS3 and SHC2 widely activated, which holds promise for providing new therapeutic approaches for AMI. Our analysis highlights transcriptional and metabolomics signatures at different time points after MI, which deepens our understanding of the dynamic biological responses and associated molecular mechanisms that occur during cardiac repair.© 2024.

38722936,Conditional independence as a statistical assessment of evidence integration processes.,PLoS One,"Intuitively, combining multiple sources of evidence should lead to more accurate decisions than considering single sources of evidence individually. In practice, however, the proper computation may be difficult, or may require additional data that are inaccessible. Here, based on the concept of conditional independence, we consider expressions that can serve either as recipes for integrating evidence based on limited data, or as statistical benchmarks for characterizing evidence integration processes. Consider three events, A, B, and C. We find that, if A and B are conditionally independent with respect to C, then the probability that C occurs given that both A and B are known, P(C|A, B), can be easily calculated without the need to measure the full three-way dependency between A, B, and C. This simplified approach can be used in two general ways: to generate predictions by combining multiple (conditionally independent) sources of evidence, or to test whether separate sources of evidence are functionally independent of each other. These applications are demonstrated with four computer-simulated examples, which include detecting a disease based on repeated diagnostic testing, inferring biological age based on multiple biomarkers of aging, discriminating two spatial locations based on multiple cue stimuli (multisensory integration), and examining how behavioral performance in a visual search task depends on selection histories. Besides providing a sound prescription for predicting outcomes, this methodology may be useful for analyzing experimental data of many types.Copyright: © 2024 Salinas, Stanford.

38718072,"Evaluation of DNAmAge in paired fresh, frozen, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded heart tissues.",PLoS One,"The continued development in methylome analysis has enabled a more precise assessment of DNA methylation, but treatment of target tissue prior to analysis may affect DNA analysis. Prediction of age based on methylation levels in the genome (DNAmAge) has gained much interest in disease predisposition (biological age estimation), but also in chronological donor age estimation in crime case samples. Various epigenetic clocks were designed to predict the age. However, it remains unknown how the storage of the tissues affects the DNAmAge estimation. In this study, we investigated the storage method impact of DNAmAge by the comparing the DNAmAge of the two commonly used storage methods, freezing and formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding (FFPE) to DNAmAge of fresh tissue. This was carried out by comparing paired heart tissue samples of fresh tissue, samples stored by freezing and FFPE to chronological age and whole blood samples from the same individuals. Illumina EPIC beadchip array was used for methylation analysis and the DNAmAge was evaluated with the following epigenetic clocks: Horvath, Hannum, Levine, Horvath skin+blood clock (Horvath2), PedBE, Wu, BLUP, EN, and TL. We observed differences in DNAmAge among the storage conditions. FFPE samples showed a lower DNAmAge compared to that of frozen and fresh samples. Additionally, the DNAmAge of the heart tissue was lower than that of the whole blood and the chronological age. This highlights caution when evaluating DNAmAge for FFPE samples as the results were underestimated compared with fresh and frozen tissue samples. Furthermore, the study also emphasizes the need for a DNAmAge model based on heart tissue samples for an accurate age estimation.Copyright: © 2024 Pruszkowska-Przybylska et al.

This study aimed to investigate the potential association between biological aging and periodontitis. Epidemiological data from 9803 participants in the 2009-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed at a cross-sectional level to assess this link. Three biological ages [Klemera-Doubal method (KDM), PhenoAge, and homeostatic dysregulation (HD)] and two measures of accelerated biological aging (BioAgeAccel and PhenoAgeAccel) were set as primary exposure and were calculated. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline regression were employed to examine the relationship between biological aging and periodontitis. Additionally, Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted to explore the causal connection between accelerated biological aging and periodontitis. After adjusting for age, gender, race, educational level, marital status, ratio of family income, and disease conditions, this study, found a significant association between subjects with older higher biological ages, accelerated biological aging, and periodontitis. Specifically, for a per year increase in the three biological ages (HD, KDM, and PhenoAge), the risk of periodontitis increases by 15%, 3%, and 4% respectively. Individuals who had positive BioAgeAccel or PhenoAgeAccel were 20% or 37% more likely to develop periodontitis compared with those who had negative BioAgeAccel or PhenoAgeAccel. Furthermore, a significant non-linear positive relationship was observed between the three biological ages, accelerated biological aging, and periodontitis.

Our findings suggest that biological aging may contribute to the risk of periodontitis, highlighting the potential utility of preventive strategies targeting aging-related pathways in reducing periodontitis risk among older adults.© 2024.

38698194,Association between biological aging and diabetic retinopathy.,Sci Rep,"The impact of aging on diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains underestimated. The current study aimed to investigate the association between biological aging and DR, in contrast to chronological age (CA). Using the National Health and Nutrition Survey data from 2005 to 2008. Biological aging was evaluated through the biological age (BA) and phenotypic age (PA), which were calculated from clinical markers. DR was identified in participants with diabetes mellitus (DM) when they exhibited one or more retinal microaneurysms or retinal blot hemorrhages under retinal imaging, with or without the presence of more severe lesions. Survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression was performed, and the regression model was further fitted using restricted cubic splines. The discriminatory capability and clinical utility of the model were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). Based on weighted analyses, of the 3100 participants included in this study, of which 162 had DR. In the adjusted model, BA (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12, 95% CI, 1.06-1.18) and PA (OR = 1.11, 95% CI, 1.07-1.14) were associated with DR, while CA was not significantly (OR = 1.01, 95% CI, 0.99-1.03). Narrowing the analysis to DM participants and adjusting for factors like insulin showed similar results. ROC and DCA analyses indicate that BA/PA predicted DR better than CA and offer greater clinical utility. The positive association between BA/PA and DR was consistent across subgroups despite potential interactions. Biological aging heightens DR risk, with BA/PA showing a stronger association than CA. Our findings underscored the importance of timely anti-aging interventions for preventing DR.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.4961535968982111e-24
38687190,Associations of combined phenotypic aging and genetic risk with incident cancer: A prospective cohort study.,Elife,"Age is the most important risk factor for cancer, but aging rates are heterogeneous across individuals. We explored a new measure of aging-Phenotypic Age (PhenoAge)-in the risk prediction of site-specific and overall cancer.Using Cox regression models, we examined the association of Phenotypic Age Acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel) with cancer incidence by genetic risk group among 374,463 participants from the UK Biobank. We generated PhenoAge using chronological age and nine biomarkers, PhenoAgeAccel after subtracting the effect of chronological age by regression residual, and an incidence-weighted overall cancer polygenic risk score (CPRS) based on 20 cancer site-specific polygenic risk scores (PRSs).Compared with biologically younger participants, those older had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.27) in men, and 1.26 (1.22-1.31) in women, respectively. A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel was observed on overall cancer risk, with HRs of 2.29 (2.10-2.51) for men and 1.94 (1.78-2.11) for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge compared with those with low genetic risk and younger PhenoAge. PhenoAgeAccel was negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors (Beta = -1.01 in men, p<0.001; Beta = -0.98 in women, p<0.001).Within and across genetic risk groups, older PhenoAge was consistently related to an increased risk of incident cancer with adjustment for chronological age and the aging process could be retarded by adherence to a healthy lifestyle.This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82230110, 82125033, 82388102 to GJ; 82273714 to MZ); and the Excellent Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20220100 to MZ).© 2024, Bian, Ma et al.",0.41632145996112213

We examined how cell-type proportions derived from the transcriptome versus the methylome (DNAm) influence estimates of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated positions (DMPs).Transcriptome and DNAm data were obtained from PBMC RNA and DNA of Kenyan children (n = 8) before, during, and 6 weeks following uncomplicated malaria. DEGs and DMPs between time points were detected using cell-type adjusted modeling with Cibersortx or IDOL, respectively.Most major cell types and principal components had moderate to high correlation between the two deconvolution methods (r = 0.60-0.96). Estimates of cell-type proportions and DEGs or DMPs were largely unaffected by the method, with the greatest discrepancy in the estimation of neutrophils.Variation in cell-type proportions is captured similarly by both transcriptomic and methylome deconvolution methods for most major cell types.",0.8579894718658482
38637469,"[Genetics, epigenetics, and environmental factors in life expectancy-What role does nature-versus-nurture play in aging?].",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,"In Germany and worldwide, the average age of the population is continuously rising. With this general increase in chronological age, the focus on biological age, meaning the actual health and fitness status, is becoming more and more important. The key question is to what extent the age-related decline in fitness is genetically predetermined or malleable by environmental factors and lifestyle.Many epigenetic studies in aging research have provided interesting insights in this nature-versus-nurture debate. In most model organisms, aging is associated with specific epigenetic changes, which can be countered by certain interventions like moderate caloric restriction or increased physical activity. Since these interventions also have positive effects on lifespan and health, epigenetics appears to be the interface between environmental factors and the aging process. This notion is supported by the fact that an epigenetic drift occurs through the life course of identical twins, which is related to the different manifestations of aging symptoms. Furthermore, biological age can be determined with high precision based on DNA methylation patterns, further emphasizing the importance of epigenetics in aging.This article provides an overview of the importance of genetic and epigenetic parameters for life expectancy. A major focus will be on the possibilities of maintaining a young epigenome through lifestyle and environmental factors, thereby slowing down biological aging.© 2024.

Here we tested the ability of a novel estimate of fitness age (FitAge) to differentiate aging trajectories.This study aimed at (1) testing the ability of FitAge to differentiate aging patterns among decelerated, normal, and accelerated agers in selected health domains, (2) estimating the risk for developing major health issues depending on the aging trajectory, and (3) comparing FitAge to body mass index (BMI) categorization in differentiating healthy from unhealthy aging patterns.A total of 176 volunteers participated in this cross-sectional study. Participants underwent clinical screening and a comprehensive assessment of body composition, nutritional and health-related status, cognitive functioning, and haematochemical analyses with routine tests, oxidative stress, and inflammation markers. Scores for major health risks were also computed.FitAge outperformed BMI in estimating major health risk scores and was able to differentiate decelerated from normal and accelerated agers for health risk profile and several physiological domains. Body composition, immune system activation, and inflammation markers emerged as those variables flagging the largest differences between decelerated and accelerated aging patterns.The novel estimate of biological aging can accurately differentiate both in women and men decelerated from accelerated agers in almost all the domains scrutinized. Overall, decelerated aging is linked to positively oriented features which associate with reduced risk of developing major health issues.The present findings have potential relevance and practical implications to identify individuals at higher risk of accelerated aging according to their FitAge estimated via simple and cost-effective motor tests.© 2024.

To address this lack of reproducibility, we established a community resource for comparing Bordetella pertussis booster responses and to host annual contests for predicting patients' vaccination outcomes. We report here on our experiences with the ""dry-run"" prediction contest. We found that, among 20+ models adopted from the literature, the most successful model predicting vaccination outcome was based on age alone. This confirms our concerns about the reproducibility of conclusions between different vaccinology studies. Further, we found that, for newly trained models, handling of baseline information on the target variables was crucial. Overall, multiple co-inertia analysis gave the best results of the tested modeling approaches.

We propose a kernel-testing framework for non-linear cell-wise distribution comparison, analyzing gene expression and epigenomic modifications. Our method allows feature-wise and global transcriptome/epigenome comparisons, revealing cell population heterogeneities. Using a classifier based on embedding variability, we identify transitions in cell states, overcoming limitations of traditional single-cell analysis. Applied to single-cell ChIP-Seq data, our approach identifies untreated breast cancer cells with an epigenomic profile resembling persister cells.

The developmental genetic and cellular changes that led to the evolution of these traits are largely unknown. Recent syngnathid genomes revealed suggestive gene content differences and provide the opportunity for detailed genetic analyses. We created a single cell RNA sequencing atlas of Gulf pipefish embryos to understand the developmental basis of four traits: derived head shape, toothlessness, dermal armor, and male pregnancy. We completed marker gene analyses, built genetic networks, and examined spatial expression of select genes. We identified osteochondrogenic mesenchymal cells in the elongating face that express regulatory genesbmp4, sfrp1a, andprdm16. We found no evidence for tooth primordia cells, and we observed re-deployment of osteoblast genetic networks in developing dermal armor. Finally, we found that epidermal cells expressed nutrient processing and environmental sensing genes, potentially relevant for the brooding environment. The examined pipefish evolutionary innovations are composed of recognizable cell types, suggesting derived features originate from changes within existing gene networks. Future work addressing syngnathid gene networks across multiple stages and species is essential for understanding how their novelties evolved.",6.294069976931037e-31
38745100,A spatial transcriptome map of the developing maize ear.,Nat Plants,"A comprehensive understanding of inflorescence development is crucial for crop genetic improvement, as inflorescence meristems give rise to reproductive organs and determine grain yield. However, dissecting inflorescence development at the cellular level has been challenging owing to a lack of specific marker genes to distinguish among cell types, particularly in different types of meristems that are vital for organ formation. In this study, we used spatial enhanced resolution omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq) to construct a precise spatial transcriptome map of the developing maize ear primordium, identifying 12 cell types, including 4 newly defined cell types found mainly in the inflorescence meristem. By extracting the meristem components for detailed clustering, we identified three subtypes of meristem and validated two MADS-box genes that were specifically expressed at the apex of determinate meristems and involved in stem cell determinacy. Furthermore, by integrating single-cell RNA transcriptomes, we identified a series of spatially specific networks and hub genes that may provide new insights into the formation of different tissues. In summary, this study provides a valuable resource for research on cereal inflorescence development, offering new clues for yield improvement.© 2024.

38589509,Heritability of complex traits in sub-populations experiencing bottlenecks and growth.,J Hum Genet,"Populations that have experienced a bottleneck are regularly used in Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to investigate variants associated with complex traits. It is generally understood that these isolated sub-populations may experience high frequency of otherwise rare variants with large effect size, and therefore provide a unique opportunity to study said trait. However, the demographic history of the population under investigation affects all SNPs that determine the complex trait genome-wide, changing its heritability and genetic architecture. We use a simulation based approach to identify the impact of the demographic processes of drift, expansion, and migration on the heritability of complex trait. We show that demography has considerable impact on complex traits. We then investigate the power to resolve heritability of complex traits in GWAS studies subjected to demographic effects. We find that demography is an important component for interpreting inference of complex traits and has a nuanced impact on the power of GWAS. We conclude that demographic histories need to be explicitly modelled to properly quantify the history of selection on a complex trait.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.489859789616712e-23

Recent breakthroughs have made it possible to simulate and infer ARGs at biobank scale, and there is now intense interest in using ARG-based methods across a broad range of applications, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Sophisticated methods exist to simulate ARGs using population genetics models, but there is currently no software to simulate quantitative traits directly from these ARGs. To apply existing quantitative trait simulators users must export genotype data, losing important information about ancestral processes and producing prohibitively large files when applied to the biobank-scale datasets currently of interest in GWAS.

38536467,Cross-ancestry genetic architecture and prediction for cholesterol traits.,Hum Genet,"While cholesterol is essential, a high level of cholesterol is associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have proven successful in identifying genetic variants that are linked to cholesterol levels, predominantly in white European populations. However, the extent to which genetic effects on cholesterol vary across different ancestries remains largely unexplored. Here, we estimate cross-ancestry genetic correlation to address questions on how genetic effects are shared across ancestries. We find significant genetic heterogeneity between ancestries for cholesterol traits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with concordant effects across ancestries for cholesterol are more frequently found in regulatory regions compared to other genomic regions. Indeed, the positive genetic covariance between ancestries is mostly driven by the effects of the concordant SNPs, whereas the genetic heterogeneity is attributed to the discordant SNPs. We also show that the predictive ability of the concordant SNPs is significantly higher than the discordant SNPs in the cross-ancestry polygenic prediction. The list of concordant SNPs for cholesterol is available in GWAS Catalog. These findings have relevance for the understanding of shared genetic architecture across ancestries, contributing to the development of clinical strategies for polygenic prediction of cholesterol in cross-ancestral settings.© 2024.

38553564,Restoration of neuronal progenitors by partial reprogramming in the aged neurogenic niche.,Nat Aging,"Partial reprogramming (pulsed expression of reprogramming transcription factors) improves the function of several tissues in old mice. However, it remains largely unknown how partial reprogramming impacts the old brain. Here we use single-cell transcriptomics to systematically examine how partial reprogramming influences the subventricular zone neurogenic niche in aged mouse brains. Whole-body partial reprogramming mainly improves neuroblasts (cells committed to give rise to new neurons) in the old neurogenic niche, restoring neuroblast proportion to more youthful levels. Interestingly, targeting partial reprogramming specifically to the neurogenic niche also boosts the proportion of neuroblasts and their precursors (neural stem cells) in old mice and improves several molecular signatures of aging, suggesting that the beneficial effects of reprogramming are niche intrinsic. In old neural stem cell cultures, partial reprogramming cell autonomously restores the proportion of neuroblasts during differentiation and blunts some age-related transcriptomic changes. Importantly, partial reprogramming improves the production of new neurons in vitro and in old brains. Our work suggests that partial reprogramming could be used to rejuvenate the neurogenic niche and counter brain decline in old individuals.© 2024.

38519576,Role of folate receptor α in the partial rejuvenation of dentate gyrus cells: Improvement of cognitive function in 21-month-old aged mice.,Sci Rep,"Neuronal aging may be, in part, related to a change in DNA methylation. Thus, methyl donors, like folate and methionine, may play a role in cognitive changes associated to neuronal aging. To test the role of these metabolites, we performed stereotaxic microinjection of these molecules into the dentate gyrus (DG) of aged mice (an average age of 21 month). Folate, but not S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM), enhances cognition in aged mice. In the presence of folate, we observed partial rejuvenation of DG cells, characterized by the expression of juvenile genes or reorganization of extracellular matrix. Here, we have also tried to identify the mechanism independent of DNA methylation, that involve folate effects on cognition. Our analyses indicated that folate binds to folate receptor α (FRα) and, upon folate binding, FRα is transported to cell nucleus, where it is acting as transcription factor for expressing genes like SOX2 or GluN2B. In this work, we report that a FRα binding peptide also replicates the folate effect on cognition, in aged mice. Our data suggest that such effect is not sex-dependent. Thus, we propose the use of this peptide to improve cognition since it lacks of folate-mediated side effects. The use of synthetic FRα binding peptides emerge as a future strategy for the study of brain rejuvenation.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.1426804339213817e-26
38554236,A prospective study of smoking-related white blood cell DNA methylation markers and risk of bladder cancer.,Eur J Epidemiol,"Bladder cancer, a common neoplasm, is primarily caused by tobacco smoking. Epigenetic alterations including DNA methylation have the potential to be used as prospective markers of increased risk, particularly in at-risk populations such as smokers. We aimed to investigate the potential of smoking-related white blood cell (WBC) methylation markers to contribute to an increase in bladder cancer risk prediction over classical questionnaire-based smoking metrics (i.e., duration, intensity, packyears) in a nested case-control study within the prospective prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial and the alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene cancer (ATBC) Prevention Study (789 cases; 849 controls). We identified 200 differentially methylated sites associated with smoking status and 28 significantly associated (after correction for multiple testing) with bladder cancer risk among 2670 previously reported smoking-related cytosine-phosphate-guanines sites (CpGs). Similar patterns were observed across cohorts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses indicated that cg05575921 (AHHR), the strongest smoking-related association we identified for bladder cancer risk, alone yielded similar predictive performance (AUC: 0.60) than classical smoking metrics (AUC: 0.59-0.62). Best prediction was achieved by including the first principal component (PC1) from the 200 smoking-related CpGs alongside smoking metrics (AUC: 0.63-0.65). Further, PC1 remained significantly associated with elevated bladder cancer risk after adjusting for smoking metrics. These findings suggest DNA methylation profiles reflect aspects of tobacco smoke exposure in addition to those captured by smoking duration, intensity and packyears, and/or individual susceptibility relevant to bladder cancer etiology, warranting further investigation.© 2024.

Chromatin complex compositions change during cellular differentiation and ageing, and are expected to be highly heterogeneous among terminally differentiated single cells4-7. Here we introduce the multinucleic acid interaction mapping in single cells (MUSIC) technique for concurrent profiling of multiplex chromatin interactions, gene expression and RNA-chromatin associations within individual nuclei. When applied to 14 human frontal cortex samples from older donors, MUSIC delineated diverse cortical cell types and states. We observed that nuclei exhibiting fewer short-range chromatin interactions were correlated with both an 'older' transcriptomic signature and Alzheimer's disease pathology. Furthermore, the cell type exhibiting chromatin contacts between cis expression quantitative trait loci and a promoter tends to be that in which these cis expression quantitative trait loci specifically affect the expression of their target gene. In addition, female cortical cells exhibit highly heterogeneous interactions between XIST non-coding RNA and chromosome X, along with diverse spatial organizations of the X chromosomes.

38724668,Tracking single-cell evolution using clock-like chromatin accessibility loci.,Nat Biotechnol,"Single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-seq) reconstructs developmental trajectory by phenotypic similarity. However, inferring the exact developmental trajectory is challenging. Previous studies showed age-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) changes in specific genomic regions, termed clock-like differential methylation loci (ClockDML). Age-associated DNAm could either result from or result in chromatin accessibility changes at ClockDML. As cells undergo mitosis, the heterogeneity of chromatin accessibility on clock-like loci is reduced, providing a measure of mitotic age. In this study, we developed a method, called EpiTrace, that counts the fraction of opened clock-like loci from scATAC-seq data to determine cell age and perform lineage tracing in various cell lineages and animal species. It shows concordance with known developmental hierarchies, correlates well with DNAm-based clocks and is complementary with mutation-based lineage tracing, RNA velocity and stemness predictions. Applying EpiTrace to scATAC-seq data reveals biological insights with clinically relevant implications, ranging from hematopoiesis, organ development, tumor biology and immunity to cortical gyrification.© 2024.

38645168,Age-Invariant Genes: Multi-Tissue Identification and Characterization of Murine Reference Genes.,bioRxiv,"Studies of the aging transcriptome focus on genes that change with age. But what can we learn from age-invariant genes-those that remain unchanged throughout the aging process? These genes also have a practical application: they serve as reference genes (often called housekeeping genes) in expression studies. Reference genes have mostly been identified and validated in young organisms, and no systematic investigation has been done across the lifespan. Here, we build upon a common pipeline for identifying reference genes in RNA-seq datasets to identify age-invariant genes across seventeen C57BL/6 mouse tissues (brain, lung, bone marrow, muscle, white blood cells, heart, small intestine, kidney, liver, pancreas, skin, brown, gonadal, marrow, and subcutaneous adipose tissue) spanning 1 to 21+ months of age. We identify 9 pan-tissue age-invariant genes and many tissue-specific age-invariant genes. These genes are stable across the lifespan and are validated in independent bulk RNA-seq datasets and RT-qPCR. We find age-invariant genes have shorter transcripts on average and are enriched for CpG islands. Interestingly, pathway enrichment analysis for age-invariant genes identifies an overrepresentation of molecular functions associated with some, but not all, hallmarks of aging. Thus, though hallmarks of aging typically involve changes in cell maintenance mechanisms, select genes associated with these hallmarks resist fluctuations in expression with age. Finally, our analysis concludes no classical reference gene is appropriate for aging studies in all tissues. Instead, we provide tissue-specific and pan-tissue genes for assays utilizing reference gene normalization (i.e., RT-qPCR) that can be applied to animals across the lifespan.",9.756166296099614e-28

This review comprehensively surveys recent human-centered studies that investigate whole genome DNA methylation in Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. The examination of various brain regions reveals distinctive DNA methylation patterns that associate with the Braak stage and Alzheimer's disease progression. The entorhinal cortex emerges as a focal point due to its early histological alterations and subsequent impact on downstream regions like the hippocampus. Notably, ANK1 hypermethylation, a protein implicated in neurofibrillary tangle formation, was recurrently identified in the entorhinal cortex. Further, the middle temporal gyrus and prefrontal cortex were shown to exhibit significant hypermethylation of genes like HOXA3, RHBDF2, and MCF2L, potentially influencing neuroinflammatory processes. The complex role of BIN1 in late-onset Alzheimer's disease is underscored by its association with altered methylation patterns. Despite the disparities across studies, these findings highlight the intricate interplay between epigenetic modifications and Alzheimer's disease pathology.

38730581,Serum Proteomic Signatures in Cervical Cancer: Current Status and Future Directions.,Cancers (Basel),"In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 604,000 new diagnoses of cervical cancer (CC) worldwide, and over 300,000 CC-related fatalities. The vast majority of CC cases are caused by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. HPV-related CC incidence and mortality rates have declined worldwide because of increased HPV vaccination and CC screening with the Papanicolaou test (PAP test). Despite these significant improvements, developing countries face difficulty implementing these programs, while developed nations are challenged with identifying HPV-independent cases. Molecular and proteomic information obtained from blood or tumor samples have a strong potential to provide information on malignancy progression and response to therapy in CC. There is a large amount of published biomarker data related to CC available but the extensive validation required by the FDA approval for clinical use is lacking. The ability of researchers to use the big data obtained from clinical studies and to draw meaningful relationships from these data are two obstacles that must be overcome for implementation into clinical practice.

38719509,Unveiling potential therapeutic targets for diabetes-induced frozen shoulder through Mendelian randomization analysis of the human plasma proteome.,BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care,"This study aimed to assess the causal relationship between diabetes and frozen shoulder by investigating the target proteins associated with diabetes and frozen shoulder in the human plasma proteome through Mendelian randomization (MR) and to reveal the corresponding pathological mechanisms.We employed the MR approach for the purposes of establishing: (1) the causal link between diabetes and frozen shoulder; (2) the plasma causal proteins associated with frozen shoulder; (3) the plasma target proteins associated with diabetes; and (4) the causal relationship between diabetes target proteins and frozen shoulder causal proteins. The MR results were validated and consolidated through colocalization analysis and protein-protein interaction network.Our MR analysis demonstrated a significant causal relationship between diabetes and frozen shoulder. We found that the plasma levels of four proteins were correlated with frozen shoulder at the Bonferroni significance level (p<3.03E-5). According to colocalization analysis, parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHLH) was moderately correlated with the genetic variance of frozen shoulder (posterior probability=0.68), while secreted frizzled-related protein 4 was highly correlated with the genetic variance of frozen shoulder (posterior probability=0.97). Additionally, nine plasma proteins were activated during diabetes-associated pathologies. Subsequent MR analysis of nine diabetic target proteins with four frozen shoulder causal proteins indicated that insulin receptor subunit alpha, interleukin-6 receptor subunit alpha, interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein, glutathione peroxidase 7, and PTHLH might contribute to the onset and progression of frozen shoulder induced by diabetes.Our study identified a causal relationship between diabetes and frozen shoulder, highlighting the pathological pathways through which diabetes influences frozen shoulder.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

38664626,Germline genetic regulation of the colorectal tumor immune microenvironment.,BMC Genomics,"To evaluate the contribution of germline genetics to regulating the briskness and diversity of T cell responses in CRC, we conducted a genome-wide association study to examine the associations between germline genetic variation and quantitative measures of T cell landscapes in 2,876 colorectal tumors from participants in the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Study (MECC).Germline DNA samples were genotyped and imputed using genome-wide arrays. Tumor DNA samples were extracted from paraffin blocks, and T cell receptor clonality and abundance were quantified by immunoSEQ (Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA). Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes per high powered field (TILs/hpf) were scored by a gastrointestinal pathologist. Regression models were used to evaluate the associations between each variant and the three T-cell features, adjusting for sex, age, genotyping platform, and global ancestry. Three independent datasets were used for replication.We identified a SNP (rs4918567) near RBM20 associated with clonality at a genome-wide significant threshold of 5 × 10- 8, with a consistent direction of association in both discovery and replication datasets. Expression quantitative trait (eQTL) analyses and in silico functional annotation for these loci provided insights into potential functional roles, including a statistically significant eQTL between the T allele at rs4918567 and higher expression of ADRA2A (P = 0.012) in healthy colon mucosa.Our study suggests that germline genetic variation is associated with the quantity and diversity of adaptive immune responses in CRC. Further studies are warranted to replicate these findings in additional samples and to investigate functional genomic mechanisms.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.4335258116915582e-18

However, novel drug targets for reducing unnecessary visceral and ectopic fat are still limited. Our study aims to provide a comprehensive investigation of the causal effects of the plasma proteome on visceral and ectopic fat using Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.We performed two-sample MR analyses based on five large genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of 2656 plasma proteins, to screen for causal associations of these proteins with traits of visceral and ectopic fat in over 30,000 participants of European ancestry, as well as to assess mediation effects by risk factors of outcomes. The colocalization analysis was conducted to examine whether the identified proteins and outcomes shared casual variants.Genetically predicted levels of 14 circulating proteins were associated with visceral and ectopic fat (P < 4.99 × 10- 5, at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold). Colocalization analysis prioritized ten protein targets that showed effect on outcomes, including FST, SIRT2, DNAJB9, IL6R, CTSA, RGMB, PNLIPRP1, FLT4, PPY and IL6ST. MR analyses revealed seven risk factors for visceral and ectopic fat (P < 0.0024). Furthermore, the associations of CTSA, DNAJB9 and IGFBP1 with primary outcomes were mediated by HDL-C and SHBG. Sensitivity analyses showed little evidence of pleiotropy.Our study identified candidate proteins showing putative causal effects as potential therapeutic targets for visceral and ectopic fat accumulation and outlined causal pathways for further prevention of downstream cardiometabolic diseases.© 2024.

38565889,Genetic determinants of plasma protein levels in the Estonian population.,Sci Rep,"The proteome holds great potential as an intermediate layer between the genome and phenome. Previous protein quantitative trait locus studies have focused mainly on describing the effects of common genetic variations on the proteome. Here, we assessed the impact of the common and rare genetic variations as well as the copy number variants (CNVs) on 326 plasma proteins measured in up to 500 individuals. We identified 184 cis and 94 trans signals for 157 protein traits, which were further fine-mapped to credible sets for 101 cis and 87 trans signals for 151 proteins. Rare genetic variation contributed to the levels of 7 proteins, with 5 cis and 14 trans associations. CNVs were associated with the levels of 11 proteins (7 cis and 5 trans), examples including a 3q12.1 deletion acting as a hub for multiple trans associations; and a CNV overlapping NAIP, a sensor component of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome which is affecting pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 18 levels. In summary, this work presents a comprehensive resource of genetic variation affecting the plasma protein levels and provides the interpretation of identified effects.© 2024.

38521921,Integrative multi-omics analysis identifies genetically supported druggable targets and immune cell specificity for myasthenia gravis.,J Transl Med,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness. Despite the availability of established therapies, the management of MG symptoms remains suboptimal, partially attributed to lack of efficacy or intolerable side-effects. Therefore, new effective drugs are warranted for treatment of MG.By employing an analytical framework that combines Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analysis, we estimate the causal effects of blood druggable expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) on the susceptibility of MG. We subsequently investigated whether potential genetic effects exhibit cell-type specificity by utilizing genetic colocalization analysis to assess the interplay between immune-cell-specific eQTLs and MG risk.We identified significant MR results for four genes (CDC42BPB, CD226, PRSS36, and TNFSF12) using cis-eQTL genetic instruments and three proteins (CTSH, PRSS8, and CPN2) using cis-pQTL genetic instruments. Six of these loci demonstrated evidence of colocalization with MG susceptibility (posterior probability > 0.80). We next undertook genetic colocalization to investigate cell-type-specific effects at these loci. Notably, we identified robust evidence of colocalization, with a posterior probability of 0.854, linking CTSH expression in TH2 cells and MG risk.This study provides crucial insights into the genetic and molecular factors associated with MG susceptibility, singling out CTSH as a potential candidate for in-depth investigation and clinical consideration. It additionally sheds light on the immune-cell regulatory mechanisms related to the disease. However, further research is imperative to validate these targets and evaluate their feasibility for drug development.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.8590560311848886e-27

However, it is not known which type of biomarker is optimal for clinical purposes. Here, we make a systematic comparison of 90 million genetic variants, 1,453 proteins, and 325 metabolites from 500,000 individuals with complex diseases from the UK Biobank. A machine learning pipeline consisting of data cleaning, data imputation, feature selection, and model training using cross-validation and comparison of the results on holdout test sets showed that proteins were most predictive, followed by metabolites, and genetic variants. Only five proteins per disease resulted in median (min-max) areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for incidence of 0.79 (0.65-0.86) and 0.84 (0.70-0.91) for prevalence. In summary, our work suggests the potential of predicting complex diseases based on a limited number of proteins.

38720975,Alchemical approach performance in calculating the ligand-binding free energy.,RSC Adv,"Alchemical binding free energy calculations are one of the most accurate methods for estimating ligand-binding affinity. Assessing the accuracy of the approach over protein targets is one of the most interesting issues. The free energy difference of binding between a protein and a ligand was calculatedviathe alchemical approach. The alchemical approach exhibits satisfactory accuracy over four targets, including AmpC beta-lactamase (AmpC); glutamate receptor, ionotropic kainate 1 (GluK1); heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90); and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro). In particular, the correlation coefficients between calculated binding free energies and the respective experiments over four targets range from 0.56 to 0.86. The affinity computedviafree energy perturbation (FEP) simulations is overestimated over the experimental value. Particularly, the electrostatic interaction free energy rules the binding process of ligands to AmpC and GluK1. However, the van der Waals (vdW) interaction free energy plays an important role in the ligand-binding processes of HSP90 and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The obtained results associate with the hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties of the ligands.

38691596,Post-retrieval stress impairs subsequent memory depending on hippocampal memory trace reinstatement during reactivation.,Sci Adv,"Upon retrieval, memories can become susceptible to meaningful events, such as stress. Post-retrieval memory changes may be attributed to an alteration of the original memory trace during reactivation-dependent reconsolidation or, alternatively, to the modification of retrieval-related memory traces that impact future remembering. Hence, how post-retrieval memory changes emerge in the human brain is unknown. In a 3-day functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we show that post-retrieval stress impairs subsequent memory depending on the strength of neural reinstatement of the original memory trace during reactivation, driven by the hippocampus and its cross-talk with neocortical representation areas. Comparison of neural patterns during immediate and final memory testing further revealed that successful retrieval was linked to pattern-dissimilarity in controls, suggesting the use of a different trace, whereas stressed participants relied on the original memory representation. These representation changes were again dependent on neocortical reinstatement during reactivation. Our findings show disruptive stress effects on the consolidation of retrieval-related memory traces that support future remembering.",5.0293754753637746e-24
38652351,Purinergic Signalling Mediates Aberrant Excitability of Developing Neuronal Circuits in the Fmr1 Knockout Mouse Model.,Mol Neurobiol,"Neuronal hyperexcitability within developing cortical circuits is a common characteristic of several heritable neurodevelopmental disorders, including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). While this aberrant circuitry is typically studied from a neuron-centric perspective, glial cells secrete soluble factors that regulate both neurite extension and synaptogenesis during development. The nucleotide-mediated purinergic signalling system is particularly instrumental in facilitating these effects. We recently reported that within a FXS animal model, the Fmr1 KO mouse, the purinergic signalling system is upregulated in cortical astrocytes leading to altered secretion of synaptogenic and plasticity-related proteins. In this study, we examined whether elevated astrocyte purinergic signalling also impacts neuronal morphology and connectivity of Fmr1 KO cortical neurons. Here, we found that conditioned media from primary Fmr1 KO astrocytes was sufficient to enhance neurite extension and complexity of both wildtype and Fmr1 KO neurons to a similar degree as UTP-mediated outgrowth. Significantly enhanced firing was also observed in Fmr1 KO neuron-astrocyte co-cultures grown on microelectrode arrays but was associated with large deficits in firing synchrony. The selective P2Y2purinergic receptor antagonist AR-C 118925XX effectively normalized much of the aberrant Fmr1 KO activity, designating P2Y2as a potential therapeutic target in FXS. These results not only demonstrate the importance of astrocyte soluble factors in the development of neural circuitry, but also show that P2Y purinergic receptors play a distinct role in pathological FXS neuronal activity.© 2024.

38510848,Epigenetic editing for autosomal dominant neurological disorders.,Front Genome Ed,"Epigenetics refers to the molecules and mechanisms that modify gene expression states without changing the nucleotide context. These modifications are what encode the cell state during differentiation or epigenetic memory in mitosis. Epigenetic modifications can alter gene expression by changing the chromatin architecture by altering the affinity for DNA to wrap around histone octamers, forming nucleosomes. The higher affinity the DNA has for the histones, the tighter it will wrap and therefore induce a heterochromatin state, silencing gene expression. Several groups have shown the ability to harness the cell's natural epigenetic modification pathways to engineer proteins that can induce changes in epigenetics and consequently regulate gene expression. Therefore, epigenetic modification can be used to target and treat disorders through the modification of endogenous gene expression. The use of epigenetic modifications may prove an effective path towards regulating gene expression to potentially correct or cure genetic disorders.Copyright © 2024 Waldo, Halmai and Fink.",1.4957609428733963e-29
38496583,Activation of the imprinted Prader-Willi Syndrome locus by CRISPR-based epigenome editing.,bioRxiv,"Epigenome editing with DNA-targeting technologies such as CRISPR-dCas9 can be used to dissect gene regulatory mechanisms and potentially treat associated disorders. For example, Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is caused by loss of paternally expressed imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11.2-q13.3, although the maternal allele is intact but epigenetically silenced. Using CRISPR repression and activation screens in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we identified genomic elements that control expression of the PWS geneSNRPNfrom the paternal and maternal chromosomes. We showed that either targeted transcriptional activation or DNA demethylation can activate the silenced maternalSNRPNand downstream PWS transcripts. However, these two approaches function at unique regions, preferentially activating different transcript variants and involving distinct epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms. Remarkably, transient expression of the targeted demethylase leads to stable, long-term maternalSNRPNexpression in PWS iPSCs. This work uncovers targeted epigenetic manipulations to reprogram a disease-associated imprinted locus and suggests possible therapeutic interventions.",1.7766025927561317e-30
38722375,Physiological aging and inflammation-induced cellular senescence may contribute to oligodendroglial dysfunction in MS.,Acta Neuropathol,"Aging affects all cell types in the CNS and plays an important role in CNS diseases. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms driving these age-associated changes and their contribution to diseases are only poorly understood. The white matter in the aging brain as well as in diseases, such as Multiple sclerosis is characterized by subtle abnormalities in myelin sheaths and paranodes, suggesting that oligodendrocytes, the myelin-maintaining cells of the CNS, lose the capacity to preserve a proper myelin structure and potentially function in age and certain diseases. Here, we made use of directly converted oligodendrocytes (dchiOL) from young, adult and old human donors to study age-associated changes. dchiOL from all three age groups differentiated in an comparable manner into O4 + immature oligodendrocytes, but the proportion of MBP + mature dchiOL decreased with increasing donor age. This was associated with an increased ROS production and upregulation of cellular senescence markers such as CDKN1A, CDKN2A in old dchiOL. Comparison of the transcriptomic profiles of dchiOL from adult and old donors revealed 1324 differentially regulated genes with limited overlap with transcriptomic profiles of the donors' fibroblasts or published data sets from directly converted human neurons or primary rodent oligodendroglial lineage cells. Methylome analyses of dchiOL and human white matter tissue samples demonstrate that chronological and epigenetic age correlate in CNS white matter as well as in dchiOL and resulted in the identification of an age-specific epigenetic signature. Furthermore, we observed an accelerated epigenetic aging of the myelinated, normal appearing white matter of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients compared to healthy individuals. Impaired differentiation and upregulation of cellular senescence markers could be induced in young dchiOL in vitro using supernatants from pro-inflammatory microglia. In summary, our data suggest that physiological aging as well as inflammation-induced cellular senescence contribute to oligodendroglial pathology in inflammatory demyelinating diseases such as MS.© 2024.

38500495,Identification of dihydromyricetin as a natural DNA methylation inhibitor with rejuvenating activity in human skin.,Front Aging,"Changes in DNA methylation patterning have been reported to be a key hallmark of aged human skin. The altered DNA methylation patterns are correlated with deregulated gene expression and impaired tissue functionality, leading to the well-known skin aging phenotype. Searching for small molecules, which correct the aged methylation pattern therefore represents a novel and attractive strategy for the identification of anti-aging compounds. DNMT1 maintains epigenetic information by copying methylation patterns from the parental (methylated) strand to the newly synthesized strand after DNA replication. We hypothesized that a modest inhibition of this process promotes the restoration of the ground-state epigenetic pattern, thereby inducing rejuvenating effects. In this study, we screened a library of 1800 natural substances and 640 FDA-approved drugs and identified the well-known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory molecule dihydromyricetin (DHM) as an inhibitor of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. DHM is the active ingredient of several plants with medicinal use and showed robust inhibition of DNMT1 in biochemical assays. We also analyzed the effect of DHM in cultivated keratinocytes by array-based methylation profiling and observed a moderate, but significant global hypomethylation effect upon treatment. To further characterize DHM-induced methylation changes, we used published DNA methylation clocks and newly established age predictors to demonstrate that the DHM-induced methylation change is associated with a reduction in the biological age of the cells. Further studies also revealed re-activation of age-dependently hypermethylated and silenced genesin vivoand a reduction in age-dependent epidermal thinning in a 3-dimensional skin model. Our findings thus establish DHM as an epigenetic inhibitor with rejuvenating effects for aged human skin.Copyright © 2024 Falckenhayn, Bienkowska, Söhle, Wegner, Raddatz, Kristof, Kuck, Siegner, Kaufmann, Korn, Baumann, Lange, Schepky, Völzke, Kaderali, Winnefeld, Lyko and Grönniger.",4.187752753119675e-33

38536869,Study protocol: Identifying transcriptional regulatory alterations of chronic effects of blast and disturbed sleep in United States Veterans.,PLoS One,"Injury related to blast exposure dramatically rose during post-911 era military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is among the most common injuries following blast, an exposure that may not result in a definitive physiologic marker (e.g., loss of consciousness). Recent research suggests that exposure to low level blasts and, more specifically repetitive blast exposure (RBE), which may be subconcussive in nature, may also impact long term physiologic and psychological outcomes, though findings have been mixed. For military personnel, blast-related injuries often occur in chaotic settings (e.g., combat), which create challenges in the immediate assessment of related-injuries, as well as acute and post-acute sequelae. As such, alternate means of identifying blast-related injuries are needed. Results from previous work suggest that epigenetic markers, such as DNA methylation, may provide a potential stable biomarker of cumulative blast exposure that can persist over time. However, more research regarding blast exposure and associations with short- and long-term sequelae is needed. Here we present the protocol for an observational study that will be completed in two phases: Phase 1 will address blast exposure among Active Duty Personnel and Phase 2 will focus on long term sequelae and biological signatures among Veterans who served in the recent conflicts and were exposed to repeated blast events as part of their military occupation. Phase 2 will be the focus of this paper. We hypothesize that Veterans will exhibit similar differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with changes in sleep and other psychological and physical metrics, as observed with Active Duty Personnel. Additional analyses will be conducted to compare DMRs between Phase 1 and 2 cohorts, as well as self-reported psychological and physical symptoms. This comparison between Service Members and Veterans will allow for exploration regarding the natural history of blast exposure in a quasi-longitudinal manner. Findings from this study are expected to provide additional evidence for repetitive blast-related physiologic changes associated with long-term neurobehavioral symptoms. It is expected that findings will provide foundational data for the development of effective interventions following RBE that could lead to improved long-term physical and psychological health.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

The rate of adverse outcomes in pregnancies affected by diabetes in Denmark is currently unknown, and there is a limited understanding of mechanisms contributing to this elevated risk. To address these gaps, the Danish Diabetes Birth Registry 2 (DDBR2) was established. The aims of this registry are to evaluate maternal and fetal-neonatal outcomes based on 5 years cohort data, and to identify pathophysiology and risk factors associated with short-term and long-term outcomes of pregnancies in women with pre-existing diabetes.The DDBR2 registry is a nationwide 5-year prospective cohort with an inclusion period from February 2023 to February 2028 of pregnancies in women with all types of pre-existing diabetes and includes registry, clinical and questionnaire data and biological samples of mother-partner-child trios. Eligible families (parents age ≥18 years and sufficient proficiency in Danish or English) can participate by either (1) basic level data obtained from medical records (mother and child) and questionnaires (partner) or (2) basic level data and additional data which includes questionnaires (mother and partner) and blood samples (all).

Women with PCOS are at increased risk of pregnancy complications including implantation failure, miscarriage, gestational diabetes, fetal growth restriction, preterm labor, and pre-eclampsia (PE). This may be attributed to the presence of specific susceptibility features associated with PCOS before and during pregnancy, such as chronic systemic inflammation, insulin resistance (IR), and hyperandrogenism, all of which have been associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications. Many of the features of PCOS are reversible following lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise, and pregnant women following a healthy lifestyle have been found to have a lower risk of complications, including PE. This narrative synthesis summarizes the evidence investigating the risk of PE and the role of nutritional factors in women with PCOS. The findings suggest that the beneficial aspects of lifestyle management of PCOS, as recommended in the evidence-based international guidelines, extend to improved pregnancy outcomes. Identifying high-risk women with PCOS will allow targeted interventions, early-pregnancy screening, and increased surveillance for PE.

38699519,Exploring the epigenetic landscape: The role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in neurodevelopmental disorders.,Camb Prism Precis Med,"Recent advances in genetic and epigenetic research have underscored the significance of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), revealing its potential as both a biomarker for early detection and a target for novel therapeutic strategies. This review article provides a comprehensive analysis of the role of 5hmC in NDDs by examining both animal models and human studies. By examining mouse models, studies have demonstrated that prenatal environmental challenges, such as maternal infection and food allergies, lead to significant epigenetic alterations in 5hmC levels, which were associated with NDDs in offspring, impacting social behavior, cognitive abilities and increasing ASD-like symptoms. In human studies, researchers have linked alterations in 5hmC levels NDDs through studies in individuals with ASD, fragile X syndrome, TET3 deficiency and ID, specifically identifying significant epigenetic modifications in genes such asGAD1,RELN,FMR1andEN-2, suggesting that dysregulation of 5hmC played a critical role in the pathogenesis of these disorders and highlighted the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions. Moreover, we explore the implications of these findings for the development of epigenetic therapies aimed at modulating 5hmC levels. The review concludes with a discussion on future directions for research in this field, such as machine learning, emphasizing the need for further studies to elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying NDDs and to translate these findings into clinical practice. This paper not only advances our understanding of the epigenetic landscape of NDDs but also opens up new avenues for diagnosis and treatment, offering hope for individuals affected by these conditions.© The Author(s) 2024.",4.280074617197925e-43

Thanks to newer and faster molecular profiling technologies and reducing costs, there are many opportunities for researchers to explore the molecular and physiological mechanisms of diseases. Biomarker discovery enables researchers to better characterize patients, enables early detection and intervention/prevention and predicts treatment responses. Due to increasing prevalence and rising treatment costs, mental health (MH) disorders have become an important venue for biomarker discovery with the goal of improved patient diagnostics, treatment and care. Exploration of underlying biological mechanisms is the key to the understanding of pathogenesis and pathophysiology of MH disorders. In an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms of MH disorders, we reviewed the major accomplishments in the MH space from a bioinformatics and data science perspective, summarized existing knowledge derived from molecular and cellular data and described challenges and areas of opportunities in this space.© The Author(s) 2024.

Our findings reveal that genes characterized by a high density of CpG codon dyads are notably associated with homeobox domains and RNA polymerase II transcription factors. Conversely, genes exhibiting low CpG codon dyad density have links to DNA damage repair and mitosis. Importantly, our study identifies a re-markable increase in expressed genes that harbor CpG during embryonic development, suggesting their potential involvement in gene regulation at these developmental stages. These results under-score the functional significance of CpG codon dyads in DNA methylation and gene expression, fur-ther demonstrating the coevolution of consecutive codons and their contribution to codon usage bias.© 2024.

38533486,Maternal oxytocin treatment at birth increases epigenetic age in male offspring.,Dev Psychobiol,"Exogenous oxytocin (OT) is widely used to induce or augment labor with little understanding of the impact on offspring development. In rodent models, including the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), it has been shown that oxytocin administered to mothers can affect the nervous system of the offspring with long lasting behavioral effects especially on sociality. Here, we examined the hypothesis that perinatal oxytocin exposure could have epigenetic and transcriptomic consequences. Prairie voles were exposed to exogenous oxytocin, through injections given to the mother just prior to birth, and were studied at the time of weaning. The outcome of this study revealed increased epigenetic age in oxytocin-exposed animals compared to the saline-exposed group. Oxytocin exposure led to 900 differentially methylated CpG sites (annotated to 589 genes), and 2 CpG sites (2 genes) remained significantly different after correction for multiple comparisons. Differentially methylated CpG sites were enriched in genes known to be involved in regulation of gene expression and neurodevelopment. Using RNA-sequencing we also found 217 nominally differentially expressed genes (p<0.05) in nucleus accumbens, a brain region involved in reward circuitry and social behavior; after corrections for multiple comparisons 6 genes remained significantly differentially expressed. Finally, we found that maternal oxytocin administration led to widespread alternative splicing in the nucleus accumbens. These results indicate that oxytocin exposure during birth may have long lasting epigenetic consequences. A need for further investigation of how oxytocin administration impacts development and behavior throughout the lifespan is supported by these outcomes.",3.161913745101337e-11

Specifically, cancer tissue samples present challenges in deconvolution studies due to mutations and genetic rearrangements. Here, we optimized a robust, DNA methylation-based protocol, to be used for deconvolution of ovarian cancer samples. We compared several state-of-the-art methods (HEpiDISH, MethylCIBERSORT and ARIC) and validated the proposed protocol in an in-silico mixture and in an external dataset containing samples from ovarian cancer patients and controls. The deconvolution protocol we eventually implemented is based on MethylCIBERSORT. Comparing deconvolution methods, we paid close attention to the role of a reference panel. We postulate that a possibly high number of samples (in our case: 247) should be used when building a reference panel to ensure robustness and to compensate for biological and technical variation between samples. Subsequently, we tested the performance of the validated protocol in our own study cohort, consisting of 72 patients with malignant and benign ovarian disease as well as in five external cohorts. In conclusion, we refined and validated a reference-based algorithm to determine cell type composition of ovarian cancer tissue samples to be used in cancer biology studies in larger cohorts.© 2024.

Current approaches for detecting allograft injury non-invasively are limited and do not differentiate between cellular mechanisms. Here, we monitor cellular damages after liver transplants from cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments released from dying cells into the circulation. We analyzed 130 blood samples collected from 44 patients at different time points after transplant. Sequence-based methylation of cfDNA fragments were mapped to patterns established to identify cell types in different organs. For liver cell types DNA methylation patterns and multi-omic data integration show distinct enrichment in open chromatin and regulatory regions functionally important for the respective cell types. We find that multi-tissue cellular damages post-transplant recover in patients without allograft injury during the first post-operative week. However, sustained elevation of hepatocyte and biliary epithelial cfDNA beyond the first week indicates early-onset allograft injury. Further, cfDNA composition differentiates amongst causes of allograft injury indicating the potential for non-invasive monitoring and timely intervention.",3.3818632541225927e-22

We conducted a GWAS meta-analysis combining 53,660 OCD cases and 2,044,417 controls from 28 European-ancestry cohorts revealing 30 independent genome-wide significant SNPs and a SNP-based heritability of 6.7%. Separate GWAS for clinical, biobank, comorbid, and self-report sub-groups found no evidence of sample ascertainment impacting our results. Functional and positional QTL gene-based approaches identified 249 significant candidate risk genes for OCD, of which 25 were identified as putatively causal, highlightingWDR6,DALRD3,CTNND1and genes in the MHC region. Tissue and single-cell enrichment analyses highlighted hippocampal and cortical excitatory neurons, along with D1- and D2-type dopamine receptor-containing medium spiny neurons, as playing a role in OCD risk. OCD displayed significant genetic correlations with 65 out of 112 examined phenotypes. Notably, it showed positive genetic correlations with all included psychiatric phenotypes, in particular anxiety, depression, anorexia nervosa, and Tourette syndrome, and negative correlations with a subset of the included autoimmune disorders, educational attainment, and body mass index..

However, regulatory variants in dairy cattle, particularly in specific biological contexts (e.g., distinct lactation stages), remain largely unknown. In this study, we explored regulatory variants in whole blood samples collected during early to mid-lactation (22-150 days after calving) of 101 Holstein cows and analyzed them to decipher the regulatory mechanisms underlying complex traits in dairy cattle.We identified 14,303 genes and 227,705 intron clusters expressed in the white blood cells of 101 cattle. The average heritability of gene expression and intron excision ratio explained by cis-SNPs is 0.28 ± 0.13 and 0.25 ± 0.13, respectively. We identified 23,485 SNP-gene expression pairs and 18,166 SNP-intron cluster pairs in dairy cattle during early to mid-lactation. Compared with the 2,380,457 cis-eQTLs reported to be present in blood in the Cattle Genotype-Tissue Expression atlas (CattleGTEx), only 6,114 cis-eQTLs (P < 0.05) were detected in the present study. By conducting colocalization analysis between cis-e/sQTL and the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from four traits, we identified a cis-e/sQTL (rs109421300) of the DGAT1 gene that might be a key marker in early to mid-lactation for milk yield, fat yield, protein yield, and somatic cell score (PP4 > 0.6). Finally, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) revealed certain genes (e.g., FAM83H and TBC1D17) whose expression in white blood cells was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with complex traits.This study investigated the genetic regulation of gene expression and alternative splicing in dairy cows during early to mid-lactation and provided new insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying complex traits of economic importance.© 2024.

Additionally, we have previously shown that common variants contribute to risk for rare NDDs. Here, we investigate whether common variants exert their effects by modifying gene expression, using multi-cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) prediction models. We first performed a transcriptome-wide association study for NDDs using 6987 probands from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study and 9720 controls, and found one gene, RAB2A, that passed multiple testing correction (p = 6.7 × 10-7). We then investigated whether cis-eQTLs modify the penetrance of putatively damaging, rare coding variants inherited by NDD probands from their unaffected parents in a set of 1700 trios. We found no evidence that unaffected parents transmitting putatively damaging coding variants had higher genetically-predicted expression of the variant-harboring gene than their child. In probands carrying putatively damaging variants in constrained genes, the genetically-predicted expression of these genes in blood was lower than in controls (p = 2.7 × 10-3). However, results for proband-control comparisons were inconsistent across different sets of genes, variant filters and tissues. We find limited evidence that common cis-eQTLs modify penetrance of rare coding variants in a large cohort of NDD probands.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.7715225565520496e-28

Here we use sheep as an animal model for low-to-high altitude translocation. We generate multi-omics data including whole-genome sequences, time-resolved bulk RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq and single-cell RNA-Seq from multiple tissues as well as phenotypic data from 20 bio-indicators. We characterize transcriptional changes of all genes in each tissue, and examine multi-tissue temporal dynamics and transcriptional interactions among genes. Particularly, we identify critical functional genes regulating the short response to hypoxia in each tissue (e.g., PARG in the cerebellum and HMOX1 in the colon). We further identify TAD-constrained cis-regulatory elements, which suppress the transcriptional activity of most genes under hypoxia. Phenotypic and transcriptional evidence indicate that antenatal hypoxia could improve hypoxia tolerance in offspring. Furthermore, we provide time-series expression data of candidate genes associated with human mountain sickness (e.g., BMPR2) and high-altitude adaptation (e.g., HIF1A).

38721342,Investigating shared genetic architecture between inflammatory bowel diseases and primary biliary cholangitis.,JHEP Rep,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is commonly associated with extraintestinal complications, including autoimmune liver disease. The co-occurrence of IBD and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) has been increasingly observed, but the underlying relationship between these conditions remains unclear.Using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we investigated the causal effects between PBC and IBD, including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). We also analyzed the shared genetic architecture between IBD and PBC using data from GWAS, bulk-tissue RNA sequencing, and single cell RNA sequencing, and explored potential functional genes.There was a strong positive genetic correlation between PBC and IBD (linkage disequilibrium score regression:rg = 0.2249,p = 3.38 × 10-5). Cross-trait analysis yielded 10 shared-risk single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), as well as nine novel SNPs, which were associated with both traits. Using Mendelian randomization, a stable causal effect was established of PBC on IBD. Genetically predicted PBC was found to have a risk effect on IBD (1.105; 95% CI: 1.058-1.15;p = 1.16 × 10-10), but notvice versa. Shared tissue-specific heritability enrichment was identified for PBC and IBD (including CD and UC) in lung, spleen, and whole-blood samples. Furthermore, shared enrichment was observed of specific cell types (T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells) and their subtypes. Nine functional genes were identified based on summary statistics-based Mendelian randomization.This study detected shared genetic architecture between IBD and PBC and demonstrated a stable causal relationship of genetically predicted PBC on the risk of IBD. These findings shed light on the biological basis of comorbidity between IBD and PBC, and have important implications for intervention and treatment targets of these two diseases simultaneously.The discovery of novel shared single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and functional genes provides insights into the common targets between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), serving as a basis for new drug development and contributing to the study of disease pathogenesis. Additionally, the established significant causality and genetic correlation underscore the importance of clinical intervention in preventing the comorbidity of IBD and PBC. The enrichment of SNP heritability in specific tissues and cell types reveals the role of immune factors in the potential disease mechanisms shared between IBD and PBC. This stimulates further research on potential interventions and could lead to the development of new targets for immune-based therapies.© 2024 The Authors.",4.841886333444763e-69

38693260,Chromatin accessibility during human first-trimester neurodevelopment.,Nature,"The human brain develops through a tightly organized cascade of patterning events, induced by transcription factor expression and changes in chromatin accessibility. Although gene expression across the developing brain has been described at single-cell resolution1, similar atlases of chromatin accessibility have been primarily focused on the forebrain2-4. Here we describe chromatin accessibility and paired gene expression across the entire developing human brain during the first trimester (6-13 weeks after conception). We defined 135 clusters and used multiomic measurements to link candidate cis-regulatory elements to gene expression. The number of accessible regions increased both with age and along neuronal differentiation. Using a convolutional neural network, we identified putative functional transcription factor-binding sites in enhancers characterizing neuronal subtypes. We applied this model to cis-regulatory elements linked to ESRRB to elucidate its activation mechanism in the Purkinje cell lineage. Finally, by linking disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms to cis-regulatory elements, we validated putative pathogenic mechanisms in several diseases and identified midbrain-derived GABAergic neurons as being the most vulnerable to major depressive disorder-related mutations. Our findings provide a more detailed view of key gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of brain cell types during the first trimester and a comprehensive reference for future studies related to human neurodevelopment.© 2024.

However, the molecular basis of this effect has been challenging to study and largely restricted to analyses of either few or easily biopsied tissues. Extensive transcriptome data collected across 15 tissues during exercise training in rats as part of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium has provided a unique opportunity to clarify how exercise can affect tissue-specific gene expression and further suggest how exercise adaptation may impact complex disease-associated genes. To build this map, we integrate this multi-tissue atlas of gene expression changes with gene-disease targets, genetic regulation of expression, and trait relationship data in humans. Consensus from multiple approaches prioritizes specific tissues and genes where endurance exercise impacts disease-relevant gene expression.

Epigenetic marks such as post-translational histone modifications remain largely plastic during development and adulthood, allowing a dynamic impact of environmental factors, including antipsychotic medications, on access to genes and regulatory elements. However, few studies so far have profiled cell-specific genome-wide histone modifications in postmortem brain samples from schizophrenia subjects, or the effect of antipsychotic treatment on such epigenetic marks. Here, we conducted ChIP-seq analyses focusing on histone marks indicative of active enhancers (H3K27ac) and active promoters (H3K4me3), alongside RNA-seq, using frontal cortex samples from antipsychotic-free (AF) and antipsychotic-treated (AT) individuals with schizophrenia, as well as individually matched controls (n=58). Schizophrenia subjects exhibited thousands of neuronal and non-neuronal epigenetic differences at regions that included several susceptibility genetic loci, such asNRG1,DISC1,andDRD3. By analyzing the AF and AT cohorts separately, we identified schizophrenia-associated alterations in specific transcription factors, their regulatees, and epigenomic and transcriptomic features that were reversed by antipsychotic treatment; as well as those that represented a consequence of antipsychotic medication rather than a hallmark of schizophrenia in postmortem human brain samples. Notably, we also found that the effect of age on epigenomic landscapes was more pronounced in frontal cortex of AT-schizophrenics, as compared to AF-schizophrenics and controls. Together, these data provide important evidence of epigenetic alterations in the frontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia, and remark for the first time on the impact of age and antipsychotic treatment on chromatin organization.© 2023, Zhu, Ainsworth et al.",8.571665230062924e-26

This score, defined as the Haplotype Function Score (HFS), replaces the original genotype in association studies. Applying the HFS framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank, we identified 3619 independent HFS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10-8. Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations, corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared with single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis. HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait associations and 153 tissue-trait associations with strong biological interpretability, including 'circadian pathway-chronotype' and 'arachidonic acid-intelligence'. Lastly, we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to integrate HFS prediction score with SNP-based polygenic risk scores, which showed an improvement of 16.1-39.8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction. We concluded that HFS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits.© 2023, Song et al.",1.2106531633702717e-12

Although various MPB-associated genetic variants have been suggested, a comprehensive study for linking these variants to gene expression regulation has not been performed to the best of our knowledge.In this study, we prioritized MPB-related tissue panels using tissue-specific enrichment analysis and utilized single-tissue panels from genotype-tissue expression version 8, as well as cross-tissue panels from context-specific genetics.

Here we present GWAS meta-analyses across six cohorts for male and female infertility in up to 41,200 cases and 687,005 controls. We identified 21 genetic risk loci for infertility (P≤5E-08), of which 12 have not been reported for any reproductive condition. We found positive genetic correlations between endometriosis and all-cause female infertility (rg=0.585,P=8.98E-14), and between polycystic ovary syndrome and anovulatory infertility (rg=0.403,P=2.16E-03). The evolutionary persistence of female infertility-risk alleles inEBAG9may be explained by recent directional selection. We additionally identified up to 269 genetic loci associated with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone, oestradiol, and testosterone through sex-specific GWAS meta-analyses (N=6,095-246,862).

38528071,Transcriptomic dysregulation and autistic-like behaviors in Kmt2c haploinsufficient mice rescued by an LSD1 inhibitor.,Mol Psychiatry,"Recent studies have consistently demonstrated that the regulation of chromatin and gene transcription plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Among many genes involved in these pathways, KMT2C, encoding one of the six known histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferases in humans and rodents, was identified as a gene whose heterozygous loss-of-function variants are causally associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the Kleefstra syndrome phenotypic spectrum. However, little is known about how KMT2C haploinsufficiency causes neurodevelopmental deficits and how these conditions can be treated. To address this, we developed and analyzed genetically engineered mice with a heterozygous frameshift mutation of Kmt2c (Kmt2c+/fsmice) as a disease model with high etiological validity. In a series of behavioral analyses, the mutant mice exhibit autistic-like behaviors such as impairments in sociality, flexibility, and working memory, demonstrating their face validity as an ASD model. To investigate the molecular basis of the observed abnormalities, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of their bulk adult brains and found that ASD risk genes were specifically enriched in the upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), whereas KMT2C peaks detected by ChIP-seq were significantly co-localized with the downregulated genes, suggesting an important role of putative indirect effects of Kmt2c haploinsufficiency. We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing of newborn mouse brains to obtain cell type-resolved insights at an earlier stage. By integrating findings from ASD exome sequencing, genome-wide association, and postmortem brain studies to characterize DEGs in each cell cluster, we found strong ASD-associated transcriptomic changes in radial glia and immature neurons with no obvious bias toward upregulated or downregulated DEGs. On the other hand, there was no significant gross change in the cellular composition. Lastly, we explored potential therapeutic agents and demonstrate that vafidemstat, a lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) inhibitor that was effective in other models of neuropsychiatric/neurodevelopmental disorders, ameliorates impairments in sociality but not working memory in adult Kmt2c+/fsmice. Intriguingly, the administration of vafidemstat was shown to alter the vast majority of DEGs in the direction to normalize the transcriptomic abnormalities in the mutant mice (94.3 and 82.5% of the significant upregulated and downregulated DEGs, respectively, P < 2.2 × 10-16, binomial test), which could be the molecular mechanism underlying the behavioral rescuing. In summary, our study expands the repertoire of ASD models with high etiological and face validity, elucidates the cell-type resolved molecular alterations due to Kmt2c haploinsufficiency, and demonstrates the efficacy of an LSD1 inhibitor that might be generalizable to multiple categories of psychiatric disorders along with a better understanding of its presumed mechanisms of action.© 2024.

We apply SuShiE to mRNA expression measured in PBMCs (n=956) and LCLs (n=814) together with plasma protein levels (n=854) from individuals of diverse ancestries in the TOPMed MESA and GENOA studies. We find SuShiE fine-mapscis-molQTLs for 16% more genes compared with baselines while prioritizing fewer variants with greater functional enrichment. SuShiE infers highly consistentcis-molQTL architectures across ancestries on average; however, we also find evidence of heterogeneity at genes with predicted loss-of-function intolerance, suggesting that environmental interactions may partially explain differences incis-molQTL effect sizes across ancestries. Lastly, we leverage estimatedcis-molQTL effect-sizes to perform individual-level TWAS and PWAS on six white blood cell-related traits in AOU Biobank individuals (n=86k), and identify 44 more genes compared with baselines, further highlighting its benefits in identifying genes relevant for complex disease risk. Overall, SuShiE provides new insights into thecis-genetic architecture of molecular traits.",5.88513077723374e-15
38658550,Large-scale cross-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis of serum urate.,Nat Commun,"Hyperuricemia is an essential causal risk factor for gout and is associated with cardiometabolic diseases. Given the limited contribution of East Asian ancestry to genome-wide association studies of serum urate, the genetic architecture of serum urate requires exploration. A large-scale cross-ancestry genome-wide association meta-analysis of 1,029,323 individuals and ancestry-specific meta-analysis identifies a total of 351 loci, including 17 previously unreported loci. The genetic architecture of serum urate control is similar between European and East Asian populations. A transcriptome-wide association study, enrichment analysis, and colocalization analysis in relevant tissues identify candidate serum urate-associated genes, including CTBP1, SKIV2L, and WWP2. A phenome-wide association study using polygenic risk scores identifies serum urate-correlated diseases including heart failure and hypertension. Mendelian randomization and mediation analyses show that serum urate-associated genes might have a causal relationship with serum urate-correlated diseases via mediation effects. This study elucidates our understanding of the genetic architecture of serum urate control.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.9999412795706525
38630784,Bayesian approach to assessing population differences in genetic risk of disease with application to prostate cancer.,PLoS Genet,"Population differences in risk of disease are common, but the potential genetic basis for these differences is not well understood. A standard approach is to compare genetic risk across populations by testing for mean differences in polygenic scores, but existing studies that use this approach do not account for statistical noise in effect estimates (i.e., the GWAS betas) that arise due to the finite sample size of GWAS training data. Here, we show using Bayesian polygenic score methods that the level of uncertainty in estimates of genetic risk differences across populations is highly dependent on the GWAS training sample size, the polygenicity (number of causal variants), and genetic distance (FST) between the populations considered. We derive a Wald test for formally assessing the difference in genetic risk across populations, which we show to have calibrated type 1 error rates under a simplified assumption that all SNPs are independent, which we achieve in practise using linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning. We further provide closed-form expressions for assessing the uncertainty in estimates of relative genetic risk across populations under the special case of an infinitesimal genetic architecture. We suggest that for many complex traits and diseases, particularly those with more polygenic architectures, current GWAS sample sizes are insufficient to detect moderate differences in genetic risk across populations, though more substantial differences in relative genetic risk (relative risk > 1.5) can be detected. We show that conventional approaches that do not account for sampling error from the training sample, such as using a simple t-test, have very high type 1 error rates. When applying our approach to prostate cancer, we demonstrate a higher genetic risk in African Ancestry men, with lower risk in men of European followed by East Asian ancestry.Copyright: © 2024 Timmins et al.

38627641,Multi-trait GWAS for diverse ancestries: mapping the knowledge gap.,BMC Genomics,"Approximately 95% of samples analyzed in univariate genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are of European ancestry. This bias toward European ancestry populations in association screening also exists for other analyses and methods that are often developed and tested on European ancestry only. However, existing data in non-European populations, which are often of modest sample size, could benefit from innovative approaches as recently illustrated in the context of polygenic risk scores.Here, we extend and assess the potential limitations and gains of our multi-trait GWAS pipeline, JASS (Joint Analysis of Summary Statistics), for the analysis of non-European ancestries. To this end, we conducted the joint GWAS of 19 hematological traits and glycemic traits across five ancestries (European (EUR), admixed American (AMR), African (AFR), East Asian (EAS), and South-East Asian (SAS)).We detected 367 new genome-wide significant associations in non-European populations (15 in Admixed American (AMR), 72 in African (AFR) and 280 in East Asian (EAS)). New associations detected represent 5%, 17% and 13% of associations in the AFR, AMR and EAS populations, respectively. Overall, multi-trait testing increases the replication of European associated loci in non-European ancestry by 15%. Pleiotropic effects were highly similar at significant loci across ancestries (e.g. the mean correlation between multi-trait genetic effects of EUR and EAS ancestries was 0.88). For hematological traits, strong discrepancies in multi-trait genetic effects are tied to known evolutionary divergences: the ARKC1 loci, which is adaptive to overcome p.vivax induced malaria.Multi-trait GWAS can be a valuable tool to narrow the genetic knowledge gap between European and non-European populations.© 2024.

38622117,An ensemble penalized regression method for multi-ancestry polygenic risk prediction.,Nat Commun,"Great efforts are being made to develop advanced polygenic risk scores (PRS) to improve the prediction of complex traits and diseases. However, most existing PRS are primarily trained on European ancestry populations, limiting their transferability to non-European populations. In this article, we propose a novel method for generating multi-ancestry Polygenic Risk scOres based on enSemble of PEnalized Regression models (PROSPER). PROSPER integrates genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics from diverse populations to develop ancestry-specific PRS with improved predictive power for minority populations. The method uses a combination ofL1(lasso) andL2(ridge) penalty functions, a parsimonious specification of the penalty parameters across populations, and an ensemble step to combine PRS generated across different penalty parameters. We evaluate the performance of PROSPER and other existing methods on large-scale simulated and real datasets, including those from 23andMe Inc., the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, and All of Us. Results show that PROSPER can substantially improve multi-ancestry polygenic prediction compared to alternative methods across a wide variety of genetic architectures. In real data analyses, for example, PROSPER increased out-of-sample prediction R2for continuous traits by an average of 70% compared to a state-of-the-art Bayesian method (PRS-CSx) in the African ancestry population. Further, PROSPER is computationally highly scalable for the analysis of large SNP contents and many diverse populations.© 2024. The Author(s).",6.927475815244481e-22

GWAS publications typically make their summary-level data (GWAS summary statistics) publicly available, enabling further exploration of genetic overlaps between phenotypes gathered from different studies and cohorts. However, systematically analyzing high-dimensional GWAS summary statistics for thousands of phenotypes can be both logistically challenging and computationally demanding. In this paper, we introduce BIGA (https://bigagwas.org/), a website that aims to offer unified data analysis pipelines and processed data resources for cross-trait genetic architecture analyses using GWAS summary statistics.

38698167,The Effects of FABP4 on Cardiovascular Disease in the Aging Population.,Curr Atheroscler Rep,"Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) plays a role in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health. In this paper, we cover FABP4 biology, its implications in atherosclerosis from observational studies, genetic factors affecting FABP4 serum levels, and ongoing drug development to target FABP4 and offer insights into future FABP4 research.FABP4 impacts cells through JAK2/STAT2 and c-kit pathways, increasing inflammatory and adhesion-related proteins. In addition, FABP4 induces angiogenesis and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. FABP4 is established as a reliable predictive biomarker for cardiovascular disease in specific at-risk groups. Genetic studies robustly link PPARG and FABP4 variants to FABP4 serum levels. Considering the potential effects on atherosclerotic lesion development, drug discovery programs have been initiated in search for potent inhibitors of FABP4. Elevated FABP4 levels indicate an increased cardiovascular risk and is causally related to acceleration of atherosclerotic disease, However, clinical trials for FABP4 inhibition are lacking, possibly due to concerns about available compounds' side effects. Further research on FABP4 genetics and its putative causal role in cardiovascular disease is needed, particularly in aging subgroups.© 2024. The Author(s).",9.214439996799194e-29
38633796,Adults prenatally exposed to the Dutch Famine exhibit a metabolic signature associated with a broad spectrum of common diseases.,medRxiv,"Exposure to famine in the prenatal period is associated with an increased risk of metabolic disease, including obesity and type-2 diabetes. We employed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic profiling to provide a deeper insight into the metabolic changes associated with survival of prenatal famine exposure during the Dutch Famine at the end of World War II and explore their link to disease.NMR metabolomics data were generated from serum in 480 individuals prenatally exposed to famine (mean 58.8 years, 0.5 SD) and 464 controls (mean 57.9 years, 5.4 SD). We tested associations of prenatal famine exposure with levels of 168 individual metabolic biomarkers and compared the metabolic biomarker signature of famine exposure with those of 154 common diseases.Prenatal famine exposure was associated with higher concentrations of branched-chain amino acids ((iso)-leucine), aromatic amino acid (tyrosine), and glucose in later life (0.2-0.3 SD, p < 3x10-3). The metabolic biomarker signature of prenatal famine exposure was positively correlated to that of incident type-2 diabetes (r = 0.77, p = 3x10-27), also when re-estimating the signature of prenatal famine exposure among individuals without diabetes (r = 0.67, p = 1x10-18). Remarkably, this association extended to 115 common diseases for which signatures were available (0.3 ≤ r ≤ 0.9, p < 3.2x10-4). Correlations among metabolic signatures of famine exposure and disease outcomes were attenuated when the famine signature was adjusted for body mass index.Prenatal famine exposure is associated with a metabolic biomarker signature that strongly resembles signatures of a diverse set of diseases, an observation that can in part be attributed to a shared involvement of obesity.",2.0825364965423892e-10
38534792,Inheritance of Stress Responses via Small Non-Coding RNAs in Invertebrates and Mammals.,Epigenomes,"While reports on the generational inheritance of a parental response to stress have been widely reported in animals, the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon have only recently emerged. The booming interest in epigenetic inheritance has been facilitated in part by the discovery that small non-coding RNAs are one of its principal conduits. Discovered 30 years ago in theCaenorhabditis elegansnematode, these small molecules have since cemented their critical roles in regulating virtually all aspects of eukaryotic development. Here, we provide an overview on the current understanding of epigenetic inheritance in animals, including mice andC. elegans, as it pertains to stresses such as temperature, nutritional, and pathogenic encounters. We focus onC. elegansto address the mechanistic complexity of how small RNAs target their cohort mRNAs to effect gene expression and how they govern the propagation or termination of generational perdurance in epigenetic inheritance. Presently, while a great amount has been learned regarding the heritability of gene expression states, many more questions remain unanswered and warrant further investigation.",1.054659056791718e-31

Understanding the problem-solving experiences of pregnant women carrying multiple can be invaluable. This study aimed to explore the experiences of Iranian women with multiple gestations.This descriptive phenomenological study utilized purposive sampling and continued until data saturation. Data collection involved in-depth semi-structured interviews, with analysis performed using Colaizzi's 7-step method. MAXQDA software was employed for data management.This study involved 12 women with multiple gestations. The average age of the participants was 33.76 ± 6.22 years, and 9 were pregnant with triplets.

38649752,Characterization of transcriptional profiles associated with stress-induced neuronal activation in Arc-GFP mice.,Mol Psychiatry,"Chronic stress has become a predominant factor associated with a variety of psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, in both human and animal models. Although multiple studies have looked at transcriptional changes after social defeat stress, these studies primarily focus on bulk tissues, which might dilute important molecular signatures of social interaction in activated cells. In this study, we employed the Arc-GFP mouse model in conjunction with chronic social defeat (CSD) to selectively isolate activated nuclei (AN) populations in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of resilient and susceptible animals. Nuclear RNA-seq of susceptible vs. resilient populations revealed distinct transcriptional profiles linked predominantly with neuronal and synaptic regulation mechanisms. In the vHIP, susceptible AN exhibited increased expression of genes related to the cytoskeleton and synaptic organization. At the same time, resilient AN showed upregulation of cell adhesion genes and differential expression of major glutamatergic subunits. In the PFC, susceptible mice exhibited upregulation of synaptotagmins and immediate early genes (IEGs), suggesting a potentially over-amplified neuronal activity state. Our findings provide a novel view of stress-exposed neuronal activation and the molecular response mechanisms in stress-susceptible vs. resilient animals, which may have important implications for understanding mental resilience.© 2024.

38645177,Sex differences in brain cell-type specific chromatin accessibility in schizophrenia.,Res Sq,"Our understanding of the sex-specific role of the non-coding genome in serious mental illness remains largely incomplete. To address this gap, we explored sex differences in 1,393 chromatin accessibility profiles, derived from neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei of two distinct cortical regions from 234 cases with serious mental illness and 235 controls. We identified sex-specific enhancer-promoter interactions and showed that they regulate genes involved in X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). Examining chromosomal conformation allowed us to identify sex-specificcis-andtrans-regulatory domains (CRDs and TRDs). Co-localization of sex-specific TRDs with schizophrenia common risk variants pinpointed male-specific regulatory regions controlling a number of metabolic pathways. Additionally, enhancers from female-specific TRDs were found to regulate two genes known to escape XCI,(XISTand JPX), underlying the importance of TRDs in deciphering sex differences in schizophrenia. Overall, these findings provide extensive characterization of sex differences in the brain epigenome and disease-associated regulomes.",1.3856731394618317e-10
38589364,"Olfactory genes affect major depression in highly educated, emotionally stable, lean women: a bridge between animal models and precision medicine.",Transl Psychiatry,"Most current approaches to establish subgroups of depressed patients for precision medicine aim to rely on biomarkers that require highly specialized assessment. Our present aim was to stratify participants of the UK Biobank cohort based on three readily measurable common independent risk factors, and to investigate depression genomics in each group to discover common and separate biological etiology. Two-step cluster analysis was run separately in males (n = 149,879) and females (n = 174,572), with neuroticism (a tendency to experience negative emotions), body fat percentage, and years spent in education as input variables. Genome-wide association analyses were implemented within each of the resulting clusters, for the lifetime occurrence of either a depressive episode or recurrent depressive disorder as the outcome. Variant-based, gene-based, gene set-based, and tissue-specific gene expression test were applied. Phenotypically distinct clusters with high genetic intercorrelations in depression genomics were found. A two-cluster solution was the best model in each sex with some differences including the less important role of neuroticism in males. In females, in case of a protective pattern of low neuroticism, low body fat percentage, and high level of education, depression was associated with pathways related to olfactory function. While also in females but in a risk pattern of high neuroticism, high body fat percentage, and less years spent in education, depression showed association with complement system genes. Our results, on one hand, indicate that alteration of olfactory pathways, that can be paralleled to the well-known rodent depression models of olfactory bulbectomy, might be a novel target towards precision psychiatry in females with less other risk factors for depression. On the other hand, our results in multi-risk females may provide a special case of immunometabolic depression.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.91286065519394e-23
38561350,Targeted Protein O-GlcNAcylation Using Bifunctional Small Molecules.,J Am Chem Soc,"Protein O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) plays a crucial role in regulating essential cellular processes. The disruption of the homeostasis of O-GlcNAcylation has been linked to various human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. However, there are limited chemical tools for protein- and site-specific O-GlcNAc modification, rendering the precise study of the O-GlcNAcylation challenging. To address this, we have developed heterobifunctional small molecules, named O-GlcNAcylation TArgeting Chimeras (OGTACs), which enable protein-specific O-GlcNAcylation in living cells. OGTACs promote O-GlcNAcylation of proteins such as BRD4, CK2α, and EZH2in celluloby recruiting FKBP12F36V-fused O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), with temporal, magnitude, and reversible control.

Finding and validating biomarkers of lung cancer is therefore essential. Such studies are often conducted on European, American and Asian populations and the relevance of these biomarkers in other populations remains less clear. In that prospect, we investigated the expression level of seven microRNAs, chosen from the medical literature (miR-16-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-103a-3p, miR-375-3p, miR-451a, miR-520-3p and miR-let-7e-5p), in the blood of Tunisian lung cancer patients, treated or not by chemotherapy, and healthy control individuals. We found that high expression levels of circulating miR-16-5p, miR-92a-3p and miR-451a in the plasma of untreated patients discriminate them from healthy control individuals. In addition, miR-16-5p and miR-451a expression levels are significantly reduced in the plasma of chemotherapy-treated patients compared to untreated patients. Our results confirmed previous work in other populations worldwide and provide further evidence that circulating miR-16-5p, miR-92a-3p and miR-451a potentially regulate key pathways involved in the initiation and progression of cancer.© 2024.

38653490,BayesKAT: bayesian optimal kernel-based test for genetic association studies reveals joint genetic effects in complex diseases.,Brief Bioinform,"Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) methods have identified individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with specific phenotypes. Nonetheless, many complex diseases are polygenic and are controlled by multiple genetic variants that are usually non-linearly dependent. These genetic variants are marginally less effective and remain undetected in GWAS analysis. Kernel-based tests (KBT), which evaluate the joint effect of a group of genetic variants, are therefore critical for complex disease analysis. However, choosing different kernel functions in KBT can significantly influence the type I error control and power, and selecting the optimal kernel remains a statistically challenging task. A few existing methods suffer from inflated type 1 errors, limited scalability, inferior power or issues of ambiguous conclusions. Here, we present a new Bayesian framework, BayesKAT (https://github.com/wangjr03/BayesKAT), which overcomes these kernel specification issues by selecting the optimal composite kernel adaptively from the data while testing genetic associations simultaneously. Furthermore, BayesKAT implements a scalable computational strategy to boost its applicability, especially for high-dimensional cases where other methods become less effective. Based on a series of performance comparisons using both simulated and real large-scale genetics data, BayesKAT outperforms the available methods in detecting complex group-level associations and controlling type I errors simultaneously. Applied on a variety of groups of functionally related genetic variants based on biological pathways, co-expression gene modules and protein complexes, BayesKAT deciphers the complex genetic basis and provides mechanistic insights into human diseases.© The Author(s) 2024.

In Stage 2, we performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to calculate the cis-regulated effect of rs6430538 onTMEM163in both AD and neuropathologically normal samples. Stage 3 involved evaluating the differential expression ofTMEM163in 4 brain tissues from AD cases and controls. Finally, in Stage 4, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to identify any association betweenTMEM163expression and AD.The results showed that genetic variant rs6430538 C allele might increase the risk of AD. eQTL analysis revealed that rs6430538 up-regulatedTMEM163expression in AD brain tissue, but down-regulated its expression in normal samples. Interestingly,TMEM163showed differential expression in entorhinal cortex (EC) and temporal cortex (TCX). Furthermore, the TWAS analysis indicated strong associations betweenTMEM163and AD in various tissues.In summary, our findings suggest that rs6430538 may influence AD by regulatingTMEM163expression.

This effort identified 10,004 eGenes at the cell type level and 8,099 eGenes at the cell subtype level. Many eGenes are only detected within cell subtypes.

However, only a small number of loci have been linked to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) detected currently. To better understand the potential reasons for many trait-associated loci lacking eQTL colocalization, we investigated whether chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) explain immune-mediated disease associations that eQTLs in LCLs did not. The power to detect caQTLs was greater than that of eQTLs and was less affected by the distance from the transcription start site of the associated gene. Meta-analyzing LCL eQTL data to increase the sample size to over a thousand led to additional loci with eQTL colocalization, demonstrating that insufficient statistical power is still likely to be a factor. Moreover, further eQTL colocalization loci were uncovered by surveying eQTLs of other immune cell types. Altogether, insufficient power and context-specificity of eQTLs both contribute to the 'missing regulation.'",3.864942458708864e-22
38659791,Investigative power of Genomic Informational Field Theory (GIFT) relative to GWAS for genotype-phenotype mapping.,bioRxiv,"Identifying associations between phenotype and genotype is the fundamental basis of genetic analyses. Inspired by frequentist probability and the work of R.A. Fisher, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) extract information using averages and variances from genotype-phenotype datasets. Averages and variances are legitimated upon creating distribution density functions obtained through the grouping of data into categories. However, as data from within a given category cannot be differentiated, the investigative power of such methodologies is limited. Genomic Informational Field Theory (GIFT) is a method specifically designed to circumvent this issue. The way GIFT proceeds is opposite to that of GWAS. Whilst GWAS determines the extent to which genes are involved in phenotype formation (bottom-up approach), GIFT determines the degree to which the phenotype can select microstates (genes) for its subsistence (top-down approach). Doing so requires dealing with new genetic concepts, a.k.a. genetic paths, upon which significance levels for genotype-phenotype associations can be determined. By using different datasets obtained inovis ariesrelated to bone growth (Dataset-1) and to a series of linked metabolic and epigenetic pathways (Dataset-2), we demonstrate that removing the informational barrier linked to categories enhances the investigative and discriminative powers of GIFT, namely that GIFT extracts more information than GWAS.

38620076,Evolution of Phenotypic Variance Provides Insights into the Genetic Basis of Adaptation.,Genome Biol Evol,"Most traits are polygenic, and the contributing loci can be identified by genome-wide association studies. The genetic basis of adaptation (adaptive architecture) is, however, difficult to characterize. Here, we propose to study the adaptive architecture of traits by monitoring the evolution of their phenotypic variance during adaptation to a new environment in well-defined laboratory conditions. Extensive computer simulations show that the evolution of phenotypic variance in a replicated experimental evolution setting can distinguish between oligogenic and polygenic adaptive architectures. We compared gene expression variance in male Drosophila simulans before and after 100 generations of adaptation to a novel hot environment. The variance change in gene expression was indistinguishable for genes with and without a significant change in mean expression after 100 generations of evolution. We suggest that the majority of adaptive gene expression evolution can be explained by a polygenic architecture. We propose that tracking the evolution of phenotypic variance across generations can provide an approach to characterize the adaptive architecture.© The Author(s) 2024.

38603726,The quantitative genetics of gene expression in Mimulus guttatus.,PLoS Genet,"Gene expression can be influenced by genetic variants that are closely linked to the expressed gene (cis eQTLs) and variants in other parts of the genome (trans eQTLs). We created a multiparental mapping population by sampling genotypes from a single natural population of Mimulus guttatus and scored gene expression in the leaves of 1,588 plants. We find that nearly every measured gene exhibits cis regulatory variation (91% have FDR < 0.05). cis eQTLs are usually allelic series with three or more functionally distinct alleles. The cis locus explains about two thirds of the standing genetic variance (on average) but varies among genes and tends to be greatest when there is high indel variation in the upstream regulatory region and high nucleotide diversity in the coding sequence. Despite mapping over 10,000 trans eQTL / affected gene pairs, most of the genetic variance generated by trans acting loci remains unexplained. This implies a large reservoir of trans acting genes with subtle or diffuse effects. Mapped trans eQTLs show lower allelic diversity but much higher genetic dominance than cis eQTLs. Several analyses also indicate that trans eQTLs make a substantial contribution to the genetic correlations in expression among different genes. They may thus be essential determinants of ""gene expression modules,"" which has important implications for the evolution of gene expression and how it is studied by geneticists.Copyright: © 2024 Veltsos, Kelly.

38565962,"Pleiotropy, epistasis and the genetic architecture of quantitative traits.",Nat Rev Genet,"Pleiotropy (whereby one genetic polymorphism affects multiple traits) and epistasis (whereby non-linear interactions between genetic polymorphisms affect the same trait) are fundamental aspects of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits. Recent advances in the ability to characterize the effects of polymorphic variants on molecular and organismal phenotypes in human and model organism populations have revealed the prevalence of pleiotropy and unexpected shared molecular genetic bases among quantitative traits, including diseases. By contrast, epistasis is common between polymorphic loci associated with quantitative traits in model organisms, such that alleles at one locus have different effects in different genetic backgrounds, but is rarely observed for human quantitative traits and common diseases. Here, we review the concepts and recent inferences about pleiotropy and epistasis, and discuss factors that contribute to similarities and differences between the genetic architecture of quantitative traits in model organisms and humans.© 2024.

38507447,The evolutionary genomics of adaptation to stress in wild rhizobium bacteria.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Microbiota comprise the bulk of life's diversity, yet we know little about how populations of microbes accumulate adaptive diversity across natural landscapes. Adaptation to stressful soil conditions in plants provides seminal examples of adaptation in response to natural selection via allelic substitution. For microbes symbiotic with plants however, horizontal gene transfer allows for adaptation via gene gain and loss, which could generate fundamentally different evolutionary dynamics. We use comparative genomics and genetics to elucidate the evolutionary mechanisms of adaptation to physiologically stressful serpentine soils in rhizobial bacteria in western North American grasslands. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the presence of a locus of major effect, thenreoperon, is necessary and sufficient to confer adaptation to nickel, a heavy metal enriched to toxic levels in serpentine soil, and a major axis of environmental soil chemistry variation. We find discordance between inferred evolutionary histories of the core genome andnreAXYgenes, which often reside in putative genomic islands. This suggests that the evolutionary history of this adaptive variant is marked by frequent losses, and/or gains via horizontal acquisition across divergent rhizobium clades. However, differentnrealleles confer distinct levels of nickel resistance, suggesting allelic substitution could also play a role in rhizobium adaptation to serpentine soil. These results illustrate that the interplay between evolution via gene gain and loss and evolution via allelic substitution may underlie adaptation in wild soil microbiota. Both processes are important to consider for understanding adaptive diversity in microbes and improving stress-adapted microbial inocula for human use.",2.148978944031609e-46
38506092,Naturally segregating genetic variants contribute to thermal tolerance in a Drosophila melanogaster model system.,Genetics,"Thermal tolerance is a fundamental physiological complex trait for survival in many species. For example, everyday tasks such as foraging, finding a mate, and avoiding predation are highly dependent on how well an organism can tolerate extreme temperatures. Understanding the general architecture of the natural variants within the genes that control this trait is of high importance if we want to better comprehend thermal physiology. Here, we take a multipronged approach to further dissect the genetic architecture that controls thermal tolerance in natural populations using the Drosophila Synthetic Population Resource as a model system. First, we used quantitative genetics and Quantitative Trait Loci mapping to identify major effect regions within the genome that influences thermal tolerance, then integrated RNA-sequencing to identify differences in gene expression, and lastly, we used the RNAi system to (1) alter tissue-specific gene expression and (2) functionally validate our findings. This powerful integration of approaches not only allows for the identification of the genetic basis of thermal tolerance but also the physiology of thermal tolerance in a natural population, which ultimately elucidates thermal tolerance through a fitness-associated lens.© The Author(s) 2024.

38501170,Cross-species modeling of muscular dystrophy in Caenorhabditis elegans using patient-derived extracellular vesicles.,Dis Model Mech,"Reliable disease models are critical for medicine advancement. Here, we established a versatile human disease model system using patient-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), which transfer a pathology-inducing cargo from a patient to a recipient naïve model organism. As a proof of principle, we applied EVs from the serum of patients with muscular dystrophy to Caenorhabditis elegans and demonstrated their capability to induce a spectrum of muscle pathologies, including lifespan shortening and robust impairment of muscle organization and function. This demonstrates that patient-derived EVs can deliver disease-relevant pathologies between species and can be exploited for establishing novel and personalized models of human disease. Such models can potentially be used for disease diagnosis, prognosis, analyzing treatment responses, drug screening and identification of the disease-transmitting cargo of patient-derived EVs and their cellular targets. This system complements traditional genetic disease models and enables modeling of multifactorial diseases and of those not yet associated with specific genetic mutations.© 2024.

38605038,Cortico-striatal differences in the epigenome in attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder.,Transl Psychiatry,"While epigenetic modifications have been implicated in ADHD through studies of peripheral tissue, to date there has been no examination of the epigenome of the brain in the disorder. To address this gap, we mapped the methylome of the caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate cortex in post-mortem tissue from fifty-eight individuals with or without ADHD. While no single probe showed adjusted significance in differential methylation, several differentially methylated regions emerged. These regions implicated genes involved in developmental processes including neurogenesis and the differentiation of oligodendrocytes and glial cells. We demonstrate a significant association between differentially methylated genes in the caudate and genes implicated by GWAS not only in ADHD but also in autistic spectrum, obsessive compulsive and bipolar affective disorders through GWAS. Using transcriptomic data available on the same subjects, we found modest correlations between the methylation and expression of genes. In conclusion, this study of the cortico-striatal methylome points to gene and gene pathways involved in neurodevelopment, consistent with studies of common and rare genetic variation, as well as the post-mortem transcriptome in ADHD.© 2024.

38561466,"Gestational epigenetic age and ADHD symptoms in childhood: a prospective, multi-cohort study.",Mol Psychiatry,"Epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), defined as the difference between chronological age and epigenetically predicted age, was calculated from multiple gestational epigenetic clocks (Bohlin, EPIC overlap, and Knight) using DNA methylation levels from cord blood in three large population-based birth cohorts: the Generation R Study (The Netherlands), the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (United Kingdom), and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (Norway). We hypothesized that a lower EAA associates prospectively with increased ADHD symptoms. We tested our hypotheses in these three cohorts and meta-analyzed the results (n = 3383). We replicated previous research on the association between gestational age (GA) and ADHD. Both clinically measured gestational age as well as epigenetic age measures at birth were negatively associated with ADHD symptoms at ages 5-7 years (clinical GA: β = -0.04, p < 0.001, Bohlin: β = -0.05, p = 0.01; EPIC overlap: β = -0.05, p = 0.01; Knight: β = -0.01, p = 0.26). Raw EAA (difference between clinical and epigenetically estimated gestational age) was positively associated with ADHD in our main model, whereas residual EAA (raw EAA corrected for clinical gestational age) was not associated with ADHD symptoms across cohorts. Overall, findings support a link between lower gestational age (either measured clinically or using epigenetic-derived estimates) and ADHD symptoms. Epigenetic age acceleration does not, however, add unique information about ADHD risk independent of clinically estimated gestational age at birth.© 2024.

38652370,Expression Patterns of miRNAs in Egyptian Children with ADHD: Clinical Study with Correlation Analysis.,J Mol Neurosci,"ADHD has huge knowledge gaps concerning its etiology. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) provide promising diagnostic biomarkers of human pathophysiology and may be a novel therapeutic option. The aim was to investigate the levels of miR-34c-3p, miR-155, miR-138-1, miR-296-5p, and plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in a group of children with ADHD compared to neurotypicals and to explore correlations between these measures and some clinical data. The participants were children with ADHD in Group I (N = 41; age: 8.2 ± 2) and neurotypical ones in Group II (N = 40; age: 8.6 ± 2.5). Group I was subjected to clinical examination, the Stanford Binet intelligence scale-5, the preschool language scale, and Conner's parent rating scale-R. Measuring the expression levels of the miRNAs was performed by qRT-PCR for all participants. The BDNF level was measured by ELISA. The lowest scores on the IQ subtest were knowledge and working memory. No discrepancies were noticed between the receptive and expressive language ages. The highest scores on the Conner's scale were those for cognitive problems. Participants with ADHD exhibited higher plasma BDNF levels compared to controls (p = 0.0003). Expression patterns of only miR-34c-3p and miR-138-1 were downregulated with significant statistical differences (p˂0.01). However, expression levels of miR-296-5p showed negative correlation with the total scores of IQ (p = 0.03). MiR-34c-3p, miR-138-1, while BDNF showed good diagnostic potential. The downregulated levels of miR-34c-3p and miR-138-1, together with high BDNF levels, are suggested to be involved in the etiology of ADHD in Egyptian children. Gender differences influenced the expression patterns of miRNAs only in children with ADHD.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.8442354561861455e-37
38681778,StemnesScoRe: an R package to estimate the stemness of glioma cancer cells at single-cell resolution.,Turk J Biol,"Glioblastoma is the most heterogeneous and the most difficult-to-treat type of brain tumor and one of the deadliest among all cancers. The high plasticity of glioma cancer stem cells and the resistance they develop against multiple modalities of therapy, along with their high heterogeneity, are the main challenges faced during treatment of glioblastoma. Therefore, a better understanding of the stemness characteristics of glioblastoma cells is needed. With the development of various single-cell technologies and increasing applications of machine learning, indices based on transcriptomic and/or epigenomic data have been developed to quantitatively measure cellular states and stemness. In this study, we aimed to develop a glioma-specific stemness score model using scATAC-seq data for the first time.We first applied three powerful machine-learning algorithms, i.e. random forest, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting, to glioblastoma scRNA-seq data to discover the most important genes associated with cellular states. We then identified promoter and enhancer regions associated with these genes. After downloading the scATAC-seq peaks and their read counts for each patient, we identified the overlapping regions between the single-cell peaks and the peaks of genes obtained through machine-learning algorithms. Then we calculated read counts that were mapped to these overlapping regions. We finally developed a model capable of estimating the stemness score for each glioma cell using overlapping regions and the importance of genes predictive of glioblastoma cellular states. We also created an R package, accessible to all researchers regardless of their coding proficiency.Our results showed that mesenchymal-like stem cells display higher stemness scores compared to neural-progenitor-, oligodendrocyte-progenitor-, and astrocyte-like cells.scATAC-seq can be used to assess heterogeneity in glioblastoma and identify cells with high stemness characteristics.

38632952,Topological and geometric analysis of cell states in single-cell transcriptomic data.,Brief Bioinform,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables dissecting cellular heterogeneity in tissues, resulting in numerous biological discoveries. Various computational methods have been devised to delineate cell types by clustering scRNA-seq data, where clusters are often annotated using prior knowledge of marker genes. In addition to identifying pure cell types, several methods have been developed to identify cells undergoing state transitions, which often rely on prior clustering results. The present computational approaches predominantly investigate the local and first-order structures of scRNA-seq data using graph representations, while scRNA-seq data frequently display complex high-dimensional structures. Here, we introduce scGeom, a tool that exploits the multiscale and multidimensional structures in scRNA-seq data by analyzing the geometry and topology through curvature and persistent homology of both cell and gene networks. We demonstrate the utility of these structural features to reflect biological properties and functions in several applications, where we show that curvatures and topological signatures of cell and gene networks can help indicate transition cells and the differentiation potential of cells. We also illustrate that structural characteristics can improve the classification of cell types.© The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press.",4.964589025434126e-38
38548811,Pan-cancer analyses suggest kindlin-associated global mechanochemical alterations.,Commun Biol,"Kindlins serve as mechanosensitive adapters, transducing extracellular mechanical cues to intracellular biochemical signals and thus, their perturbations potentially lead to cancer progressions. Despite the kindlin involvement in tumor development, understanding their genetic and mechanochemical characteristics across different cancers remains elusive. Here, we thoroughly examined genetic alterations in kindlins across more than 10,000 patients with 33 cancer types. Our findings reveal cancer-specific alterations, particularly prevalent in advanced tumor stage and during metastatic onset. We observed a significant co-alteration between kindlins and mechanochemical proteome in various tumors through the activation of cancer-related pathways and adverse survival outcomes. Leveraging normal mode analysis, we predicted structural consequences of cancer-specific kindlin mutations, highlighting potential impacts on stability and downstream signaling pathways. Our study unraveled alterations in epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers associated with kindlin activity. This comprehensive analysis provides a resource for guiding future mechanistic investigations and therapeutic strategies targeting the roles of kindlins in cancer treatment.© 2024.

38524605,Single cell analyses of cancer cells identified two regulatorily and functionally distinct categories in differentially expressed genes among tumor subclones.,Heliyon,"To explore the feature of cancer cells and tumor subclones, we analyzed 101,065 single-cell transcriptomes from 12 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and 92 single cell genomes from one of these patients. We found cancer cells, endothelial cells and stromal cells in tumor tissue expressed much more genes and had stronger cell-cell interactions than their counterparts in normal tissue. We identified copy number variations (CNVs) in each cancer cell and found correlation between gene copy number and expression level in cancer cells at single cell resolution. Analysis of tumor subclones inferred by CNVs showed accumulation of mutations in each tumor subclone along lineage trajectories. We found differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor subclones had two populations: DEGCNVand DEGreg. DEGCNV, showing high CNV-expression correlation and whose expression differences depend on the differences of CNV level, enriched in housekeeping genes and cell adhesion associated genes. DEGreg, showing low CNV-expression correlation and mainly in low CNV variation regions and regions without CNVs, enriched in cytokine signaling genes. Furthermore, cell-cell communication analyses showed that DEGCNVtends to involve in cell-cell contact while DEGregtends to involve in secreted signaling, which further support that DEGCNVand DEGregare two regulatorily and functionally distinct categories.© 2024 The Authors.",4.4740240428626513e-35
38598160,Revisit and explore the ethylene-independent mechanism of sex expression in cucumber (Cucumis sativus).,Plant Reprod,"This review provides a thorough and comprehensive perspective on the topic of cucumber sexual expression. Specifically, insights into sex expression mediated by pathways other than ethylene are highlighted. Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is a common and important commercial crop that is cultivated and consumed worldwide. Additionally, this species is commonly used as a model for investigating plant sex expression. Cucumbers exhibit a variety of floral arrangements, comprising male, female, and hermaphroditic (bisexual) flowers. Generally, cucumber plants that produce female flowers are typically preferred due to their significant impact on the overall output. Various environmental conditions, such as temperature, light quality, and photoperiod, have been also shown to influence the sex expression in this species. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that ethylene and its biosynthesis genes are crucial in regulating cucumber sex expression. Gibberellins, another well-known phytohormone, can similarly influence cucumber sex expression via an ethylene-independent route. Further studies employing the next-generation sequencing technology also visualized a deeper slice of the molecular mechanism such as the role of the cell cycle program in the cucumber sex expression. This review aims to provide an overview of the sex expression of cucumber including its underlying molecular mechanism and regulatory aspects based on recent investigations.© 2024.

38670977,Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs): molecular mechanisms of induction and applications.,Signal Transduct Target Ther,"The induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology has transformed in vitro research and holds great promise to advance regenerative medicine. iPSCs have the capacity for an almost unlimited expansion, are amenable to genetic engineering, and can be differentiated into most somatic cell types. iPSCs have been widely applied to model human development and diseases, perform drug screening, and develop cell therapies. In this review, we outline key developments in the iPSC field and highlight the immense versatility of the iPSC technology for in vitro modeling and therapeutic applications. We begin by discussing the pivotal discoveries that revealed the potential of a somatic cell nucleus for reprogramming and led to successful generation of iPSCs. We consider the molecular mechanisms and dynamics of somatic cell reprogramming as well as the numerous methods available to induce pluripotency. Subsequently, we discuss various iPSC-based cellular models, from mono-cultures of a single cell type to complex three-dimensional organoids, and how these models can be applied to elucidate the mechanisms of human development and diseases. We use examples of neurological disorders, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and cancer to highlight the diversity of disease-specific phenotypes that can be modeled using iPSC-derived cells. We also consider how iPSC-derived cellular models can be used in high-throughput drug screening and drug toxicity studies. Finally, we discuss the process of developing autologous and allogeneic iPSC-based cell therapies and their potential to alleviate human diseases.© 2024. The Author(s).",9.498055865431968e-60
38643268,Integrative analysis in head and neck cancer reveals distinct role of miRNome and methylome as tumour epigenetic drivers.,Sci Rep,"Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide, with the relatively low 5-year survival rate, mainly because it is diagnosed at a late stage. Infection with HPV is a well known aetiology, which affects the nature of these cancers and patients' survival. Besides, it is considered that the main driving force for this type of cancer could be epigenetics. In this study we aimed to find potential epigenetic biomarkers, by integrating miRNome, methylome, and transcriptome analyses. From the fresh head and neck cancer tissue samples, we chose a group for miRNome, methylome and transcriptome profiling, in comparison to adequate control samples. Bioinformatics analyses are performed in R v4.2.2. Count normalisation and group differential expression for mRNA and the previously obtained miRNA count data was performed with DESeq2 v1.36. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed and visualised using gProfiler2 v0.2.1 Identification of miRNA targets was performed by querying in miRTarBase using multiMiR v1.18.0. Annotation of CpG sites merging into islands was obtained from RnBeads.hg19 v1.28.0. package. For the integrative analysis we performed kmeans clustering using stats v4.2.2 package, using 8-12 clusters and nstart 100. We found that transcriptome analysis divides samples into cancers and controls clusters, with no relation to HPV status or cancer anatomical location. Differentially expressed genes (n = 2781) were predominantly associated with signalling pathways of tumour progression. We identified a cluster of genes under the control of the transcription factor E2F that are significantly underexpressed in cancer tissue, as well as T cell immunity genes and genes related to regulation of transcription. Among overexpressed genes in tumours we found those that belong to cell cycle regulation and vasculature. A small number of genes were found significantly differentially expressed in HPV-positive versus HPV-negative tumours (for example NEFH, ZFR2, TAF7L, ZNF541, and TYMS). In this comprehensive study on an overlapping set of samples where the integration of miRNome, methylome and transcriptome analysis were performed for head and neck cancer, we demonstrated that the majority of genes were associated exclusively with miRNome or methylome and, to a lesser extent, under the control of both epigenetic mechanisms.© 2024.

38632583,Analysis of REST binding sites with canonical and non-canonical motifs in human cell lines.,BMC Med Genomics,"Repressor element 1 (RE1) silencing transcription factor (REST) is a transcriptional repressor abundantly expressed in aging human brains. It is known to regulate genes associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurological disorders by binding to a canonical form of sequence motif and its non-canonical variations. Although analysis of genomic sequence motifs is crucial to understand transcriptional regulation by transcription factors (TFs), a comprehensive characterization of various forms of RE1 motifs in human cell lines has not been performed.Here, we analyzed 23 ENCODE REST ChIP-seq datasets from diverse human cell lines and identified a non-redundant set of 68,975 loci with ChIP-seq peaks. Our systematic characterization of these binding sites revealed that the canonical form of REST binding motif was found primarily in ChIP-seq peaks shared across multiple cell lines, while non-canonical forms of motifs were identified in both cell-line-specific binding sites and those shared across cell lines. Remarkably, we observed a notable prevalence of non-canonical motifs that corresponded to half segments of the canonical motif. Furthermore, our analysis unveiled the presence of cell-line-specific REST binding patterns, as evidenced by the clustering of ChIP-seq experiments according to their respective cell lines. This observation underscores the cell-line specificity of REST binding at certain genomic loci, implying intricate cell-line-specific regulatory mechanisms.Overall, our study provides a comprehensive characterization of REST binding motifs in human cell lines and genome-wide RE1 motif profiles. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of REST-mediated transcriptional regulation and highlight the importance of considering cell-line-specific effects in future investigations.© 2024.

38566104,Race-specific coregulatory and transcriptomic profiles associated with DNA methylation and androgen receptor in prostate cancer.,Genome Med,"Prostate cancer is a significant health concern, particularly among African American (AA) men who exhibit higher incidence and mortality compared to European American (EA) men. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these disparities is imperative for enhancing clinical management and achieving better outcomes.Employing a multi-omics approach, we analyzed prostate cancer in both AA and EA men. Using Illumina methylation arrays and RNA sequencing, we investigated DNA methylation and gene expression in tumor and non-tumor prostate tissues. Additionally, Boolean analysis was utilized to unravel complex networks contributing to racial disparities in prostate cancer.When comparing tumor and adjacent non-tumor prostate tissues, we found that DNA hypermethylated regions are enriched for PRC2/H3K27me3 pathways and EZH2/SUZ12 cofactors. Olfactory/ribosomal pathways and distinct cofactors, including CTCF and KMT2A, were enriched in DNA hypomethylated regions in prostate tumors from AA men. We identified race-specific inverse associations of DNA methylation with expression of several androgen receptor (AR) associated genes, including the GATA family of transcription factors and TRIM63. This suggests that race-specific dysregulation of the AR signaling pathway exists in prostate cancer. To investigate the effect of AR inhibition on race-specific gene expression changes, we generated in-silico patient-specific prostate cancer Boolean networks. Our simulations revealed prolonged AR inhibition causes significant dysregulation of TGF-β, IDH1, and cell cycle pathways specifically in AA prostate cancer. We further quantified global gene expression changes, which revealed differential expression of genes related to microtubules, immune function, and TMPRSS2-fusion pathways, specifically in prostate tumors of AA men. Enrichment of these pathways significantly correlated with an altered risk of disease progression in a race-specific manner.Our study reveals unique signaling networks underlying prostate cancer biology in AA and EA men, offering potential insights for clinical management strategies tailored to specific racial groups. Targeting AR and associated pathways could be particularly beneficial in addressing the disparities observed in prostate cancer outcomes in the context of AA and EA men. Further investigation into these identified pathways may lead to the development of personalized therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes for prostate cancer patients across different racial backgrounds.© 2024.

38517697,Comparative analysis of models in predicting the effects of SNPs on TF-DNA binding using large-scale in vitro and in vivo data.,Brief Bioinform,"Non-coding variants associated with complex traits can alter the motifs of transcription factor (TF)-deoxyribonucleic acid binding. Although many computational models have been developed to predict the effects of non-coding variants on TF binding, their predictive power lacks systematic evaluation. Here we have evaluated 14 different models built on position weight matrices (PWMs), support vector machines, ordinary least squares and deep neural networks (DNNs), using large-scale in vitro (i.e. SNP-SELEX) and in vivo (i.e. allele-specific binding, ASB) TF binding data. Our results show that the accuracy of each model in predicting SNP effects in vitro significantly exceeds that achieved in vivo. For in vitro variant impact prediction, kmer/gkm-based machine learning methods (deltaSVM_HT-SELEX, QBiC-Pred) trained on in vitro datasets exhibit the best performance. For in vivo ASB variant prediction, DNN-based multitask models (DeepSEA, Sei, Enformer) trained on the ChIP-seq dataset exhibit relatively superior performance. Among the PWM-based methods, tRap demonstrates better performance in both in vitro and in vivo evaluations. In addition, we find that TF classes such as basic leucine zipper factors could be predicted more accurately, whereas those such as C2H2 zinc finger factors are predicted less accurately, aligning with the evolutionary conservation of these TF classes. We also underscore the significance of non-sequence factors such as cis-regulatory element type, TF expression, interactions and post-translational modifications in influencing the in vivo predictive performance of TFs. Our research provides valuable insights into selecting prioritization methods for non-coding variants and further optimizing such models.© The Author(s) 2024.

To better understand their malignancy, we investigated how AT/RT-specific DNA hypermethylation was associated with gene expression and altered transcription factor binding and how it is linked to upstream regulation. Medulloblastomas, choroid plexus tumors, pluripotent stem cells, and fetal brain were used as references. A part of the genomic regions, which were hypermethylated in AT/RTs similarly as in pluripotent stem cells and demethylated in the fetal brain, were targeted by neural transcriptional regulators. AT/RT-unique DNA hypermethylation was associated with polycomb repressive complex 2 and linked to suppressed genes with a role in neural development and tumorigenesis. Activity of the several NEUROG/NEUROD pioneer factors, which are unable to bind to methylated DNA, was compromised via the suppressed expression or DNA hypermethylation of their target sites, which was also experimentally validated for NEUROD1 in medulloblastomas and AT/RT samples. These results highlight and characterize the role of DNA hypermethylation in AT/RT malignancy and halted neural cell differentiation.© 2024 Pekkarinen et al.",1.925131360400018e-28
38659923,DNA methylation differences between the female and male X chromosomes in human brain.,bioRxiv,"The mechanisms of X chromosome inactivation suggest fundamental epigenetic differences between the female and male X chromosomes. However, DNA methylation studies often exclude the X chromosomes. In addition, many previous studies relied on techniques that examine non-randomly selected subsets of positions such as array-based methods, rather than assessing the whole X chromosome. Consequently, our understanding of X chromosome DNA methylation lags behind that of autosomes. Here we addressed this gap of knowledge by studying X chromosome DNA methylation using 89 whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) maps from neurons and oligodendrocytes. Using this unbiased and comprehensive data, we show that DNA methylation of the female X chromosomes is globally reduced (hypomethylated) across the entire chromosome compared to the male X chromosomes and autosomes. On the other hand, the majority of X-linked promoters were more highly methylated (hypermethylated) in females compared to males, consistent with the role of DNA methylation in X chromosome inactivation and dosage compensation. Remarkably, hypermethylation of female X promoters was limited to a group of previously lowly methylated promoters. The other group of highly methylated promoters were both hyper- and hypo-methylated in females with no obvious association with gene expression. Therefore, X chromosome inactivation by DNA methylation was exclusive to a subset of promoters with distinctive epigenetic feature. Apart from this group of promoters, differentially methylated regions in the female and male X chromosomes were dominated by female hypomethylation. Our study furthers the understanding of X-chromosome dosage regulation by DNA methylation on the chromosomal level as well as on individual gene level.",2.4259196110489946e-11

Consequently, this study aims to examine the connection between NLR and all-cause as well as cardiovascular mortality in the population of the United States (US) with hyperglycemia status.Data were collected from a total of 20,270 eligible individuals enrolled for analysis, spanning ten cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2018. The subjects were categorized into three groups based on tertiles of NLR levels. The association of NLR with both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression models. Restricted cubic splines were used to visualize the nonlinear relationship between NLR levels and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in subjects with diabetes after accounting for all relevant factors.Over a median follow-up period of 8.6 years, a total of 1909 subjects with diabetes died, with 671 deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease (CVD). And over a period of 8.46 years, 1974 subjects with prediabetes died, with 616 cases due to CVD. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) comparing high to low tertile of NLR in diabetes subjects were found to be 1.37 (95% CI, 1.19-1.58) for all-cause mortality and 1.63 (95% CI, 1.29-2.05) for CVD mortality. And the correlation between high to low NLR tertile and heightened susceptibility to mortality from any cause (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.43) and CVD mortality (HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.08-2.04) remained statistically significant (both p-values for trend < 0.05) in prediabetes subjects. The 10-year cumulative survival probability was determined to be 70.34%, 84.65% for all-cause events, and 86.21%, 94.54% for cardiovascular events in top NLR tertile of diabetes and prediabetes individuals, respectively. Furthermore, each incremental unit in the absolute value of NLR was associated with a 16%, 12% increase in all-cause mortality and a 25%, 24% increase in cardiovascular mortality among diabetes and prediabetes individuals, respectively.The findings of this prospective cohort study conducted in the US indicate a positive association of elevated NLR levels with heightened risks of overall and cardiovascular mortality among adults with diabetes and prediabetes. However, potential confounding factors for NLR and the challenge of monitoring NLR's fluctuations over time should be further focused.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.3646788759404502e-23
38529588,Correlation of Neutrophil-Lymphocyte and Albumin-Globulin Ratios With Outcomes in Patients With Breast Cancer Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy or Upfront Surgery.,J Breast Cancer,"Higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLRs) indicate a pro-inflammatory state and are associated with poor survival. Conversely, higher albumin-globulin ratio (AGRs) may be associated with improved prognosis. We aimed to investigate the association between NLR and AGR and prognosis and survival in patients with breast cancer.This retrospective study included all patients with stage I-III breast cancer between 2011 and 2017 in Singapore General Hospital and National Cancer Center Singapore. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of NLR, AGR, age, stage, grade, and subtype was performed. Survival data between groups were compared using Cox regression analysis and log-rank tests.A total of 1,188 patients were included, of whom 323 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and 865 underwent upfront surgery. In patients who underwent NACT, a higher AGR was significantly associated with a higher pCR rate (cut-off > 1.28; odds ratio [OR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-3.74;p= 0.020), better DFS (cut off > 1.55; hazard ratio [HR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16-0.85;p= 0.019), and better CSS (cut off > 1.46; HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.17-0.92;p= 0.031). Higher NLR was significantly associated with worse DFS (cut off > 4.09; HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.07-2.91;p= 0.026) and worse CSS (cut off > 4.09; HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.11-3.53;p= 0.021). In patients who underwent upfront surgery, higher AGR correlated with significantly better OS (cut off > 1.17; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36-0.82;p= 0.004) and higher NLR correlated with worse OS (cut off > 2.38; HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09-2.44;p= 0.018).NLR and AGR are useful in predicting the response to NACT as well as prognosis of patients with breast cancer.

The iodine concentration in the venous phase (ICvp), standardized iodine concentration (NICVP), and the slope of the energy spectrum curve (kVP) were extracted from DSCT data. NLR was determined from laboratory results. DSCT (including ICVP, NICVP, and kVP) and combination (including DSCT model and NLR) models were established based on the multinomial logistic regression analysis. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the diagnostic value.A total of 155 patients (SRC [n = 45, aged 61.22 ± 11.4 years], mSRC [n = 60, aged 61.09 ± 12.7 years], and nSRC [n = 50, aged 67.66 ± 8.76 years]) were included. There were significant differences in NLR, ICVP, NICVP, and kVPamong the SRC, mSRC, and nSRC groups (all P < 0.001). The AUC of the combination model for SRC vs. mSRC + nSRC was 0.964 (95% CI: 0.923-1.000), with a sensitivity of 98.3% and a specificity of 86.7%, higher than with DSCT (AUC: 0.959, 95% CI: 0.919-0.998, sensitivity: 90.0%, specificity: 89.9%) or NLR (AUC: 0.670, 95% CI: 0.577-0.768, sensitivity: 62.2%, specificity: 61.8%).DSCT combined with NLR showed high diagnostic efficacy in differentiating SRC from mSRC and nSRC.© 2024.

38567944,A concerted increase in readthrough and intron retention drives transposon expression during aging and senescence.,Elife,"Aging and senescence are characterized by pervasive transcriptional dysfunction, including increased expression of transposons and introns. Our aim was to elucidate mechanisms behind this increased expression. Most transposons are found within genes and introns, with a large minority being close to genes. This raises the possibility that transcriptional readthrough and intron retention are responsible for age-related changes in transposon expression rather than expression of autonomous transposons. To test this, we compiled public RNA-seq datasets from aged human fibroblasts, replicative and drug-induced senescence in human cells, and RNA-seq from aging mice and senescent mouse cells. Indeed, our reanalysis revealed a correlation between transposons expression, intron retention, and transcriptional readthrough across samples and within samples. Both intron retention and readthrough increased with aging or cellular senescence and these transcriptional defects were more pronounced in human samples as compared to those of mice. In support of a causal connection between readthrough and transposon expression, analysis of models showing induced transcriptional readthrough confirmed that they also show elevated transposon expression. Taken together, our data suggest that elevated transposon reads during aging seen in various RNA-seq dataset are concomitant with multiple transcriptional defects. Intron retention and transcriptional readthrough are the most likely explanation for the expression of transposable elements that lack a functional promoter.© 2023, Pabis et al.",9.2398287247741e-44
38709169,ISWI chromatin remodeling complexes recruit NSD2 and H3K36me2 in pericentromeric heterochromatin.,J Cell Biol,"Histone H3 lysine36 dimethylation (H3K36me2) is generally distributed in the gene body and euchromatic intergenic regions. However, we found that H3K36me2 is enriched in pericentromeric heterochromatin in some mouse cell lines. We here revealed the mechanism of heterochromatin targeting of H3K36me2. Among several H3K36 methyltransferases, NSD2 was responsible for inducing heterochromatic H3K36me2. Depletion and overexpression analyses of NSD2-associating proteins revealed that NSD2 recruitment to heterochromatin was mediated through the imitation switch (ISWI) chromatin remodeling complexes, such as BAZ1B-SMARCA5 (WICH), which directly binds to AT-rich DNA via a BAZ1B domain-containing AT-hook-like motifs. The abundance and stoichiometry of NSD2, SMARCA5, and BAZ1B could determine the localization of H3K36me2 in different cell types. In mouse embryos, H3K36me2 heterochromatin localization was observed at the two- to four-cell stages, suggesting its physiological relevance.© 2024 Goto et al.",3.7268893542274735e-32
38678237,Histone proteoform analysis reveals epigenetic changes in adult mouse brown adipose tissue in response to cold stress.,Epigenetics Chromatin,"Regulation of the thermogenic response by brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an important component of energy homeostasis with implications for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. Our preliminary analyses of RNA-Seq data uncovered many nodes representing epigenetic modifiers that are altered in BAT in response to chronic thermogenic activation. Thus, we hypothesized that chronic thermogenic activation broadly alters epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones in BAT.Motivated to understand how BAT function is regulated epigenetically, we developed a novel method for the first-ever unbiased top-down proteomic quantitation of histone modifications in BAT and validated our results with a multi-omic approach. To test our hypothesis, wildtype male C57BL/6J mice were housed under chronic conditions of thermoneutral temperature (TN, 28°C), mild cold/room temperature (RT, 22°C), or severe cold (SC, 8°C) and BAT was analyzed for DNA methylation and histone modifications. Methylation of promoters and intragenic regions in genomic DNA decrease in response to chronic cold exposure. Integration of DNA methylation and RNA expression datasets suggest a role for epigenetic modification of DNA in regulation of gene expression in response to cold. In response to cold housing, we observe increased bulk acetylation of histones H3.2 and H4, increased histone H3.2 proteoforms with di- and trimethylation of lysine 9 (K9me2 and K9me3), and increased histone H4 proteoforms with acetylation of lysine 16 (K16ac) in BAT.Our results reveal global epigenetically-regulated transcriptional ""on"" and ""off"" signals in murine BAT in response to varying degrees of chronic cold stimuli and establish a novel methodology to quantitatively study histones in BAT, allowing for direct comparisons to decipher mechanistic changes during the thermogenic response. Additionally, we make histone PTM and proteoform quantitation, RNA splicing, RRBS, and transcriptional footprint datasets available as a resource for future research.© 2024.

38560180,Prognostic effect of DNA methylation of BTG2 gene in Chinese hepatocellular carcinoma.,Heliyon,"This study aims to develop a prognostic model for overall survival based on potential methylation sites within B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2) in Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).This is a retrospective study. The beta values of nine CpG sites and RSEM normalized count values ofBTG2gene were extracted from the Cancer Genome Atlas-Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) (TCGA-LIHC) dataset, with the beta value representing the methylation level by indicating the ratio of the intensity of the methylated bead type to the combined locus intensity. Pyrosequencing was performed to determine the range of methylation values surrounding cg01798157 site inBTG2gene. A weighted linear model was developed to predict the overall survival (OS).The beta value of cg01798157 was significantly negatively associated with the mRNA expression ofBTG2in the TCGA-LIHC dataset (Spearman's rho = -0.5306,P = 2.27 × 10-27). The methylation level of cg01798157 was significantly associated with OS in the cohort of 51 Chinese HCC patients (Hazard ratio = 0.597, 95% CI: 0.434-0.820,P = 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified methylation level of cg01798157, cirrhosis, and microvascular invasion as independent prognostic factors. The prognostic efficiency of death risk score was superior to that of cirrhosis or microvascular invasion alone.The methylation level of cg01798157 inBTG2may be an epigenetic biomarker in Chinese patients with resectable HCC.© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",3.121287935963063e-21
38668978,DNA Methylation in Ctenophores.,Methods Mol Biol,"Epigenomic regulation and dynamic DNA methylation, in particular, are widespread mechanisms orchestrating the genome operation across time and species. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is currently the only method for unbiasedly capturing the presence of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) DNA methylation patterns across an entire genome with single-nucleotide resolution. Bisulfite treatment converts unmethylated cytosines to uracils but leaves methylated cytosines intact, thereby creating a map of all methylated cytosines across a genome also known as a methylome. These epigenomic patterns of DNA methylation have been found to regulate gene expression and influence gene evolution rates between species. While protocols have been optimized for vertebrate methylome production, little adaptation has been done for invertebrates. Creating a methylome reference allows comparisons to be made between rates of transcription and epigenomic patterning in animals. Here we present a method of library construction for bisulfite sequencing optimized for non-bilateral metazoans such as the ctenophore, Mnemiopsis leidyi. We have improved upon our previously published method by including spike-in genomic DNA controls to measure methylation conversion rates. By pooling two bisulfite conversion reactions from the same individual, we also produced sequencing libraries that yielded a higher percentage of sequenced reads uniquely mapping to the reference genome. We successfully detected 5-mC in whole-animal methylomes at CpG, CHG, and CHH sites and visualized datasets using circos diagrams. The proof-of-concept tests were performed both under control conditions and following injury tests with changes in methylation patterns of genes encoding innexins, toxins and neuropeptides. Our approach can be easily adapted to produce epigenomes from other fragile marine animals.© 2024. Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2.633108866866336e-19
38641644,Analysis of blood methylation quantitative trait loci in East Asians reveals ancestry-specific impacts on complex traits.,Nat Genet,"Methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) are essential for understanding the role of DNA methylation changes in genetic predisposition, yet they have not been fully characterized in East Asians (EAs). Here we identified mQTLs in whole blood from 3,523 Chinese individuals and replicated them in additional 1,858 Chinese individuals from two cohorts. Over 9% of mQTLs displayed specificity to EAs, facilitating the fine-mapping of EA-specific genetic associations, as shown for variants associated with height. Trans-mQTL hotspots revealed biological pathways contributing to EA-specific genetic associations, including an ERG-mediated 233 trans-mCpG network, implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation, which likely reflects binding efficiency modulation of the ERG protein complex. More than 90% of mQTLs were shared between different blood cell lineages, with a smaller fraction of lineage-specific mQTLs displaying preferential hypomethylation in the respective lineages. Our study provides new insights into the mQTL landscape across genetic ancestries and their downstream effects on cellular processes and diseases/traits.© 2024.

The proliferation of developed methods coupled with inconsistent results obtained in many cases, highlights the pressing need for guidance in the selection of appropriate methods. Additionally, the growing accessibility of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, often accompanied by bulk expression from related samples enable the benchmark of existing methods.In this study, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of 31 methods, utilizing single-cell RNA-sequencing data from diverse human and mouse tissues. Employing various simulation scenarios, we reveal the efficacy of regression-based deconvolution methods, highlighting their sensitivity to reference choices. We investigate the impact of bulk-reference differences, incorporating variables such as sample, study and technology. We provide validation using a gold standard dataset from mononuclear cells and suggest a consensus prediction of proportions when ground truth is not available.

Evidence links maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) to detrimental birth outcomes, yet the impact on the infant's epigenome is unclear. Moreover, maternal sleep habits during pregnancy may influence this association. Here, we explore whether restless sleep during pregnancy moderates the association between exposure to maternal childhood adversity and infant epigenetic age acceleration in 332 mother-infant dyads (56% female; 39% Black; 25% Hispanic). During the 2ndtrimester, mothers self-reported childhood adversity and past-week restless sleep; DNA methylation from umbilical vein endothelial cells was used to estimate five epigenetic clocks. Multivariable linear regression was used to test study hypotheses. Despite no evidence of main effects, there was evidence of an interaction between maternal ACEs and restless sleep in predicting infant epigenetic age acceleration using the EPIC Gestational Age clock. Only infants whose mothers reported exposure to both ACEs and restless sleep demonstrated accelerated epigenetic aging. Results provide preliminary evidence that maternal childhood adversity and sleep may influence the infant epigenome.",0.9999999999999996

Compared to other periods in life, during this early period of acute vulnerability, when children's biological and regulatory systems are developing, biological aging occurs most rapidly. We review theory and empirical research suggesting that processes of development and aging are intricately linked, and that early adversity may program biological parameters for accelerated aging and disease risk early in life, even though clinical signs of age-related disease onset may not be evident until many years later. Following from this, we make the case for widespread incorporation of biological aging constructs into child development research.",1.8162088428617732e-08
38561362,A negative feedback loop between TET2 and leptin in adipocyte regulates body weight.,Nat Commun,"Ten-eleven translocation (TET) 2 is an enzyme that catalyzes DNA demethylation to regulate gene expression by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, functioning as an essential epigenetic regulator in various biological processes. However, the regulation and function of TET2 in adipocytes during obesity are poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that leptin, a key adipokine in mammalian energy homeostasis regulation, suppresses adipocyte TET2 levels via JAK2-STAT3 signaling. Adipocyte Tet2 deficiency protects against high-fat diet-induced weight gain by reducing leptin levels and further improving leptin sensitivity in obese male mice. By interacting with C/EBPα, adipocyte TET2 increases the hydroxymethylcytosine levels of the leptin gene promoter, thereby promoting leptin gene expression. A decrease in adipose TET2 is associated with obesity-related hyperleptinemia in humans. Inhibition of TET2 suppresses the production of leptin in mature human adipocytes. Our findings support the existence of a negative feedback loop between TET2 and leptin in adipocytes and reveal a compensatory mechanism for the body to counteract the metabolic dysfunction caused by obesity.© 2024.

38529333,Gender-specific genetic and epigenetic signatures in cardiovascular disease.,Front Cardiovasc Med,"Cardiac sex differences represent a pertinent focus in pursuit of the long-awaited goal of personalized medicine. Despite evident disparities in the onset and progression of cardiac pathology between sexes, historical oversight has led to the neglect of gender-specific considerations in the treatment of patients. This oversight is attributed to a predominant focus on male samples and a lack of sex-based segregation in patient studies. Recognizing these sex differences is not only relevant to the treatment of cisgender individuals; it also holds paramount importance in addressing the healthcare needs of transgender patients, a demographic that is increasingly prominent in contemporary society. In response to these challenges, various agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, have actively directed their efforts toward advancing our comprehension of this phenomenon. Epigenetics has proven to play a crucial role in understanding sex differences in both healthy and disease states within the heart. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the physiological distinctions between males and females during the development of various cardiac pathologies, specifically focusing on unraveling the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms at play. Current findings related to distinct sex-chromosome compositions, the emergence of gender-biased genetic variations, and variations in hormonal profiles between sexes are highlighted. Additionally, the roles of DNA methylation, histone marks, and chromatin structure in mediating pathological sex differences are explored.

Studies in mice that investigate underlying mechanisms have shown Chd8 haploinsufficient mice display some trait disruptions that mimic clinical phenotypes, although inconsistencies have been reported in some traits across different models on the same strain background. One source of variation across studies may be the impact of Chd8 haploinsufficiency on maternal-offspring interactions. While differences in maternal care as a function of Chd8 genotype have not been studied directly, a previous study showed that pup survival was reduced when reared by Chd8 heterozygous dams compared with wild-type (WT) dams, suggesting altered maternal care as a function of Chd8 genotype. Through systematic observation of the C57BL/6 strain, we first determined the impact of Chd8 haploinsufficiency in the offspring on WT maternal care frequencies across preweaning development. We next determined the impact of maternal Chd8 haploinsufficiency on pup care. Compared with litters with all WT offspring, WT dams exhibited less frequent maternal behaviors toward litters consisting of offspring with mixed Chd8 genotypes, particularly during postnatal week 1. Dam Chd8 haploinsufficiency decreased litter survival and increased active maternal care also during postnatal week 1. Determining the impact of Chd8 haploinsufficiency on early life experiences provides an important foundation for interpreting offspring outcomes and determining mechanisms that underlie heterogeneous phenotypes.© 2024 The Authors.

38711368,Interpretation of 10 years of Alzheimer's disease genetic findings in the perspective of statistical heterogeneity.,Brief Bioinform,"Common genetic variants and susceptibility loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been discovered through large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), GWAS by proxy (GWAX) and meta-analysis of GWAS and GWAX (GWAS+GWAX). However, due to the very low repeatability of AD susceptibility loci and the low heritability of AD, these AD genetic findings have been questioned. We summarize AD genetic findings from the past 10 years and provide a new interpretation of these findings in the context of statistical heterogeneity. We discovered that only 17% of AD risk loci demonstrated reproducibility with a genome-wide significance of P < 5.00E-08 across all AD GWAS and GWAS+GWAX datasets. We highlighted that the AD GWAS+GWAX with the largest sample size failed to identify the most significant signals, the maximum number of genome-wide significant genetic variants or maximum heritability. Additionally, we identified widespread statistical heterogeneity in AD GWAS+GWAX datasets, but not in AD GWAS datasets. We consider that statistical heterogeneity may have attenuated the statistical power in AD GWAS+GWAX and may contribute to explaining the low repeatability (17%) of genome-wide significant AD susceptibility loci and the decreased AD heritability (40-2%) as the sample size increased. Importantly, evidence supports the idea that a decrease in statistical heterogeneity facilitates the identification of genome-wide significant genetic loci and contributes to an increase in AD heritability. Collectively, current AD GWAX and GWAS+GWAX findings should be meticulously assessed and warrant additional investigation, and AD GWAS+GWAX should employ multiple meta-analysis methods, such as random-effects inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis, which is designed specifically for statistical heterogeneity.© The Author(s) 2024.

Recent research has shed light on the intriguing association between fetal lung development disorders and the development of adult diseases. Understanding these links can provide valuable insights into the developmental origins of health and disease, paving the way for targeted preventive measures and clinical interventions. This review article aims to comprehensively explore the association of fetal lung development disorders with adult diseases. We delve into the stages of fetal lung development, examining key factors influencing fetal lung maturation. Subsequently, we investigate specific fetal lung development disorders, such as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), and other abnormalities. Furthermore, we explore the potential mechanisms underlying these associations, considering the role of epigenetic modifications, transgenerational effects, and intrauterine environmental factors. Additionally, we examine the epidemiological evidence and clinical findings linking fetal lung development disorders to adult respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other respiratory ailments.

There is significant interest in globally identifying these methylation marks. Unfortunately, this remains challenging due to the lack of robust technologies for selectively labeling Kme2. To address this, we present a chemical method named tertiary amine coupling by oxidation (TACO). This method selectively modifies Kme2to aldehydes using Selectfluor and a base. The resulting aldehydes from Kme2were then functionalized using reductive amination, thiolamine, and oxime chemistry. We successfully demonstrated the versatility of TACO in selectively labeling Kme2peptides and proteins in complex cell lysate mixtures with varying payloads, including affinity tags and fluorophores. We further showed the application of TACO chemistry for the identification of Kme2sites at a single-molecule level by fluorosequencing. We discovered novel 30 Kme2sites, in addition to previously known 5 Kme2sites, by proteomics analysis of TACO-modified nuclear extracts.

38539515,PIP4K2B Protein Regulation by NSD1 in HPV-Negative Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,Cancers (Basel),"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) ranks among the most prevalent global cancers. Despite advancements in treatments, the five-year survival rate remains at approximately 66%. The histone methyltransferase NSD1, known for its role in catalyzing histone H3 lysine 36 di-methylation (H3K36me2), emerges as a potential oncogenic factor in HNSCC. Our study, employing Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) analysis and subsequent validation, reveals that PIP4K2B is a key downstream target of NSD1. Notably, PIP4K2B depletion in HNSCC induces downregulation of the mTOR pathway, resulting in diminished cell growth in vitro. Our investigation highlights a direct, positive regulatory role of NSD1 on PIP4K2B gene transcription through an H3K36me2-dependent mechanism. Importantly, the impact of PIP4K2B appears to be context-dependent, with overexpression rescuing cell growth in laryngeal HNSCC cells but not in tongue/hypopharynx cells. In conclusion, our findings implicate PIP4K2B as a novel NSD1-dependent protein in HNSCC, suggesting its potential significance for laryngeal cancer cell survival. This insight contributes to our understanding of the molecular landscape in HNSCC and establishes PIP4KB as a promising target for drug development.",3.479461535518574e-49
38654121,YY1 binding is a gene-intrinsic barrier to Xist-mediated gene silencing.,EMBO Rep,"X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in mammals is mediated by Xist RNA which functions in cis to silence genes on a single X chromosome in XX female cells, thereby equalising levels of X-linked gene expression relative to XY males. XCI progresses over a period of several days, with some X-linked genes silencing faster than others. The chromosomal location of a gene is an important determinant of silencing rate, but uncharacterised gene-intrinsic features also mediate resistance or susceptibility to silencing. In this study, we examine mouse embryonic stem cell lines with an inducible Xist allele (iXist-ChrX mESCs) and integrate allele-specific data of gene silencing and decreasing inactive X (Xi) chromatin accessibility over time courses of Xist induction with cellular differentiation. Our analysis reveals that motifs bound by the transcription factor YY1 are associated with persistently accessible regulatory elements, including many promoters and enhancers of slow-silencing genes. We further show that YY1 is evicted relatively slowly from target sites on Xi, and that silencing of X-linked genes is increased upon YY1 degradation. Together our results suggest that YY1 acts as a barrier to Xist-mediated silencing until the late stages of the XCI process.© 2024. Crown.",1.5374192595759156e-28
38610938,Sex-Specific Expression of Histone Lysine Demethylases (KDMs) in Thyroid Cancer.,Cancers (Basel),"The incidence of thyroid cancer in women is 3-4-fold higher than in men. To characterize sex-specific molecular alterations in thyroid cancer, we examined the expression of sex-biased genes in normal thyroids and thyroid tumors.Ingenuity pathways analysis was used to define sex-biased gene networks using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Confirmatory studies were performed through the analysis of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) expression by real-time PCR and immunostaining.In normal thyroids, 44 sex-biased genes were comparatively upregulated in male and 28 in female patients. The expressions of 37/72 (51%) sex-biased genes were affected in cancer tissues compared with normal thyroids. Gene network analyses revealed sex-specific patterns in the expressions of KDM5C, KDM5D, and KDM6A. In confirmatory studies, KDM5D mRNA and protein were detected only in males, whereas KDM5C and KDM6A were detected in samples from male and female patients. Nuclear staining with anti-KDMs was found in normal thyroids, but a loss of nuclear expression with a concomitant gain of cytoplasmic staining was observed in cancer tissues.Normal thyroids have a sex-specific molecular signature, and the development of thyroid cancer is associated with a differential expression of sex-biased genes. The sex-specific expression of KDMs, coupled with cancer-related alterations in their intracellular localization, may contribute to mechanisms underlying sex differences in thyroid tumorigenesis.",6.015305121121316e-33
38589557,Hallmarks of sex bias in immuno-oncology: mechanisms and therapeutic implications.,Nat Rev Cancer,"Sex differences are present across multiple non-reproductive organ cancers, with male individuals generally experiencing higher incidence of cancer with poorer outcomes. Although some mechanisms underlying these differences are emerging, the immunological basis is not well understood. Observations from clinical trials also suggest a sex bias in conventional immunotherapies with male individuals experiencing a more favourable response and female individuals experiencing more severe adverse events to immune checkpoint blockade. In this Perspective article, we summarize the major biological hallmarks underlying sex bias in immuno-oncology. We focus on signalling from sex hormones and chromosome-encoded gene products, along with sex hormone-independent and chromosome-independent epigenetic mechanisms in tumour and immune cells such as myeloid cells and T cells. Finally, we highlight opportunities for future studies on sex differences that integrate sex hormones and chromosomes and other emerging cancer hallmarks such as ageing and the microbiome to provide a more comprehensive view of how sex differences underlie the response in cancer that can be leveraged for more effective immuno-oncology approaches.© 2024.

38532495,Sex and statin-related genetic associations at the PCSK9 gene locus: results of genome-wide association meta-analysis.,Biol Sex Differ,"Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a key player of lipid metabolism with higher plasma levels in women throughout their life. Statin treatment affects PCSK9 levels also showing evidence of sex-differential effects. It remains unclear whether these differences can be explained by genetics.We performed genome-wide association meta-analyses (GWAS) of PCSK9 levels stratified for sex and statin treatment in six independent studies of Europeans (8936 women/11,080 men respectively 14,825 statin-free/5191 statin-treated individuals). Loci associated in one of the strata were tested for statin- and sex-interactions considering all independent signals per locus. Independent variants at the PCSK9 gene locus were then used in a stratified Mendelian Randomization analysis (cis-MR) of PCSK9 effects on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to detect differences of causal effects between the subgroups.We identified 11 loci associated with PCSK9 in at least one stratified subgroup (p < 1.0 × 10-6), including the PCSK9 gene locus and five other lipid loci: APOB, TM6SF2, FADS1/FADS2, JMJD1C, and HP/HPR. The interaction analysis revealed eight loci with sex- and/or statin-interactions. At the PCSK9 gene locus, there were four independent signals, one with a significant sex-interaction showing stronger effects in men (rs693668). Regarding statin treatment, there were two significant interactions in PCSK9 missense mutations: rs11591147 had stronger effects in statin-free individuals, and rs11583680 had stronger effects in statin-treated individuals. Besides replicating known loci, we detected two novel genome-wide significant associations: one for statin-treated individuals at 6q11.1 (within KHDRBS2) and one for males at 12q24.22 (near KSR2/NOS1), both with significant interactions. In the MR of PCSK9 on LDL-C, we observed significant causal estimates within all subgroups, but significantly stronger causal effects in statin-free subjects compared to statin-treated individuals.We performed the first double-stratified GWAS of PCSK9 levels and identified multiple biologically plausible loci with genetic interaction effects. Our results indicate that the observed sexual dimorphism of PCSK9 and its statin-related interactions have a genetic basis. Significant differences in the causal relationship between PCSK9 and LDL-C suggest sex-specific dosages of PCSK9 inhibitors.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.618251139282572e-20
38688917,Dopamine signaling enriched striatal gene set predicts striatal dopamine synthesis and physiological activity in vivo.,Nat Commun,"The polygenic architecture of schizophrenia implicates several molecular pathways involved in synaptic function. However, it is unclear how polygenic risk funnels through these pathways to translate into syndromic illness. Using tensor decomposition, we analyze gene co-expression in the caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of post-mortem brain samples from 358 individuals. We identify a set of genes predominantly expressed in the caudate nucleus and associated with both clinical state and genetic risk for schizophrenia that shows dopaminergic selectivity. A higher polygenic risk score for schizophrenia parsed by this set of genes predicts greater dopamine synthesis in the striatum and greater striatal activation during reward anticipation. These results translate dopamine-linked genetic risk variation into in vivo neurochemical and hemodynamic phenotypes in the striatum that have long been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.© 2024.

38528176,A combination nutritional supplement reduces DNA methylation age only in older adults with a raised epigenetic age.,Geroscience,"An increase in systemic inflammation (inflammaging) is one of the hallmarks of aging. Epigenetic (DNA methylation) clocks can quantify the degree of biological aging and this can be reversed by lifestyle and pharmacological intervention. We aimed to investigate whether a multi-component nutritional supplement could reduce systemic inflammation and epigenetic age in healthy older adults.We recruited 80 healthy older participants (mean age ± SD: 71.85 ± 6.23; males = 31, females = 49). Blood and saliva were obtained pre and post a 12-week course of a multi-component supplement, containing: Vitamin B3, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Omega 3 fish oils, Resveratrol, Olive fruit phenols and Astaxanthin. Plasma GDF-15 and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were quantified as markers of biological aging and inflammation respectively. DNA methylation was assessed in whole blood and saliva and used to derive epigenetic age using various clock algorithms.No difference between the epigenetic and chronological ages of participants was observed pre- and post-treatment by the blood-based Horvath or Hannum clocks, or the saliva-based InflammAge clock. However, in those with epigenetic age acceleration of ≥ 2 years at baseline, a significant reduction in epigenetic age (p = 0.015) and epigenetic age acceleration (p = 0.0058) was observed post-treatment using the saliva-based InflammAge clock. No differences were observed pre- and post-treatment in plasma GDF-15 and CRP, though participants with CRP indicative of an elevated cardiovascular disease risk (hsCRP ≥ 3µg/ml), had a reduction in CRP post-supplementation (p = 0.0195).Our data suggest a possible benefit of combined nutritional supplementation in individuals with an accelerated epigenetic age and inflammaging.© 2024.

38496542,Developmental hematopoietic stem cell variation explains clonal hematopoiesis later in life.,bioRxiv,"Clonal hematopoiesis becomes increasingly common with age, but its cause is enigmatic because driver mutations are often absent. Serial observations infer weak selection indicating variants are acquired much earlier in life with unexplained initial growth spurts. Here we use fluctuating CpG methylation as a lineage marker to track stem cell clonal dynamics of hematopoiesis. We show, via the shared prenatal circulation of monozygotic twins, that weak selection conferred by stem cell variation created before birth can reliably yield clonal hematopoiesis later in life. Theory indicates weak selection will lead to dominance given enough time and large enough population sizes. Human hematopoiesis satisfies both these conditions. Stochastic loss of weakly selected variants is naturally prevented by the expansion of stem cell lineages during development. The dominance of stem cell clones created before birth is supported by blood fluctuating CpG methylation patterns that exhibit low correlation between unrelated individuals but are highly correlated between many elderly monozygotic twins. Therefore, clonal hematopoiesis driven by weak selection in later life appears to reflect variation created before birth.",6.016950665592575e-20
38532012,Immunophenotypes in psychosis: is it a premature inflamm-aging disorder?,Mol Psychiatry,"Immunopsychiatric field has rapidly accumulated evidence demonstrating the involvement of both innate and adaptive immune components in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Nevertheless, researchers are facing dilemmas of discrepant findings of immunophenotypes both outside and inside the brains of psychotic patients, as discovered by recent meta-analyses. These discrepancies make interpretations and interrogations on their roles in psychosis remain vague and even controversial, regarding whether certain immune cells are more activated or less so, and whether they are causal or consequential, or beneficial or harmful for psychosis. Addressing these issues for psychosis is not at all trivial, as immune cells either outside or inside the brain are an enormously heterogeneous and plastic cell population, falling into a vast range of lineages and subgroups, and functioning differently and malleably in context-dependent manners. This review aims to overview the currently known immunophenotypes of patients with psychosis, and provocatively suggest the premature immune ""burnout"" or inflamm-aging initiated since organ development as a potential primary mechanism behind these immunophenotypes and the pathogenesis of psychotic disorders.© 2024.

38728264,"The milk study protocol: A longitudinal, prospective cohort study of the relationship between human milk metabolic hormone concentration, maternal body composition, and early growth and satiety development in Samoan infants aged 1-4 months.",PLoS One,"Current research suggests that energy transfer through human milk influences infant nutritional development and initiates metabolic programming, influencing eating patterns into adulthood. To date, this research has predominantly been conducted among women in high income settings and/or among undernourished women. We will investigate the relationship between maternal body composition, metabolic hormones in human milk, and infant satiety to explore mechanisms of developmental satiety programming and implications for early infant growth and body composition in Samoans; a population at high risk and prevalence for overweight and obesity. Our aims are (1) to examine how maternal body composition influences metabolic hormone transfer from mother to infant through human milk, and (2) to examine the influences of maternal metabolic hormone transfer and infant feeding patterns on early infant growth and satiety.We will examine temporal changes in hormone transfers to infants through human milk in a prospective longitudinal cohort of n = 80 Samoan mother-infant dyads. Data will be collected at three time points (1, 3, & 4 months postpartum). At each study visit we will collect human milk and fingerpick blood samples from breastfeeding mother-infant dyads to measure the hormones leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin. Additionally, we will obtain body composition measurements from the dyad, observe breastfeeding behavior, conduct semi-structured interviews, and use questionnaires to document infant hunger and feeding cues and satiety responsiveness. Descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate analyses will be conducted to address each aim.This research is designed to advance our understanding of variation in the developmental programming of satiety and implications for early infant growth and body composition. The use of a prospective longitudinal cohort alongside data collection that utilizes a mixed methods approach will allow us to capture a more accurate representation on both biological and cultural variables at play in a population at high risk of overweight and obesity.Copyright: © 2024 Harries et al.

38627436,The impact of CREBRF rs373863828 Pacific-variant on infant body composition.,Sci Rep,"In Māori and Pacific adults, the CREBRF rs373863828 minor (A) allele is associated with increased body mass index (BMI) but reduced incidence of type-2 and gestational diabetes mellitus. In this prospective cohort study of Māori and Pacific infants, nested within a nutritional intervention trial for pregnant women with obesity and without pregestational diabetes, we investigated whether the rs373863828 A allele is associated with differences in growth and body composition from birth to 12-18 months' corrected age. Infants with and without the variant allele were compared using generalised linear models adjusted for potential confounding by gestation length, sex, ethnicity and parity, and in a secondary analysis, additionally adjusted for gestational diabetes. Carriage of the rs373863828 A allele was not associated with altered growth and body composition from birth to 6 months. At 12-18 months, infants with the rs373863828 A allele had lower whole-body fat mass [FM 1.4 (0.7) vs. 1.7 (0.7) kg, aMD -0.4, 95% CI -0.7, 0.0, P = 0.05; FM index 2.2 (1.1) vs. 2.6 (1.0) kg/m2aMD -0.6, 95% CI -1.2,0.0, P = 0.04]. However, this association was not significant after adjustment for gestational diabetes, suggesting that it may be mediated, at least in part, by the beneficial effect of CREBRF rs373863828 A allele on maternal glycemic status.© 2024.

38734844,Reduction of APOE accounts for neurobehavioral deficits in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.,Mol Psychiatry,"A hallmark of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is neurobehavioral deficits that still do not have effective treatment. Here, we present that reduction of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is critically involved in neurobehavioral deficits in FASD. We show that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) changes chromatin accessibility of Apoe locus, and causes reduction of APOE levels in both the brain and peripheral blood in postnatal mice. Of note, postnatal administration of an APOE receptor agonist (APOE-RA) mitigates motor learning deficits and anxiety in those mice. Several molecular and electrophysiological properties essential for learning, which are altered by PAE, are restored by APOE-RA. Our human genome-wide association study further reveals that the interaction of PAE and a single nucleotide polymorphism in the APOE enhancer which chromatin is closed by PAE in mice is associated with lower scores in the delayed matching-to-sample task in children. APOE in the plasma is also reduced in PAE children, and the reduced level is associated with their lower cognitive performance. These findings suggest that controlling the APOE level can serve as an effective treatment for neurobehavioral deficits in FASD.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.878907815768209e-18
38496252,Wonder symphony: epigenetics and the enchantment of the arts.,Environ Epigenet,"Epigenetics, the study of heritable changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, has gained significant attention due to its implications for gene regulation and chromatin stability. Epigenetic mechanisms play a fundamental role in gene-environment interactions, shaping individual development and adaptation. DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs are key epigenetic regulators. Epigenetic changes can be triggered by environmental factors, including stress, toxins, and social interactions, influencing health and well-being. Positive experiences, such as engagement with the arts, have been linked to emotional responses and neurotransmitter release. While the impacts of detrimental factors on epigenetics have been widely studied, the effects of positive influences are less explored. Specifically, visual art and music have profound effects on emotions, cognition, and mood regulation. Exposure to arts enhances memory, reduces stress, and fosters social inclusion. Recent research has begun to explore the links between positive experiences and epigenetic modifications, suggesting that aesthetic experiences, including visual art and music fruition, might induce dynamic and/or stable changes in gene expression profiles. However, this field is in its infancy, and more research is needed to establish clear connections. Collaborative efforts among genetics, epigenetics, neuroscience, psychology, and the arts are essential for a comprehensive understanding. Longitudinal studies tracking sustained exposure to positive experiences and examining the influence of childhood artistic education on the biological bases of therapeutic effects of art and music are promising avenues for future research. Ultimately, understanding how positive experiences influence epigenetics could provide insights into the long-term enhancement of human well-being.© The Author(s) 2024.

38714703,Determinants of mosaic chromosomal alteration fitness.,Nat Commun,"Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is characterized by the acquisition of a somatic mutation in a hematopoietic stem cell that results in a clonal expansion. These driver mutations can be single nucleotide variants in cancer driver genes or larger structural rearrangements called mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs). The factors that influence the variations in mCA fitness and ultimately result in different clonal expansion rates are not well understood. We used the Passenger-Approximated Clonal Expansion Rate (PACER) method to estimate clonal expansion rate as PACER scores for 6,381 individuals in the NHLBI TOPMed cohort with gain, loss, and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity mCAs. Our mCA fitness estimates, derived by aggregating per-individual PACER scores, were correlated (R2 = 0.49) with an alternative approach that estimated fitness of mCAs in the UK Biobank using population-level distributions of clonal fraction. Among individuals with JAK2 V617F clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential or mCAs affecting the JAK2 gene on chromosome 9, PACER score was strongly correlated with erythrocyte count. In a cross-sectional analysis, genome-wide association study of estimates of mCA expansion rate identified a TCL1A locus variant associated with mCA clonal expansion rate, with suggestive variants in NRIP1 and TERT.© 2024.

38617360,APOBEC shapes tumor evolution and age at onset of lung cancer in smokers.,bioRxiv,"APOBEC enzymes are part of the innate immunity and are responsible for restricting viruses and retroelements by deaminating cytosine residues1,2. Most solid tumors harbor different levels of somatic mutations attributed to the off-target activities of APOBEC3A (A3A) and/or APOBEC3B (A3B)3-6. However, how APOBEC3A/B enzymes shape the tumor evolution in the presence of exogenous mutagenic processes is largely unknown. Here, by combining deep whole-genome sequencing with multi-omics profiling of 309 lung cancers from smokers with detailed tobacco smoking information, we identify two subtypes defined by low (LAS) and high (HAS) APOBEC mutagenesis. LAS are enriched for A3B-like mutagenesis andKRASmutations, whereas HAS for A3A-like mutagenesis andTP53mutations. UnlikeAPOBEC3A,APOBEC3Bexpression is strongly associated with an upregulation of the base excision repair pathway. Hypermutation by unrepaired A3A and tobacco smoking mutagenesis combined withTP53-induced genomic instability can trigger senescence7, apoptosis8, and cell regeneration9, as indicated by high expression of pulmonary healing signaling pathway, stemness markers and distal cell-of-origin in HAS. The expected association of tobacco smoking variables (e.g., time to first cigarette) with genomic/epigenomic changes are not observed in HAS, a plausible consequence of frequent cell senescence or apoptosis. HAS have more neoantigens, slower clonal expansion, and older age at onset compared to LAS, particularly in heavy smokers, consistent with high proportions of newly generated, unmutated cells and frequent immuno-editing. These findings show how heterogeneity in mutational burden across co-occurring mutational processes and cell types contributes to tumor development, with important clinical implications.",2.6508849173520613e-35
38587182,Mutation rate heterogeneity at the sub-gene scale due to local DNA hypomethylation.,Nucleic Acids Res,"Local mutation rates in human are highly heterogeneous, with known variability at the scale of megabase-sized chromosomal domains, and, on the other extreme, at the scale of oligonucleotides. The intermediate, kilobase-scale heterogeneity in mutation risk is less well characterized. Here, by analyzing thousands of somatic genomes, we studied mutation risk gradients along gene bodies, representing a genomic scale spanning roughly 1-10 kb, hypothesizing that different mutational mechanisms are differently distributed across gene segments. The main heterogeneity concerns several kilobases at the transcription start site and further downstream into 5' ends of gene bodies; these are commonly hypomutated with several mutational signatures, most prominently the ubiquitous C > T changes at CpG dinucleotides. The width and shape of this mutational coldspot at 5' gene ends is variable across genes, and corresponds to variable interval of lowered DNA methylation depending on gene activity level and regulation. Such hypomutated loci, at 5' gene ends or elsewhere, correspond to DNA hypomethylation that can associate with various landmarks, including intragenic enhancers, Polycomb-marked regions, or chromatin loop anchor points. Tissue-specific DNA hypomethylation begets tissue-specific local hypomutation. Of note, direction of mutation risk is inverted for AID/APOBEC3 cytosine deaminase activity, whose signatures are enriched in hypomethylated regions.© The Author(s) 2024.

38503282,Contrasting somatic mutation patterns in aging human neurons and oligodendrocytes.,Cell,"Characterizing somatic mutations in the brain is important for disentangling the complex mechanisms of aging, yet little is known about mutational patterns in different brain cell types. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 86 single oligodendrocytes, 20 mixed glia, and 56 single neurons from neurotypical individuals spanning 0.4-104 years of age and identified >92,000 somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels). Although both cell types accumulate somatic mutations linearly with age, oligodendrocytes accumulated sSNVs 81% faster than neurons and indels 28% slower than neurons. Correlation of mutations with single-nucleus RNA profiles and chromatin accessibility from the same brains revealed that oligodendrocyte mutations are enriched in inactive genomic regions and are distributed across the genome similarly to mutations in brain cancers. In contrast, neuronal mutations are enriched in open, transcriptionally active chromatin. These stark differences suggest an assortment of active mutagenic processes in oligodendrocytes and neurons.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

38725300,Identification of potential mediators of the relationship between body mass index and colorectal cancer: a Mendelian randomization analysis.,Int J Epidemiol,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third-most-common cancer worldwide and its rates are increasing. Elevated body mass index (BMI) is an established risk factor for CRC, although the molecular mechanisms behind this association remain unclear. Using the Mendelian randomization (MR) framework, we aimed to investigate the mediating effects of putative biomarkers and other CRC risk factors in the association between BMI and CRC.We selected as mediators biomarkers of established cancer-related mechanisms and other CRC risk factors for which a plausible association with obesity exists, such as inflammatory biomarkers, glucose homeostasis traits, lipids, adipokines, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), sex hormones, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, smoking, physical activity (PA) and alcohol consumption. We used inverse-variance weighted MR in the main univariable analyses and performed sensitivity analyses (weighted-median, MR-Egger, Contamination Mixture). We used multivariable MR for the mediation analyses.Genetically predicted BMI was positively associated with CRC risk [odds ratio per SD (5 kg/m2) = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.08-1.24, P-value = 1.4 × 10-5] and robustly associated with nearly all potential mediators. Genetically predicted IGF1, fasting insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, PA and alcohol were associated with CRC risk. Evidence for attenuation was found for IGF1 [explained 7% (95% CI: 2-13%) of the association], smoking (31%, 4-57%) and PA (7%, 2-11%). There was little evidence for pleiotropy, although smoking was bidirectionally associated with BMI and instruments were weak for PA.The effect of BMI on CRC risk is possibly partly mediated through plasma IGF1, whereas the attenuation of the BMI-CRC association by smoking and PA may reflect confounding and shared underlying mechanisms rather than mediation.© The Author(s) 2024.

38609709,Effect of weight satisfaction on adolescent facial and dental satisfaction.,Eur Arch Paediatr Dent,"To investigate if facial and dental satisfaction is related to body fat percentage and body weight satisfaction.A self-administered questionnaire was applied to adolescents from a Private School in Southern Brazil containing sociodemographic (sex and age) and self-perception variables. Adolescents were asked about their perceptions concerning dental problems. Body fat percentage was collected using bioelectrical impedance analysis.A total of 372 adolescents were examined. Most adolescents were satisfied with their dental (81.7%) and facial appearance (87.6%), while 39% of adolescents were satisfied with their body weight. Poisson regression model showed that adolescents who expressed satisfaction with their body weight (PR = 1.12, 95%CI 1.06-1.19) and were satisfied with their dental appearance (PR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.08-1.41) exhibited a positive association with facial satisfaction. Adolescents dissatisfied with dental color (PR = 0.88, 95%CI 0.80-0.97), those reporting dental pain (PR = 0.88, 95%CI 0.80-0.97), and individuals with obesity (PR = 0.91, 95%CI 0.83-0.99) demonstrated a decrease in facial satisfaction. Adolescents aged 16 to 19 years (PR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15) and those satisfied with their facial appearance (PR = 1.20, 95%CI 1.01-1.43) exhibited a higher prevalence of dental satisfaction. Conversely, adolescents dissatisfied with dental color (PR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.66-0.82) and those with misaligned teeth (PR = 0.63, 95%CI 0.55-0.73) reported lower levels of dental satisfaction. Parametric g-formula analysis found that the association between body fat and facial satisfaction was mediated by body weight satisfaction (p = 0.001).While dental satisfaction was not influenced by corporeal characteristics, facial satisfaction was influenced by dental and body weight satisfaction.

We compared the observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses of iron status biomarkers and hemoglobin with these diseases.Observational analyses of hemoglobin were compared with genetically predicted hemoglobin with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in the UK Biobank. Iron biomarkers included transferrin saturation, serum iron, ferritin, and total iron binding capacity.

Bidirectional MR analyses confirmed the causal relevance of iron biomarkers for hemoglobin. Further MR analyses in global consortia demonstrated modest protective effects of iron biomarkers for CAD (7%-14% lower risk for 1 SD higher levels of iron biomarkers), adverse effects for T2D, but no associations with IS or HF.Higher levels of iron biomarkers were protective for CAD, had adverse effects on T2D, but had no effects on IS or HF.

38718120,Genomic context- and H2AK119 ubiquitination-dependent inheritance of human Polycomb silencing.,Sci Adv,"Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and 2) are required for heritable repression of developmental genes. The cis- and trans-acting factors that contribute to epigenetic inheritance of mammalian Polycomb repression are not fully understood. Here, we show that, in human cells, ectopically induced Polycomb silencing at initially active developmental genes, but not near ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes, is inherited for many cell divisions. Unexpectedly, silencing is heritable in cells with mutations in the H3K27me3 binding pocket of the Embryonic Ectoderm Development (EED) subunit of PRC2, which are known to disrupt H3K27me3 recognition and lead to loss of H3K27me3. This mode of inheritance is less stable and requires intact PRC2 and recognition of H2AK119ub1 by PRC1. Our findings suggest that maintenance of Polycomb silencing is sensitive to local genomic context and can be mediated by PRC1-dependent H2AK119ub1 and PRC2 independently of H3K27me3 recognition.",5.288019347512402e-36

Yet the pathophysiology of APOs is poorly understood, limiting our ability to prevent and treat these conditions. To search for genetic markers of maternal risk for four APOs, we performed multi-ancestry genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for pregnancy loss, gestational length, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia. We clustered participants by their genetic ancestry and focused our analyses on three sub-cohorts with the largest sample sizes: European, African, and Admixed American. Association tests were carried out separately for each sub-cohort and then meta-analyzed together. Two novel loci were significantly associated with an increased risk of pregnancy loss: a cluster of SNPs located downstream of the TRMU gene (top SNP: rs142795512), and the SNP rs62021480 near RGMA. In the GWAS of gestational length we identified two new variants, rs2550487 and rs58548906 near WFDC1 and AC005052.1, respectively.

Fourteen loci previously correlated with preterm birth, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia were found to be associated with these outcomes as well.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.001464015220682827
38704398,Genetic association of inflammatory marker GlycA with lung function and respiratory diseases.,Nat Commun,"Association of circulating glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA), a systemic inflammation biomarker, with lung function and respiratory diseases remain to be investigated. We examined the genetic correlation, shared genetics, and potential causality of GlycA (N = 115,078) with lung function and respiratory diseases (N = 497,000). GlycA showed significant genetic correlation with FEV1 (rg = -0.14), FVC (rg = -0.18), asthma (rg = 0.21) and COPD (rg = 0.31). We consistently identified ten shared loci (including chr3p21.31 and chr8p23.1) at both SNP and gene level revealing potential shared biological mechanisms involving ubiquitination, immune response, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, cell growth and differentiation in tissues or cells including blood, epithelium, fibroblast, fetal thymus, and fetal intestine. Genetically elevated GlycA was significantly correlated with lung function and asthma susceptibility (354.13 ml decrement of FEV1, 442.28 ml decrement of FVC, and 144% increased risk of asthma per SD increment of GlycA) from MR analyses. Our findings provide insights into biological mechanisms of GlycA in relating to lung function, asthma, and COPD.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.5816034479787957e-12
38697998,Using genome and transcriptome data from African-ancestry female participants to identify putative breast cancer susceptibility genes.,Nat Commun,"African-ancestry (AA) participants are underrepresented in genetics research. Here, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) in AA female participants to identify putative breast cancer susceptibility genes. We built genetic models to predict levels of gene expression, exon junction, and 3' UTR alternative polyadenylation using genomic and transcriptomic data generated in normal breast tissues from 150 AA participants and then used these models to perform association analyses using genomic data from 18,034 cases and 22,104 controls. At Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05, we identified six genes associated with breast cancer risk, including four genes not previously reported (CTD-3080P12.3, EN1, LINC01956 and NUP210L). Most of these genes showed a stronger association with risk of estrogen-receptor (ER) negative or triple-negative than ER-positive breast cancer. We also replicated the associations with 29 genes reported in previous TWAS at P < 0.05 (one-sided), providing further support for an association of these genes with breast cancer risk. Our study sheds new light on the genetic basis of breast cancer and highlights the value of conducting research in AA populations.© 2024. The Author(s).",5.191425833779065e-10
38685026,Large-scale genome-wide association studies reveal the genetic causal etiology between air pollutants and autoimmune diseases.,J Transl Med,"Epidemiological evidence links a close correlation between long-term exposure to air pollutants and autoimmune diseases, while the causality remained unknown.Two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) was used to investigate the role of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and NOX(N = 423,796-456,380) in 15 autoimmune diseases (N = 14,890-314,995) using data from large European GWASs including UKB, FINNGEN, IMSGC, and IPSCSG. Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was conducted to investigate the direct effect of each air pollutant and the mediating role of common factors, including body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, smoking status, and household income. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), two-step MR, and colocalization analyses were performed to explore underlying mechanisms between air pollution and autoimmune diseases.In TSMR, after correction of multiple testing, hypothyroidism was causally associated with higher exposure to NO2[odds ratio (OR): 1.37, p = 9.08 × 10-4] and NOX[OR: 1.34, p = 2.86 × 10-3], ulcerative colitis (UC) was causally associated with higher exposure to NOX[OR: 2.24, p = 1.23 × 10-2] and PM2.5 [OR: 2.60, p = 5.96 × 10-3], rheumatoid arthritis was causally associated with higher exposure to NOX[OR: 1.72, p = 1.50 × 10-2], systemic lupus erythematosus was causally associated with higher exposure to NOX[OR: 4.92, p = 6.89 × 10-3], celiac disease was causally associated with lower exposure to NOX[OR: 0.14, p = 6.74 × 10-4] and PM2.5 [OR: 0.17, p = 3.18 × 10-3]. The risky effects of PM2.5 on UC remained significant in MVMR analyses after adjusting for other air pollutants. MVMR revealed several common mediators between air pollutants and autoimmune diseases. Transcriptional analysis identified specific gene transcripts and pathways interconnecting air pollutants and autoimmune diseases. Two-step MR revealed that POR, HSPA1B, and BRD2 might mediate from air pollutants to autoimmune diseases. POR pQTL (rs59882870, PPH4=1.00) strongly colocalized with autoimmune diseases.This research underscores the necessity of rigorous air pollutant surveillance within public health studies to curb the prevalence of autoimmune diseases.© 2024.

We investigated whether individuals diagnosed as children differ from those diagnosed in adulthood with respect to shared and unique architecture at the genome-wide and gene expression level of analysis.We used genomic structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate differences in genetic correlations (rg) of childhood-diagnosed (ncases = 14,878) and adulthood-diagnosed (ncases = 6961) ADHD with 98 behavioral, psychiatric, cognitive, and health outcomes. We went on to apply transcriptome-wide SEM to identify functional annotations and patterns of gene expression associated with genetic risk sharing or divergence across the ADHD subgroups.Compared with the childhood subgroup, adulthood-diagnosed ADHD exhibited a significantly larger negativergwith educational attainment, the noncognitive skills of educational attainment, and age at first sexual intercourse. We observed a larger positivergfor adulthood-diagnosed ADHD with major depression, suicidal ideation, and a latent internalizing factor. At the gene expression level, transcriptome-wide SEM analyses revealed 22 genes that were significantly associated with shared genetic risk across the subtypes that reflected a mixture of coding and noncoding genes and included 15 novel genes relative to the ADHD subgroups.This study demonstrated that ADHD diagnosed later in life shows much stronger genetic overlap with internalizing disorders and related traits. This may indicate the potential clinical relevance of distinguishing these subgroups or increased misdiagnosis for those diagnosed later in life.

While the regulatory networks formed by transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes has been mostly studied with relation to cis effects such as in TF binding sites, we focused on trans effects of TFs on the expression of their transcribed genes and their potential mechanisms.We provide a comprehensive tissue-specific atlas, spanning 49 tissues of TF variations affecting gene expression through computational models considering two potential mechanisms, including combinatorial regulation by the expression of the TFs, and by genetic variants within the TF. We demonstrate that similarity between tissues based on our discovered genes corresponds to other types of tissue similarity. The genes affected by complex TF regulation, and their modelled TFs, were highly enriched for pharmacogenomic functions, while the TFs themselves were also enriched in several cancer and metabolic pathways. Additionally, genes that appear in multiple clusters are enriched for regulation of immune system while tissue clusters include cluster-specific genes that are enriched for biological functions and diseases previously associated with the tissues forming the cluster. Finally, our atlas exposes multilevel regulation across multiple tissues, where TFs regulate other TFs through the two tested mechanisms.Our tissue-specific atlas provides hierarchical tissue-specific trans genetic regulations that can be further studied for association with human phenotypes.© 2024.

Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify genes causally associated with IBD.We extracted blood eQTL data from the GTExv8.ALL.Whole_Blood database, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics of IBD from the IEU GWAS database, and performed a three-fold analysis protocol, including transcriptome-wide association analysis, Mendelian randomisation analysis, Bayesian colocalisation, and subsequent potential therapeutic agents identification.We identified four pathogenic genes, namely CARD9, RTEL1, STMN3 and ARFRP1, that promote the development of IBD, encompassing both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Notably, ARFRP1 exhibited the ability to suppress IBD (encompassing UC and CD) development. Regarding drug prediction, cyclophosphamide emerged as a promising novel therapeutic option for IBD, encompassing UC and CD.We identified several potential genes related to IBD (UC and CD), including CARD9, RTEL1, STMN3 and ARFRP1, warranting further investigation in functional studies to elucidate underlying disease mechanisms.

38608280,Proteome-wide association study and functional validation identify novel protein markers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,Gigascience,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a lethal malignancy, largely due to the paucity of reliable biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic targeting. Existing blood protein biomarkers for PDAC often suffer from replicability issues, arising from inherent limitations such as unmeasured confounding factors in conventional epidemiologic study designs. To circumvent these limitations, we use genetic instruments to identify proteins with genetically predicted levels to be associated with PDAC risk. Leveraging genome and plasma proteome data from the INTERVAL study, we established and validated models to predict protein levels using genetic variants. By examining 8,275 PDAC cases and 6,723 controls, we identified 40 associated proteins, of which 16 are novel. Functionally validating these candidates by focusing on 2 selected novel protein-encoding genes, GOLM1 and B4GALT1, we demonstrated their pivotal roles in driving PDAC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, we also identified potential drug repurposing opportunities for treating PDAC.PDAC is a notoriously difficult-to-treat malignancy, and our limited understanding of causal protein markers hampers progress in developing effective early detection strategies and treatments. Our study identifies novel causal proteins using genetic instruments and subsequently functionally validates selected novel proteins. This dual approach enhances our understanding of PDAC etiology and potentially opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions.© The Author(s) 2024.

38585769,Proteome-wide association studies using summary proteomic data identified 23 risk genes of Alzheimer's disease.,medRxiv,"Characterizing the genetic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is crucial for developing new therapeutics. Proteome-wide association study (PWAS) integrating proteomics data with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data was shown as a powerful tool for detecting risk genes. The identified PWAS risk genes can be interpretated as having genetic effects mediated through the genetically regulated protein abundances. Existing PWAS analyses of AD often rely on the availability of individual-level proteomics and genetics data of a reference cohort. Leveraging summary-level protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) reference data of multiple relevant tissues is expected to improve PWAS findings for studying AD. Here, we applied our recently developed OTTERS tool to conduct PWAS of AD dementia, by leveraging summary-level pQTL data of brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma tissues, and multiple statistical methods. For each target protein, imputation models of the protein abundance with genetic predictors were trained from summary-level pQTL data, estimating a set of pQTL weights for considered genetic predictors. PWAS p-values were obtained by integrating GWAS summary data of AD dementia with estimated pQTL weights. PWAS p-values from multiple statistical methods were combined by the aggregated Cauchy association test to yield one omnibus PWAS p-value for the target protein. We identified significant PWAS risk genes through omnibus PWAS p-values and analyzed their protein-protein interactions using STRING. Their potential causal effects were assessed by the probabilistic Mendelian randomization (PMR-Egger). As a result, we identified a total of 23 significant PWAS risk genes for AD dementia in brain, CSF, and plasma tissues, including 7 novel findings. We showed that 15 of these risk genes were interconnected within a protein-protein interaction network involving the well-known AD risk gene ofAPOEand 5 novel findings, and enriched in immune functions and lipids pathways including positive regulation of immune system process, positive regulation of macrophage proliferation, humoral immune response, and high-density lipoprotein particle clearance. Existing biological evidence was found to relate our novel findings with AD. We validated the mediated causal effects of 14 risk genes (60.8%). In conclusion, we identified both known and novel PWAS risk genes, providing novel insights into the genetic mechanisms in brain, CSF, and plasma tissues, and targeted therapeutics development of AD dementia. Our study also demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating public available summary-level pQTL data with GWAS summary data for mapping risk genes of complex human diseases.",3.394554167768877e-41
38578439,Phenotypic and genetic effect of carotid intima-media thickness on the risk of stroke.,Hum Genet,"While carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) as a noninvasive surrogate measure of atherosclerosis is widely considered a risk factor for stroke, the intrinsic link underlying cIMT and stroke has not been fully understood. We aimed to evaluate the clinical value of cIMT in stroke through the investigation of phenotypic and genetic relationships between cIMT and stroke. We evaluated phenotypic associations using observational data from UK Biobank (N = 21,526). We then investigated genetic relationships leveraging genomic data conducted in predominantly European ancestry for cIMT (N = 45,185) and any stroke (AS, Ncase/Ncontrol=40,585/406,111). Observational analyses suggested an increased hazard of stroke per one standard deviation increase in cIMT (cIMTmax-AS: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.39, 95%CI = 1.09-1.79; cIMTmean-AS: HR = 1.39, 95%CI = 1.09-1.78; cIMTmin-AS: HR = 1.32, 95%CI = 1.04-1.68). A positive global genetic correlation was observed (cIMTmax-AS: [Formula: see text]=0.23, P=9.44 × 10-5; cIMTmean-AS: [Formula: see text]=0.21, P=3.00 × 10-4; cIMTmin-AS: [Formula: see text]=0.16, P=6.30 × 10-3). This was further substantiated by five shared independent loci and 15 shared expression-trait associations. Mendelian randomization analyses suggested no causal effect of cIMT on stroke (cIMTmax-AS: odds ratio (OR)=1.12, 95%CI=0.97-1.28; cIMTmean-AS: OR=1.09, 95%CI=0.93-1.26; cIMTmin-AS: OR=1.03, 95%CI = 0.90-1.17). A putative association was observed for genetically predicted stroke on cIMT (AS-cIMTmax: beta=0.07, 95%CI = 0.01-0.13; AS-cIMTmean: beta=0.08, 95%CI = 0.01-0.15; AS-cIMTmin: beta = 0.08, 95%CI = 0.01-0.16) in the reverse direction MR, which attenuated to non-significant in sensitivity analysis. Our work does not find evidence supporting causal associations between cIMT and stroke. The pronounced cIMT-stroke association is intrinsic, and mostly attributed to shared genetic components. The clinical value of cIMT as a surrogate marker for stroke risk in the general population is likely limited.© 2024.

38576865,Joint-tissue integrative analysis identifies high-risk genes for Parkinson's disease.,Front Neurosci,"The loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the abnormal accumulation of synuclein proteins and neurotransmitters in Lewy bodies constitute the primary symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Besides environmental factors, scholars are in the early stages of comprehending the genetic factors involved in the pathogenic mechanism of PD. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have unveiled numerous genetic variants associated with PD, precisely pinpointing the causal variants remains challenging due to strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) among them. Addressing this issue, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) cohorts were employed in a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to infer the genetic correlation between gene expression and a particular trait. Utilizing the TWAS theory alongside the enhanced Joint-Tissue Imputation (JTI) technique and Mendelian Randomization (MR) framework (MR-JTI), we identified a total of 159 PD-associated genes by amalgamating LD score, GTEx eQTL data, and GWAS summary statistic data from a substantial cohort. Subsequently, Fisher's exact test was conducted on these PD-associated genes using 5,152 differentially expressed genes sourced from 12 PD-related datasets. Ultimately, 29 highly credible PD-associated genes, including CTX1B, SCNA, and ARSA, were uncovered. Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these genes primarily function in tissue synthesis, regulation of neuron projection development, vesicle organization and transportation, and lysosomal impact. The potential PD-associated genes identified in this study not only offer fresh insights into the disease's pathophysiology but also suggest potential biomarkers for early disease detection.Copyright © 2024 Wu, Zheng, Liu, Sun, Xu, Shao, Cai and Tang.",1.4642565137570322e-37

Despite their widespread prevalence, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of these common chronic hepatic conditions are not fully understood. Here, we conducted the most extensive meta-analysis of hepatic gene expression datasets from liver biopsy samples to date, integrating 10 RNA-sequencing and microarray datasets (1,058 samples). Using a random-effects meta-analysis model, we compared over 12,000 shared genes across datasets.

Systemic immunomodulatory management continues to be an attractive approach in periodontal care, particularly within the context of 'predictive, preventive, and personalized' periodontics. The present study incorporated genetic proxies identified through genome-wide association studies for circulating immune cells and periodontitis into a comprehensive Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. Univariable MR, multivariable MR, subgroup analysis, reverse MR, and Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) were utilized to investigate the causal relationships. Furthermore, transcriptome-wide association study and colocalization analysis were deployed to pinpoint the underlying genes. Consequently, the MR study indicated a causal association between circulating neutrophils, natural killer T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and an elevated risk of periodontitis. MR-BMA analysis revealed that neutrophils were the primary contributors to periodontitis. The high-confidence genesS100A9andS100A12, located on 1q21.3, could potentially serve as immunomodulatory targets for neutrophil-mediated periodontitis. These findings hold promise for early diagnosis, risk assessment, targeted prevention, and personalized treatment of periodontitis.

Additionally, these studies were based on gene expression prediction models trained primarily in breast tissue, and they did not account for alternative splicing of genes.In this study, we utilized two approaches to perform multi-tissue TWASs of breast cancer by ER subtype: (1) an expression-based TWAS that combined TWAS signals for each gene across multiple tissues and (2) a splicing-based TWAS that combined TWAS signals of all excised introns for each gene across tissues. To perform this TWAS, we utilized summary statistics for ER + BC from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) and for ER- BC from a meta-analysis of BCAC and the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 (CIMBA).In total, we identified 230 genes in 86 loci that were associated with ER + BC and 66 genes in 29 loci that were associated with ER- BC at a Bonferroni threshold of significance. Of these genes, 2 genes associated with ER + BC at the 1q21.1 locus were located at least 1 Mb from published GWAS hits. For several well-studied tumor suppressor genes such as TP53 and CHEK2 which have historically been thought to impact BC risk through rare, penetrant mutations, we discovered that common variants, which modulate gene expression, may additionally contribute to ER + or ER- etiology.Our study comprehensively examined how differences in common variation contribute to molecular differences between ER + and ER- BC and introduces a novel, splicing-based framework that can be used in future TWAS studies.© 2024.

The approach uses regularized Poisson regression on tile-level accessibility data to jointly model all regulatory effects at a gene locus, avoiding the limitations of pairwise gene-peak correlations and dependence on peak calling. SCARlink outperformed existing gene scoring methods for imputing gene expression from chromatin accessibility across high-coverage multi-ome datasets while giving comparable to improved performance on low-coverage datasets. Shapley value analysis on trained models identified cell-type-specific gene enhancers that are validated by promoter capture Hi-C and are 11× to 15× and 5× to 12× enriched in fine-mapped eQTLs and fine-mapped genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants, respectively.

Using kidney-specific epigenomic annotations and 3D genome information we generated and validated gene expression prediction models for the purpose of transcriptome-wide association studies in 700 human kidneys. We identified 889 kidney genes associated with BP of which 399 were prioritised as contributors to BP regulation. Imputation of kidney proteome and microRNAome uncovered 97 renal proteins and 11 miRNAs associated with BP. Integration with plasma proteomics and metabolomics illuminated circulating levels of myo-inositol, 4-guanidinobutanoate and angiotensinogen as downstream effectors of several kidney BP genes (SLC5A11, AGMAT, AGT, respectively). We showed that genetically determined reduction in renal expression may mimic the effects of rare loss-of-function variants on kidney mRNA/protein and lead to an increase in BP (e.g., ENPEP). We demonstrated a strong correlation (r = 0.81) in expression of protein-coding genes between cells harvested from urine and the kidney highlighting a diagnostic potential of urinary cell transcriptomics. We uncovered adenylyl cyclase activators as a repurposing opportunity for hypertension and illustrated examples of BP-elevating effects of anticancer drugs (e.g. tubulin polymerisation inhibitors).

38491773,Subset-based method for cross-tissue transcriptome-wide association studies improves power and interpretability.,HGG Adv,"Integrating results from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and studies of molecular phenotypes such as gene expressions can improve our understanding of the biological functions of trait-associated variants and can help prioritize candidate genes for downstream analysis. Using reference expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, several methods have been proposed to identify gene-trait associations, primarily based on gene expression imputation. To increase the statistical power by leveraging substantial eQTL sharing across tissues, meta-analysis methods aggregating such gene-based test results across multiple tissues or contexts have been developed as well. However, most existing meta-analysis methods have limited power to identify associations when the gene has weaker associations in only a few tissues and cannot identify the subset of tissues in which the gene is ""activated."" For this, we developed a cross-tissue subset-based transcriptome-wide association study (CSTWAS) meta-analysis method that improves power under such scenarios and can extract the set of potentially associated tissues. To improve applicability, CSTWAS uses only GWAS summary statistics and pre-computed correlation matrices to identify a subset of tissues that have the maximal evidence of gene-trait association. Through numerical simulations, we found that CSTWAS can maintain a well-calibrated type-I error rate, improves power especially when there is a small number of associated tissues for a gene-trait association, and identifies an accurate associated tissue set. By analyzing GWAS summary statistics of three complex traits and diseases, we demonstrate that CSTWAS could identify biological meaningful signals while providing an interpretation of disease etiology by extracting a set of potentially associated tissues.Published by Elsevier Inc.",3.803623119273431e-23
38664368,Dysfunction of the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor latrophilin 1 (ADGRL1/LPHN1) increases the risk of obesity.,Signal Transduct Target Ther,"Obesity is one of the diseases with severe health consequences and rapidly increasing worldwide prevalence. Understanding the complex network of food intake and energy balance regulation is an essential prerequisite for pharmacological intervention with obesity. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are among the main modulators of metabolism and energy balance. They, for instance, regulate appetite and satiety in certain hypothalamic neurons, as well as glucose and lipid metabolism and hormone secretion from adipocytes. Mutations in some GPCRs, such as the melanocortin receptor type 4 (MC4R), have been associated with early-onset obesity. Here, we identified the adhesion GPCR latrophilin 1 (ADGRL1/LPHN1) as a member of the regulating network governing food intake and the maintenance of energy balance. Deficiency of the highly conserved receptor in mice results in increased food consumption and severe obesity, accompanied by dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. Consistently, we identified a partially inactivating mutation in human ADGRL1/LPHN1 in a patient suffering from obesity. Therefore, we propose that LPHN1 dysfunction is a risk factor for obesity development.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.4460604516293606e-31

These include a subpopulation of highly connected 'hub' cells, important for the propagation of intercellular Ca2+waves. Functional subpopulations have also been demonstrated in human beta cells, with an altered subtype distribution apparent in type 2 diabetes. At present, the molecular mechanisms through which beta cell hierarchy is established are poorly understood. Changes at the level of the epigenome provide one such possibility, which we explore here by focusing on the imprinted gene Nnat (encoding neuronatin [NNAT]), which is required for normal insulin synthesis and secretion.Single-cell RNA-seq datasets were examined using Seurat 4.0 and ClusterProfiler running under R. Transgenic mice expressing enhanced GFP under the control of the Nnat enhancer/promoter regions were generated for FACS of beta cells and downstream analysis of CpG methylation by bisulphite sequencing and RNA-seq, respectively. Animals deleted for the de novo methyltransferase DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) from the pancreatic progenitor stage were used to explore control of promoter methylation. Proteomics was performed using affinity purification mass spectrometry and Ca2+dynamics explored by rapid confocal imaging of Cal-520 AM and Cal-590 AM. Insulin secretion was measured using homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence imaging.Nnat mRNA was differentially expressed in a discrete beta cell population in a developmental stage- and DNA methylation (DNMT3A)-dependent manner. Thus, pseudo-time analysis of embryonic datasets demonstrated the early establishment of Nnat-positive and -negative subpopulations during embryogenesis. NNAT expression is also restricted to a subset of beta cells across the human islet that is maintained throughout adult life. NNAT+beta cells also displayed a discrete transcriptome at adult stages, representing a subpopulation specialised for insulin production, and were diminished in db/db mice. 'Hub' cells were less abundant in the NNAT+population, consistent with epigenetic control of this functional specialisation.These findings demonstrate that differential DNA methylation at Nnat represents a novel means through which beta cell heterogeneity is established during development. We therefore hypothesise that changes in methylation at this locus may contribute to a loss of beta cell hierarchy and connectivity, potentially contributing to defective insulin secretion in some forms of diabetes.The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD048465.© 2024.

38550950,Updates of precision medicine in type 2 diabetes.,Camb Prism Precis Med,"Diabetes mellitus is prevalent worldwide and affects 1 in 10 adults. Despite the successful development of glucose-lowering drugs, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors recently, the proportion of patients achieving satisfactory glucose control has not risen as expected. The heterogeneity of diabetes determines that a one-size-fits-all strategy is not suitable for people with diabetes. Diabetes is undoubtedly more heterogeneous than the conventional subclassification, such as type 1, type 2, monogenic and gestational diabetes. The recent progress in genetics and epigenetics of diabetes has gradually unveiled the mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of diabetes, and cluster analysis has shown promising results in the substratification of type 2 diabetes, which accounts for 95% of diabetic patients. More recently, the rapid development of sophisticated glucose monitoring and artificial intelligence technologies further enabled comprehensive consideration of the complex individual genetic and clinical information and might ultimately realize a precision diagnosis and treatment in diabetics.© The Author(s) 2023.",5.176874995324981e-25
38528048,Visit to visit transition in TXNIP gene methylation and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a nested case-control study.,J Hum Genet,"Our study aimed to investigate the association between the transition of the TXNIP gene methylation level and the risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study included 263 incident cases of T2DM and 263 matched non-T2DM participants. According to the methylation levels of five loci (CpG1-5; chr1:145441102-145442001) on the TXNIP gene, the participants were classified into four transition groups: maintained low, low to high, high to low, and maintained high methylation levels. Compared with individuals whose methylation level of CpG2-5 at the TXNIP gene was maintained low, individuals with maintained high methylation levels showed a 61-87% reduction in T2DM risk (66% for CpG2 [OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.80]; 77% for CpG3 [OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.78]; 87% for CpG4 [OR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.56]; and 61% for CpG5 [OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.92]). Maintained high methylation levels of four loci of the TXNIP gene are associated with a reduction of T2DM incident risk in the current study. Our study suggests that preserving hypermethylation levels of the TXNIP gene may hold promise as a potential preventive measure against the onset of T2DM.© 2024.

38741015,Genetic mapping across autoimmune diseases reveals shared associations and mechanisms.,Nat Genet,"Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are polygenic disorders of the immune system. Many genomic loci harbor risk alleles for several diseases, but the limited resolution of genetic mapping prevents determining whether the same allele is responsible, indicating a shared underlying mechanism. Here, using a collection of 129,058 cases and controls across 6 diseases, we show that ~40% of overlapping associations are due to the same allele. We improve fine-mapping resolution for shared alleles twofold by combining cases and controls across diseases, allowing us to identify more expression quantitative trait loci driven by the shared alleles. The patterns indicate widespread sharing of pathogenic mechanisms but not a single global autoimmune mechanism. Our approach can be applied to any set of traits and is particularly valuable as sample collections become depleted.© 2024.

38730006,Fundamentals for predicting transcriptional regulations from DNA sequence patterns.,J Hum Genet,"Cell-type-specific regulatory elements, cataloged through extensive experiments and bioinformatics in large-scale consortiums, have enabled enrichment analyses of genetic associations that primarily utilize positional information of the regulatory elements. These analyses have identified cell types and pathways genetically associated with human complex traits. However, our understanding of detailed allelic effects on these elements' activities and on-off states remains incomplete, hampering the interpretation of human genetic study results. This review introduces machine learning methods to learn sequence-dependent transcriptional regulation mechanisms from DNA sequences for predicting such allelic effects (not associations). We provide a concise history of machine-learning-based approaches, the requirements, and the key computational processes, focusing on primers in machine learning. Convolution and self-attention, pivotal in modern deep-learning models, are explained through geometrical interpretations using dot products. This facilitates understanding of the concept and why these have been used for machine learning for DNA sequences. These will inspire further research in this genetics and genomics field.© 2024.

38724970,Causal relationship between serum metabolites and juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a mendelian randomization study.,Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,"Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a condition that occurs when individuals under the age of 16 develop arthritis that lasts for more than six weeks, and the cause is unknown. The development of JIA may be linked to serum metabolites. Nevertheless, the association between JIA pathogenesis and serum metabolites is unclear, and there are discrepancies in the findings across studies.In this research, the association between JIA in humans and 486 serum metabolites was assessed using genetic variation data and genome-wide association study. The identification of causal relationships was accomplished through the application of univariate Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Various statistical methods, including inverse variance weighted and MR-Egger, were applied to achieve this objective. To ensure that the findings from the MR analysis were trustworthy, a number of assessments were carried out. To ensure the accuracy of the obtained results, a range of techniques were utilised including the Cochran Q test, examination of the MR-Egger intercept, implementation of the leave-one-out strategy, and regression analysis of linkage disequilibrium scores. In order to identify the specific metabolic pathways associated with JIA, our primary objective was to perform pathway enrichment analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.Two-sample summary data MR analyses and sensitivity analyses showed that five metabolites were significantly causally associated with JIA, including two risk factors-kynurenine (odds ratio [OR]: 16.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.07-129.63, p = 5.11 × 10- 6) and linolenate (OR: 16.48, 95% CI: 1.32-206.22, p = 0.030)-and three protective factors-3-dehydrocarnitine (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.14-0.72, p = 0.007), levulinate (4-oxovalerate) (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.20-0.80, p = 0.010), and X-14,208 (phenylalanylserine) (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.51-0.92, p = 0.010). Furthermore, seven metabolic pathways, including α-linolenic acid metabolism and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, are potentially associated with the onset and progression of JIA.Five serum metabolites, including kynurenine and 3-dehydrocarnitine, may be causally associated with JIA. These results provide a theoretical framework for developing effective JIA prevention and screening strategies.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.6236324253323035e-33
38709794,Annotation of nuclear lncRNAs based on chromatin interactions.,PLoS One,"The human genome is pervasively transcribed and produces a wide variety of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), constituting the majority of transcripts across human cell types. Some specific nuclear lncRNAs have been shown to be important regulatory components acting locally. As RNA-chromatin interaction and Hi-C chromatin conformation data showed that chromatin interactions of nuclear lncRNAs are determined by the local chromatin 3D conformation, we used Hi-C data to identify potential target genes of lncRNAs. RNA-protein interaction data suggested that nuclear lncRNAs act as scaffolds to recruit regulatory proteins to target promoters and enhancers. Nuclear lncRNAs may therefore play a role in directing regulatory factors to locations spatially close to the lncRNA gene.

38689000,Leveraging functional genomic annotations and genome coverage to improve polygenic prediction of complex traits within and between ancestries.,Nat Genet,"We develop a method, SBayesRC, that integrates genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics with functional genomic annotations to improve polygenic prediction of complex traits. Our method is scalable to whole-genome variant analysis and refines signals from functional annotations by allowing them to affect both causal variant probability and causal effect distribution. We analyze 50 complex traits and diseases using ∼7 million common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 96 annotations. SBayesRC improves prediction accuracy by 14% in European ancestry and up to 34% in cross-ancestry prediction compared to the baseline method SBayesR, which does not use annotations, and outperforms other methods, including LDpred2, LDpred-funct, MegaPRS, PolyPred-S and PRS-CSx. Investigation of factors affecting prediction accuracy identifies a significant interaction between SNP density and annotation information, suggesting whole-genome sequence variants with annotations may further improve prediction. Functional partitioning analysis highlights a major contribution of evolutionary constrained regions to prediction accuracy and the largest per-SNP contribution from nonsynonymous SNPs.© 2024.

38664414,Insights into the genetic architecture of cerebellar lobules derived from the UK Biobank.,Sci Rep,"In this work we endeavor to further understand the genetic architecture of the cerebellum by examining the genetic underpinnings of the different cerebellar lob(ul)es, identifying their genetic relation to cortical and subcortical regions, as well as to psychiatric disorders, as well as traces of their evolutionary trajectories. We confirm the moderate heritability of cerebellar volumes, and reveal genetic clustering and variability across their different substructures, which warranted a detailed analysis using this higher structural resolution. We replicated known genetic correlations with several subcortical volumes, and report new cortico-cerebellar genetic correlations, including negative genetic correlations between anterior cerebellar lobules and cingulate, and positive ones between lateral Crus I and lobule VI with cortical measures in the fusiform region. Heritability partitioning for evolutionary annotations highlighted that the vermis of Crus II has depleted heritability in genomic regions of ""archaic introgression deserts"", but no enrichment/depletion of heritability in any other cerebellar regions. Taken together, these findings reveal novel insights into the genetic underpinnings of the different cerebellar lobules.© 2024. The Author(s).",9.412624277589381e-25
38653906,Disentangling the relationships of body mass index and circulating sex hormone concentrations in mammographic density using Mendelian randomization.,Breast Cancer Res Treat,"Mammographic density phenotypes, adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI), are strong predictors of breast cancer risk. BMI is associated with mammographic density measures, but the role of circulating sex hormone concentrations is less clear. We investigated the relationship between BMI, circulating sex hormone concentrations, and mammographic density phenotypes using Mendelian randomization (MR).We applied two-sample MR approaches to assess the association between genetically predicted circulating concentrations of sex hormones [estradiol, testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)], BMI, and mammographic density phenotypes (dense and non-dense area). We created instrumental variables from large European ancestry-based genome-wide association studies and applied estimates to mammographic density phenotypes in up to 14,000 women of European ancestry. We performed analyses overall and by menopausal status.Genetically predicted BMI was positively associated with non-dense area (IVW: β = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.58, 2.00; p = 9.57 × 10-63) and inversely associated with dense area (IVW: β = - 0.37; 95% CI = - 0.51,- 0.23; p = 4.7 × 10-7). We observed weak evidence for an association of circulating sex hormone concentrations with mammographic density phenotypes, specifically inverse associations between genetically predicted testosterone concentration and dense area (β = - 0.22; 95% CI = - 0.38, - 0.053; p = 0.009) and between genetically predicted estradiol concentration and non-dense area (β =  - 3.32; 95% CI = - 5.83, - 0.82; p = 0.009), although results were not consistent across a range of MR approaches.Our findings support a positive causal association between BMI and mammographic non-dense area and an inverse association between BMI and dense area. Evidence was weaker and inconsistent for a causal effect of circulating sex hormone concentrations on mammographic density phenotypes. Based on our findings, associations between circulating sex hormone concentrations and mammographic density phenotypes are weak at best.© 2024.

38638564,Asian-European differentiation of schizophrenia-associated genes driven by admixture and natural selection.,iScience,"The European-centered genome-wide association studies of schizophrenia (SCZ) may not be well applied to non-European populations. We analyzed 1,592 reported SCZ-associated genes using the public genome data and found an overall higher Asian-European differentiation on the SCZ-associated variants than at the genome-wide level. Notable examples included 15 missense variants, a regulatory variantSLC5A10-rs1624825, and a damaging variantTSPAN18-rs1001292. Independent local adaptations in recent 25,000 years, after the Asian-European divergence, could have contributed to such genetic differentiation, as were identified at a missense mutationLTN1-rs57646126-A in Asians, and a non-risk alleleZSWIM6-rs72761442-G in Europeans. Altai-Neanderthal-derived alleles may have opposite effects on SCZ susceptibility between ancestries. Furthermore, adaptive introgression was detected on the non-risk haplotype at 1q21.2 in Europeans, while in Asians it was observed on the SCZ risk haplotype at 3p21.31 which is also potentially ultra-violet protective. This study emphasizes the importance of including more representative Asian samples in future SCZ studies.© 2024 The Author(s).",7.518842457989062e-16
38637617,Genome-wide association analyses identify 95 risk loci and provide insights into the neurobiology of post-traumatic stress disorder.,Nat Genet,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) genetics are characterized by lower discoverability than most other psychiatric disorders. The contribution to biological understanding from previous genetic studies has thus been limited. We performed a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies across 1,222,882 individuals of European ancestry (137,136 cases) and 58,051 admixed individuals with African and Native American ancestry (13,624 cases). We identified 95 genome-wide significant loci (80 new). Convergent multi-omic approaches identified 43 potential causal genes, broadly classified as neurotransmitter and ion channel synaptic modulators (for example, GRIA1, GRM8 and CACNA1E), developmental, axon guidance and transcription factors (for example, FOXP2, EFNA5 and DCC), synaptic structure and function genes (for example, PCLO, NCAM1 and PDE4B) and endocrine or immune regulators (for example, ESR1, TRAF3 and TANK). Additional top genes influence stress, immune, fear and threat-related processes, previously hypothesized to underlie PTSD neurobiology. These findings strengthen our understanding of neurobiological systems relevant to PTSD pathophysiology, while also opening new areas for investigation.© 2024.

38637555,Massively parallel screen uncovers many rare 3' UTR variants regulating mRNA abundance of cancer driver genes.,Nat Commun,"Understanding the function of rare non-coding variants represents a significant challenge. Using MapUTR, a screening method, we studied the function of rare 3' UTR variants affecting mRNA abundance post-transcriptionally. Among 17,301 rare gnomAD variants, an average of 24.5% were functional, with 70% in cancer-related genes, many in critical cancer pathways. This observation motivated an interrogation of 11,929 somatic mutations, uncovering 3928 (33%) functional mutations in 155 cancer driver genes. Functional MapUTR variants were enriched in microRNA- or protein-binding sites and may underlie outlier gene expression in tumors. Further, we introduce untranslated tumor mutational burden (uTMB), a metric reflecting the amount of somatic functional MapUTR variants of a tumor and show its potential in predicting patient survival. Through prime editing, we characterized three variants in cancer-relevant genes (MFN2, FOSL2, and IRAK1), demonstrating their cancer-driving potential. Our study elucidates the function of tens of thousands of non-coding variants, nominates non-coding cancer driver mutations, and demonstrates their potential contributions to cancer.© 2024.

38626574,Investigating the shared genetic architecture between breast and ovarian cancers.,Genet Mol Biol,"High heritability and strong correlation have been observed in breast and ovarian cancers. However, their shared genetic architecture remained unclear. Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and heritability estimation from summary statistics (ρ-HESS) were applied to estimate heritability and genetic correlations. Bivariate causal mixture model (MiXeR) was used to qualify the polygenic overlap. Then, stratified-LDSC (S-LDSC) was used to identify tissue and cell type specificity. Meanwhile, the adaptive association test called MTaSPUsSet was performed to identify potential pleiotropic genes. The Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) heritability was 13% for breast cancer and 5% for ovarian cancer. There was a significant genetic correlation between breast and ovarian cancers (rg=0.21). Breast and ovarian cancers exhibited polygenic overlap, sharing 0.4 K out 2.8 K of causal variants. Tissue and cell type specificity displayed significant enrichment in female breast mammary, uterus, kidney tissues, and adipose cell. Moreover, the 74 potential pleiotropic genes were identified between breast and ovarian cancers, which were related to the regulation of cell cycle and cell death. We quantified the shared genetic architecture between breast and ovarian cancers and shed light on the biological basis of the co-morbidity. Ultimately, these findings facilitated the understanding of disease etiology.",2.4242280246385223e-38

While significant progress has been made in understanding epigenetic regulation mediated by eRNAs, research on the construction of eRNA-mediated gene regulatory networks (eGRN) and the identification of critical network components that influence complex traits is lacking.Here, employing the pig as a model, we conducted a comprehensive study using H3K27ac histone ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data to construct eRNA expression profiles from multiple tissues of two distinct pig breeds, namely Enshi Black (ES) and Duroc. In addition to revealing the regulatory landscape of eRNAs at the tissue level, we developed an innovative network construction and refinement method by integrating RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals and enhancer-modulating effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) measured by self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq) experiments. Using this approach, we unraveled eGRN that significantly influence the growth and development of muscle and fat tissues, and identified several novel genes that affect adipocyte differentiation in a cell line model.Our work not only provides novel insights into the genetic basis of economic pig traits, but also offers a generalizable approach to elucidate the eRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation underlying a wide spectrum of complex traits for diverse organisms.© 2024.

As single-cell genomics experiments scale up to hundreds of thousands of cells, the demand for computational resources for downstream analysis grows intractably large and exceeds the capabilities of most researchers. Here, we propose EpiCarousel, a tailored Python package based on lazy loading, parallel processing, and community detection for memory- and time-efficient identification of metacells, i.e. the emergence of homogenous cells, in large-scale scCAS data. Through comprehensive experiments on five datasets of various protocols, sample sizes, dimensions, number of cell types, and degrees of cell-type imbalance, EpiCarousel outperformed baseline methods in systematic evaluation of memory usage, computational time, and multiple downstream analyses including cell type identification. Moreover, EpiCarousel executes preprocessing and downstream cell clustering on the atlas-level dataset with 707 043 cells and 1 154 611 peaks within 2 h consuming <75 GB of RAM and provides superior performance for characterizing cell heterogeneity than state-of-the-art methods.The EpiCarousel software is well-documented and freely available at https://github.com/biox-nku/epicarousel.

The cis regulatory effects of these variants have been extensively characterized, but how they affect gene regulation in trans has been the subject of fewer studies because of the difficulty in detecting trans-expression quantitative loci (eQTLs). We developed trans-PCO for detecting trans effects of genetic variants on gene networks. Our simulations demonstrate that trans-PCO substantially outperforms existing trans-eQTL mapping methods. We applied trans-PCO to two gene expression datasets from whole blood, DGN (N = 913) and eQTLGen (N = 31,684), and identified 14,985 high-quality trans-eSNP-module pairs associated with 197 co-expression gene modules and biological processes.

Despite great successes of the last decade's genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the results have been translated to genomic medicine to a limited extent. One route to get closer to improved medical treatment could be by understanding the genetics of medication use. Current medication profiles from 335,744 individuals from the UK Biobank were obtained, and a GWAS was conducted to identify common genetic variants associated with current medication use. In total, 59 independent loci were identified for medication use, and approximately 18% of the total variation was attributable to common genetic variation. The largest fraction of genetic variance for current medication use was captured by variants with low-to-medium minor allele frequency, with coding, conserved genomic regions and transcription start sites being enriched for associated variants. The average correlation (R) between medication use and the polygenic score was 0.14. The results further demonstrated that individuals with higher polygenic burden for medication use were, on average, sicker and had a higher risk for adverse drug reactions. These results provide an insight into the genetic contribution of medication use and pave the way for developments of novel multiple trait polygenic scores, which include the genetically informed medication use.",2.336953063457203e-20
38527901,Uncovering genetic associations in the human diseasome using an endophenotype-augmented disease network.,Bioinformatics,"Many diseases, particularly cardiometabolic disorders, exhibit complex multimorbidities with one another. An intuitive way to model the connections between phenotypes is with a disease-disease network (DDN), where nodes represent diseases and edges represent associations, such as shared single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), between pairs of diseases. To gain further genetic understanding of molecular contributors to disease associations, we propose a novel version of the shared-SNP DDN (ssDDN), denoted as ssDDN+, which includes connections between diseases derived from genetic correlations with intermediate endophenotypes. We hypothesize that a ssDDN+ can provide complementary information to the disease connections in a ssDDN, yielding insight into the role of clinical laboratory measurements in disease interactions.Using PheWAS summary statistics from the UK Biobank, we constructed a ssDDN+ revealing hundreds of genetic correlations between diseases and quantitative traits. Our augmented network uncovers genetic associations across different disease categories, connects relevant cardiometabolic diseases, and highlights specific biomarkers that are associated with cross-phenotype associations. Out of the 31 clinical measurements under consideration, HDL-C connects the greatest number of diseases and is strongly associated with both type 2 diabetes and heart failure. Triglycerides, another blood lipid with known genetic causes in non-mendelian diseases, also adds a substantial number of edges to the ssDDN. This work demonstrates how association with clinical biomarkers can better explain the shared genetics between cardiometabolic disorders. Our study can facilitate future network-based investigations of cross-phenotype associations involving pleiotropy and genetic heterogeneity, potentially uncovering sources of missing heritability in multimorbidities.The generated ssDDN+ can be explored at https://hdpm.biomedinfolab.com/ddn/biomarkerDDN.© The Author(s) 2024.

We conducted a GWAS meta-analysis with a 2-3-fold increase in case sample size (OCD cases: N = 37,015, controls: N = 948,616) compared to the last OCD GWAS, including six previously published cohorts (OCGAS, IOCDF-GC, IOCDF-GC-trio, NORDiC-nor, NORDiC-swe, and iPSYCH) and unpublished self-report data from 23andMe Inc. We explored the genetic architecture of OCD by conducting gene-based tests, tissue and celltype enrichment analyses, and estimating heritability and genetic correlations with 74 phenotypes. To examine a potential heterogeneity in our data, we conducted multivariable GWASs with MTAG. We found support for 15 independent genome-wide significant loci (14 new) and 79 protein-coding genes. Tissue enrichment analyses implicate multiple cortical regions, the amygdala, and hypothalamus, while cell type analyses yielded 12 cell types linked to OCD (all neurons). The SNP-based heritability of OCD was estimated to be 0.08. Using MTAG we found evidence for specific genetic underpinnings characteristic of different cohort-ascertainment and identified additional significant SNPs. OCD was genetically correlated with 40 disorders or traits-positively with all psychiatric disorders and negatively with BMI, age at first birth and multiple autoimmune diseases. The GWAS meta-analysis identified several biologically informative genes as important contributors to the aetiology of OCD. Overall, we have begun laying the groundwork through which the biology of OCD will be understood and described.",1.1483804600511884e-15
38496579,Fibroblasts as an in vitro model of circadian genetic and genomic studies: A temporal analysis.,bioRxiv,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a heritable disorder characterized by shifts in mood that manifest in manic or depressive episodes. Clinical studies have identified abnormalities of the circadian system in BD patients as a hallmark of underlying pathophysiology. Fibroblasts are a well-establishedin vitromodel for measuring circadian patterns. We set out to examine the underlying genetic architecture of circadian rhythm in fibroblasts, with the goal to assess its contribution to the polygenic nature of BD disease risk. We collected, from primary cell lines of 6 healthy individuals, temporal genomic features over a 48 hour period from transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) and open chromatin data (ATAC-seq). The RNA-seq data showed that only a limited number of genes, primarily the known core clock genes such asARNTL,CRY1,PER3,NR1D2andTEFdisplay circadian patterns of expression consistently across cell cultures. The ATAC-seq data identified that distinct transcription factor families, like those with the basic helix-loop-helix motif, were associated with regions that were increasing in accessibility over time. Whereas known glucocorticoid receptor target motifs were identified in those regions that were decreasing in accessibility. Further evaluation of these regions using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression (sLDSC) analysis failed to identify a significant presence of them in the known genetic architecture of BD, and other psychiatric disorders or neurobehavioral traits in which the circadian rhythm is affected. In this study, we characterize the biological pathways that are activated in thisin vitrocircadian model, evaluating the relevance of these processes in the context of the genetic architecture of BD and other disorders, highlighting its limitations and future applications for circadian genomic studies.",7.429598119364953e-30
38559255,Dissection of core promoter syntax through single nucleotide resolution modeling of transcription initiation.,bioRxiv,"Our understanding of how the DNA sequences ofcis-regulatory elements encode transcription initiation patterns remains limited. Here we introduce CLIPNET, a deep learning model trained on population-scale PRO-cap data that accurately predicts the position and quantity of transcription initiation with single nucleotide resolution from DNA sequence. Interpretation of CLIPNET revealed a complex regulatory syntax consisting of DNA-protein interactions in five major positions between-200 and +50 bp relative to the transcription start site, as well as more subtle positional preferences among different transcriptional activators. Transcriptional activator and core promoter motifs occupy different positions and play distinct roles in regulating initiation, with the former driving initiation quantity and the latter initiation position. We identified core promoter motifs that explain initiation patterns in the majority of promoters and enhancers, including DPR motifs and AT-rich TBP binding sequences in TATA-less promoters. Our results provide insights into the sequence architecture governing transcription initiation.",3.400755139384504e-19
38557966,Obesity-related indicators and tuberculosis: A Mendelian randomization study.,PLoS One,"Obesity is a strong risk factor for many diseases, with controversy regarding the cause(s) of tuberculosis (TB) reflected by contradictory findings. Therefore, a larger sample population is required to determine the relationship between obesity and TB, which may further inform treatment.Obesity-related indicators and TB mutation data were obtained from a genome-wide association study database, while representative instrumental variables (IVs) were obtained by screening and merging. Causal relationships between exposure factors and outcomes were determined using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Three tests were used to determine the representativeness and stability of the IVs, supported by sensitivity analysis.Initially, 191 single nucleotide polymorphisms were designated as IVs by screening, followed by two-sample MR analysis, which revealed the causal relationship between waist circumference [odds ratio (OR): 2.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19-3.80); p = 0.011] and TB. Sensitivity analysis verified the credibility of the IVs, none of which were heterogeneous or horizontally pleiotropic.The present study determined the causal effect between waist circumference and TB by two-sample MR analysis and found both to be likely to be potential risk factors.Copyright: © 2024 Cai et al.

38745010,Dynamics of cognitive variability with age and its genetic underpinning in NIHR BioResource Genes and Cognition cohort participants.,Nat Med,"A leading explanation for translational failure in neurodegenerative disease is that new drugs are evaluated late in the disease course when clinical features have become irreversible. Here, to address this gap, we cognitively profiled 21,051 people aged 17-85 years as part of the Genes and Cognition cohort within the National Institute for Health and Care Research BioResource across England. We describe the cohort, present cognitive trajectories and show the potential utility. Surprisingly, when studied at scale, the APOE genotype had negligible impact on cognitive performance. Different cognitive domains had distinct genetic architectures, with one indicating brain region-specific activation of microglia and another with glycogen metabolism. Thus, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning cognition are distinct from dementia risk loci, presenting different targets to slow down age-related cognitive decline. Participants can now be recalled stratified by genotype and cognitive phenotype for natural history and interventional studies of neurodegenerative and other disorders.© 2024.

Genetic variants at 12 loci were associated with breast cancer risk (P < 5 × 10-8), including associations of a low-frequency missense variant rs61751053 in ARHGEF38 with overall breast cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 1.48) and a common variant rs76664032 at chromosome 2q14.2 with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (OR = 1.30). Approximately 15.4% of cases with TNBC carried six risk alleles in three genome-wide association study-identified TNBC risk variants, with an OR of 4.21 (95% confidence interval = 2.66-7.03) compared with those carrying fewer than two risk alleles. A polygenic risk score (PRS) showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.60 for the prediction of breast cancer risk, which outperformed PRS derived using data from females of European ancestry. Our study markedly increases the population diversity in genetic studies for breast cancer and demonstrates the utility of PRS for risk prediction in females of African ancestry.© 2024.

38737893,Shared genetic architecture highlights the bidirectional association between major depressive disorder and fracture risk.,Gen Psychiatr,"There is limited evidence suggesting that osteoporosis might exacerbate depressive symptoms, while more studies demonstrate that depression negatively affects bone density and increases fracture risk.To explore the relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD) and fracture risk.We conducted a nested case-control analysis (32 670 patients with fracture and 397 017 individuals without fracture) and a matched cohort analysis (16 496 patients with MDD and 435 492 individuals without MDD) in the same prospective UK Biobank data set. Further, we investigated the shared genetic architecture between MDD and fracture with linkage disequilibrium score regression and the MiXeR statistical tools. We used the conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate approach to identify the specific shared loci. We calculated the weighted genetic risk score for individuals in the UK Biobank and logistic regression was used to confirm the association observed in the prospective study.We found that MDD was associated with a 14% increase in fracture risk (hazard ratio (HR) 1.14, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.15, p<0.001) in the nested case-control analysis, while fracture was associated with a 72% increase in MDD risk (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.64 to 1.79, p<0.001) in the matched cohort analysis, suggesting a longitudinal and bidirectional relationship. Further, genetic summary data suggested a genetic overlap between MDD and fracture. Specifically, we identified four shared genomic loci, with the top signal (rs7554101) nearSGIP1. The protein encoded bySGIP1is involved in cannabinoid receptor type 1 signalling. We found that genetically predicted MDD was associated with a higher risk of fracture andvice versa. In addition, we found that the higher expression level ofSGIP1in the spinal cord and muscle was associated with an increased risk of fracture and MDD.The genetic pleiotropy between MDD and fracture highlights the bidirectional association observed in the epidemiological analysis. The shared genetic components (such asSGIP1) between the diseases suggest that modulating the endocannabinoid system could be a potential therapeutic strategy for both MDD and bone loss.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

38725839,Genome-wide association studies reveal differences in genetic susceptibility between single events vs. recurrent events of atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction: the HUNT study.,Front Cardiovasc Med,"Genetic research into atrial fibrillation (AF) and myocardial infarction (MI) has predominantly focused on comparing afflicted individuals with their healthy counterparts. However, this approach lacks granularity, thus overlooking subtleties within patient populations. In this study, we explore the distinction between AF and MI patients who experience only a single disease event and those experiencing recurrent events. Integrating hospital records, questionnaire data, clinical measurements, and genetic data from more than 500,000 HUNT and United Kingdom Biobank participants, we compare both clinical and genetic characteristics between the two groups using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) meta-analyses, phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) analyses, and gene co-expression networks. We found that the two groups of patients differ in both clinical characteristics and genetic risks. More specifically, recurrent AF patients are significantly younger and have better baseline health, in terms of reduced cholesterol and blood pressure, than single AF patients. Also, the results of the GWAS meta-analysis indicate that recurrent AF patients seem to be at greater genetic risk for recurrent events. The PheWAS and gene co-expression network analyses highlight differences in the functions associated with the sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes for the two groups. However, for MI patients, we found that those experiencing single events are significantly younger and have better baseline health than those with recurrent MI, yet they exhibit higher genetic risk. The GWAS meta-analysis mostly identifies genetic regions uniquely associated with single MI, and the PheWAS analysis and gene co-expression networks support the genetic differences between the single MI and recurrent MI groups. In conclusion, this work has identified novel genetic regions uniquely associated with single MI and related PheWAS analyses, as well as gene co-expression networks that support the genetic differences between the patient subgroups of single and recurrent occurrence for both MI and AF.© 2024 Hall, Skogholt, Surakka, Dalen and Almaas.",2.5683456415492073e-41
38719907,Effect of serum metabolites on the risk of iridocyclitis: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,Sci Rep,"Previous research has linked serum metabolite levels to iridocyclitis, yet their causal relationship remains unexplored. This study investigated this potential causality by analyzing pooled data from 7824 iridocyclitis patients in a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) using Mendelian randomization (MR) and linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC). Employing rigorous quality control and comprehensive statistical methods, including sensitivity analyses, we examined the influence of 486 serum metabolites on iridocyclitis. Our MR analysis identified 23 metabolites with significant causal effects on iridocyclitis, comprising 17 known and 6 unidentified metabolites. Further refinement using Cochran's Q test and MR-PRESSO indicated 16 metabolites significantly associated with iridocyclitis risk. LDSC highlighted the heritability of certain metabolites, underscoring genetic influences on their levels. Notably, tryptophan, proline, theobromine, and 7-methylxanthine emerged as risk factors, while 3,4-dihydroxybutyrate appeared protective. These findings enhance our understanding of the metabolic interactions in iridocyclitis, offering insights for diagnosis, unraveling pathophysiological mechanisms, and informing potential avenues for prevention and personalized treatment.© 2024.

38711061,Elucidating the association of obstructive sleep apnea with brain structure and cognitive performance.,BMC Psychiatry,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a pervasive, chronic sleep-related respiratory condition that causes brain structural alterations and cognitive impairments. However, the causal association of OSA with brain morphology and cognitive performance has not been determined.We conducted a two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationship between OSA and a range of neurocognitive characteristics, including brain cortical structure, brain subcortical structure, brain structural change across the lifespan, and cognitive performance. Summary-level GWAS data for OSA from the FinnGen consortium was used to identify genetically predicted OSA. Data regarding neurocognitive characteristics were obtained from published meta-analysis studies. Linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis was employed to reveal genetic correlations between OSA and related traits.Our MR study provided evidence that OSA was found to significantly increase the volume of the hippocampus (IVW β (95% CI) = 158.997 (76.768 to 241.227), P = 1.51e-04), with no heterogeneity and pleiotropy detected. Nominally causal effects of OSA on brain structures, such as the thickness of the temporal pole with or without global weighted, amygdala structure change, and cerebellum white matter change covering lifespan, were observed. Bidirectional causal links were also detected between brain cortical structure, brain subcortical, cognitive performance, and OSA risk. LDSC regression analysis showed no significant correlation between OSA and hippocampus volume.Overall, we observed a positive association between genetically predicted OSA and hippocampus volume. These findings may provide new insights into the bidirectional links between OSA and neurocognitive features, including brain morphology and cognitive performance.© 2024.

This study comprehensively assessed the causal association between genetically predicted modifiable risk factors and AILD by employing Mendelian randomization.Genetic variants associated with 29 exposure factors were obtained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Genetic association data with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were also obtained from publicly available GWAS. Univariate and multivariate Mendelian randomization analyses were performed to identify potential risk factors for AILD.Genetically predicted rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (OR = 1.620, 95%CI 1.423-1.843, P = 2.506 × 10- 13) was significantly associated with an increased risk of AIH.

38699308,Genome-wide analyses of variance in blood cell phenotypes provide new insights into complex trait biology and prediction.,medRxiv,"Blood cell phenotypes are routinely tested in healthcare to inform clinical decisions. Genetic variants influencing mean blood cell phenotypes have been used to understand disease aetiology and improve prediction; however, additional information may be captured by genetic effects on observed variance. Here, we mapped variance quantitative trait loci (vQTL), i.e. genetic loci associated with trait variance, for 29 blood cell phenotypes from the UK Biobank (N~408,111). We discovered 176 independent blood cell vQTLs, of which 147 were not found by additive QTL mapping. vQTLs displayed on average 1.8-fold stronger negative selection than additive QTL, highlighting that selection acts to reduce extreme blood cell phenotypes. Variance polygenic scores (vPGSs) were constructed to stratify individuals in the INTERVAL cohort (N~40,466), where genetically less variable individuals (low vPGS) had increased conventional PGS accuracy (by ~19%) than genetically more variable individuals. Genetic prediction of blood cell traits improved by ~10% on average combining PGS with vPGS. Using Mendelian randomisation and vPGS association analyses, we found that alcohol consumption significantly increased blood cell trait variances highlighting the utility of blood cell vQTLs and vPGSs to provide novel insight into phenotype aetiology as well as improve prediction.",1.7518991549625863e-10

Here we identify 113 novel loci, reporting a total of 2,103 independent genetic signals (P < 5 × 10-8) from the largest single-stage blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association study to date (n = 1,028,980 European individuals). These associations explain more than 60% of single nucleotide polymorphism-based BP heritability. Comparing top versus bottom deciles of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) reveals clinically meaningful differences in BP (16.9 mmHg systolic BP, 95% CI, 15.5-18.2 mmHg, P = 2.22 × 10-126) and more than a sevenfold higher odds of hypertension risk (odds ratio, 7.33; 95% CI, 5.54-9.70; P = 4.13 × 10-44) in an independent dataset.

In this genome-wide association study meta-analysis, comprising 16,480 ET cases and 1,936,173 controls from seven datasets, we identify 12 sequence variants at 11 loci. Evaluating mRNA expression, splicing, plasma protein levels, and coding effects, we highlight seven putative causal genes at these loci, including CA3 and CPLX1. CA3 encodes Carbonic Anhydrase III and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have been shown to decrease tremors. CPLX1, encoding Complexin-1, regulates neurotransmitter release.

We applied genomic structural equation modeling (gSEM) to genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics to evaluate the factor structure of externalizing and internalizing psychopathology across 16 traits and disorders among European-ancestry individuals (n's = 16,400 to 1,074,629). We conducted GWAS on factors derived from well-fitting models. Downstream analyses served to identify biological mechanisms, explore drug repurposing targets, estimate genetic overlap between the externalizing and internalizing spectra, and evaluate causal effects of psychopathology liability on physical health. Both a correlated factors model, comprising two factors of externalizing and internalizing risk, and a higher-order single-factor model of genetic effects contributing to both spectra demonstrated acceptable t. GWAS identified 409 lead single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with externalizing and 85 lead SNPs associated with internalizing, while the second-order GWAS identified 256 lead SNPs contributing to broad psychopathology risk. In bivariate causal mixture models, nearly all externalizing and internalizing causal variants overlapped, despite a genetic correlation of only 0.37 (SE = 0.02) between them. Externalizing genes showed cell-type specific expression in GABAergic, cortical, and hippocampal neurons, and internalizing genes were associated with reduced subcallosal cortical volume, providing insight into the neurobiological underpinnings of psychopathology. Genetic liability for externalizing, internalizing, and broad psychopathology exerted causal effects on pain, general health, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic illnesses. These findings underscore the complex genetic architecture of psychopathology, identify potential biological pathways for the externalizing and internalizing spectra, and highlight the physical health burden of psychiatric comorbidity.",8.195772220985864e-32
38649715,An approach to identify gene-environment interactions and reveal new biological insight in complex traits.,Nat Commun,"There is a long-standing debate about the magnitude of the contribution of gene-environment interactions to phenotypic variations of complex traits owing to the low statistical power and few reported interactions to date. To address this issue, the Gene-Lifestyle Interactions Working Group within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genetic Epidemiology Consortium has been spearheading efforts to investigate G × E in large and diverse samples through meta-analysis. Here, we present a powerful new approach to screen for interactions across the genome, an approach that shares substantial similarity to the Mendelian randomization framework. We identify and confirm 5 loci (6 independent signals) interacted with either cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption for serum lipids, and empirically demonstrate that interaction and mediation are the major contributors to genetic effect size heterogeneity across populations. The estimated lower bound of the interaction and environmentally mediated heritability is significant (P < 0.02) for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides in Cross-Population data.

38648211,Collider bias correction for multiple covariates in GWAS using robust multivariable Mendelian randomization.,PLoS Genet,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many genetic loci associated with complex traits and diseases in the past 20 years. Multiple heritable covariates may be added into GWAS regression models to estimate direct effects of genetic variants on a focal trait, or to improve the power by accounting for environmental effects and other sources of trait variations. When one or more covariates are causally affected by both genetic variants and hidden confounders, adjusting for them in GWAS will produce biased estimation of SNP effects, known as collider bias. Several approaches have been developed to correct collider bias through estimating the bias by Mendelian randomization (MR). However, these methods work for only one covariate, some of which utilize MR methods with relatively strong assumptions, both of which may not hold in practice. In this paper, we extend the bias-correction approaches in two aspects: first we derive an analytical expression for the collider bias in the presence of multiple covariates, then we propose estimating the bias using a robust multivariable MR (MVMR) method based on constrained maximum likelihood (called MVMR-cML), allowing the presence of invalid instrumental variables (IVs) and correlated pleiotropy. We also established the estimation consistency and asymptotic normality of the new bias-corrected estimator. We conducted simulations to show that all methods mitigated collider bias under various scenarios. In real data analyses, we applied the methods to two GWAS examples, the first a GWAS of waist-hip ratio with adjustment for only one covariate, body-mass index (BMI), and the second a GWAS of BMI adjusting metabolomic principle components as multiple covariates, illustrating the effectiveness of bias correction.Copyright: © 2024 Wang et al.

38640244,Tissue-specific genetic variation suggests distinct molecular pathways between body shape phenotypes and colorectal cancer.,Sci Adv,"It remains unknown whether adiposity subtypes are differentially associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). To move beyond single-trait anthropometric indicators, we derived four multi-trait body shape phenotypes reflecting adiposity subtypes from principal components analysis on body mass index, height, weight, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist and hip circumference. A generally obese (PC1) and a tall, centrally obese (PC3) body shape were both positively associated with CRC risk in observational analyses in 329,828 UK Biobank participants (3728 cases). In genome-wide association studies in 460,198 UK Biobank participants, we identified 3414 genetic variants across four body shapes and Mendelian randomization analyses confirmed positive associations of PC1 and PC3 with CRC risk (52,775 cases/45,940 controls from GECCO/CORECT/CCFR). Brain tissue-specific genetic instruments, mapped to PC1 through enrichment analysis, were responsible for the relationship between PC1 and CRC, while the relationship between PC3 and CRC was predominantly driven by adipose tissue-specific genetic instruments. This study suggests distinct putative causal pathways between adiposity subtypes and CRC.",3.7641411275917303e-07
38637810,"Dissecting the shared genetic landscape of anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.",J Transl Med,"Numerous studies highlight the genetic underpinnings of mental disorders comorbidity, particularly in anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. However, their shared genetic loci are not well understood. Our study employs Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses, alongside multi-omics data, to uncover potential genetic targets for these conditions, thereby informing therapeutic and drug development strategies.We utilized the Consortium for Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) and Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to investigate genetic correlations among anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Utilizing GTEx V8 eQTL and deCODE Genetics pQTL data, we performed a three-step summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) and protein-protein interaction analysis. This helped assess causal and comorbid loci for these disorders and determine if identified loci share coincidental variations with psychiatric diseases. Additionally, phenome-wide association studies, drug prediction, and molecular docking validated potential drug targets.We found genetic correlations between anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia, and under a meta-analysis of MR from multiple databases, the causal relationships among these disorders are supported. Based on this, three-step SMR and colocalization analyses identified ITIH3 and CCS as being related to the risk of developing depression, while CTSS and DNPH1 are related to the onset of schizophrenia. BTN3A1, PSMB4, and TIMP4 were identified as comorbidity loci for both disorders. Molecules that could not be determined through colocalization analysis were also presented. Drug prediction and molecular docking showed that some drugs and proteins have good binding affinity and available structural data.Our study indicates genetic correlations and shared risk loci between anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. These findings offer insights into the underlying mechanisms of their comorbidities and aid in drug development.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.623398460460256e-35
38632618,Epidemiologic association and shared genetic architecture between cataract and hearing difficulties among middle-aged and older adults.,Hum Genomics,"Age-related cataract and hearing difficulties are major sensory disorders that often co-exist in the global-wide elderly and have a tangible influence on the quality of life. However, the epidemiologic association between cataract and hearing difficulties remains unexplored, while little is known about whether the two share their genetic etiology. We first investigated the clinical association between cataract and hearing difficulties using the UK Biobank covering 502,543 individuals. Both unmatched analysis (adjusted for confounders) and a matched analysis (one control matched for each patient with cataract according to confounding factors) were undertaken and confirmed that cataract was associated with hearing difficulties (OR, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.98-2.27; OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.86-2.23, respectively). Furthermore, we explored and quantified the shared genetic architecture of these two complex sensory disorders at the common variant level using the bivariate causal mixture model (MiXeR) and conditional/conjunctional false discovery rate method based on the largest available genome-wide association studies of cataract (N = 585,243) and hearing difficulties (N = 323,978). Despite detecting only a negligible genetic correlation, we observe polygenic overlap between cataract and hearing difficulties and identify 6 shared loci with mixed directions of effects. Follow-up analysis of the shared loci implicates candidate genes QKI, STK17A, TYR, NSF, and TCF4 likely contribute to the pathophysiology of cataracts and hearing difficulties. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the presence of epidemiologic association between cataract and hearing difficulties and provides new insights into the shared genetic architecture of these two disorders at the common variant level.© 2024.

38632349,Integrative common and rare variant analyses provide insights into the genetic architecture of liver cirrhosis.,Nat Genet,"We report a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study on liver cirrhosis and its associated endophenotypes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and γ-glutamyl transferase. Using data from 12 cohorts, including 18,265 cases with cirrhosis, 1,782,047 controls, up to 1 million individuals with liver function tests and a validation cohort of 21,689 cases and 617,729 controls, we identify and validate 14 risk associations for cirrhosis. Many variants are located near genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism. One of these, PNPLA3 p.Ile148Met, interacts with alcohol intake, obesity and diabetes on the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We develop a polygenic risk score that associates with the progression from cirrhosis to HCC. By focusing on prioritized genes from common variant analyses, we find that rare coding variants in GPAM associate with lower ALT, supporting GPAM as a potential target for therapeutic inhibition. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the genetic underpinnings of cirrhosis.© 2024. The Author(s).",5.925698252691549e-13
38632254,Reverse causation between multiple sclerosis and psoriasis: a genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization study.,Sci Rep,"Observational studies have found a potential bidirectional positive association between multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, but these studies are susceptible to confounding factors. We examined the directionality of causation using Mendelian randomization and estimated the genetic correlation using the linkage disequilibrium score. We performed Mendelian randomization analysis using large-scale genome-wide association studies datasets from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC, 115,803 individuals of European ancestry) and FinnGen (252,323 individuals of European ancestry). We selected several Mendelian randomization methods including causal analysis using summary effect (CAUSE), inverse variance-weighted (IVW), and pleiotropy-robust methods. According to CAUSE and IVW the genetic liability to MS reduces the risk of psoriasis (CAUSE odds ratio [OR] 0.93, p = 0.045; IVW OR 0.93, p = 2.51 × 10-20), and vice versa (CAUSE OR 0.72, p = 0.001; IVW OR 0.71, p = 4.80 × 10-26). Pleiotropy-robust methods show the same results, with all p-values < 0.05. The linkage disequilibrium score showed no genetic correlation between psoriasis and MS (rg =  - 0.071, p = 0.2852). In summary, there is genetic evidence that MS reduces the risk of psoriasis, and vice versa.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.1956804699463492e-16
38604127,MUSSEL: Enhanced Bayesian polygenic risk prediction leveraging information across multiple ancestry groups.,Cell Genom,"Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are now showing promising predictive performance on a wide variety of complex traits and diseases, but there exists a substantial performance gap across populations. We propose MUSSEL, a method for ancestry-specific polygenic prediction that borrows information in summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) across multiple ancestry groups via Bayesian hierarchical modeling and ensemble learning. In our simulation studies and data analyses across four distinct studies, totaling 5.7 million participants with a substantial ancestral diversity, MUSSEL shows promising performance compared to alternatives. For example, MUSSEL has an average gain in prediction R2across 11 continuous traits of 40.2% and 49.3% compared to PRS-CSx and CT-SLEB, respectively, in the African ancestry population. The best-performing method, however, varies by GWAS sample size, target ancestry, trait architecture, and linkage disequilibrium reference samples; thus, ultimately a combination of methods may be needed to generate the most robust PRSs across diverse populations.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

38603516,Interpreting population- and family-based genome-wide association studies in the presence of confounding.,PLoS Biol,"A central aim of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to estimate direct genetic effects: the causal effects on an individual's phenotype of the alleles that they carry. However, estimates of direct effects can be subject to genetic and environmental confounding and can also absorb the ""indirect"" genetic effects of relatives' genotypes. Recently, an important development in controlling for these confounds has been the use of within-family GWASs, which, because of the randomness of mendelian segregation within pedigrees, are often interpreted as producing unbiased estimates of direct effects. Here, we present a general theoretical analysis of the influence of confounding in standard population-based and within-family GWASs. We show that, contrary to common interpretation, family-based estimates of direct effects can be biased by genetic confounding. In humans, such biases will often be small per-locus, but can be compounded when effect-size estimates are used in polygenic scores (PGSs). We illustrate the influence of genetic confounding on population- and family-based estimates of direct effects using models of assortative mating, population stratification, and stabilizing selection on GWAS traits. We further show how family-based estimates of indirect genetic effects, based on comparisons of parentally transmitted and untransmitted alleles, can suffer substantial genetic confounding. We conclude that, while family-based studies have placed GWAS estimation on a more rigorous footing, they carry subtle issues of interpretation that arise from confounding.Copyright: © 2024 Veller, Coop.

Nevertheless, with the appearance of large-scale sequencing profiles, we could explore the rare coding variants in disease pathogenesis.We estimated the genetic correlation of nine respiratory diseases and lung cancer in the UK Biobank (UKB) by linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC). Then, we performed exome-wide association studies at single-variant level and gene-level for lung cancer and lung cancer-related respiratory diseases using the whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of 427,934 European participants. Cross-trait meta-analysis was conducted by association analysis based on subsets (ASSET) to identify the pleiotropic variants, while in-silico functional analysis was performed to explore their function. Causal mediation analysis was used to explore whether these pleiotropic variants lead to lung cancer is mediated by affecting the chronic respiratory diseases.Five respiratory diseases [emphysema, pneumonia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and fibrosis] were genetically correlated with lung cancer. We identified 102 significant independent variants at single-variant levels for lung cancer and five lung cancer-related diseases. 15:78590583:G>A (missense variant inCHRNA5) was shared in lung cancer, emphysema, and COPD. Meanwhile, 14 significant genes and 87 suggestive genes were identified in gene-based association tests, includingHSD3B7(lung cancer),SRSF2(pneumonia),TNXB(asthma),TERT(fibrosis),MOSPD3(emphysema). Based on the cross-trait meta-analysis, we detected 145 independent pleiotropic variants. We further identified abundant pathways with significant enrichment effects, demonstrating that these pleiotropic genes were functional. Meanwhile, the proportion of mediation effects of these variants ranged from 6 to 23 (emphysema: 23%; COPD: 20%; pneumonia: 20%; fibrosis: 7%; asthma: 6%) through these five respiratory diseases to the incidence of lung cancer.The identified shared genetic variants, genes, biological pathways, and potential intermediate causal pathways provide a basis for further exploration of the relationship between lung cancer and respiratory diseases.2024 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

38600095,Genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses support causal relationships between dietary habits and age at menarche.,Sci Rep,"Dietary habits are essential in the mean age at menarche (AAM). However, the causal relationship between these factors remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the genetic relationship between dietary habits and AAM. Genetic summary statistics for dietary habits were obtained from the UK Biobank. GWAS summary data for AAM was obtained from the ReproGen Consortium. Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to test genetic correlations between dietary habits and AAM. The Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses used the inverse-variance weighted method. Genetic correlations with AAM were identified for 29 candi-date dietary habits, such as milk type (skimmed, semi-skimmed, full cream; coefficient = 0.2704, Pldsc = 1.13 × 10-14). MR evaluations revealed that 19 dietary habits were associated with AAM, including bread type (white vs. any other; OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.28-2.29, Pmr = 3.20 × 10-4), tablespoons of cooked vegetables (OR 0.437, 95% CI 0.29-0.67; Pmr = 1.30 × 10-4), and cups of coffee per day (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.57-0.92, Pmr = 8.31 × 10-3). These results were observed to be stable under the sensitivity analysis. Our study provides potential insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying AAM and evidence that dietary habits are associated with AAM.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.013690313037332466

Mechanisms of uptake, distribution, metabolism, and excretion are partly under genetic control but have not yet been extensively mapped. Here we report a comprehensive multi-element genome-wide association study of 57 essential and non-essential trace elements. We perform genome-wide association meta-analyses of 14 trace elements in up to 6564 Scandinavian whole blood samples, and genome-wide association studies of 43 trace elements in up to 2819 samples measured only in the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT). We identify 11 novel genetic loci associated with blood concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, manganese, selenium, and zinc in genome-wide association meta-analyses. In HUNT, several genome-wide significant loci are also indicated for other trace elements. Using two-sample Mendelian randomization, we find several indications of weak to moderate effects on health outcomes, the most precise being a weak harmful effect of increased zinc on prostate cancer. However, independent validation is needed. Our current understanding of trace element-associated genetic variants may help establish consequences of trace elements on human health.© 2024.

38591545,Deciphering the complex relationship between type 2 diabetes and fracture risk with both genetic and observational evidence.,Elife,"The 'diabetic bone paradox' suggested that type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients would have higher areal bone mineral density (BMD) but higher fracture risk than individuals without T2D. In this study, we found that the genetically predicted T2D was associated with higher BMD and lower risk of fracture in both weighted genetic risk score (wGRS) and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. We also identified ten genomic loci shared between T2D and fracture, with the top signal at SNP rs4580892 in the intron of geneRSPO3. And the higher expression in adipose subcutaneous and higher protein level in plasma ofRSPO3were associated with increased risk of T2D, but decreased risk of fracture. In the prospective study, T2D was observed to be associated with higher risk of fracture, but BMI mediated 30.2% of the protective effect. However, when stratified by the T2D-related risk factors for fracture, we observed that the effect of T2D on the risk of fracture decreased when the number of T2D-related risk factors decreased, and the association became non-significant if the T2D patients carried none of the risk factors. In conclusion, the genetically determined T2D might not be associated with higher risk of fracture. And the shared genetic architecture between T2D and fracture suggested a top signal aroundRSPO3gene. The observed effect size of T2D on fracture risk decreased if the T2D-related risk factors could be eliminated. Therefore, it is important to manage the complications of T2D to prevent the risk of fracture.© 2023, Zhao, Sheng, Xu et al.",1.8412711022160588e-30
38590722,Genetically determined metabolites in allergic conjunctivitis: A Mendelian randomization study.,World Allergy Organ J,"Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) afflicts a significant portion of the global populace. Yet, its metabolic foundations remain largely unexplored.We applied Mendelian Randomization (MR) and Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) to scrutinize a cohort comprising 20 958 AC cases and 356 319 controls. Data were amalgamated from the metabolomics GWAS server and the FinnGen project, under strict quality control protocols.Using two-sample MR analysis, 486 blood metabolites were investigated in relation to AC. The IVW approach highlighted 18 metabolites as closely tied to AC risk; of these, 16 retained significance post sensitivity assessments for heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. LDSC analysis, adopted to bolster our findings and negate confounders from shared genetic markers, revealed 8 metabolites with marked heritability, including: palmitate (OR = 0.614), 3-methoxytyrosine (OR = 0.657), carnitine (OR = 1.368), threonate (OR = 0.828), N-[3-(2-Oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)propyl]acetamide (OR = 1.257), metoprolol acid metabolite (OR = 0.982), oleoylcarnitine (OR = 0.635), and 2-palmitoylglycerophosphocholine (OR = 1.351).AC is precipitated by ocular responses to environmental allergens. Our study unveils a causal link between 8 blood metabolites and AC. This insight accentuates the role of metabolites in AC onset, suggesting novel avenues for its early prediction, targeted prevention, and tailored therapeutic interventions.© 2024 The Authors.",1.7756858184047942e-10
38589871,Characterizing the polygenic overlap and shared loci between rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular diseases.,BMC Med,"Despite substantial research revealing that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have excessive morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the mechanism underlying this association has not been fully known. This study aims to systematically investigate the phenotypic and genetic correlation between RA and CVD.Based on UK Biobank, we conducted two cohort studies to evaluate the phenotypic relationships between RA and CVD, including atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), and stroke. Next, we used linkage disequilibrium score regression, Local Analysis of [co]Variant Association, and bivariate causal mixture model (MiXeR) methods to examine the genetic correlation and polygenic overlap between RA and CVD, using genome-wide association summary statistics. Furthermore, we explored specific shared genetic loci by conjunctional false discovery rate analysis and association analysis based on subsets.Compared with the general population, RA patients showed a higher incidence of CVD (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-1.28). We observed positive genetic correlations of RA with AF and stroke, and a mixture of negative and positive local genetic correlations underlying the global genetic correlation for CAD and HF, with 13 ~ 33% of shared genetic variants for these trait pairs. We further identified 23 pleiotropic loci associated with RA and at least one CVD, including one novel locus (rs7098414, TSPAN14, 10q23.1). Genes mapped to these shared loci were enriched in immune and inflammatory-related pathways, and modifiable risk factors, such as high diastolic blood pressure.This study revealed the shared genetic architecture of RA and CVD, which may facilitate drug target identification and improved clinical management.© 2024.

Here we conducted a large-scale whole-exome-sequencing study to interrogate the impact of protein-coding variants on 46 neuropsychiatric diseases and 23 traits in 350,770 adults from the UK Biobank. Twenty new genes were associated with neuropsychiatric diseases through coding variants, among which 16 genes had impacts on the longitudinal risks of diseases. Thirty new genes were associated with neuropsychiatric traits, with SYNGAP1 showing pleiotropic effects across cognitive function domains. Pairwise estimation of genetic correlations at the coding-variant level highlighted shared genetic associations among pairs of neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders. Lastly, a comprehensive multi-omics analysis suggested that alterations in brain structures, blood proteins and inflammation potentially contribute to the gene-phenotype linkages.

Here, we investigated the potential shared genetic basis of common epilepsies and general cognitive ability (COG).We applied linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) regression, MiXeR and conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) to analyze different aspects of genetic overlap between COG and epilepsies. We used the largest available genome-wide association study data on COG (n= 269,867) and common epilepsies (n= 27,559 cases, 42,436 controls), including the broad phenotypes 'all epilepsy', focal epilepsies and genetic generalized epilepsies (GGE), and as well as specific subtypes. We functionally annotated the identified loci using a variety of biological resources and validated the results in independent samples.Using MiXeR, COG (11.2k variants) was estimated to be almost four times more polygenic than 'all epilepsy', GGE, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), and childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) (2.5k - 2.9k variants). The other epilepsy phenotypes were insufficiently powered for analysis. We show extensive genetic overlap between COG and epilepsies with significant negative genetic correlations (-0.23 to -0.04). COG was estimated to share 2.9k variants with both GGE and 'all epilepsy', and 2.3k variants with both JME and CAE. Using conjFDR, we identified 66 distinct loci shared between COG and epilepsies, including novel associations for GGE (27), 'all epilepsy' (5), JME (5) and CAE (5). The implicated genes were significantly expressed in multiple brain regions. The results were validated in independent samples (COG:p= 1.0 × 10-14; 'all epilepsy':p= 5.6 × 10-3).Our study demonstrates a substantial genetic basis shared between epilepsies and COG and identifies novel overlapping genomic loci.

However, existing MR approaches often suffer the bias from weak instrumental variables, horizontal pleiotropy and sample overlap. We introduce MRBEE (MR using bias-corrected estimating equation), a multivariable MR method capable of simultaneously removing weak instrument and sample overlap bias and identifying horizontal pleiotropy. Our extensive simulations and real data analyses reveal that MRBEE provides nearly unbiased estimates of causal effects, well-controlled type I error rates and higher power than comparably robust methods and is computationally efficient. Our real data analyses result in consistent causal effect estimates and offer valuable guidance for conducting multivariable MR studies, elucidating the roles of pleiotropy, and identifying total 42 horizontal pleiotropic loci missed previously that are associated with myopia, schizophrenia, and coronary artery disease.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of FECD in the Million Veteran Program followed by multi-ancestry meta-analysis with the previous largest FECD GWAS, for a total of 3970 cases and 333,794 controls. We confirm the previous four loci, and identify eight novel loci: SSBP3, THSD7A, LAMB1, PIDD1, RORA, HS3ST3B1, LAMA5, and COL18A1. We further confirm the TCF4 locus in GWAS for admixed African and Hispanic/Latino ancestries and show an enrichment of European-ancestry haplotypes at TCF4 in FECD cases. Among the novel associations are low frequency missense variants in laminin genes LAMA5 and LAMB1 which, together with previously reported LAMC1, form laminin-511 (LM511). AlphaFold 2 protein modeling, validated through homology, suggests that mutations at LAMA5 and LAMB1 may destabilize LM511 by altering inter-domain interactions or extracellular matrix binding. Finally, phenome-wide association scans and colocalization analyses suggest that the TCF4 CTG18.1 trinucleotide repeat expansion leads to dysregulation of ion transport in the corneal endothelium and has pleiotropic effects on renal function.© 2024.

38580839,Unsupervised deep representation learning enables phenotype discovery for genetic association studies of brain imaging.,Commun Biol,"Understanding the genetic architecture of brain structure is challenging, partly due to difficulties in designing robust, non-biased descriptors of brain morphology. Until recently, brain measures for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consisted of traditionally expert-defined or software-derived image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) that are often based on theoretical preconceptions or computed from limited amounts of data. Here, we present an approach to derive brain imaging phenotypes using unsupervised deep representation learning. We train a 3-D convolutional autoencoder model with reconstruction loss on 6130 UK Biobank (UKBB) participants' T1 or T2-FLAIR (T2) brain MRIs to create a 128-dimensional representation known as Unsupervised Deep learning derived Imaging Phenotypes (UDIPs). GWAS of these UDIPs in held-out UKBB subjects (n = 22,880 discovery and n = 12,359/11,265 replication cohorts for T1/T2) identified 9457 significant SNPs organized into 97 independent genetic loci of which 60 loci were replicated. Twenty-six loci were not reported in earlier T1 and T2 IDP-based UK Biobank GWAS. We developed a perturbation-based decoder interpretation approach to show that these loci are associated with UDIPs mapped to multiple relevant brain regions. Our results established unsupervised deep learning can derive robust, unbiased, heritable, and interpretable brain imaging phenotypes.© 2024. The Author(s).",5.889725648102916e-13

Individuals suffering from PTSD are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but it is unclear why. This study assesses shared genetic liability and potential causal pathways between PTSD and CVD.We leveraged summary-level data of genome-wide association studies (PTSD: N= 1,222,882; atrial fibrillation (AF): N=482,409; coronary artery disease (CAD): N=1,165,690; hypertension: N=458,554; heart failure (HF): N=977,323). First, we estimated genetic correlations and utilized genomic structural equation modeling to identify a common genetic factor for PTSD and CVD. Next, we assessed biological, behavioural, and psychosocial factors as potential mediators. Finally, we employed multivariable Mendelian randomization to examine causal pathways between PTSD and CVD, incorporating the same potential mediators.Significant genetic correlations were found between PTSD and CAD, HT, and HF (rg=0.21-0.32, p≤ 3.08 · 10-16), but not between PTSD and AF. Insomnia, smoking, alcohol dependence, waist-to-hip ratio, and inflammation (IL6, C-reactive protein) partly mediated these associations. Mendelian randomization indicated that PTSD causally increases CAD (IVW OR=1.53, 95% CIs=1.19-1.96, p=0.001), HF (OR=1.44, CIs=1.08-1.92, p=0.012), and to a lesser degree hypertension (OR=1.25, CIs=1.05-1.49, p=0.012). While insomnia, smoking, alcohol, and inflammation were important mediators, independent causal effects also remained.In addition to shared genetic liability between PTSD and CVD, we present strong evidence for causal effects of PTSD on CVD. Crucially, we implicate specific lifestyle and biological mediators (insomnia, substance use, inflammation) which has important implications for interventions to prevent CVD in PTSD patients.",3.2010260387447416e-14

This study aimed to estimate the relative importance of predictors of Hg and Se concentrations in blood samples taken from pregnant women. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in the UK measured whole blood Hg and Se concentrations in 3,972 pregnant women. We identified 30 potential predictors of Hg and 24 of Se, which were evaluated using cross-validated random forests to identify the optimal models for predictive power. The relative importance of individual variables was estimated by averaging the added-R2per predictor. Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate the variance explained by genotype. A multivariable model of 14 predictors explained 22.4% of Hg variance (95% CI: 13.0 to 37.1), including 6.9% from blood Se and 3.2% from white fish consumption. There were 11 predictors which explained 15.3% of Se variance (CI: 8.9 to 25.9), including 6.4% from blood Hg, 1.3% from blood lead, and 1.3% from oily fish. Measured genetic variation explained 30% of Hg variance (CI: 8.4 to 51.5) and 37.5% of Se (CI: 10.4 to 64.5). A high proportion of Hg and Se variance could be explained from dietary, sociodemographic, metabolic, and genetic factors. Seafood consumption was less predictive of Hg than may be expected and other factors should be considered when determining risk of exposure. There was tentative evidence that genotype is a major contributor to Hg and Se variation, possibly by modifying the efficacy of internal metabolism.© 2023 The Authors.",0.0006016474195901108
38561342,Effects of genetically predicted posttraumatic stress disorder on autoimmune phenotypes.,Transl Psychiatry,"Observational studies suggest that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increases risk for various autoimmune diseases. Insights into shared biology and causal relationships between these diseases may inform intervention approaches to PTSD and co-morbid autoimmune conditions. We investigated the shared genetic contributions and causal relationships between PTSD, 18 autoimmune diseases, and 3 immune/inflammatory biomarkers. Univariate MiXeR was used to contrast the genetic architectures of phenotypes. Genetic correlations were estimated using linkage disequilibrium score regression. Bi-directional, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed using independent, genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms; inverse variance weighted and weighted median MR estimates were evaluated. Sensitivity analyses for uncorrelated (MR PRESSO) and correlated horizontal pleiotropy (CAUSE) were also performed. PTSD was considerably more polygenic (10,863 influential variants) than autoimmune diseases (median 255 influential variants). However, PTSD evidenced significant genetic correlation with nine autoimmune diseases and three inflammatory biomarkers. PTSD had putative causal effects on autoimmune thyroid disease (p = 0.00009) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 4.3 × 10-7). Inferences were not substantially altered by sensitivity analyses. Additionally, the PTSD-autoimmune thyroid disease association remained significant in multivariable MR analysis adjusted for genetically predicted inflammatory biomarkers as potential mechanistic pathway variables. No autoimmune disease had a significant causal effect on PTSD (all p values > 0.05). Although causal effect models were supported for associations of PTSD with CRP, shared pleiotropy was adequate to explain a putative causal effect of CRP on PTSD (p = 0.18). In summary, our results suggest a significant genetic overlap between PTSD, autoimmune diseases, and biomarkers of inflammation. PTSD has a putative causal effect on autoimmune thyroid disease, consistent with existing epidemiologic evidence. A previously reported causal effect of CRP on PTSD is potentially confounded by shared genetics. Together, results highlight the nuanced links between PTSD, autoimmune disorders, and associated inflammatory signatures, and suggest the importance of targeting related pathways to protect against disease and disability.© 2024.

38559031,A framework for conducting time-varying genome-wide association studies: An application to body mass index across childhood in six multiethnic cohorts.,medRxiv,"Genetic effects on changes in human traits over time are understudied and may have important pathophysiological impact. We propose a framework that enables data quality control, implements mixed models to evaluate trajectories of change in traits, and estimates phenotypes to identify age-varying genetic effects in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Using childhood body mass index (BMI) as an example, we included 71,336 participants from six cohorts and estimated the slope and area under the BMI curve within four time periods (infancy, early childhood, late childhood and adolescence) for each participant, in addition to the age and BMI at the adiposity peak and the adiposity rebound. GWAS on each of the estimated phenotypes identified 28 genome-wide significant variants at 13 loci across the 12 estimated phenotypes, one of which was novel (inDAOA)and had not been previously associated with childhood or adult BMI. Genetic studies of changes in human traits over time could uncover novel biological mechanisms influencing quantitative traits.",0.9424968251844346
38554235,Osteoporosis and Primary Biliary Cholangitis: A Trans-ethnic Mendelian Randomization Analysis.,Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,"Osteoporosis is a major clinical problem in many autoimmune diseases, including primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), the most common autoimmune liver disease. Osteoporosis is a major cause of fracture and related mortality. However, it remains unclear whether PBC confers a causally risk-increasing effect on osteoporosis. Herein, we aimed to investigate the causal relationship between PBC and osteoporosis and whether the relationship is independent of potential confounders. We performed bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to investigate the association between PBC (8021 cases and 16,489 controls) and osteoporosis in Europeans (the UK Biobank and FinnGen Consortium: 12,787 cases and 726,996 controls). The direct effect of PBC on osteoporosis was estimated using multivariable MR analyses. An independent replication was conducted in East Asians (PBC: 2495 cases and 4283 controls; osteoporosis: 9794 cases and 168,932 controls). Trans-ethnic meta-analysis was performed by pooling the MR estimates of Europeans and East Asians. Inverse-variance weighted analyses revealed that genetic liability to PBC was associated with a higher risk of osteoporosis in Europeans (OR, 1.040; 95% CI, 1.016-1.064; P = 0.001). Furthermore, the causal effect of PBC on osteoporosis persisted after adjusting for BMI, calcium, lipidemic traits, and sex hormones. The causal relationship was further validated in the East Asians (OR, 1.059; 95% CI, 1.023-1.096; P = 0.001). Trans-ethnic meta-analysis confirmed that PBC conferred increased risk on osteoporosis (OR, 1.045; 95% CI, 1.025-1.067; P = 8.17 × 10-6). Our data supports a causal effect of PBC on osteoporosis, and the causality is independent of BMI, calcium, triglycerides, and several sex hormones.© 2024.

38548983,"Genome-Wide Association Study of Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms including 33,943 individuals from the general population.",Mol Psychiatry,"While 1-2% of individuals meet the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many more (~13-38%) experience subclinical obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) during their life. To characterize the genetic underpinnings of OCS and its genetic relationship to OCD, we conducted the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of parent- or self-reported OCS to date (N = 33,943 with complete phenotypic and genome-wide data), combining the results from seven large-scale population-based cohorts from Sweden, the Netherlands, England, and Canada (including six twin cohorts and one cohort of unrelated individuals). We found no genome-wide significant associations at the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or gene-level, but a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on the OCD GWAS previously published by the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC-OCD) was significantly associated with OCS (Pfixed = 3.06 × 10-5). Also, one curated gene set (Mootha Gluconeogenesis) reached Bonferroni-corrected significance (Ngenes = 28, Beta = 0.79, SE = 0.16, Pbon = 0.008). Expression of genes in this set is high at sites of insulin mediated glucose disposal. Dysregulated insulin signaling in the etiology of OCS has been suggested by a previous study describing a genetic overlap of OCS with insulin signaling-related traits in children and adolescents. We report a SNP heritability of 4.1% (P = 0.0044) in the meta-analyzed GWAS, and heritability estimates based on the twin cohorts of 33-43%. Genetic correlation analysis showed that OCS were most strongly associated with OCD (rG = 0.72, p = 0.0007) among all tested psychiatric disorders (N = 11). Of all 97 tested phenotypes, 24 showed a significant genetic correlation with OCS, and 66 traits showed concordant directions of effect with OCS and OCD. OCS have a significant polygenic contribution and share genetic risk with diagnosed OCD, supporting the hypothesis that OCD represents the extreme end of widely distributed OCS in the population.© 2024.

38536179,Genetic and Phenotypic Features of Schizophrenia in the UK Biobank.,JAMA Psychiatry,"Large-scale biobanks provide important opportunities for mental health research, but selection biases raise questions regarding the comparability of individuals with those in clinical research settings.To compare the genetic liability to psychiatric disorders in individuals with schizophrenia in the UK Biobank with individuals in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) and to compare genetic liability and phenotypic features with participants recruited from clinical settings.This cross-sectional study included participants from the population-based UK Biobank and schizophrenia samples recruited from clinical settings (CLOZUK, CardiffCOGS, Cardiff F-Series, and Cardiff Affected Sib-Pairs). Data were collected between January 1993 and July 2021. Data analysis was conducted between July 2021 and June 2023.A genome-wide association study of UK Biobank schizophrenia case-control status was conducted, and the results were compared with those from the PGC via genetic correlations. To test for differences with the clinical samples, polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and intelligence using PRS-CS. PRS and phenotypic comparisons were conducted using pairwise logistic regressions. The proportions of individuals with copy number variants associated with schizophrenia were compared using Firth logistic regression.The sample of 517 375 participants included 1438 UK Biobank participants with schizophrenia (550 [38.2%] female; mean [SD] age, 54.7 [8.3] years), 499 475 UK Biobank controls (271 884 [54.4%] female; mean [SD] age, 56.5 [8.1] years), and 4 schizophrenia research samples (4758 [28.9%] female; mean [SD] age, 38.2 [21.0] years). Liability to schizophrenia in UK Biobank was highly correlated with the latest genome-wide association study from the PGC (genetic correlation, 0.98; SE, 0.18) and showed the expected patterns of correlations with other psychiatric disorders. The schizophrenia PRS explained 6.8% of the variance in liability for schizophrenia case status in UK Biobank. UK Biobank participants with schizophrenia had significantly lower schizophrenia PRS than 3 of the clinically ascertained samples and significantly lower rates of schizophrenia-associated copy number variants than the CLOZUK sample. UK Biobank participants with schizophrenia had higher educational attainment and employment rates than the clinically ascertained schizophrenia samples, lower rates of smoking, and a later age of onset of psychosis.Individuals with schizophrenia in the UK Biobank, and likely other volunteer-based biobanks, represent those less severely affected. Their inclusion in wider studies should enhance the representation of the full spectrum of illness severity.",2.1837345862947514e-20
38532343,Phenome-wide causal associations between osteoarthritis and other complex traits through the latent causal variable analysis.,BMC Musculoskelet Disord,"Individuals with osteoarthritis present with comorbidities, and the potential causal associations remain incompletely elucidated. The present study undertook a large-scale investigation about the causality between osteoarthritis and variable traits, using the summary-level data of genome-wide association studies (GWAS).The present study included the summary-level GWS data of knee osteoarthritis, hip osteoarthritis, hip or knee osteoarthritis, hand osteoarthritis, and other 1355 traits. Genetic correlation analysis was conducted between osteoarthritis and other traits through cross-trait bivariate linkage disequilibrium score regression. Subsequently, latent causal variable analysis was performed to explore the causal association when there was a significant genetic correlation. Genetic correlation and latent causal variable analysis were conducted on the Complex Traits Genomics Virtual Lab platform ( https://vl.genoma.io/ ).We found 133 unique phenotypes showing causal relationships with osteoarthritis. Our results confirmed several well-established risk factors of osteoarthritis, such as obesity, weight, BMI, and meniscus derangement. Additionally, our findings suggested putative causal links between osteoarthritis and multiple factors. Socioeconomic determinants such as occupational exposure to dust and diesel exhaust, extended work hours exceeding 40 per week, and unemployment status were implicated. Furthermore, our analysis revealed causal associations with cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, including heart failure, deep venous thrombosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and elevated cholesterol levels. Soft tissue and musculoskeletal disorders, such as hallux valgus, internal derangement of the knee, and spondylitis, were also identified to be causally related to osteoarthritis. The study also identified the putative causal associations of osteoarthritis with digestive and respiratory diseases, such as Barrett's esophagus, esophagitis, and asthma, as well as psychiatric conditions including panic attacks and manic or hyperactive episodes. Additionally, we observed osteoarthritis causally related to pharmacological treatments, such as the use of antihypertensive medications, anti-asthmatic drugs, and antidepressants.Our study uncovered a wide range of traits causally associated with osteoarthritis. Further studies are needed to validate and illustrate the detailed mechanism of those causal associations.© 2024. The Author(s).",7.204205718348779e-36
38531894,Abundant pleiotropy across neuroimaging modalities identified through a multivariate genome-wide association study.,Nat Commun,"Genetic pleiotropy is abundant across spatially distributed brain characteristics derived from one neuroimaging modality (e.g. structural, functional or diffusion magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]). A better understanding of pleiotropy across modalities could inform us on the integration of brain function, micro- and macrostructure. Here we show extensive genetic overlap across neuroimaging modalities at a locus and gene level in the UK Biobank (N = 34,029) and ABCD Study (N = 8607). When jointly analysing phenotypes derived from structural, functional and diffusion MRI in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with the Multivariate Omnibus Statistical Test (MOSTest), we boost the discovery of loci and genes beyond previously identified effects for each modality individually. Cross-modality genes are involved in fundamental biological processes and predominantly expressed during prenatal brain development. We additionally boost prediction of psychiatric disorders by conditioning independent GWAS on our multimodal multivariate GWAS. These findings shed light on the shared genetic mechanisms underlying variation in brain morphology, functional connectivity, and tissue composition.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.3975276846315378e-16
38531844,Using rare genetic mutations to revisit structural brain asymmetry.,Nat Commun,"Asymmetry between the left and right hemisphere is a key feature of brain organization. Hemispheric functional specialization underlies some of the most advanced human-defining cognitive operations, such as articulated language, perspective taking, or rapid detection of facial cues. Yet, genetic investigations into brain asymmetry have mostly relied on common variants, which typically exert small effects on brain-related phenotypes. Here, we leverage rare genomic deletions and duplications to study how genetic alterations reverberate in human brain and behavior. We designed a pattern-learning approach to dissect the impact of eight high-effect-size copy number variations (CNVs) on brain asymmetry in a multi-site cohort of 552 CNV carriers and 290 non-carriers. Isolated multivariate brain asymmetry patterns spotlighted regions typically thought to subserve lateralized functions, including language, hearing, as well as visual, face and word recognition. Planum temporale asymmetry emerged as especially susceptible to deletions and duplications of specific gene sets. Targeted analysis of common variants through genome-wide association study (GWAS) consolidated partly diverging genetic influences on the right versus left planum temporale structure. In conclusion, our gene-brain-behavior data fusion highlights the consequences of genetically controlled brain lateralization on uniquely human cognitive capacities.© 2024.

The potential causal relationships between IBD and the risk of cancers remain largely unclear.We performed genome-wide linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), standard two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), and colocalization analyses using summary genome-wide association study (GWAS) data across East Asian and European populations to evaluate the causal relationships between IBD and cancers. Sensitivity analyses for the MR approach were additionally performed to explore the stability of the results.There were no significant genetic correlations between IBD, CD, or UC and cancers (all P values > 0.05) in East Asian or European populations. According to the main MR analysis, no significant causal relationship was observed between IBD and cancers in the East Asian population. There were significant associations between CD and ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.898, 95% CI = 0.844-0.955) and between UC and nonmelanoma skin cancer (OR = 1.002, 95% CI = 1.000-1.004, P = 0.019) in the European population. The multivariable MR analysis did not find any of the above significant associations. There was no shared causal variant to prove the associations of IBD, CD, or UC with cancers in East Asian or European populations using colocalization analysis.We did not provide robust genetic evidence of causal associations between IBD and cancer risk. Exposure to IBD might not independently contribute to the risk of cancers, and the increased risk of cancers observed in observational studies might be attributed to factors accompanying the diagnosis of IBD.© 2024.

38528049,A mediation analysis framework based on variance component to remove genetic confounding effect.,J Hum Genet,"Identification of pleiotropy at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level provides valuable insights into shared genetic signals among phenotypes. One approach to study these signals is through mediation analysis, which dissects the total effect of a SNP on the outcome into a direct effect and an indirect effect through a mediator. However, estimated effects from mediation analysis can be confounded by the genetic correlation between phenotypes, leading to inaccurate results. To address this confounding effect in the context of genetic mediation analysis, we propose a restricted-maximum-likelihood (REML)-based mediation analysis framework called REML-mediation, which can be applied to either individual-level or summary statistics data. Simulations demonstrated that REML-mediation provides unbiased estimates of the true cross-trait causal effect, assuming certain assumptions, albeit with a slightly inflated standard error compared to traditional linear regression. To validate the effectiveness of REML-mediation, we applied it to UK Biobank data and analyzed several mediator-outcome trait pairs along with their corresponding sets of pleiotropic SNPs. REML-mediation successfully identified and corrected for genetic confounding effects in these trait pairs, with correction magnitudes ranging from 7% to 39%. These findings highlight the presence of genetic confounding effects in cross-trait epidemiological studies and underscore the importance of accounting for them in data analysis.© 2024.

38525495,"Assessing the Role of Cortisol in Anxiety, Major Depression, and Neuroticism: A Mendelian Randomization Study Using SERPINA6/SERPINA1 Variants.",Biol Psychiatry Glob Open Sci,"Previous evidence informed by the toxic stress model suggests that higher cortisol causes anxiety and major depression, but clinical success is lacking. To clarify the role of cortisol, we used Mendelian randomization to estimate its associations with anxiety, major depression, and neuroticism, leveraging the largest available genome-wide association studies including from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, the UK Biobank, and FinnGen.After meta-analyzing 2 genome-wide association studies on morning plasma cortisol (n = 32,981), we selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) atp< 5 × 10-8andr2< 0.3 in theSERPINA6/SERPINA1gene region encoding proteins that influence cortisol bioavailability. We applied these SNPs to summary genetic associations with the outcomes considered (n = 17,310-449,484), and systolic blood pressure as a positive outcome, using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis accounting for correlation. Sensitivity analyses addressing SNP correlation and confounding by childhood maltreatment and follow-up analyses using only SNPs that colocalized withSERPINA6expression were conducted.Cortisol was associated with anxiety (pooled odds ratio [OR] 1.16 per cortisolzscore; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.31), but not major depression (pooled OR 1.02, 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.10) or neuroticism (β -0.025; 95% CI, -0.071 to 0.022). Sensitivity analyses yielded similar estimates. Cortisol was positively associated with systolic blood pressure, as expected. Using rs9989237 and rs2736898, selected using colocalization, cortisol was associated with anxiety in the UK Biobank (OR 1.32; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.74) but not with major depression in FinnGen (OR 1.14; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.37).Cortisol was associated with anxiety and may be a potential target for prevention. Other targets may be more relevant to major depression and neuroticism.© 2024 The Authors.",9.781531767003414e-11

Through genome-wide association study analysis, we explore shared genes and pathways related to LHA. Shared genetic factors are found in 8 out of 20 pairs, indicating genetic correlations. The analysis reveals 53 loci with pleiotropic effects, including 8 loci exhibiting shared causality across multiple traits. Based on SNP-p level tissue-specific multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) analysis demonstrates significant enrichment of pleiotropy in liver and heart diseases within different cardiovascular tissues and female reproductive appendages. Gene-specific MAGMA analysis identifies 343 pleiotropic genes associated with various traits; these genes show tissue-specific enrichment primarily in the liver, cardiovascular system, and other tissues. Shared risk loci between immune cells and both liver and cardiovascular diseases are also discovered.

However, their shared genetic components have not been systematically studied. Here, we composed an atlas of the shared genetic associations between 11 immune-mediated diseases and AD by analyzing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. Our results unveiled a significant genetic overlap between AD and 11 individual immune-mediated diseases despite negligible genetic correlations, suggesting a complex shared genetic architecture distributed across the genome. The shared loci between AD and immune-mediated diseases implicated several genes, including GRAMD1B, FUT2, ADAMTS4, HBEGF, WNT3, TSPAN14, DHODH, ABCB9, and TNIP1, all of which are protein-coding genes and thus potential drug targets. Top biological pathways enriched with these identified shared genes were related to the immune system and cell adhesion. In addition, in silico single-cell analyses showed enrichment of immune and brain cells, including neurons and microglia. In summary, our results suggest a genetic relationship between AD and the 11 immune-mediated diseases, pinpointing the existence of a shared however non-causal genetic basis. These identified protein-coding genes have the potential to serve as a novel path to therapeutic interventions for both AD and immune-mediated diseases and their comorbidities.© 2024.

38495498,Illuminating Shared Genetic Associations Between Oesophageal Carcinoma and Pulmonary Carcinoma Risk.,J Cancer,"Background:Lung cancer and oesophageal cancer are prevalent malignancies with rising incidence and mortality worldwide. While some environmental and behavioural risk factors for these cancers are established, the contribution of genetic factors to their pathogenesis remains incompletely defined. This study aimed to interrogate the intricate genetic relationship between lung cancer and oesophageal cancer and their potential comorbidity.Methods:We utilised linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) to analyse the genetic correlation between oesophageal carcinoma and lung carcinoma. We then employed several approaches, including pleiotropic analysis under the composite null hypothesis (PLACO), multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA), cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis, and a pan-cancer assessment to identify pleiotropic loci and genes. Finally, we performed bidirectional Mendelian randomisation (MR) to evaluate the causal relationship between these malignancies.Results:LDSC revealed a significant genetic correlation between oesophageal carcinoma and lung carcinoma. Further analysis identified shared gene loci including PGBD1, ZNF323, and WNK1 using PLACO. MAGMA identified enriched pathways and 9 pleiotropic genes including HIST1H1B, HIST1H4L, and HIST1H2BL. eQTL analysis integrating oesophageal, lung, and blood tissues revealed 26 shared genes including TERT, NKAPL, RAD52, BTN3A2, GABBR1, CLPTM1L, and TRIM27. A pan-cancer exploration of the identified genes was undertaken. MR analysis showed no evidence for a bidirectional causal relationship between oesophageal carcinoma and lung carcinoma.Conclusions:This study provides salient insights into the intricate genetic links between lung carcinoma and oesophageal carcinoma. Utilising multiple approaches for genetic correlation, locus and gene analysis, and causal assessment, we identify shared genetic susceptibilities and regulatory mechanisms. These findings reveal new leads and targets to further elucidate the genetic basis of lung and oesophageal carcinoma, aiding development of preventive and therapeutic strategies.© The author(s).",1.9706844561609605e-40
38491288,A single-nuclei paired multiomic analysis of the human midbrain reveals age- and Parkinson's disease-associated glial changes.,Nat Aging,"Age is the primary risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD), but how aging changes the expression and regulatory landscape of the brain remains unclear. Here we present a single-nuclei multiomic study profiling shared gene expression and chromatin accessibility of young, aged and PD postmortem midbrain samples. Combined multiomic analysis along a pseudopathogenesis trajectory reveals that all glial cell types are affected by age, but microglia and oligodendrocytes are further altered in PD. We present evidence for a disease-associated oligodendrocyte subtype and identify genes lost over the aging and disease process, including CARNS1, that may predispose healthy cells to develop a disease-associated phenotype. Surprisingly, we found that chromatin accessibility changed little over aging or PD within the same cell types. Peak-gene association patterns, however, are substantially altered during aging and PD, identifying cell-type-specific chromosomal loci that contain PD-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Our study suggests a previously undescribed role for oligodendrocytes in aging and PD.© 2024. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",3.1297545904249583e-24

Different TF models are being used to assess the effect of DNA sequence variants, such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs).

We investigated the distribution of absolute maximal differential TF binding scores for general computational models that affect TF binding. We find that a modified Laplace distribution can adequately approximate the empirical distributions.

38528002,The Persian plateau served as hub for Homo sapiens after the main out of Africa dispersal.,Nat Commun,"A combination of evidence, based on genetic, fossil and archaeological findings, indicates that Homo sapiens spread out of Africa between ~70-60 thousand years ago (kya). However, it appears that once outside of Africa, human populations did not expand across all of Eurasia until ~45 kya. The geographic whereabouts of these early settlers in the timeframe between ~70-60 to 45 kya has been difficult to reconcile. Here we combine genetic evidence and palaeoecological models to infer the geographic location that acted as the Hub for our species during the early phases of colonisation of Eurasia. Leveraging on available genomic evidence we show that populations from the Persian Plateau carry an ancestry component that closely matches the population that settled the Hub outside Africa. With the paleoclimatic data available to date, we built ecological models showing that the Persian Plateau was suitable for human occupation and that it could sustain a larger population compared to other West Asian regions, strengthening this claim.© 2024.

To evaluate ccfDNA fragmentation for detecting early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we first modeled and tested using hospitalized HCC patients and then evaluated in a population-based study. A total of 427 samples were analyzed, including 270 samples collected prior to HCC diagnosis from a population-based study. Our model distinguished hospital HCC patients from controls excellently (area under curve 0.999). A high ccfDNA fragmentation score was highly associated with an advanced tumor stage and a shorter survival. In evaluation, the model showed increasing sensitivities in detecting HCC using 'pre-samples' collected ≥4 years (8.3%), 3-4 years (20.0%), 2-3 years (31.0%), 1-2 years (35.0%), and 0-1 year (36.4%) before diagnosis.

38655013,A method for chromatin domain partitioning based on hypergraph clustering.,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,"For many years, multi-scale models of chromatin domains, such as A/B compartments, sub-compartments, topologically associated domains (TADs), sub-TADs, and loops have been popular. However, existing methods can only identify structures at a single scale and cannot partition multi-scale structures. In this paper, we proposed a method (TORNADOES) for chromatin domain partitioning based on hypergraph clustering. First, we use a density clustering algorithm to identify TADs at different scales based on Hi-C data with different resolutions. Then, by combining ChIP-seq data features and TAD results at different scales, we generate a hypergraph based on these TADs. Finally, we partition the chromatin domain structure at different scales, including A/B, A1, A2, B1, B2, and B3 based on the Laplacian matrix feature of the hypergraph. Similarity comparison experiments and ChIP-seq signal enrichment analysis are performed on the A/B region and sub-TAD levels, respectively, demonstrating that our method can identify chromatin domains with distinct features and provide a deeper understanding of the organizational patterns and functional differences in TADs at the genomic hierarchical structure. Comparative analysis of multiple cell line data shows that TORNADOES can better classify different numbers and types of compartments by changing the factors ChIP-seq data and clustering number used to characterize TAD compared to other methods.

38646172,Predicting A/B compartments from histone modifications using deep learning.,iScience,"The three-dimensional organization of genomes plays a crucial role in essential biological processes. The segregation of chromatin into A and B compartments highlights regions of activity and inactivity, providing a window into the genomic activities specific to each cell type. Yet, the steep costs associated with acquiring Hi-C data, necessary for studying this compartmentalization across various cell types, pose a significant barrier in studying cell type specific genome organization. To address this, we present a prediction tool called compartment prediction using recurrent neural networks (CoRNN), which predicts compartmentalization of 3D genome using histone modification enrichment. CoRNN demonstrates robust cross-cell-type prediction of A/B compartments with an average AuROC of 90.9%. Cell-type-specific predictions align well with known functional elements, with H3K27ac and H3K36me3 identified as highly predictive histone marks. We further investigate our mispredictions and found that they are located in regions with ambiguous compartmental status. Furthermore, our model's generalizability is validated by predicting compartments in independent tissue samples, which underscores its broad applicability.© 2024 The Author(s).",3.2098768697548933e-24
38519987,Depletion of lamins B1 and B2 promotes chromatin mobility and induces differential gene expression by a mesoscale-motion-dependent mechanism.,Genome Biol,"B-type lamins are critical nuclear envelope proteins that interact with the three-dimensional genomic architecture. However, identifying the direct roles of B-lamins on dynamic genome organization has been challenging as their joint depletion severely impacts cell viability. To overcome this, we engineered mammalian cells to rapidly and completely degrade endogenous B-type lamins using Auxin-inducible degron technology.Using live-cell Dual Partial Wave Spectroscopic (Dual-PWS) microscopy, Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM), in situ Hi-C, CRISPR-Sirius, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we demonstrate that lamin B1 and lamin B2 are critical structural components of the nuclear periphery that create a repressive compartment for peripheral-associated genes. Lamin B1 and lamin B2 depletion minimally alters higher-order chromatin folding but disrupts cell morphology, significantly increases chromatin mobility, redistributes both constitutive and facultative heterochromatin, and induces differential gene expression both within and near lamin-associated domain (LAD) boundaries. Critically, we demonstrate that chromatin territories expand as upregulated genes within LADs radially shift inwards. Our results indicate that the mechanism of action of B-type lamins comes from their role in constraining chromatin motion and spatial positioning of gene-specific loci, heterochromatin, and chromatin domains.Our findings suggest that, while B-type lamin degradation does not significantly change genome topology, it has major implications for three-dimensional chromatin conformation at the single-cell level both at the lamina-associated periphery and the non-LAD-associated nuclear interior with concomitant genome-wide transcriptional changes. This raises intriguing questions about the individual and overlapping roles of lamin B1 and lamin B2 in cellular function and disease.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.7359069587126025e-48
38496446,Regulation of immune signal integration and memory by inflammation-induced chromosome conformation.,bioRxiv,"3-dimensional (3D) genome conformation is central to gene expression regulation, yet our understanding of its contribution to rapid transcriptional responses, signal integration, and memory in immune cells is limited. Here, we study the molecular regulation of the inflammatory response in primary macrophages using integrated transcriptomic, epigenomic, and chromosome conformation data, including base pair-resolution Micro-Capture C. We demonstrate that interleukin-4 (IL-4) primes the inflammatory response in macrophages by stably rewiring 3D genome conformation, juxtaposing endotoxin-, interferon-gamma-, and dexamethasone-responsive enhancers in close proximity to their cognate gene promoters. CRISPR-based perturbations of enhancer-promoter contacts or CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) boundary elements demonstrated that IL-4-driven conformation changes are indispensable for enhanced and synergistic endotoxin-induced transcriptional responses, as well as transcriptional memory following stimulus removal. Moreover, transcriptional memory mediated by changes in chromosome conformation often occurred in the absence of changes in chromatin accessibility or histone modifications. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that rapid and memory transcriptional responses to immunological stimuli are encoded in the 3D genome.",8.582372965219388e-38
38493342,scENCORE: leveraging single-cell epigenetic data to predict chromatin conformation using graph embedding.,Brief Bioinform,"Dynamic compartmentalization of eukaryotic DNA into active and repressed states enables diverse transcriptional programs to arise from a single genetic blueprint, whereas its dysregulation can be strongly linked to a broad spectrum of diseases. While single-cell Hi-C experiments allow for chromosome conformation profiling across many cells, they are still expensive and not widely available for most labs. Here, we propose an alternate approach, scENCORE, to computationally reconstruct chromatin compartments from the more affordable and widely accessible single-cell epigenetic data. First, scENCORE constructs a long-range epigenetic correlation graph to mimic chromatin interaction frequencies, where nodes and edges represent genome bins and their correlations. Then, it learns the node embeddings to cluster genome regions into A/B compartments and aligns different graphs to quantify chromatin conformation changes across conditions. Benchmarking using cell-type-matched Hi-C experiments demonstrates that scENCORE can robustly reconstruct A/B compartments in a cell-type-specific manner. Furthermore, our chromatin confirmation switching studies highlight substantial compartment-switching events that may introduce substantial regulatory and transcriptional changes in psychiatric disease. In summary, scENCORE allows accurate and cost-effective A/B compartment reconstruction to delineate higher-order chromatin structure heterogeneity in complex tissues.© Published by Oxford University Press 2024.",1.8986747550126434e-34

However, the influence of maternal education on children's height is less studied. This study aims to investigate the dynamic influence of maternal education on children's height among Chinese children aged 0-18 years.Children undergoing health examinations from January 2021 to September 2023 were included in this study. Clinical information including height, weight, maternal pregnancy history, blood specimens for bone metabolism-related indicators and maternal education level was collected. Children's height was categorized into 14 groups based on age and gender percentiles, following WHO 2006 growth standards. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear regression, chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were applied for data analysis.A total of 6269 samples were collected, including 3654 males and 2615 females, with an average age of 8.38 (3.97) for males and 7.89 (3.55) for females. Significant correlations between maternal education level, birth weight, birth order, weight percentile, vitamin D, serum phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase levels, and children's height were identified. Birth weight's influence on height varied across age groups. Compared with normal birth weight children, low birth weight children exhibited catch-up growth within the first 6 years and a subsequent gradual widening of the height gap from 6 to 18 years old. Remarkably, the impact of maternal education on height became more pronounced among children above 3-6 years old, which can mitigate the effect of low birth weight on height.We found that weight percentile, birth weight, birth order, bone marker levels, and maternal education level have significant effect on height. Maternal education attenuates the impact of low birth weight on height. The findings indicated that maternal education plays a consistent and critical role in promoting robust and healthy growth.© 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",4.782202124041466e-07

We propose a new kernel-based method called Latent Interaction Testing (LIT) to screen for genetic interactions that leverages pleiotropy from multiple related traits without requiring the interacting variable to be specified or observed. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that LIT increases power to detect latent genetic interactions compared to univariate methods.

However, the genetic variants that affect the activity of regulatory elements in pigs are largely unknown, and the extent to which these variants influence gene expression and contribute to the understanding of complex phenotypes remains unclear. Here, we annotate 90,991 high-quality regulatory elements using acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27ac) ChIP-seq of 292 pig livers. Combined with genome resequencing and RNA-seq data, we identify 28,425 H3K27ac quantitative trait loci (acQTLs) and 12,250 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Through the allelic imbalance analysis, we validate two causative acQTL variants in independent datasets. We observe substantial sharing of genetic controls between gene expression and H3K27ac, particularly within promoters. We infer that 46% of H3K27ac exhibit a concomitant rather than causative relationship with gene expression. By integrating GWAS, eQTLs, acQTLs, and transcription factor binding prediction, we further demonstrate their application, through metabolites dulcitol, phosphatidylcholine (PC) (16:0/16:0) and published phenotypes, in identifying likely causal variants and genes, and discovering sub-threshold GWAS loci. We provide insight into the relationship between regulatory elements and gene expression, and the genetic foundation for dissecting the molecular mechanism of phenotypes.© 2024.

38740675,"Can social adversity alter the epigenome, trigger oral disease, and affect future generations?",Ir J Med Sci,"The nature versus nurture debate has intrigued scientific circles for decades. Although extensive research has established a clear relationship between genetics and disease development, recent evidence has highlighted the insufficiency of attributing adverse health outcomes to genetic factors alone. In fact, it has been suggested that environmental influences, such as socioeconomic position (SEP), may play a much larger role in the development of disease than previously thought, with extensive research suggesting that low SEP is associated with adverse health conditions. In relation to oral health, a higher prevalence of caries (tooth decay) exists among those of low SEP. Although little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying this relationship, epigenetic modifications resulting from environmental influences have been suggested to play an important role. This review explores the intersection of health inequalities and epigenetics, the role of early-life social adversity and its long-term epigenetic impacts, and how those living within the lower hierarchies of the socioeconomic pyramid are indeed at higher risk of developing diseases, particularly in relation to oral health. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms could lead to the development of targeted interventions for individuals of low SEP to improve oral health or identify those who are at higher risk of developing oral disease.© 2024.

38496251,Characterization of genomic regions escaping epigenetic reprogramming in sheep.,Environ Epigenet,"The mammalian genome undergoes two global epigenetic reprogramming events during the establishment of primordial germ cells and in the pre-implantation embryo after fertilization. These events involve the erasure and re-establishment of DNA methylation marks. However, imprinted genes and transposable elements (TEs) maintain their DNA methylation signatures to ensure normal embryonic development and genome stability. Despite extensive research in mice and humans, there is limited knowledge regarding environmentally induced epigenetic marks that escape epigenetic reprogramming in other species. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the characteristics and locations of genomic regions that evade epigenetic reprogramming in sheep, as well as to explore the biological functions of the genes within these regions. In a previous study, we identified 107 transgenerationally inherited differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) in the F1 and F2 generations in response to a paternal methionine-supplemented diet. These DMCs were found in TEs, non-repetitive regions, and imprinted and non-imprinted genes. Our findings suggest that genomic regions, rather than TEs and imprinted genes, have the propensity to escape reprogramming and serve as potential candidates for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. Notably, 34 transgenerational methylated genes influenced by paternal nutrition escaped reprogramming, impacting growth, development, male fertility, cardiac disorders, and neurodevelopment. Intriguingly, among these genes, 21 have been associated with neural development and brain disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disease, and intellectual disability. This suggests a potential genetic overlap between brain and infertility disorders. Overall, our study supports the concept of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of environmentally induced marks in mammals.© The Author(s) 2024.

38645064,Predicting chromatin conformation contact maps.,bioRxiv,"Over the past 15 years, a variety of next-generation sequencing assays have been developed for measuring the 3D conformation of DNA in the nucleus. Each of these assays gives, for a particular cell or tissue type, a distinct picture of 3D chromatin architecture. Accordingly, making sense of the relationship between genome structure and function requires teasing apart two closely related questions: how does chromatin 3D structure change from one cell type to the next, and how do different measurements of that structure differ from one another, even when the two assays are carried out in the same cell type? In this work, we assemble a collection of chromatin 3D datasets-each represented as a 2D contact map- spanning multiple assay types and cell types. We then build a machine learning model that predicts missing contact maps in this collection. We use the model to systematically explore how genome 3D architecture changes, at the level of compartments, domains, and loops, between cell type and between assay types.",2.768803579048599e-23
38514204,Robust chromatin state annotation.,Genome Res,"With the goal of mapping genomic activity, international projects have recently measured epigenetic activity in hundreds of cell and tissue types. Chromatin state annotations produced by segmentation and genome annotation (SAGA) methods have emerged as the predominant way to summarize these epigenomic data sets in order to annotate the genome. These chromatin state annotations are essential for many genomic tasks, including identifying active regulatory elements and interpreting disease-associated genetic variation. However, despite the widespread applications of SAGA methods, no principled approach exists to evaluate the statistical significance of chromatin state assignments. Here, we propose the first method for assigning calibrated confidence scores to chromatin state annotations. Toward this goal, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of the reproducibility of the two most widely used existing SAGA methods, ChromHMM and Segway. We found that their predictions are frequently irreproducible. For example, when applying the same SAGA method on two sets of experimental replicates, 27%-69% of predicted enhancers fail to replicate. This suggests that a substantial fraction of predicted elements in existing chromatin state annotations cannot be relied upon. To remedy this problem, we introduce SAGAconf, a method for assigning a measure of confidence (r-value) to chromatin state annotations. SAGAconf works with any SAGA method and assigns anr-value to each genomic bin of a chromatin state annotation that represents the probability that the label of this bin will be reproduced in a replicated experiment. Thus, SAGAconf allows a researcher to select only the reliable predictions from a chromatin annotation for use in downstream analyses.© 2024 Foroozandeh Shahraki et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",6.048097268718532e-23

Participants for this study were drawn from the Strong African American Healthy Adults Program. Data analysis was conducted from April 2023 to January 2024.Family economic disadvantage (measured during the adolescent years) and college graduation (indicating upward mobility).Primary outcomes included mental health, substance use, and physical health. Mental health included a composite of internalizing and disruptive problems (anxiety, depression, anger, aggressive behaviors, and emotional reactivity). Substance use included a composite of smoking, drinking, and drug use. Physical health included metabolic syndrome (MetS) and proinflammatory phenotypes (immune cells mounting exaggerated cytokine responses to bacterial challenge and being insensitive to inhibitory signals from glucocorticoids). Mental and physical health measures were taken at age 31 and during the adolescent years. Linear and logistic regression analyses, as well as mediated moderation analyses, were conducted.The study population consisted of 329 Black youths (212 women [64%]; 117 men [36%]; mean [SD] age at follow-up, 31 [1] years). Compared with those who did not graduate college, those who graduated from college had 0.14 SD fewer mental health problems (b = -1.377; 95% CI, -2.529 to -0.226; β = -0.137; P = .02) and 0.13 SD lower levels of substance use (b = -0.114; 95% CI, -0.210 to -0.018; β = -0.131; P = .02). Residualized change scores revealed that college graduates showed greater decreases from age 16 to 31 years in mental health problems (b = -1.267; 95% CI, -2.360 to -0.174; β = -0.133; P = .02) and substance use problems (b = -0.116; 95% CI, -0.211 to -0.021; β = -0.136; P = .02). For physical health, significant interactions between childhood family disadvantage and college completion emerged in association with MetS (OR, 1.495; 95% CI, 1.111-2.012; P = .008) and proinflammatory phenotype (b = 0.051; 95% CI, 0.003 to 0.099; β = 0.131; P = .04). Among youths growing up in disadvantaged households, college completion was associated with a 32.6% greater likelihood of MetS (OR, 3.947; 95% CI, 1.003-15.502; P = .049) and 0.59 SD more proinflammatory phenotype (mean difference, 0.249, 95% CI, 0.001 to 0.497; P = .049). Conversely, among those from economically advantaged backgrounds, college completion was correlated with lower MetS and less proinflammatory phenotype. Findings held after controlling for body mass index at age 19 years.In this longitudinal cohort study of Black youths, graduating from college was associated with an adult profile of better mental health but poorer physical health among those from economic disadvantage. These findings suggest that developing interventions that foster healthy outcomes across multiple life domains may be important for ensuring that striving for upward mobility is not accompanied by unintended cardiometabolic risk.",1.0
38564607,An epigenetic candidate-gene association study of parental styles in suicide attempters with substance use disorders.,Addict Biol,"Suicide attempts (SA) are prevalent in substance use disorders (SUD). Epigenetic mechanisms may play a pivotal role in the molecular mechanisms of environmental effects eliciting suicidal behaviour in this population. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), oxytocin and neurotrophin pathways have been consistently involved in SA, yet , their interplay with childhood adversity remains unclear, particularly in SUD. In 24 outpatients with SUDs, we examined the relation between three parental dysfunctional styles and history of SA with methylation of 32 genes from these pathways, eventually analysing 823 methylation sites. Extensive phenotypic characterization was obtained using a semi-structured interview. Parental style was patient-reported using the Measure of Parental Style (MOPS) questionnaire, analysed with and without imputation of missing items. Linear regressions were performed to adjust for possible confounders, followed by multiple testing correction. We describe both differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) for each set of analyses (with and without imputation of MOPS items). Without imputation, five DMRs in OXTR, CRH and NTF3 significantly interacted with MOPS father abuse to increase the risk for lifetime SA, thus covering the three pathways. After imputation of missing MOPS items, two other DMPs from FKBP5 and SOCS3 significantly interacted with each of the three father styles to increase the risk for SA. Although our findings must be interpreted with caution due to small sample size, they suggest implications of stress reactivity genes in the suicidal risk of SUD patients and highlight the significance of father dysfunction as a potential marker of childhood adversity in SUD patients.© 2024 The Authors.

Individuals with variants in the NAA15 coding region develop NAA15-related neurodevelopmental syndrome which presents with a wide array of manifestations that affect the heart, brain, musculoskeletal system, and behavioral and cognitive development. We tracked a cohort of 26 participants (8 females and 18 males) over time, each with a pathogenic NAA15 variant, and administered the Vineland-3 assessment to them to assess their adaptive functioning. We found that the cohort performed significantly worse compared to the normalized Vineland values. On average, females performed better than males across all domains. They performed significantly better on the Motor Domain and Fine Motor Sub-Domain portions of the assessment. Over time, females showed a decrease in adaptive functioning with the decline being especially strongly correlated at the Coping subdomain, Domestic sub-domain, and Fine motor sub-domains. It is difficult to determine the strength of these correlations due to limited power. Males (after excluding one outlier) showed a moderate positive correlation between age and ABC standard score.

LRRK2 has been implicated as playing a role in both diseases. Exploring the genetic basis of the IBD-PD comorbidity through studying high-impact rare genetic variants can facilitate the identification of the novel shared genetic factors underlying this comorbidity.We analyzed whole exomes from the BioMe BioBank and UK Biobank, and whole genomes from a cohort of 67 European patients diagnosed with both IBD and PD to examine the effects of LRRK2 missense variants on IBD, PD and their co-occurrence (IBD-PD). We performed optimized sequence kernel association test (SKAT-O) and network-based heterogeneity clustering (NHC) analyses using high-impact rare variants in the IBD-PD cohort to identify novel candidate genes, which we further prioritized by biological relatedness approaches. We conducted phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) employing BioMe BioBank and UK Biobank whole exomes to estimate the genetic relevance of the 14 prioritized genes to IBD-PD.The analysis of LRRK2 missense variants revealed significant associations of the G2019S and N2081D variants with IBD-PD in addition to several other variants as potential contributors to increased or decreased IBD-PD risk. SKAT-O identified two significant genes, LRRK2 and IL10RA, and NHC identified 6 significant gene clusters that are biologically relevant to IBD-PD. We observed prominent overlaps between the enriched pathways in the known IBD, PD, and candidate IBD-PD gene sets. Additionally, we detected significantly enriched pathways unique to the IBD-PD, including MAPK signaling, LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function, and NAD signaling. Fourteen final candidate IBD-PD genes were prioritized by biological relatedness methods. The biological importance scores estimated by protein-protein interaction networks and pathway and ontology enrichment analyses indicated the involvement of genes related to immunity, inflammation, and autophagy in IBD-PD. Additionally, PheWAS provided support for the associations of candidate genes with IBD and PD.Our study confirms and uncovers new LRRK2 associations in IBD-PD. The identification of novel inflammation and autophagy-related genes supports and expands previous findings related to IBD-PD pathogenesis, and underscores the significance of therapeutic interventions for reducing systemic inflammation.© 2024.

Patterns of aneuploidy differ across cancers, yet are similar in cancers affecting closely related tissues. The selection pressures underlying aneuploidy patterns are not fully understood, hindering our understanding of cancer development and progression.Here, we apply interpretable machine learning methods to study tissue-selective aneuploidy patterns. We define 20 types of features corresponding to genomic attributes of chromosome-arms, normal tissues, primary tumors, and cancer cell lines (CCLs), and use them to model gains and losses of chromosome arms in 24 cancer types. To reveal the factors that shape the tissue-specific cancer aneuploidy landscapes, we interpret the machine learning models by estimating the relative contribution of each feature to the models. While confirming known drivers of positive selection, our quantitative analysis highlights the importance of negative selection for shaping aneuploidy landscapes. This is exemplified by tumor suppressor gene density being a better predictor of gain patterns than oncogene density, and vice versa for loss patterns. We also identify the importance of tissue-selective features and demonstrate them experimentally, revealing KLF5 as an important driver for chr13q gain in colon cancer. Further supporting an important role for negative selection in shaping the aneuploidy landscapes, we find compensation by paralogs to be among the top predictors of chromosome arm loss prevalence and demonstrate this relationship for one paralog interaction.

In this study, we performed a multi-trait analysis of GWAS (MTAG) of MM, exploring overlapping genetic architecture between traits, to identify novel genetic associations for fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23).We applied MTAG to genetic variants common to GWAS of 5 genetically correlated MM markers (calcium, phosphorus, FGF23, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and parathyroid hormone (PTH)) in European-ancestry subjects. We integrated information from UKBioBank GWAS for blood levels for phosphate, 25(OH)D and calcium (n=366,484), and CHARGE GWAS for PTH (n=29,155) and FGF23 (n=16,624). We then used functional genomics to model interactive and dynamic networks to identify novel associations between genetic traits and circulating FGF23.MTAG increased the effective sample size for all MM markers to n=50,325 for FGF23. After clumping, MTAG identified independent genome-wide significant SNPs for all traits, including 62 loci for FGF23. Many of these loci have not been previously reported in single-trait analyses. Through functional genomics we identified Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) and high mobility group box 1(HMGB1) genes as master regulators of downstream canonical pathways associated with FGF23. HRG-HMGB1 network interactions were also highly enriched in left ventricular heart tissue of a cohort of deceased hemodialysis patients.Our findings highlight the importance of MTAG analysis of MM markers to boost the number of genome-wide significant loci for FGF23 to identify novel genetic traits.

38737975,Apolipoprotein A-1 downregulation promotes basal-like breast cancer cell proliferation and migration associated with DNA methylation.,Oncol Lett,"Apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) performs different roles in different subtypes of breast cancer. It is hypothesized to function as a tumor suppressor in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC). However, the specific role of APOA1 in BLBC and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The findings of the present study demonstrated a positive correlation between the expression level of APOA1 and the overall survival of patients with BLBC. Ectopic expression of APOA1 effectively inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of BLBC cellsin vitro, and these effects are closely related to DNA methylation. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report increased methylation of the promoter region and decreased methylation of the structural genes of APOA1 in BLBC cells. These alterations resulted in the downregulation of APOA1 expression and suppression of BLBC tumor growth. Collectively, the results of the present study suggested that APOA1 mRNA expression is negatively regulated by DNA methylation in BLBC. Therefore, low expression of APOA1 may be a potential risk biomarker to predict survival in patients with BLBC.Copyright: © 2024 Wang et al.",7.452836112115871e-34
38719891,Genome-wide profiling of angiogenic cis-regulatory elements unravels cis-regulatory SNPs for vascular abnormality.,Sci Data,"Angiogenesis is extensively involved in embryonic development and requires complex regulation networks, whose defects can cause a variety of vascular abnormalities. Cis-regulatory elements control gene expression at all developmental stages, but they have not been studied or profiled in angiogenesis yet. In this study, we exploited public DNase-seq and RNA-seq datasets from a VEGFA-stimulated in vitro angiogenic model, and carried out an integrated analysis of the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility across the entire process. Totally, we generated a bank of 47,125 angiogenic cis-regulatory elements with promoter (marker by H3K4me3) and/or enhancer (marker by H3K27ac) activities. Motif enrichment analysis revealed that these angiogenic cis-regulatory elements interacted preferentially with ETS family TFs. With this tool, we performed an association study using our WES data of TAPVC and identified rs199530718 as a cis-regulatory SNP associated with disease risk. Altogether, this study generated a genome-wide bank of angiogenic cis-regulatory elements and illustrated its utility in identifying novel cis-regulatory SNPs for TAPVC, expanding new horizons of angiogenesis as well as vascular abnormality genetics.© 2024.

CWAS-Plus, adapted from a Python package for category-wide association testing (CWAS) employs both whole-genome sequencing and user-provided functional data to enhance noncoding variant analysis, with a faster and more efficient execution of the CWAS workflow. Here, we used single-nuclei assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing to facilitate CWAS-guided noncoding variant analysis at cell-type specific enhancers and promoters. Examining autism spectrum disorder whole-genome sequencing data (n = 7,280), CWAS-Plus identified noncodingde novovariant associations in transcription factor binding sites within conserved loci. Independently, in Alzheimer's disease whole-genome sequencing data (n = 1,087), CWAS-Plus detected rare noncoding variant associations in microglia-specific regulatory elements.

In this study, we explored the top genomics regions and the candidate driver SNPs for selection in these two populations using newly sequenced whole-genomes of 54 highlanders and 74 lowlanders. We identified two candidate SNPs under selection - one in highlanders, associated with red blood cell traits and another in lowlanders, which is associated with white blood cell count - both potentially influencing the heart rate of Papua New Guineans in opposite directions. We also observed four candidate driver SNPs that exhibit linkage disequilibrium with an introgressed haplotype, highlighting the need to explore the possibility of adaptive introgression within these populations. This study reveals that the signatures of positive selection in highlanders and lowlanders of Papua New Guinea align closely with the challenges they face, which are specific to their environments.© 2024.

38655459,Identification of an novel genetic variant associated with osteoporosis: insights from the Taiwan Biobank Study.,JBMR Plus,"The purpose of this study was to identify new independent significant SNPs associated with osteoporosis using data from the Taiwan Biobank (TWBB).The dataset was divided into discovery (60%) and replication (40%) subsets. Following data quality control, genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis was performed, adjusting for sex, age, and the top 5 principal components, employing the Scalable and Accurate Implementation of the Generalized mixed model approach. This was followed by a meta-analysis of TWBB1 and TWBB2. The Functional Mapping and Annotation (FUMA) platform was used to identify osteoporosis-associated loci. Manhattan and quantile-quantile plots were generated using the FUMA platform to visualize the results. Independent significant SNPs were selected based on genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10-8) and independence from each other (r2 < 0.6) within a 1 Mb window. Positional, eQTL(expression quantitative trait locus), and Chromatin interaction mapping were used to map SNPs to genes.A total of 29 084 individuals (3154 osteoporosis cases and 25 930 controls) were used for GWAS analysis (TWBB1 data), and 18 918 individuals (1917 cases and 17 001 controls) were utilized for replication studies (TWBB2 data). We identified a new independent significant SNP for osteoporosis in TWBB1, with the lead SNP rs76140829 (minor allele frequency = 0.055,P-value = 1.15 × 10-08). Replication of the association was performed in TWBB2, yielding aP-value of 6.56 × 10-3. The meta-analysis of TWBB1 and TWBB2 data demonstrated a highly significant association for SNP rs76140829 (P-value = 7.52 × 10-10). In the positional mapping of rs76140829, 6 genes (HABP2,RP11-481H12.1,RNU7-165P,RP11-139 K1.2,RP11-57H14.3,and RP11-214 N15.5) were identified through chromatin interaction mapping in mesenchymal stem cells.Our GWAS analysis using the Taiwan Biobank dataset unveils rs76140829 in theVTI1Agene as a key risk variant associated with osteoporosis.

38653249,Gene-specific somatic epigenetic mosaicism of FDFT1 underlies a non-hereditary localized form of porokeratosis.,Am J Hum Genet,"Porokeratosis is a clonal keratinization disorder characterized by solitary, linearly arranged, or generally distributed multiple skin lesions. Previous studies showed that genetic alterations in MVK, PMVK, MVD, or FDPS-genes in the mevalonate pathway-cause hereditary porokeratosis, with skin lesions harboring germline and lesion-specific somatic variants on opposite alleles. Here, we identified non-hereditary porokeratosis associated with epigenetic silencing of FDFT1, another gene in the mevalonate pathway. Skin lesions of the generalized form had germline and lesion-specific somatic variants on opposite alleles in FDFT1, representing FDFT1-associated hereditary porokeratosis identified in this study. Conversely, lesions of the solitary or linearly arranged localized form had somatic bi-allelic promoter hypermethylation or mono-allelic promoter hypermethylation with somatic genetic alterations on opposite alleles in FDFT1, indicating non-hereditary porokeratosis. FDFT1 localization was uniformly diminished within the lesions, and lesion-derived keratinocytes showed cholesterol dependence for cell growth and altered expression of genes related to cell-cycle and epidermal development, confirming that lesions form by clonal expansion of FDFT1-deficient keratinocytes. In some individuals with the localized form, gene-specific promoter hypermethylation of FDFT1 was detected in morphologically normal epidermis adjacent to methylation-related lesions but not distal to these lesions, suggesting that asymptomatic somatic epigenetic mosaicism of FDFT1 predisposes certain skin areas to the disease. Finally, consistent with its genetic etiology, topical statin treatment ameliorated lesions in FDFT1-deficient porokeratosis. In conclusion, we identified bi-allelic genetic and/or epigenetic alterations of FDFT1 as a cause of porokeratosis and shed light on the pathogenesis of skin mosaicism involving clonal expansion of epigenetically altered cells.Copyright © 2024 American Society of Human Genetics.

38649186,lncRNA LINC00941 modulates MTA2/NuRD occupancy to suppress premature human epidermal differentiation.,Life Sci Alliance,"Numerous long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were shown to have a functional impact on cellular processes such as human epidermal homeostasis. However, the mechanism of action for many lncRNAs remains unclear to date. Here, we report that lncRNA LINC00941 regulates keratinocyte differentiation on an epigenetic level through association with the NuRD complex, one of the major chromatin remodelers in cells. We find that LINC00941 interacts with NuRD-associated MTA2 and CHD4 in human primary keratinocytes. LINC00941 perturbation changes MTA2/NuRD occupancy at bivalent chromatin domains in close proximity to transcriptional regulator genes, including theEGR3gene coding for a transcription factor regulating epidermal differentiation. Notably, LINC00941 depletion resulted in reduced NuRD occupancy at theEGR3gene locus, increased EGR3 expression in human primary keratinocytes, and increased abundance of EGR3-regulated epidermal differentiation genes in cells and human organotypic epidermal tissues. Our results therefore indicate a role of LINC00941/NuRD in repressing EGR3 expression in non-differentiated keratinocytes, consequentially preventing premature differentiation of human epidermal tissues.© 2024 Morgenstern et al.",1.1965952146902199e-35

To interpret their deleteriousness, studies have sought to identify regions within genes that are specifically intolerant of missense variation1-12. Here, we leverage the patterns of rare missense variation in 125,748 individuals in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)13against a null mutational model to identify transcripts that display regional differences in missense constraint. Missense-depleted regions are enriched for ClinVar14pathogenic variants,de novomissense variants from individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs)15,16, and complex trait heritability. Following ClinGen calibration recommendations for the ACMG/AMP guidelines, we establish that regions with less than 20% of their expected missense variation achieve moderate support for pathogenicity. We create a missense deleteriousness metric (MPC) that incorporates regional constraint and outperforms other deleteriousness scores at stratifying case and controlde novomissense variation, with a strong enrichment in NDDs.

After a 12-h overnight fasting, 20 mL of blood samples were collected for the measurement of fasting blood glucose and lipid profile. DNA was extracted, and the Tetra-ARMS PCR (amplification refractory mutation system) was used for genotyping of rs10789117 in the ANGPTL3 gene. The genotype frequencies of the variant of rs10789117 in the ANGPTL3 gene were estimated using χ2tests. Eventually, the statistical analysis was done by SPSS version 20.Individuals with AC/CC genotypes (rs10789117) were found to have to greater risk of CVD events compared to AA genotype (OR = 1.43, 95%CI = 1.01-2.02, p = 0.041). There was a 1.3-fold increase in cardiovascular events in individuals carrying the C allele of rs10789117 variant compared to non-carriers (OR = 1.32, 95%CI = 1.06-1.72, p value = 0.038). There were significant differences between different genotypes for serum triglyceride levels within the control group, but this difference was not significant in the group with CVD. Moreover, there was a significant association between CC genotype and CVD risk in the individuals with a normal serum HDL-C.We have found that a rs10789117 C>A in ANGPTL3 gene polymorphism was associated with incident CVD events, and this may be of value as a risk stratification biomarker in CVD in the Iranian population.© 2024 The Authors.

38608704,Chromatin context-dependent regulation and epigenetic manipulation of prime editing.,Cell,"We set out to exhaustively characterize the impact of the cis-chromatin environment on prime editing, a precise genome engineering tool. Using a highly sensitive method for mapping the genomic locations of randomly integrated reporters, we discover massive position effects, exemplified by editing efficiencies ranging from ∼0% to 94% for an identical target site and edit. Position effects on prime editing efficiency are well predicted by chromatin marks, e.g., positively by H3K79me2 and negatively by H3K9me3. Next, we developed a multiplex perturbational framework to assess the interaction of trans-acting factors with the cis-chromatin environment on editing outcomes. Applying this framework to DNA repair factors, we identify HLTF as a context-dependent repressor of prime editing. Finally, several lines of evidence suggest that active transcriptional elongation enhances prime editing. Consistent with this, we show we can robustly decrease or increase the efficiency of prime editing by preceding it with CRISPR-mediated silencing or activation, respectively.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

38604126,Human gene regulatory evolution is driven by the divergence of regulatory element function in both cis and trans.,Cell Genom,"Gene regulatory divergence between species can result from cis-acting local changes to regulatory element DNA sequences or global trans-acting changes to the regulatory environment. Understanding how these mechanisms drive regulatory evolution has been limited by challenges in identifying trans-acting changes. We present a comprehensive approach to directly identify cis- and trans-divergent regulatory elements between human and rhesus macaque lymphoblastoid cells using assay for transposase-accessible chromatin coupled to self-transcribing active regulatory region (ATAC-STARR) sequencing. In addition to thousands of cis changes, we discover an unexpected number (∼10,000) of trans changes and show that cis and trans elements exhibit distinct patterns of sequence divergence and function. We further identify differentially expressed transcription factors that underlie ∼37% of trans differences and trace how cis changes can produce cascades of trans changes. Overall, we find that most divergent elements (67%) experienced changes in both cis and trans, revealing a substantial role for trans divergence-alone and together with cis changes-in regulatory differences between species.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

38589411,Single-cell multiomics reveals the interplay of clonal evolution and cellular plasticity in hepatoblastoma.,Nat Commun,"Hepatoblastomas (HB) display heterogeneous cellular phenotypes that influence the clinical outcome, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we use a single-cell multiomic strategy to unravel the molecular determinants of this plasticity. We identify a continuum of HB cell states between hepatocytic (scH), liver progenitor (scLP) and mesenchymal (scM) differentiation poles, with an intermediate scH/LP population bordering scLP and scH areas in spatial transcriptomics. Chromatin accessibility landscapes reveal the gene regulatory networks of each differentiation pole, and the sequence of transcription factor activations underlying cell state transitions. Single-cell mapping of somatic alterations reveals the clonal architecture of each tumor, showing that each genetic subclone displays its own range of cellular plasticity across differentiation states. The most scLP subclones, overexpressing stem cell and DNA repair genes, proliferate faster after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. These results highlight how the interplay of clonal evolution and epigenetic plasticity shapes the potential of HB subclones to respond to chemotherapy.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.8609630365364453e-30

We sequenced and analyzed Oxford Nanopore long-read genomes of 68 individuals from the Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) with no previously identified diagnostic mutations from short-read sequencing. Using our optimized SV detection pipelines and 571 control long-read genomes, we detected 716 long-read rare (MAF < 0.01) SV alleles per genome on average, achieving a 2.4x increase from short-reads. To characterize the functional effects of rare SVs, we assessed their relationship with gene expression from blood or fibroblasts from the same individuals, and found that rare SVs overlapping enhancers were enriched (LOR = 0.46) near expression outliers. We also evaluated tandem repeat expansions (TREs) and found 14 rare TREs per genome; notably these TREs were also enriched near overexpression outliers. To prioritize candidate functional SVs, we developed Watershed-SV, a probabilistic model that integrates expression data with SV-specific genomic annotations, which significantly outperforms baseline models that don't incorporate expression data. Watershed-SV identified a median of eight high-confidence functional SVs per UDN genome. Notably, this included compound heterozygous deletions inFAM177A1shared by two siblings, which were likely causal for a rare neurodevelopmental disorder.

We selected candidate regions by integrating data from NPCs, prefrontal cortex, developmental timepoints, and GWAS. Over 8,000 regions demonstrated enhancer activity in the phNPCs, and we linked these regions to over 2,200 predicted target genes. These genes are involved in neuronal and psychiatric disease-associated pathways, including dopaminergic synapse, axon guidance, and schizophrenia. We functionally validated a subset of these enhancers using mutation STARR-sequencing and CRISPR deletions, demonstrating the effects of genetic variation on enhancer activity and enhancer deletion on gene expression.

We further show that the association signal appears driven by variants from male proband-female sibling pairs that are upstream of assigned genes. We then develop Expression Neighborhood Sequence Association Study (ENSAS), which utilizes gene expression correlations and sequence information, to more systematically identify phenotype-associated variant sets. Applying ENSAS to the same set ofde novovariants, we identify gene expression-based neighborhoods showing significant ASD association signal, enriched for synapse-related gene ontology terms. For these top neighborhoods, we also identify chromatin states annotations of variants that are predictive of the proband-sibling local GC content differences.

APOBEC-associated mutations were detected in 92% of mUCs and were equally distributed across the genome, while APOBEC hotspot mutations (ApoHMs) were enriched in open chromatin. Hairpin loops were frequent targets of didymi (twins in Greek), two hotspot mutations characterized by the APOBEC SBS2 signature, in conjunction with an uncharacterized mutational context (Ap[C>T]). Next, we developed a statistical framework that identified ApoHMs as drivers in coding and non-coding genomic regions of mUCs.

However, the specificity of genome-wide eQTL identification is limited by stringent control for false discoveries. Here, we described a method based on the non-homogeneous Poisson process to identify 125 489 regions with highly frequent, multiple eQTL associations, or 'eQTL-hotspots', from the public database of 59 human tissues or cell types. We stratified the eQTL-hotspots into two classes with their distinct sequence and epigenomic characteristics. Based on these classifications, we developed a machine-learning model, E-SpotFinder, for augmented discovery of tissue- or cell-type-specific eQTL-hotspots. We applied this model to 36 tissues or cell types. Using augmented eQTL-hotspots, we recovered 655 402 eSNPs and reconstructed a comprehensive regulatory network of 2 725 380 cis-interactions among eQTL-hotspots. We further identified 52 012 modules representing transcriptional programs with unique functional backgrounds.

We have conducted the largest study of site-specific 5hmC in placenta to date using parallel bisulphite and oxidative bisulphite modification with array-based assessment. Incorporating parallel RNA-sequencing data allowed us to assess associations between 5hmC and gene expression, using expression quantitative trait hydroxymethylation (eQTHM) analysis. We identified ~ 47,000 loci with consistently elevated (systematic) 5hmC proportions. Systematic 5hmC was significantly depleted (p < 0.0001) at CpG islands (CGI), and enriched (p < 0.0001) in 'open sea' regions (CpG >4 kb from CGI). 5hmC was most and least abundant at CpGs in enhancers and active transcription start sites (TSS), respectively (p < 0.05). We identified 499 significant (empirical-p <0.05) eQTHMs within 1 MB of the assayed gene. At most (75.4%) eQTHMs, the proportion of 5hmC was positively correlated with transcript abundance. eQTHMs were significantly enriched among enhancer CpGs and depleted among CpGs in active TSS (p < 0.05 for both).

38727273,Differentiation and Regulation of Bovine Th2 Cells In Vitro.,Cells,"Bovine Th2 cells have usually been characterized by IL4 mRNA expression, but it is unclear whether their IL4 protein expression corresponds to transcription. We found that grass-fed healthy beef cattle, which had been regularly exposed to parasites on the grass, had a low frequency of IL4+ Th2 cells during flow cytometry, similar to animals grown in feedlots. To assess the distribution of IL4+ CD4+ T cells across tissues, samples from the blood, spleen, abomasal (draining), and inguinal lymph nodes were examined, which revealed limited IL4 protein detection in the CD4+ T cells across the examined tissues. To determine if bovine CD4+ T cells may develop into Th2 cells, naïve cells were stimulated with anti-bovine CD3 under a Th2 differentiation kit in vitro. The cells produced primarily IFNγ proteins, with only a small fraction (<10%) co-expressing IL4 proteins. Quantitative PCR confirmed elevated IFNγ transcription but no significant change in IL4 transcription. Surprisingly, GATA3, the master regulator of IL4, was highest in naïve CD4+ T cells but was considerably reduced following differentiation. To determine if the differentiated cells were true Th2 cells, an unbiased proteomic assay was carried out. The assay identified 4212 proteins, 422 of which were differently expressed compared to those in naïve cells. Based on these differential proteins, Th2-related upstream components were predicted, including CD3, CD28, IL4, and IL33, demonstrating typical Th2 differentiation. To boost IL4 expression, T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation strength was reduced by lowering anti-CD3 concentrations. Consequently, weak TCR stimulation essentially abolished Th2 expansion and survival. In addition, extra recombinant bovine IL4 (rbIL4) was added during Th2 differentiation, but, despite enhanced expansion, the IL4 level remained unaltered. These findings suggest that, while bovine CD4+ T cells can respond to Th2 differentiation stimuli, the bovine IL4 pathway is not regulated in the same way as in mice and humans. Furthermore,Ostertagia ostertagi(OO) extract, a gastrointestinal nematode in cattle, inhibited signaling via CD3, CD28, IL4, and TLRs/MYD88, indicating that external pathogens can influence bovine Th2 differentiation. In conclusion, though bovine CD4+ T cells can respond to IL4-driven differentiation, IL4 expression is not a defining feature of differentiated bovine Th2 cells.",4.179827500052746e-68

Of these, 52.2 % were female and 72.9 % were non-Hispanic whites. The optimal cutoff value of serum α-klotho for predicting all-cause mortality risk in the general population was 603.5 pg/ml. Individuals with low serum α-klotho (<603.5 pg/ml) had a significantly higher risk of all-cause (adjusted HR: 1.34(1.18-1.52), P < 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR: 1.63(1.27-2.10), P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that low serum α-klotho level was an independent risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in people with hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and emphysema, while it was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with renal insufficiency.A low serum α-klotho concentration (<603.5 pg/ml) could serve as a marker of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the general population and in people with age-related diseases, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and emphysema.© 2024 The Authors.

38717999,HIF3A gene disruption causes abnormal alveoli structure and early neonatal death.,PLoS One,"Transcriptional response to changes in oxygen concentration is mainly controlled by hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). Besides regulation of hypoxia-responsible gene expression, HIF-3α has recently been shown to be involved in lung development and in the metabolic process of fat tissue. However, the precise mechanism for such properties of HIF-3α is still largely unknown. To this end, we generated HIF3A gene-disrupted mice by means of genome editing technology to explore the pleiotropic role of HIF-3α in development and physiology. We obtained adult mice carrying homozygous HIF3A gene mutations with comparable body weight and height to wild-type mice. However, the number of litters and ratio of homozygous mutation carriers born from the mating between homozygous mutant mice was lower than expected due to sporadic deaths on postnatal day 1. HIF3A gene-disrupted mice exhibited abnormal configuration of the lung such as a reduced number of alveoli and thickened alveolar walls. Transcriptome analysis showed, as well as genes associated with lung development, an upregulation of stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase 1, a pivotal enzyme for fatty acid metabolism. Analysis of fatty acid composition in the lung employing gas chromatography indicated an elevation in palmitoleic acid and a reduction in oleic acid, suggesting an imbalance in distribution of fatty acid, a constituent of lung surfactant. Accordingly, administration of glucocorticoid injections during pregnancy resulted in a restoration of normal alveolar counts and a decrease in neonatal mortality. In conclusion, these observations provide novel insights into a pivotal role of HIF-3α in the preservation of critically important structure and function of alveoli beyond the regulation of hypoxia-mediated gene expression.Copyright: © 2024 Kawahata et al.

38533302,Biomedicines in Longevity and Aging the Quest to Resist Biological Decline.,Biomedicine (Taipei),"Aging is considered part of the natural process of life, however in recent years medical literature has started to show that specific facets of aging are beginning to be understood and those factors may even be considered preventable with various measures. Aging is also considered the number one cause of poor quality of life, disease, disability, and death, so the importance of understanding the aging process and how to control certain aspects of it cannot be underestimated when age related suffering is factored in. The causes of aging are now becoming well understood, and in recent years many therapies have already become available to the public to attenuate specific corridors of aging. The heterogeneity of the aging process and the biological drivers involved is examined here in parallel with various compounds and therapies to combat biological decline. The benefits for governments in keeping their populations healthy and vibrant are vast, and at the same time offer a great incentive to invest into newly emerging technologies that may prevent the onset of preventable disease. Whilst this paper only discusses nine pathways to the aging process, many more exist.© the Author(s).",6.195383491186825e-23
38545181,Integrated genomic and proteomic analyses identify PYGL as a novel experimental therapeutic target for clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,Heliyon,"Sunitinib, the first-line targeted therapy for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), faces a significant challenge as most patients develop acquired resistance. Integrated genomic and proteomic analyses identified PYGL as a novel therapeutic target for ccRCC. PYGL knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, cloning capacity, migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis in ccRCC cell lines. PYGL expression was increased in sunitinib-resistant ccRCC cell lines, and CP-91149 targeting the PYGL could restore drug sensitivity in these cell lines. Moreover, chromatin immune-precipitation assays revealed that PYGL upregulation is induced by the transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α. Overall, PYGL was identified as a novel diagnostic biomarker by combining genomic and proteomic approaches in ccRCC, and sunitinib resistance to ccRCC may be overcome by targeting PYGL.© 2024 The Authors.",8.170363600448059e-41
38708513,[Correlation between insulin resistance and coronary collateral circulation in patients with chronic total coronary occlusion].,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,"To explore the impact of diabetes on collateral circulation (CC) development in patients with chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) and the underlying regulatory mechanism.This study was conducted among 87 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), who had CTO in at least one vessel as confirmed by coronary angiography. Among them 42 patients were found to have a low CC level (Cohen-Rentrop grades 0-1) and 45 had a high CC level (grades 2-3). In the 39 patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus and 48 non-diabetic patients, insulin resistance (IR) levels were compared between the subgroups with different CC levels. The steady-state mode evaluation method was employed for calculating the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) using a mathematical model. During the interventional procedures, collateral and peripheral blood samples were collected from 22 patients for comparison of the metabolites using non-targeted metabolomics analysis.NT-proBNP levels and LVEF differed significantly between the patients with different CC levels (P<0.05). In non-diabetic patients, HOMA-IR was higher in low CC level group than in high CC level groups. Compared with the non-diabetic patients, the diabetic patients showed 63 upregulated and 48 downregulated metabolites in the collateral blood and 23 upregulated and 14 downregulated metabolites in the peripheral blood. The differential metabolites in the collateral blood were involved in aromatic compound degradation, fatty acid biosynthesis, and steroid degradation pathways; those in the peripheral blood were related with pentose phosphate metabolism, bacterial chemotaxis, hexanoyl-CoA degradation, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and lysine degradation pathways.The non-diabetic patients with a low level of CC had significant insulin resistance. The degradation pathways of aromatic compounds, fatty acid biosynthesis, and steroid degradation are closely correlated with the development of CC.",1.610240039679206e-38
38532888,Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing identifies stage- and subtype-specific DNA methylation signatures in pancreatic cancer.,iScience,"In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), no recurrent metastasis-specific mutation has been found, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, are the major contributors of late-stage disease progression. Here, we performed the first whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on mouse and human PDAC organoid models to identify stage-specific and molecular subtype-specific DNA methylation signatures. With this approach, we identified thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that can distinguish between the stages and molecular subtypes of PDAC. Stage-specific DMRs are associated with genes related to nervous system development and cell-cell adhesions, and are enriched in promoters and bivalent enhancers. Subtype-specific DMRs showed hypermethylation of GATA6 foregut endoderm transcriptional networks in the squamous subtype and hypermethylation of EMT transcriptional networks in the progenitor subtype. These results indicate that aberrant DNA methylation contributes to both PDAC progression and subtype differentiation, resulting in significant and reoccurring DNA methylation patterns with diagnostic and prognostic potential.© 2024 The Author(s).",2.374612504158512e-29
38554150,Genetic forms of tauopathies: inherited causes and implications of Alzheimer's disease-like TAU pathology in primary and secondary tauopathies.,J Neurol,"Tauopathies are a heterogeneous group of neurologic diseases characterized by pathological axodendritic distribution, ectopic expression, and/or phosphorylation and aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein TAU, encoded by the gene MAPT. Neuronal dysfunction, dementia, and neurodegeneration are common features of these often detrimental diseases. A neurodegenerative disease is considered a primary tauopathy when MAPT mutations/haplotypes are its primary cause and/or TAU is the main pathological feature. In case TAU pathology is observed but superimposed by another pathological hallmark, the condition is classified as a secondary tauopathy. In some tauopathies (e.g. MAPT-associated frontotemporal dementia (FTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD)) TAU is recognized as a significant pathogenic driver of the disease. In many secondary tauopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Huntington's disease (HD), TAU is suggested to contribute to the development of dementia, but in others (e.g. Niemann-Pick disease (NPC)) TAU may only be a bystander. The genetic and pathological mechanisms underlying TAU pathology are often not fully understood. In this review, the genetic predispositions and variants associated with both primary and secondary tauopathies are examined in detail, assessing evidence for the role of TAU in these conditions. We highlight less common genetic forms of tauopathies to increase awareness for these disorders and the involvement of TAU in their pathology. This approach not only contributes to a deeper understanding of these conditions but may also lay the groundwork for potential TAU-based therapeutic interventions for various tauopathies.© 2024.

38726308,Epigenetic modifications of DNA and RNA in Alzheimer's disease.,Front Mol Neurosci,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia. There are two main types of AD: familial and sporadic. Familial AD is linked to mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2). On the other hand, sporadic AD is the more common form of the disease and has genetic, epigenetic, and environmental components that influence disease onset and progression. Investigating the epigenetic mechanisms associated with AD is essential for increasing understanding of pathology and identifying biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment. Chemical covalent modifications on DNA and RNA can epigenetically regulate gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and play protective or pathological roles in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.Copyright © 2024 Martinez-Feduchi, Jin and Yao.",1.0145620420166934e-26

38499720,Dnmt3a1 regulates hippocampus-dependent memory via the downstream target Nrp1.,Neuropsychopharmacology,"Epigenetic factors are well-established players in memory formation. Specifically, DNA methylation is necessary for the formation of long-term memory in multiple brain regions including the hippocampus. Despite the demonstrated role of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) in memory formation, it is unclear whether individual Dnmts have unique or redundant functions in long-term memory formation. Furthermore, the downstream processes controlled by Dnmts during memory consolidation have not been investigated. In this study, we demonstrated that Dnmt3a1, the predominant Dnmt in the adult brain, is required for long-term spatial object recognition and contextual fear memory. Using RNA sequencing, we identified an activity-regulated Dnmt3a1-dependent genomic program in which several genes were associated with functional and structural plasticity. Furthermore, we found that some of the identified genes are selectively dependent on Dnmt3a1, but not its isoform Dnmt3a2. Specifically, we identified Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) as a downstream target of Dnmt3a1 and further demonstrated the involvement of Nrp1 in hippocampus-dependent memory formation. Importantly, we found that Dnmt3a1 regulates hippocampus-dependent memory via Nrp1. In contrast, Nrp1 overexpression did not rescue memory impairments triggered by reduced Dnmt3a2 levels. Taken together, our study uncovered a Dnmt3a-isoform-specific mechanism in memory formation, identified a novel regulator of memory, and further highlighted the complex and highly regulated functions of distinct epigenetic regulators in brain function.© 2024.

38577817,Trauma context exerts intergenerational effects on child mental health via DNA methylation.,Epigenetics,"Many people experience traumatic or negative events, but few develop mental health issues as a result. This study investigated whether newborn DNA methylation (DNAm) previously associated with maternal childhood physical abuse by her father affected the child's mental health and physical growth, as well as whether it mediated or moderated developmental outcomes.Study sample (N = 903) and data came from Bristol University's Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. DNAm was measured in cord blood at birth. DNAm data was preprocessed, normalized, and quality controlled before subsetting to 60 CpG sites of interest from previous research. Linear regression analysis examined newborn DNAm and child development outcome associations. Sobel test examined the mediating relationship between mother's history of childhood abuse by father, newborn targeted gene DNAm of significant CpG sites, and child's mental health and physical growth. Moderation analyses examined the interaction effects between the significant CpG sites and mothers' physical abuse by their fathers on child's mental health and physical growth.Full cohort analyses showed that newborn DNAm of several different CpG sites associates with separation anxiety, fear, and unhappy/tearful presentations in children aged 6-7 y. Sex-specific associations emerged with boys showing associations with anxiety and fear, and girls showing associations with fear and unhappiness. In boys only, cord blood DNAm mediates the effect of maternal childhood trauma on offspring mental health. No moderation effects emerged.Intergenerational effects of mother's relationship to her abuser present in newborn DNAm associate with 7-year-old child's mental health, show sex-specific effects, and newborn DNAm does mediate maternal childhood trauma effects on offspring mental health in early-life.",1.0
38693466,Using non-invasive behavioral and physiological data to measure biological age in wild baboons.,Geroscience,"Biological aging is near-ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, but its timing and pace vary between individuals and over lifespans. Prospective, individual-based studies of wild animals-especially non-human primates-help identify the social and environmental drivers of this variation by indicating the conditions and exposure windows that affect aging processes. However, measuring individual biological age in wild primates is challenging because several of the most promising methods require invasive sampling. Here, we leverage observational data on behavior and physiology, collected non-invasively from 319 wild female baboons across 2402 female-years of study, to develop a composite predictor of age: the non-invasive physiology and behavior (NPB) clock. We found that age predictions from the NPB clock explained 51% of the variation in females' known ages. Further, deviations from the clock's age predictions predicted female survival: females predicted to be older than their known ages had higher adult mortality. Finally, females who experienced harsh early-life conditions were predicted to be about 6 months older than those who grew up in more benign conditions. While the relationship between early adversity and NPB age is noisy, this estimate translates to a predicted 2-3 year reduction in mean adult lifespan in our model. A constraint of our clock is that it is tailored to data collection approaches implemented in our study population. However, many of the clock's components have analogs in other populations, suggesting that non-invasive data can provide broadly applicable insight into heterogeneity in biological age in natural populations.© 2024.

38574017,Aflatoxin B1 and Epstein-Barr virus-induced CCL22 expression stimulates B cell infection.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infects more than 90% of the adult population worldwide. EBV infection is associated with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) though alone is not sufficient to induce carcinogenesis implying the involvement of co-factors. BL is endemic in African regions faced with mycotoxins exposure. Exposure to mycotoxins and oncogenic viruses has been shown to increase cancer risks partly through the deregulation of the immune response. A recent transcriptome profiling of B cells exposed to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) revealed an upregulation of the Chemokine ligand 22 (CCL22) expression although the underlying mechanisms were not investigated. Here, we tested whether mycotoxins and EBV exposure may together contribute to endemic BL (eBL) carcinogenesis via immunomodulatory mechanisms involving CCL22. Our results revealed that B cells exposure to AFB1 and EBV synergistically stimulated CCL22 secretion via the activation of Nuclear Factor-kappa B pathway. By expressing EBV latent genes in B cells, we revealed that elevated levels of CCL22 result not only from the expression of the latent membrane protein LMP1 as previously reported but also from the expression of other viral latent genes. Importantly, CCL22 overexpression resulting from AFB1-exposure in vitro increased EBV infection through the activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathway. Moreover, inhibiting CCL22 in vitro and in humanized mice in vivo limited EBV infection and decreased viral genes expression, supporting the notion that CCL22 overexpression plays an important role in B cell infection. These findings unravel new mechanisms that may underpin eBL development and identify novel pathways that can be targeted in drug development.",8.905551667152929e-58
38631091,Impact of ambient air pollution on colorectal cancer risk and survival: insights from a prospective cohort and epigenetic Mendelian randomization study.,EBioMedicine,"This study investigates the associations between air pollution and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and survival from an epigenomic perspective.Using a newly developed Air Pollutants Exposure Score (APES), we utilized a prospective cohort study (UK Biobank) to investigate the associations of individual and combined air pollution exposures with CRC incidence and survival, followed by an up-to-date systematic review with meta-analysis to verify the associations. In epigenetic two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses, we examine the associations between genetically predicted DNA methylation related to air pollution and CRC risk. Further genetic colocalization and gene-environment interaction analyses provided different insights to disentangle pathogenic effects of air pollution via epigenetic modification.During a median 12.97-year follow-up, 5767 incident CRC cases among 428,632 participants free of baseline CRC and 533 deaths in 2401 patients with CRC were documented in the UK Biobank. A higher APES score was associated with an increased CRC risk (HR, 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01-1.06; P = 0.016) and poorer survival (HR, 1.13, 95% CI = 1.03-1.23; P = 0.010), particularly among participants with insufficient physical activity and ever smokers (Pinteraction> 0.05). A subsequent meta-analysis of seven observational studies, including UK Biobank data, corroborated the association between PM2.5exposure (per 10 μg/m3increment) and elevated CRC risk (RR,1.42, 95% CI = 1.12-1.79; P = 0.004; I2 = 90.8%). Genetically predicted methylation at PM2.5-related CpG site cg13835894 near TMBIM1/PNKD and cg16235962 near CXCR5, and NO2-related cg16947394 near TMEM110 were associated with an increased CRC risk. Gene-environment interaction analysis confirmed the epigenetic modification of aforementioned CpG sites with CRC risk and survival.Our study suggests the association between air pollution and CRC incidence and survival, underscoring the possible modifying roles of epigenomic factors.

A prospective cohort study.,BMC Oral Health,"To compare presence and levels of serum cytokines in smokers and non-smokers with periodontitis following periodontal therapy.Thirty heavy smokers and 30 non-smokers with stage III or IV periodontitis were included in this prospective cohort study. Clinical data and blood serum were collected at baseline (T0), after step I-III (T1), and after 12 months step IV periodontal therapy (T2). Cytokine IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-10, and IP-10 levels were measured using multiplex kit Bio-Plex Human Pro™ Assay. Linear regression models with cluster robust variance estimates to adjust for repeated observations were used to test intra- and intergroup levels for each marker, IL-6 and IL-8 defined as primary outcomes.Clinical outcomes improved in both groups following therapy (p < 0.05). IL-6 levels increased with 75.0% from T0-T2 among smokers (p = 0.004). No significant intra- or intergroup differences were observed for IL-8. Higher levels of TNF-α (44.1%) and IL-10 (50.6%) were detected in smokers compared with non-smokers at T1 (p = 0.007 and p = 0.037, respectively). From T1-T2, differences in mean change over time for levels of TNF-α and IL-10 were observed in smokers compared with non-smokers (p = 0.005 and p = 0.008, respectively).Upregulated levels of serum cytokines in smokers indicate a systemic effect of smoking following periodontal therapy.

Patients positive for anti-SSA or/and anti-SSB were termed as seropositive pSS, and these negative for both anti-SSA and anti-SSB (non-antinuclear antibodies) as seronegative pSS. Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings were compared between the two groups.Among the 232 patients with pSS, 192 (82.8%) were seropositive pSS and 40 (17.2%) were seronegative pSS. Compared to seropositive pSS, seronegative pSS were older and with higher percentage of low disease activity (ESSDAI < 5), xerostomia and xerophthalmia, with higher platelet count and level of creatine kinase. This subgroup was with lower levels of gamma globulin, immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin A and autoantibodies including rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody in serum, and less immunoglobulin G deposition in labial gland.Seronegative pSS was a distinct subtype of pSS different from seropositive pSS. Clinical manifestations in seronegative pSS subgroup were restricted to exocrine gland and less B lymphocyte activation, while seropositive pSS were prone to present with systemic involvement and high disease activity. Specific underlying pathogenesis mechanisms and therapeutic strategies in this subgroup needed to be further studied.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.2305938780196059e-49
38617282,Microglia and macrophages alterations in the CNS during acute SIV infection: a single-cell analysis in rhesus macaques.,bioRxiv,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is widely acknowledged for its profound impact on the immune system. Although HIV primarily affects peripheral CD4 T cells, its influence on the central nervous system (CNS) cannot be overlooked. Within the brain, microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs) serve as the primary targets for HIV, as well as for the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in nonhuman primates. This infection can lead to neurological effects and the establishment of a viral reservoir. Given the gaps in our understanding of how these cells respondin vivoto acute CNS infection, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on myeloid cells from the brains of three rhesus macaques 12-days after SIV infection, along with three uninfected controls. Our analysis revealed six distinct microglial clusters including homeostatic microglia, preactivated microglia, and activated microglia expressing high levels of inflammatory and disease-related molecules. In response to acute SIV infection, the population of homeostatic and preactivated microglia decreased, while the activated and disease-related microglia increased. All microglial clusters exhibited upregulation of MHC class I molecules and interferon-related genes, indicating their crucial roles in defending against SIV during the acute phase. All microglia clusters also upregulated genes linked to cellular senescence. Additionally, we identified two distinct CAM populations: CD14lowCD16hiand CD14hiCD16lowCAMs. Interestingly, during acute SIV infection, the dominant CAM population changed to one with an inflammatory phenotype. Notably, specific upregulated genes within one microglia and one macrophage cluster were associated with neurodegenerative pathways, suggesting potential links to neurocognitive disorders. This research sheds light on the intricate interactions between viral infection, innate immune responses, and the CNS, providing valuable insights for future investigations.",2.3743557471074193e-76

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,"This systematic review aims to identify the association between prenatal exposure to air pollutants and allergic diseases in children, focusing on specific pollutants, timing of exposure, and associated diseases. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for English articles until May 1, 2023, examining maternal exposure to outdoor air pollutants (PM1, PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) during pregnancy and child allergic diseases (atopic dermatitis (AD), food allergy (FA), asthma (AT) and allergic rhinitis (AR)/hay fever (HF)). The final 38 eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis. Exposure to PM2.5and NO2during pregnancy was associated with the risk of childhood AD, with pooled ORs of 1.34 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-1.63) and 1.10 (95%CI, 1.05-1.15) per 10 µg/m3increase, respectively. Maternal exposure to PM1, PM2.5, and NO2with a 10 µg/m3increase posed a risk for AT, with pooled ORs of 1.34 (95%CI, 1.17-1.54), 1.11 (95%CI, 1.05-1.18), and 1.07 (95%CI, 1.02-1.12), respectively. An increased risk of HF was observed for PM2.5and NO2with a 10 µg/m3increase, with ORs of 1.36 (95%CI, 1.17-1.58) and 1.26 (95%CI, 1.08-1.48), respectively. Traffic-related air pollutants (TRAP), particularly PM2.5and NO2, throughout pregnancy, pose a pervasive risk for childhood allergies. Different pollutants may induce diverse allergic diseases in children across varying perinatal periods. AT is more likely to be induced by outdoor air pollutants as a health outcome. More research is needed to explore links between air pollution and airway-derived food allergies.© 2024.

We apply nanopore direct RNA sequencing to investigate psi dynamics under cellular perturbations in SH-SY5Y cells. We assign sites to psi synthases using siRNA-based knockdown. A steady-state enzyme-substrate model reveals a strong correlation between psi synthase and mRNA substrate levels and psi modification frequencies. Next, we performed either differentiation or lead-exposure to SH-SY5Y cells and found that, upon lead exposure, not differentiation, the modification frequency is less dependent on enzyme levels suggesting translational control. Finally, we compared the plasticity of psi sites across cellular states and found that plastic sites can be condition-dependent or condition-independent; several of these sites fall within transcripts encoding proteins involved in neuronal processes.

38602745,Fetal influence on the human brain through the lifespan.,Elife,"Human fetal development has been associated with brain health at later stages. It is unknown whether growth in utero, as indexed by birth weight (BW), relates consistently to lifespan brain characteristics and changes, and to what extent these influences are of a genetic or environmental nature. Here we show remarkably stable and lifelong positive associations between BW and cortical surface area and volume across and within developmental, aging and lifespan longitudinal samples (N = 5794, 4-82 y of age, w/386 monozygotic twins, followed for up to 8.3 y w/12,088 brain MRIs). In contrast, no consistent effect of BW on brain changes was observed. Partly environmental effects were indicated by analysis of twin BW discordance. In conclusion, the influence of prenatal growth on cortical topography is stable and reliable through the lifespan. This early-life factor appears to influence the brain by association of brain reserve, rather than brain maintenance. Thus, fetal influences appear omnipresent in the spacetime of the human brain throughout the human lifespan. Optimizing fetal growth may increase brain reserve for life, also in aging.© 2023, Walhovd et al.",9.195187816585048e-11

However, the mechanism of the deletion of LRG1 from endothelial cells rescued by cigarette smoke (CS) induced emphysema remains unclear.

The emphysema mouse model defined as the CS exposure group was induced by CS exposure plus cigarette smoke extract (CSE) intraperitoneal injection for 28 days. Primary PMVECs were isolated from the mouse by magnetic bead sorting method via CD31-Dynabeads. Apoptosis was detected by western blot and flow cytometry.LRG1 was increased in lung tissue of COPD patients and CS exposure mice, and CSE-induced PMVECs apoptosis model. KLK10 was over-expressed in lung tissue of COPD patients and CS exposure mice, and CSE-induced PMVECs apoptosis model. LRG1 promoted apoptosis in PMVECs. LRG1 knockdown reversed CSE-induced apoptosis in PMVECs. The mRNA and protein expression of KLK10 were increased after over-expressed LRG1 in PMVECs isolated from mice. Similarly, both the mRNA and protein levels of KLK10 were decreased after LRG1 knockdown in PMVECs. The result of co-immunoprecipitation revealed a protein-protein interaction between LRG1 and KLK10 in PMVECs. KLK10 promoted apoptosis via the down-regulation of Bcl-2/Bax in PMVECs. KLK10 knockdown could reverse CSE-induced apoptosis in PMVECs.LRG1 promotes apoptosis via up-regulation of KLK10 in PMVECs isolated from mice. KLK10 promotes apoptosis via the down-regulation of Bcl-2/Bax in PMVECs. There was a direct protein-protein interaction between LRG1 and KLK10 in PMVECs. Our novel findings provide insights into the understanding of LRG1/KLK10 function as a potential molecule in COPD.© 2024 Cheng W. et al.",1.2974558421751704e-57
38586284,Elevated risk for psychiatric outcomes in pediatric patients with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C): A review of neuroinflammatory and psychosocial stressors.,Brain Behav Immun Health,"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a secondary immune manifestation of COVID-19 involving multiple organ systems in the body, resulting in fever, skin rash, abdominal pain, nausea, shock, and cardiac dysfunction that often lead to hospitalization. Although many of these symptoms resolve following anti-inflammatory treatment, the long-term neurological and psychiatric sequelae of MIS-C are unknown. In this review, we will summarize two domains of the MIS-C disease course, 1) Neuroinflammation in the MIS-C brain and 2) Psychosocial disruptions resulting from stress and hospitalization. In both domains, we present existing clinical findings and hypothesize potential connections to psychiatric outcomes. This is the first review to conceptualize a holistic framework of psychiatric risk in MIS-C patients that includes neuroinflammatory and psychosocial risk factors. As cases of severe COVID-19 and MIS-C subside, it is important for clinicians to monitor outcomes in this vulnerable patient population.© 2024 The Authors.",1.1522337530772837e-29
38503928,Associations of altered leukocyte DDR1 promoter methylation and childhood trauma with bipolar disorder and suicidal behavior in euthymic patients.,Mol Psychiatry,"Altered DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) have been found in the blood and brain of patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and the brain of patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Childhood trauma (CT) is associated with changes in DNAm that in turn are related to suicidal behavior (SB) in patients with several psychiatric disorders. Here, using MassARRAY® technology, we studied 128 patients diagnosed with BD in remission and 141 healthy controls (HCs) to compare leukocyte DDR1 promoter DNAm patterns between patients and HCs and between patients with and without SB. Additionally, we investigated whether CT was associated with DDR1 DNAm and mediated SB. We found hypermethylation at DDR1 cg19215110 and cg23953820 sites and hypomethylation at cg14279856 and cg03270204 sites in patients with BD compared to HCs. Logistic regression models showed that hypermethylation of DDR1 cg23953820 but not cg19215110 and CT were risk factors for BD, while cg14279856 and cg03270204 hypomethylation were protective factors. In patients, CT was a risk factor for SB, but DDR1 DNAm, although associated with CT, did not mediate the association of CT with SB. This is the first study demonstrating altered leukocyte DDR1 promoter DNAm in euthymic patients with BD. We conclude that altered DDR1 DNAm may be related to immune and inflammatory mechanisms and could be a potential blood biomarker for the diagnosis and stratification of psychiatric patients.© 2024.

38523457,"Firefighting, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, and DNA methylation of genes associated with prostate cancer risk.",Environ Mol Mutagen,"Prostate cancer is the leading incident cancer among men in the United States. Firefighters are diagnosed with this disease at a rate 1.21 times higher than the average population. This increased risk may result from occupational exposures to many toxicants, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This study assessed the association between firefighting as an occupation in general or PFAS serum levels, with DNA methylation. Only genomic regions previously linked to prostate cancer risk were selected for analysis: GSTP1, Alu repetitive elements, and the 8q24 chromosomal region. There were 444 male firefighters included in this study, with some analyses being conducted on fewer participants due to missingness. Statistical models were used to test associations between exposures and DNA methylation at CpG sites in the selected genomic regions. Exposure variables included proxies of cumulative firefighting exposures (incumbent versus academy status and years of firefighting experience) and biomarkers of PFAS exposures (serum concentrations of 9 PFAS). Proxies of cumulative exposures were associated with DNA methylation at 15 CpG sites and one region located within FAM83A (q-value <0.1). SbPFOA was associated with 19 CpG sites (q < 0.1), but due to low detection rates, this PFAS was modeled as detected versus not detected in serum. Overall, there is evidence that firefighting experience is associated with differential DNA methylation in prostate cancer risk loci, but this study did not find evidence that these differences are due to PFAS exposures specifically.© 2024 The Authors.

38528056,DNA methylation profiling in Kabuki syndrome: reclassification of germline KMT2D VUS and sensitivity in validating postzygotic mosaicism.,Eur J Hum Genet,"Autosomal dominant Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare multiple congenital anomalies/neurodevelopmental disorder caused by heterozygous inactivating variants or structural rearrangements of the lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) gene. While it is often recognizable due to a distinctive gestalt, the disorder is clinically variable, and a phenotypic scoring system has been introduced to help clinicians to reach a clinical diagnosis. The phenotype, however, can be less pronounced in some patients, including those carrying postzygotic mutations. The full spectrum of pathogenic variation in KMT2D has not fully been characterized, which may hamper the clinical classification of a portion of these variants. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiling has successfully been used as a tool to classify variants in genes associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders, including KS. In this work, we applied a KS-specific DNAm signature in a cohort of 13 individuals with KMT2D VUS and clinical features suggestive or overlapping with KS. We succeeded in correctly classifying all the tested individuals, confirming diagnosis for three subjects and rejecting the pathogenic role of 10 VUS in the context of KS. In the latter group, exome sequencing allowed to identify the genetic cause underlying the disorder in three subjects. By testing five individuals with postzygotic pathogenic KMT2D variants, we also provide evidence that DNAm profiling has power to recognize pathogenic variants at different levels of mosaicism, identifying 15% as the minimum threshold for which DNAm profiling can be applied as an informative diagnostic tool in KS mosaics.© 2024.

Here, we present whole tumor RNA sequencing data in the context of treatment with ICB in murine models of AB1 mesothelioma and Renca renal cell cancer. We sequenced 144 bulk RNAseq samples from these two cancer types across 4 time points prior and after treatment with ICB. We also performed single-cell sequencing on 12 samples of AB1 and Renca tumors an hour before ICB administration. Our samples were equally distributed between responders and non-responders to treatment. Additionally, we sequenced AB1-HA mesothelioma tumors treated with two sample dissociation protocols to assess the impact of these protocols on the quality transcriptional information in our samples. These datasets provide time-course information to transcriptionally characterize the ICB response and provide detailed information at the single-cell level of the early tumor microenvironment prior to ICB therapy.© 2024.

38659747,Genetic context modulates aging and degeneration in the murine retina.,bioRxiv,"Age is the principal risk factor for neurodegeneration in both the retina and brain. The retina and brain share many biological properties; thus, insights into retinal aging and degeneration may shed light onto similar processes in the brain. Genetic makeup strongly influences susceptibility to age-related retinal disease. However, studies investigating retinal aging have not sufficiently accounted for genetic diversity. Therefore, examining molecular aging in the retina across different genetic backgrounds will enhance our understanding of human-relevant aging and degeneration in both the retina and brain-potentially improving therapeutic approaches to these debilitating conditions.Transcriptomics and proteomics were employed to elucidate retinal aging signatures in nine genetically diverse mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvlmJ, NZO/HlLtJ, WSB/EiJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhK, NOD/ShiLtJ, A/J, and BALB/cJ) across lifespan. These data predicted human disease-relevant changes in WSB and NZO strains. Accordingly, B6, WSB and NZO mice were subjected to human-relevantin vivoexaminations at 4, 8, 12, and/or 18M, including: slit lamp, fundus imaging, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and pattern/full-field electroretinography. Retinal morphology, vascular structure, and cell counts were assessedex vivo.We identified common molecular aging signatures across the nine mouse strains, which included genes associated with photoreceptor function and immune activation. Genetic background strongly modulated these aging signatures. Analysis of cell type-specific marker genes predicted age-related loss of photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in WSB and NZO, respectively. Fundus exams revealed retinitis pigmentosa-relevant pigmentary abnormalities in WSB retinas and diabetic retinopathy (DR)-relevant cotton wool spots and exudates in NZO retinas. Profound photoreceptor dysfunction and loss were confirmed in WSB. Molecular analyses indicated changes in photoreceptor-specific proteins prior to loss, suggesting photoreceptor-intrinsic dysfunction in WSB. In addition, age-associated RGC dysfunction, loss, and concomitant microvascular dysfunction was observed in NZO mice. Proteomic analyses revealed an early reduction in protective antioxidant processes, which may underlie increased susceptibility to DR-relevant pathology in NZO.Genetic context is a strong determinant of retinal aging, and our multi-omics resource can aid in understanding age-related diseases of the eye and brain. Our investigations identified and validated WSB and NZO mice as improved preclinical models relevant to common retinal neurodegenerative diseases.",3.8844830034475815e-64

38519330,Time is ticking faster for long genes in aging.,Trends Genet,"Recent studies of aging organisms have identified a systematic phenomenon, characterized by a negative correlation between gene length and their expression in various cell types, species, and diseases. We term this phenomenon gene-length-dependent transcription decline (GLTD) and suggest that it may represent a bottleneck in the transcription machinery and thereby significantly contribute to aging as an etiological factor. We review potential links between GLTD and key aging processes such as DNA damage and explore their potential in identifying disease modification targets. Notably, in Alzheimer's disease, GLTD spotlights extremely long synaptic genes at chromosomal fragile sites (CFSs) and their vulnerability to postmitotic DNA damage. We suggest that GLTD is an integral element of biological aging.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.",1.5519516358463091e-15
38503727,Oncogenic enhancers prime quiescent metastatic cells to escape NK immune surveillance by eliciting transcriptional memory.,Nat Commun,"Metastasis arises from disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) that are characterized by intrinsic phenotypic plasticity and the capability of seeding to secondary organs. DTCs can remain latent for years before giving rise to symptomatic overt metastasis. In this context, DTCs fluctuate between a quiescent and proliferative state in response to systemic and microenvironmental signals including immune-mediated surveillance. Despite its relevance, how intrinsic mechanisms sustain DTCs plasticity has not been addressed. By interrogating the epigenetic state of metastatic cells, we find that tumour progression is coupled with the activation of oncogenic enhancers that are organized in variable interconnected chromatin domains. This spatial chromatin context leads to the activation of a robust transcriptional response upon repeated exposure to retinoic acid (RA). We show that this adaptive mechanism sustains the quiescence of DTCs through the activation of the master regulator SOX9. Finally, we determine that RA-stimulated transcriptional memory increases the fitness of metastatic cells by supporting the escape of quiescent DTCs from NK-mediated immune surveillance. Overall, these findings highlight the contribution of oncogenic enhancers in establishing transcriptional memories as an adaptive mechanism to reinforce cancer dormancy and immune escape, thus amenable for therapeutic intervention.© 2024.

38711449,Deciphering the TET3 interactome in primary thymic developing T cells.,iScience,"Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins are DNA dioxygenases that mediate active DNA demethylation. TET3 is the most highly expressed TET protein in thymic developing T cells. TET3, either independently or in cooperation with TET1 or TET2, has been implicated in T cell lineage specification by regulating DNA demethylation. However, TET-deficient mice exhibit complex phenotypes, suggesting that TET3 exerts multifaceted roles, potentially by interacting with other proteins. We performed liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry in primary developing T cells to identify TET3 interacting partners in endogenous,in vivoconditions. We discover TET3 interacting partners. Our data establish that TET3 participates in a plethora of fundamental biological processes, such as transcriptional regulation, RNA polymerase elongation, splicing, DNA repair, and DNA replication. This resource brings in the spotlight emerging functions of TET3 and sets the stage for systematic studies to dissect the precise mechanistic contributions of TET3 in shaping T cell biology.© 2024 The Author(s).",7.684419673604723e-36
38561804,Nucleosome reorganisation in breast cancer tissues.,Clin Epigenetics,"Nucleosome repositioning in cancer is believed to cause many changes in genome organisation and gene expression. Understanding these changes is important to elucidate fundamental aspects of cancer. It is also important for medical diagnostics based on cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which originates from genomic DNA regions protected from digestion by nucleosomes.We have generated high-resolution nucleosome maps in paired tumour and normal tissues from the same breast cancer patients using MNase-assisted histone H3 ChIP-seq and compared them with the corresponding cfDNA from blood plasma. This analysis has detected single-nucleosome repositioning at key regulatory regions in a patient-specific manner and common cancer-specific patterns across patients. The nucleosomes gained in tumour versus normal tissue were particularly informative of cancer pathways, with ~ 20-fold enrichment at CpG islands, a large fraction of which marked promoters of genes encoding DNA-binding proteins. The tumour tissues were characterised by a 5-10 bp decrease in the average distance between nucleosomes (nucleosome repeat length, NRL), which is qualitatively similar to the differences between pluripotent and differentiated cells. This effect was correlated with gene activity, differential DNA methylation and changes in local occupancy of linker histone variants H1.4 and H1X.Our study offers a novel resource of high-resolution nucleosome maps in breast cancer patients and reports for the first time the effect of systematic decrease of NRL in paired tumour versus normal breast tissues from the same patient. Our findings provide a new mechanistic understanding of nucleosome repositioning in tumour tissues that can be valuable for patient diagnostics, stratification and monitoring.© 2024.

38499830,The impact of DNA methylation on CTCF-mediated 3D genome organization.,Nat Struct Mol Biol,"Cytosine DNA methylation is a highly conserved epigenetic mark in eukaryotes. Although the role of DNA methylation at gene promoters and repetitive elements has been extensively studied, the function of DNA methylation in other genomic contexts remains less clear. In the nucleus of mammalian cells, the genome is spatially organized at different levels, and strongly influences myriad genomic processes. There are a number of factors that regulate the three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome, with the CTCF insulator protein being among the most well-characterized. Pertinently, CTCF binding has been reported as being DNA methylation-sensitive in certain contexts, perhaps most notably in the process of genomic imprinting. Therefore, it stands to reason that DNA methylation may play a broader role in the regulation of chromatin architecture. Here we summarize the current understanding that is relevant to both the mammalian DNA methylation and chromatin architecture fields and attempt to assess the extent to which DNA methylation impacts the folding of the genome. The focus is in early embryonic development and cellular transitions when the epigenome is in flux, but we also describe insights from pathological contexts, such as cancer, in which the epigenome and 3D genome organization are misregulated.© 2024.

38706718,Lipotoxicity as a therapeutic target in obesity and diabetic cardiomyopathy.,J Pharm Pharm Sci,"Unhealthy sources of fats, ultra-processed foods with added sugars, and a sedentary lifestyle make humans more susceptible to developing overweight and obesity. While lipids constitute an integral component of the organism, excessive and abnormal lipid accumulation that exceeds the storage capacity of lipid droplets disrupts the intracellular composition of fatty acids and results in the release of deleterious lipid species, thereby giving rise to a pathological state termed lipotoxicity. This condition induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammatory responses, and cell death. Recent advances in omics technologies and analytical methodologies and clinical research have provided novel insights into the mechanisms of lipotoxicity, including gut dysbiosis, epigenetic and epitranscriptomic modifications, dysfunction of lipid droplets, post-translational modifications, and altered membrane lipid composition. In this review, we discuss the recent knowledge on the mechanisms underlying the development of lipotoxicity and lipotoxic cardiometabolic disease in obesity, with a particular focus on lipotoxic and diabetic cardiomyopathy.Copyright © 2024 Nakamura.",8.872769039898282e-33
38658557,Single cell tracing of Pomc neurons reveals recruitment of 'Ghost' subtypes with atypical identity in a mouse model of obesity.,Nat Commun,"The hypothalamus contains a remarkable diversity of neurons that orchestrate behavioural and metabolic outputs in a highly plastic manner. Neuronal diversity is key to enabling hypothalamic functions and, according to the neuroscience dogma, it is predetermined during embryonic life. Here, by combining lineage tracing of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc) neurons with single-cell profiling approaches in adult male mice, we uncovered subpopulations of 'Ghost' neurons endowed with atypical molecular and functional identity. Compared to 'classical' Pomc neurons, Ghost neurons exhibit negligible Pomc expression and are 'invisible' to available neuroanatomical approaches and promoter-based reporter mice for studying Pomc biology. Ghost neuron numbers augment in diet-induced obese mice, independent of neurogenesis or cell death, but weight loss can reverse this shift. Our work challenges the notion of fixed, developmentally programmed neuronal identities in the mature hypothalamus and highlight the ability of specialised neurons to reversibly adapt their functional identity to adult-onset obesogenic stimuli.© 2024.

38581556,Telomeres and aging: on and off the planet!,Biogerontology,"Improving human healthspan in our rapidly aging population has never been more imperative. Telomeres, protective ""caps"" at the ends of linear chromosomes, are essential for maintaining genome stability of eukaryotic genomes. Due to their physical location and the ""end-replication problem"" first envisioned by Dr. Alexey Olovnikov, telomeres shorten with cell division, the implications of which are remarkably profound. Telomeres are hallmarks and molecular drivers of aging, as well as fundamental integrating components of the cumulative effects of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors that erode telomere length over time. Ongoing telomere attrition and the resulting limit to replicative potential imposed by cellular senescence serves a powerful tumor suppressor function, and also underlies aging and a spectrum of age-related degenerative pathologies, including reduced fertility, dementias, cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, very little data exists regarding the extraordinary stressors and exposures associated with long-duration space exploration and eventual habitation of other planets, nor how such missions will influence telomeres, reproduction, health, disease risk, and aging. Here, we briefly review our current understanding, which has advanced significantly in recent years as a result of the NASA Twins Study, the most comprehensive evaluation of human health effects associated with spaceflight ever conducted. Thus, the Twins Study is at the forefront of personalized space medicine approaches for astronauts and sets the stage for subsequent missions.

38550927,Optimizing human performance in extreme environments through precision medicine: From spaceflight to high-performance operations on Earth.,Camb Prism Precis Med,"Humans operating in extreme environments often conduct their operations at the edges of the limits of human performance. Sometimes, they are required to push these limits to previously unattained levels. As a result, their margins for error in execution are much smaller than that found in the general public. These same small margins for error that impact execution may also impact risk, safety, health, and even survival. Thus, humans operating in extreme environments have a need for greater refinement in their preparation, training, fitness, and medical care. Precision medicine (PM) is uniquely suited to address the needs of those engaged in these extreme operations because of its depth of molecular analysis, derived precision countermeasures, and ability to match each individual (and his or her specific molecular phenotype) with any given operating context (environment). Herein, we present an overview of a systems approach to PM in extreme environments, which affords clinicians one method to contextualize the inputs, processes, and outputs that can form the basis of a formal practice. For the sake of brevity, this overview is focused on molecular dynamics, while providing only a brief introduction to the also important physiologic and behavioral phenotypes in PM. Moreover, rather than a full review, it highlights important concepts, while using only selected citations to illustrate those concepts. It further explores, by demonstration, the basic principles of using functionally characterized molecular networks to guide the practical application of PM in extreme environments. At its core, PM in extreme environments is about attention to incremental gains and losses in molecular network efficiency that can scale to produce notable changes in health and performance. The aim of this overview is to provide a conceptual overview of one approach to PM in extreme environments, coupled with a selected suite of practical considerations for molecular profiling and countermeasures.© The Author(s) 2023.",1.0194351946721171e-50

To overcome these stressors, the body undergoes various adaptations such as cardiovascular deconditioning, fluid shifts, metabolic changes, and alterations in the state of the bone marrow. Another area of concern is the potential impact of these adaptations on erythrocyte and haemoglobin concentrations, which can lead to what is commonly referred to as space anaemia or microgravity-induced anaemia. It is known that anaemia may result in impaired physical and cognitive performance, making early detection and management crucial for the health and wellbeing of astronauts during extended space missions. However, the effects and mechanisms of space anaemia are not fully understood, and research is underway to determine the extent to which it poses a challenge to astronauts.

We show microvolume flow cytometry from 10 μL sample drops, with data from five simultaneous channels using 10 μs bin intervals during each sample run, yielding an average of 72 million raw data points in approximately 2 min. We demonstrate the device measures each test sample repeatably, including correct identification of a sample that degraded in transit to the International Space Station.

Despite the progress in screening, early diagnosis, and treatment, approximately 20%-25% of CRC patients still present with metastatic disease at the time of their initial diagnosis. Furthermore, the burden of disease is still expected to increase, especially in individuals younger than 50 years old, among whom early-onset CRC incidence has been increasing. Screening and early detection are pivotal to improve CRC-related outcomes. It is well established that CRC screening not only reduces incidence, but also decreases deaths from CRC. Diverse screening strategies have proven effective in decreasing both CRC incidence and mortality, though variations in efficacy have been reported across the literature. However, uncertainties persist regarding the optimal screening method, age intervals and periodicity. Moreover, adherence to CRC screening remains globally low. In recent years, emerging technologies, notably artificial intelligence, and non-invasive biomarkers, have been developed to overcome these barriers. However, controversy exists over the actual impact of some of the new discoveries on CRC-related outcomes and how to effectively integrate them into daily practice. In this review, we aim to cover the current evidence surrounding CRC screening. We will further critically assess novel approaches under investigation, in an effort to differentiate promising innovations from mere novelties.©The Author(s) 2024.

This short review aims to summarize key findings and future perspectives that might provide new insights into the mechanisms underpinning the lung-brain axis in MS.© 2024 The Author.",1.6686190019345905e-20
38522363,Impact of adult-onset multiple sclerosis on MRI-based intracranial volume: A study in clinically discordant monozygotic twins.,Neuroimage Clin,"Intracranial volume (ICV) represents the maximal brain volume for an individual, attained prior to late adolescence and remaining constant throughout life after. Thus, ICV serves as a surrogate marker for brain growth integrity. To assess the potential impact of adult-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) and its preceding prodromal subclinical changes on ICV in a large cohort of monozygotic twins clinically discordant for MS.FSL software was used to derive ICV estimates from 3D-T1-weighted-3 T-MRI images by using an atlas scaling factor method. ICV were compared between clinically affected and healthy co-twins. All twins were compared to a large healthy reference cohort using standardized ICV z-scores. Mixed models assessed the impact of age at MS diagnosis on ICV.54 twin-pairs (108 individuals/80female/42.45 ± 11.98 years), 731 individuals (375 non-twins, 109/69 monozygotic/dizygotic twin-pairs; 398female/29.18 ± 0.13 years) and 35 healthy local individuals (20male/31.34 ± 1.53 years). In 45/54 (83 %) twin-pairs, both clinically affected and healthy co-twins showed negative ICV z-scores, i.e., ICVs lower than the average of the healthy reference cohort (M = -1.53 ± 0.11, P<10-5). Younger age at MS diagnosis was strongly associated with lower ICVs (t = 3.76, P = 0.0003). Stratification of twin-pairs by age at MS diagnosis of the affected co-twin (≤30 versus > 30 years) yielded lower ICVs in those twin pairs with younger age at diagnosis (P = 0.01). Comparison within individual twin-pairs identified lower ICVs in the MS-affected co-twins with younger age at diagnosis compared to their corresponding healthy co-twins (P = 0.003).We offer for the first-time evidence for strong associations between adult-onset MS and lower ICV, which is more pronounced with younger age at diagnosis. This suggests pre-clinical alterations in early neurodevelopment associated with susceptibility to MS both in individuals with and without clinical manifestation of the disease.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

38741139,PPAR-γ agonists reactivate the ALDOC-NR2F1 axis to enhance sensitivity to temozolomide and suppress glioblastoma progression.,Cell Commun Signal,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a type of brain cancer categorized as a high-grade glioma. GBM is characterized by limited treatment options, low patient survival rates, and abnormal serotonin metabolism. Previous studies have investigated the tumor suppressor function of aldolase C (ALDOC), a glycolytic enzyme in GBM. However, it is unclear how ALDOC regulates production of serotonin and its associated receptors, HTRs. In this study, we analyzed ALDOC mRNA levels and methylation status using sequencing data and in silico datasets. Furthermore, we investigated pathways, phenotypes, and drug effects using cell and mouse models. Our results suggest that loss of ALDOC function in GBM promotes tumor cell invasion and migration. We observed that hypermethylation, which results in loss of ALDOC expression, is associated with serotonin hypersecretion and the inhibition of PPAR-γ signaling. Using several omics datasets, we present evidence that ALDOC regulates serotonin levels and safeguards PPAR-γ against serotonin metabolism mediated by 5-HT, which leads to a reduction in PPAR-γ expression. PPAR-γ activation inhibits serotonin release by HTR and diminishes GBM tumor growth in our cellular and animal models. Importantly, research has demonstrated that PPAR-γ agonists prolong animal survival rates and increase the efficacy of temozolomide in an orthotopic brain model of GBM. The relationship and function of the ALDOC-PPAR-γ axis could serve as a potential prognostic indicator. Furthermore, PPAR-γ agonists offer a new treatment alternative for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).© 2024. The Author(s).",1.0658780708583184e-46
38728394,CD8(+) T cell targeting of tumor antigens presented by HLA-E.,Sci Adv,"The nonpolymorphic major histocompatibility complex E (MHC-E) molecule is up-regulated on many cancer cells, thus contributing to immune evasion by engaging inhibitory NKG2A/CD94 receptors on NK cells and tumor-infiltrating T cells. To investigate whether MHC-E expression by cancer cells can be targeted for MHC-E-restricted T cell control, we immunized rhesus macaques (RM) with rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV) vectors genetically programmed to elicit MHC-E-restricted CD8+T cells and to express established tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) including prostatic acidic phosphatase (PAP), Wilms tumor-1 protein, or Mesothelin. T cell responses to all three tumor antigens were comparable to viral antigen-specific responses with respect to frequency, duration, phenotype, epitope density, and MHC restriction. Thus, CMV-vectored cancer vaccines can bypass central tolerance by eliciting T cells to noncanonical epitopes. We further demonstrate that PAP-specific, MHC-E-restricted CD8+T cells from RhCMV/PAP-immunized RM respond to PAP-expressing HLA-E+prostate cancer cells, suggesting that the HLA-E/NKG2A immune checkpoint can be exploited for CD8+T cell-based immunotherapies.",2.7734319501888383e-47

Yet, adaptive resistance mechanisms, induced by rapid, context-specific signaling network rewiring, continue to challenge therapeutic efficacy. Leveraging progress in proteomic technologies and network-based methodologies, we introduce Virtual Enrichment-based Signaling Protein-activity Analysis (VESPA)-an algorithm designed to elucidate mechanisms of cell response and adaptation to drug perturbations-and use it to analyze 7-point phosphoproteomic time series from colorectal cancer cells treated with clinically-relevant inhibitors and control media. Interrogating tumor-specific enzyme/substrate interactions accurately infers kinase and phosphatase activity, based on their substrate phosphorylation state, effectively accounting for signal crosstalk and sparse phosphoproteome coverage. The analysis elucidates time-dependent signaling pathway response to each drug perturbation and, more importantly, cell adaptive response and rewiring, experimentally confirmed by CRISPR knock-out assays, suggesting broad applicability to cancer and other diseases.© 2024.

38722458,The analysis of transcriptomic signature of TNBC-searching for the potential RNA-based predictive biomarkers to determine the chemotherapy sensitivity.,J Appl Genet,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the foundation treatment for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and frequently results in pathological complete response (pCR). However, there are large differences in clinical response and survival after neoadjuvant chemotherapy of TNBC patients. The aim was to identify genes whose expression significantly associates with the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with TNBC. Transcriptomes of 46 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples from TNBC patients were analyzed by RNA-seq by comparing 26 TNBCs with pCR versus 20 TNBCs with pathological partial remission (pPR). Subsequently, we narrowed down the list of genes to those that strongly correlated with drug sensitivity of 63 breast cancer cell lines based on Dependency Map Consortium data re-analysis. Furthermore, the list of genes was limited to those presenting specific expression in breast tumor cells as revealed in three large published single-cell RNA-seq breast cancer datasets. Finally, we analyzed which of the selected genes were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) in TNBC TCGA dataset. A total of 105 genes were significantly differentially expressed in comparison between pPR versus pCR. As revealed by PLSR analysis in breast cancer cell lines, out of 105 deregulated genes, 42 were associated with sensitivity to docetaxel, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and/or cyclophosphamide. We found that 24 out of 42 sensitivity-associated genes displayed intermediate or strong expression in breast malignant cells using single-cell RNAseq re-analysis. Finally, 10 out of 24 genes were significantly associated with overall survival in TNBC TCGA dataset. Our RNA-seq-based findings suggest that there might be transcriptomic signature consisted of 24 genes specifically expressed in tumor malignant cells for predicting neoadjuvant response in FFPE samples from TNBC patients prior to treatment initiation. Additionally, nine out of 24 genes were potential survival predictors in TNBC. This group of 24 genes should be further investigated for its potential to be translated into a predictive test(s).© 2024. The Author(s).",4.083884173960464e-60
38720734,Organoids derived from metastatic cancers: Present and future.,Heliyon,"Organoids are three-dimensional structures derived from primary tissue or tumors that closely mimic the architecture, histology, and function of the parental tissue. In recent years, patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling tumor heterogeneity, drug screening, and personalized medicine. Although most cancer organoids are derived from primary tumors, the ability of organoids from metastatic cancer to serve as a model for studying tumor biology and predicting the therapeutic response is an area of active investigation. Recent studies have shown that organoids derived from metastatic sites can provide valuable insights into tumor biology and may be used to validate predictive models of the drug response. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the feasibility of culturing organoids from multiple metastatic cancers and evaluate their potential for advancing basic cancer research, drug development, and personalized therapy. We also explore the limitations and challenges associated with using metastasis organoids for cancer research. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state and future prospects of metastatic cancer-derived organoids.© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2.352262131930614e-47
38704604,Antileukemic potential of methylated indolequinone MAC681 through immunogenic necroptosis and PARP1 degradation.,Biomark Res,"Despite advancements in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), resistance and intolerance remain significant challenges. Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and TKI-resistant cells rely on altered mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation. Targeting rewired energy metabolism and inducing non-apoptotic cell death, along with the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), can enhance therapeutic strategies and immunogenic therapies against CML and prevent the emergence of TKI-resistant cells and LSC persistence.Transcriptomic analysis was conducted using datasets of CML patients' stem cells and healthy cells. DNA damage was evaluated by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. Cell death was assessed by trypan blue exclusion test, fluorescent microscopy, flow cytometry, colony formation assay, and in vivo Zebrafish xenografts. Energy metabolism was determined by measuring NAD+and NADH levels, ATP production rate by Seahorse analyzer, and intracellular ATP content. Mitochondrial fitness was estimated by measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS, and calcium accumulation by flow cytometry, and morphology was visualized by TEM. Bioinformatic analysis, real-time qPCR, western blotting, chemical reaction prediction, and molecular docking were utilized to identify the drug target. The immunogenic potential was assessed by high mobility group box (HMGB)1 ELISA assay, luciferase-based extracellular ATP assay, ectopic calreticulin expression by flow cytometry, and validated by phagocytosis assay, and in vivo vaccination assay using syngeneic C57BL/6 mice.Transcriptomic analysis identified metabolic alterations and DNA repair deficiency signatures in CML patients. CML patients exhibited enrichment in immune system, DNA repair, and metabolic pathways. The gene signature associated with BRCA mutated tumors was enriched in CML datasets, suggesting a deficiency in double-strand break repair pathways. Additionally, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)1 was significantly upregulated in CML patients' stem cells compared to healthy counterparts. Consistent with the CML patient DNA repair signature, treatment with the methylated indolequinone MAC681 induced DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium homeostasis disruption, metabolic catastrophe, and necroptotic-like cell death. In parallel, MAC681 led to PARP1 degradation that was prevented by 3-aminobenzamide. MAC681-treated myeloid leukemia cells released DAMPs and demonstrated the potential to generate an immunogenic vaccine in C57BL/6 mice. MAC681 and asciminib exhibited synergistic effects in killing both imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML, opening new therapeutic opportunities.Overall, increasing the tumor mutational burden by PARP1 degradation and mitochondrial deregulation makes CML suitable for immunotherapy.© 2024.

38687247,Epithelial Expressed B7-H4 Drives Differential Immunotherapy Response in Murine and Human Breast Cancer.,Cancer Res Commun,"Combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI, including anti-PD-1/PD-L1) and chemotherapy have been FDA approved for metastatic and early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but most patients do not benefit. B7-H4 is a B7 family ligand with proposed immunosuppressive functions being explored as a cancer immunotherapy target and may be associated with anti-PD-L1 resistance. However, little is known about its regulation and effect on immune cell function in breast cancers. We assessed murine and human breast cancer cells to identify regulation mechanisms of B7-H4 in vitro. We used an immunocompetent anti-PD-L1-sensitive orthotopic mammary cancer model and induced ectopic expression of B7-H4. We assessed therapy response and transcriptional changes at baseline and under treatment with anti-PD-L1. We observed B7-H4 was highly associated with epithelial cell status and transcription factors and found to be regulated by PI3K activity. EMT6 tumors with cell-surface B7-H4 expression were more resistant to immunotherapy. In addition, tumor-infiltrating immune cells had reduced immune activation signaling based on transcriptomic analysis. Paradoxically, in human breast cancer, B7-H4 expression was associated with survival benefit for patients with metastatic TNBC treated with carboplatin plus anti-PD-L1 and was associated with no change in response or survival for patients with early breast cancer receiving chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1. While B7-H4 induces tumor resistance to anti-PD-L1 in murine models, there are alternative mechanisms of signaling and function in human cancers. In addition, the strong correlation of B7-H4 to epithelial cell markers suggests a potential regulatory mechanism of B7-H4 independent of PD-L1.This translational study confirms the association of B7-H4 expression with a cold immune microenvironment in breast cancer and offers preclinical studies demonstrating a potential role for B7-H4 in suppressing response to checkpoint therapy. However, analysis of two clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors in the early and metastatic settings argue against B7-H4 as being a mechanism of clinical resistance to checkpoints, with clear implications for its candidacy as a therapeutic target.© 2024 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.",3.0629116137676113e-85
38682900,Ribosome subunit attrition and activation of the p53-MDM4 axis dominate the response of MLL-rearranged cancer cells to WDR5 WIN site inhibition.,Elife,"The chromatin-associated protein WD Repeat Domain 5 (WDR5) is a promising target for cancer drug discovery, with most efforts blocking an arginine-binding cavity on the protein called the 'WIN' site that tethers WDR5 to chromatin. WIN site inhibitors (WINi) are active against multiple cancer cell types in vitro, the most notable of which are those derived from MLL-rearranged (MLLr) leukemias. Peptidomimetic WINi were originally proposed to inhibit MLLr cells via dysregulation of genes connected to hematopoietic stem cell expansion. Our discovery and interrogation of small-molecule WINi, however, revealed that they act in MLLr cell lines to suppress ribosome protein gene (RPG) transcription, induce nucleolar stress, and activate p53. Because there is no precedent for an anticancer strategy that specifically targets RPG expression, we took an integrated multi-omics approach to further interrogate the mechanism of action of WINi in human MLLr cancer cells. We show that WINi induce depletion of the stock of ribosomes, accompanied by a broad yet modest translational choke and changes in alternative mRNA splicing that inactivate the p53 antagonist MDM4. We also show that WINi are synergistic with agents including venetoclax and BET-bromodomain inhibitors. Together, these studies reinforce the concept that WINi are a novel type of ribosome-directed anticancer therapy and provide a resource to support their clinical implementation in MLLr leukemias and other malignancies.© 2023, Howard et al.",3.294608868531563e-47
38678587,DeepKEGG: a multi-omics data integration framework with biological insights for cancer recurrence prediction and biomarker discovery.,Brief Bioinform,"Deep learning-based multi-omics data integration methods have the capability to reveal the mechanisms of cancer development, discover cancer biomarkers and identify pathogenic targets. However, current methods ignore the potential correlations between samples in integrating multi-omics data. In addition, providing accurate biological explanations still poses significant challenges due to the complexity of deep learning models. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a deep learning-based multi-omics integration method to explore the potential correlations between samples and provide model interpretability. Herein, we propose a novel interpretable multi-omics data integration method (DeepKEGG) for cancer recurrence prediction and biomarker discovery. In DeepKEGG, a biological hierarchical module is designed for local connections of neuron nodes and model interpretability based on the biological relationship between genes/miRNAs and pathways. In addition, a pathway self-attention module is constructed to explore the correlation between different samples and generate the potential pathway feature representation for enhancing the prediction performance of the model. Lastly, an attribution-based feature importance calculation method is utilized to discover biomarkers related to cancer recurrence and provide a biological interpretation of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepKEGG outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in 5-fold cross validation. Furthermore, case studies also indicate that DeepKEGG serves as an effective tool for biomarker discovery. The code is available at https://github.com/lanbiolab/DeepKEGG.© The Author(s) 2024.

38664416,Group 3 medulloblastoma transcriptional networks collapse under domain specific EP300/CBP inhibition.,Nat Commun,"Chemical discovery efforts commonly target individual protein domains. Many proteins, including the EP300/CBP histone acetyltransferases (HATs), contain several targetable domains. EP300/CBP are critical gene-regulatory targets in cancer, with existing high potency inhibitors of either the catalytic HAT domain or protein-binding bromodomain (BRD). A domain-specific inhibitory approach to multidomain-containing proteins may identify exceptional-responding tumor types, thereby expanding a therapeutic index. Here, we discover that targeting EP300/CBP using the domain-specific inhibitors, A485 (HAT) or CCS1477 (BRD) have different effects in select tumor types. Group 3 medulloblastoma (G3MB) cells are especially sensitive to BRD, compared with HAT inhibition. Structurally, these effects are mediated by the difluorophenyl group in the catalytic core of CCS1477. Mechanistically, bromodomain inhibition causes rapid disruption of genetic dependency networks that are required for G3MB growth. These studies provide a domain-specific structural foundation for drug discovery efforts targeting EP300/CBP and identify a selective role for the EP300/CBP bromodomain in maintaining genetic dependency networks in G3MB.© 2024.

This study investigated the effect of hsa-miR-34a-5p and its combination with temozolomide on GBM, the related molecular mechanisms, and the signaling pathway usingin-silicoandin-vitroapproaches. Thein-silicotumor bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses were done on TCGA-GTEx, CGGA, GSE13276, GSE90603, and GSE182109 datasets. After selecting the A172 cell line, hsa-miR-34a-5p mimics were transfected, and the cell viability, migration, cell cycle, clonogenicity, and apoptosis of studied groups were studied using MTT, scratch, flow cytometry, colony formation, and Annexin V/PI assays.

The combined treatment significantly downregulated the expression ofMET,SRC, andMAP2K1, leading to the inhibition of the MET/MAPK pathway compared to temozolomide. Besides exerting anti-tumoral effects on the cell viability, migration, cell cycle, apoptosis, and clonogenicity of A172 cells, its combination with temozolomide enhanced temozolomide anti-tumoral effect.

38649537,SUCLG1 restricts POLRMT succinylation to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and leukemia progression.,EMBO J,"Mitochondria are cellular powerhouses that generate energy through the electron transport chain (ETC). The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) encodes essential ETC proteins in a compartmentalized manner, however, the mechanism underlying metabolic regulation of mtDNA function remains unknown. Here, we report that expression of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme succinate-CoA ligase SUCLG1 strongly correlates with ETC genes across various TCGA cancer transcriptomes. Mechanistically, SUCLG1 restricts succinyl-CoA levels to suppress the succinylation of mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT). Lysine 622 succinylation disrupts the interaction of POLRMT with mtDNA and mitochondrial transcription factors. SUCLG1-mediated POLRMT hyposuccinylation maintains mtDNA transcription, mitochondrial biogenesis, and leukemia cell proliferation. Specifically, leukemia-promoting FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations modulate nuclear transcription and upregulate SUCLG1 expression to reduce succinyl-CoA and POLRMT succinylation, resulting in enhanced mitobiogenesis. In line, genetic depletion of POLRMT or SUCLG1 significantly delays disease progression in mouse and humanized leukemia models. Importantly, succinyl-CoA level and POLRMT succinylation are downregulated in FLT3-mutated clinical leukemia samples, linking enhanced mitobiogenesis to cancer progression. Together, SUCLG1 connects succinyl-CoA with POLRMT succinylation to modulate mitochondrial function and cancer development.© 2024. The Author(s).",7.293335515309236e-36

We defined the genomic binding sites of PML::RARA in primary mouse and human hematopoietic progenitor cells with V5-tagged PML::RARA, using anti-V5-PML::RARA chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and CUT&RUN approaches. Most genomic PML::RARA binding sites were found in regions that were already chromatin-accessible (defined by ATAC-seq) in unmanipulated, wild-type promyelocytes, suggesting that these regions are ""open"" prior to PML::RARA expression. We found that GATA binding motifs, and the direct binding of the chromatin ""pioneering factor"" GATA2, were significantly enriched near PML::RARA binding sites. Proximity labeling studies revealed that PML::RARA interacts with ~250 proteins in primary mouse hematopoietic cells; GATA2 and 33 others require PML::RARA binding to DNA for the interaction to occur, suggesting that binding to their cognate DNA target motifs may stabilize their interactions. In the absence ofPML::RARA,Gata2overexpression induces many of the same epigenetic and transcriptional changes asPML::RARA. These findings suggested thatPML::RARAmay indirectly initiate its transcriptional program by activatingGata2expression: Indeed, we demonstrated that inactivation ofGata2prior toPML::RARAexpression prevented its ability to induce self-renewal. These data suggested that GATA2 binding creates accessible chromatin regions enriched for both GATA and Retinoic Acid Receptor Element motifs, where GATA2 and PML::RARA can potentially bind and interact with each other. In turn, PML::RARA binding to DNA promotes a feed-forward transcriptional program by positively regulatingGata2expression.Gata2may therefore be required forPML::RARAto establish its transcriptional program.",4.8345791873103544e-30

38632359,DNA double-strand break-capturing nuclear envelope tubules drive DNA repair.,Nat Struct Mol Biol,"Current models suggest that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can move to the nuclear periphery for repair. It is unclear to what extent human DSBs display such repositioning. Here we show that the human nuclear envelope localizes to DSBs in a manner depending on DNA damage response (DDR) kinases and cytoplasmic microtubules acetylated by α-tubulin acetyltransferase-1 (ATAT1). These factors collaborate with the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex (LINC), nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein NUP153, nuclear lamina and kinesins KIF5B and KIF13B to generate DSB-capturing nuclear envelope tubules (dsbNETs). dsbNETs are partly supported by nuclear actin filaments and the circadian factor PER1 and reversed by kinesin KIFC3. Although dsbNETs promote repair and survival, they are also co-opted during poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition to restrain BRCA1-deficient breast cancer cells and are hyper-induced in cells expressing the aging-linked lamin A mutant progerin. In summary, our results advance understanding of nuclear structure-function relationships, uncover a nuclear-cytoplasmic DDR and identify dsbNETs as critical factors in genome organization and stability.© 2024.

We present a strategy combining biomarker testing with drug repurposing to identify new treatments for patients with advanced cancer.Tumours were sequenced with the Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 (TSO-500) platform or the FoundationOne CDx panel. Mutations were screened by two medical oncologists and pathogenic mutations were categorised referencing literature. Variants of unknown significance were classified as potentially pathogenic using plausible mechanisms and computational prediction of pathogenicity. Gain of function (GOF) mutations were evaluated through repurposing databases Probe Miner (PM), Broad Institute Drug Repurposing Hub (Broad Institute DRH) and TOPOGRAPH. GOF mutations were repurposing events if identified in PM, not indexed in TOPOGRAPH and excluding mutations with a known Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biomarker. The computational repurposing approach was validated by evaluating its ability to identify FDA-approved biomarkers. The total repurposable genome was identified by evaluating all possible gene-FDA drug-approved combinations in the PM dataset.The computational repurposing approach was accurate at identifying FDA therapies with known biomarkers (94%). Using next-generation sequencing molecular reports (n = 94), a meaningful percentage of patients (14%) could have an off-label therapeutic identified. The frequency of theoretical drug repurposing events in The Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer dataset was 73% of the samples in the cohort.A computational drug repurposing approach may assist in identifying novel repurposing events in cancer patients with no access to standard therapies.

Seurat R program was used to analyze scRNA-seq data and identify CAFs clusters corresponding to CAFs markers. Differential expression analysis was performed on the TCGA dataset to identify prognostic genes. A CAF-associated risk signature was designed using Lasso regression and combined with clinicopathological variables to develop a nomogram. Functional enrichment and the immune landscape were also analyzed.Five CAFs clusters were identified in OC using scRNA-seq data, and 2 were significantly associated with OC prognosis. Seven genes were selected to develop a CAF-based risk signature, primarily associated with 28 pathways. The signature was a key independent predictor of OC prognosis and relevant in predicting the results of immunotherapy interventions. A novel nomogram combining CAF-based risk and disease stage was developed to predict OC prognosis.The study highlights the importance of CAFs in OC progression and suggests potential for innovative treatment strategies.

38622716,Architecting the metabolic reprogramming survival risk framework in LUAD through single-cell landscape analysis: three-stage ensemble learning with genetic algorithm optimization.,J Transl Med,"Recent studies have increasingly revealed the connection between metabolic reprogramming and tumor progression. However, the specific impact of metabolic reprogramming on inter-patient heterogeneity and prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) still requires further exploration. Here, we introduced a cellular hierarchy framework according to a malignant and metabolic gene set, named malignant & metabolism reprogramming (MMR), to reanalyze 178,739 single-cell reference profiles. Furthermore, we proposed a three-stage ensemble learning pipeline, aided by genetic algorithm (GA), for survival prediction across 9 LUAD cohorts (n = 2066). Throughout the pipeline of developing the three stage-MMR (3 S-MMR) score, double training sets were implemented to avoid over-fitting; the gene-pairing method was utilized to remove batch effect; GA was harnessed to pinpoint the optimal basic learner combination. The novel 3 S-MMR score reflects various aspects of LUAD biology, provides new insights into precision medicine for patients, and may serve as a generalizable predictor of prognosis and immunotherapy response. To facilitate the clinical adoption of the 3 S-MMR score, we developed an easy-to-use web tool for risk scoring as well as therapy stratification in LUAD patients. In summary, we have proposed and validated an ensemble learning model pipeline within the framework of metabolic reprogramming, offering potential insights for LUAD treatment and an effective approach for developing prognostic models for other diseases.© 2024.

Modern transcriptomics techniques can identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that may serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets, so we screened for DEGs in osteosarcoma. We found that osteosarcoma cases could be divided into fair and poor survival groups based on gene expression profiles. Among the genes upregulated in the poor survival group, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the glycosylation-related gene C1GALT1 suppressed osteosarcoma cell proliferation in culture. Gene expression, phosphorylation, and glycome array analyses also demonstrated that C1GALT1 is required to maintain ERK signaling and cell cycle progression. Moreover, the C1GALT1 inhibitor itraconazole suppressed osteosarcoma cell proliferation in culture, while doxycycline-induced shRNA-mediated knockdown reduced xenograft osteosarcoma growth in mice. Elevated C1GALT1 expression is a potential early predictor of poor prognosis, while pharmacological inhibition may be a feasible treatment strategy for osteosarcoma.© 2024.

38617258,Rapid profiling of transcription factor-cofactor interaction networks reveals principles of epigenetic regulation.,bioRxiv,"Transcription factor (TF)-cofactor (COF) interactions define dynamic, cell-specific networks that govern gene expression; however, these networks are understudied due to a lack of methods for high-throughput profiling of DNA-bound TF-COF complexes. Here we describe the Cofactor Recruitment (CoRec) method for rapid profiling of cell-specific TF-COF complexes. We define a lysine acetyltransferase (KAT)-TF network in resting and stimulated T cells. We find promiscuous recruitment of KATs for many TFs and that 35% of KAT-TF interactions are condition specific. KAT-TF interactions identify NF-κB as a primary regulator of acutely induced H3K27ac. Finally, we find that heterotypic clustering of CBP/P300-recruiting TFs is a strong predictor of total promoter H3K27ac. Our data supports clustering of TF sites that broadly recruit KATs as a mechanism for widespread co-occurring histone acetylation marks. CoRec can be readily applied to different cell systems and provides a powerful approach to define TF-COF networks impacting chromatin state and gene regulation.",7.871575309261633e-38
38602606,"Mediator kinase module proteins, genetic alterations and expression of super-enhancer regulated genes in colorectal cancer.",Pharmacol Rep,"Genetic alterations are well characterized as contributors to the pathogenesis of cancers. Epigenetic abnormalities can lead to perturbations of the expression of genes in cancer cells without structural defects. Deregulation of proteins of the transcription machinery may result in perturbations of target genes. Mediator, a multiprotein component of the transcription machinery facilitates the function of RNA polymerase II, which transcribes most human genes. A part of the mediator with kinase activity, called the Mediator kinase module shows genetic alterations in a sub-set of colorectal cancers.Data from publicly available genomic series of colorectal cancer patients were examined to determine alterations of Mediator kinase module component genes, including MED12, MED12L, MED13, MED13L, CDK8, CDK19, and CCNC. The prevalence of alterations in genomically defined colorectal cancer sub-sets was also interrogated. The effect of Mediator kinase module member gene expression on colorectal cancer relapse-free survival was investigated.Mutations in genes of the Mediator kinase module were present in a small percentage of colorectal cancers, ranging between 2 to 10% for MED12 and MED13 and alternative units MED12L and MED13L and below 2% for kinases CDK8 and CDK19 and cyclin C. Amplifications of the CDK8 gene were observed in 3% to 5% of colorectal cancers. The highest prevalence of mutations was observed in MSI cancers and the equivalent CMS1 group, with other genomic groups showing much lower frequency. An association of higher expression of MED12 with inferior relapse-free survival was observed. In contrast, higher expression of cyclin C was associated with improved survival. Colorectal cancer cell lines with CDK8 amplifications displayed sensitivity to several small molecule inhibitors of the KRAS/PI3K pathway but not to BET inhibitors.The Mediator kinase module is deregulated in a sub-set of colorectal cancers with differences observed in genomically defined groups. These variations may result in differences in sensitivity to targeted therapies and may have to be taken into consideration as such therapies are developed.© 2024.

38601538,Identification of a novel cancer-associated fibroblasts gene signature based on bioinformatics analysis to predict prognosis and therapeutic responses in breast cancer.,Heliyon,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) provide suitable conditions for growth of tumor cell and facilitate tumor progression. Hence, we aimed to identify a CAFs-related gene signature associated with the prognosis of patients with breast cancer (BRCA). We downloaded datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and confirmed the correlation between CAFs infiltration scores and prognosis. By performing weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and Lasso Cox regression analysis, we constructed a four-gene (COL5A3, FN1, POSTN, and RARRES2) prognostic CAFs signature model. Based on the median risk score of CAFs, patients with BRCA were divided into high- and low-risk groups. Compared with low-risk group, patients in high-risk group exhibited a poor prognosis and limited response to immunotherapy. Furthermore, patients with high CAFs risk scores were found to have a detrimental prognosis due to the induction of immunosuppressive cell infiltration, resulting in an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Importantly, we found that CAFs overexpressing FN1 and POSTN significantly promoted the wound healing and invasion ability of tumor cells in vitro validation. Taking together, we identified a four-gene prognostic CAFs signature, which was proven to be a reliable indicator for prognosis and therapeutic efficacy in patients with BRCA. This study provided evidence for novel CAFs-based stromal therapy.© 2024 The Authors.",2.4449681415454407e-58
38598634,Molecular phenotyping of small cell lung cancer using targeted cfDNA profiling of transcriptional regulatory regions.,Sci Adv,"We report an approach for cancer phenotyping based on targeted sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In SCLC, differential activation of transcription factors (TFs), such as ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and REST defines molecular subtypes. We designed a targeted capture panel that identifies chromatin organization signatures at 1535 TF binding sites and 13,240 gene transcription start sites and detects exonic mutations in 842 genes. Sequencing of cfDNA from SCLC patient-derived xenograft models captured TF activity and gene expression and revealed individual highly informative loci. Prediction models of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 activity using informative loci achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) from 0.84 to 0.88 in patients with SCLC. As non-SCLC (NSCLC) often transforms to SCLC following targeted therapy, we applied our framework to distinguish NSCLC from SCLC and achieved an AUC of 0.99. Our approach shows promising utility for SCLC subtyping and transformation monitoring, with potential applicability to diverse tumor types.",3.7093414014734566e-33
38591003,Inference of drug off-target effects on cellular signaling using interactome-based deep learning.,iScience,"Many diseases emerge from dysregulated cellular signaling, and drugs are often designed to target specific signaling proteins. Off-target effects are, however, common and may ultimately result in failed clinical trials. Here we develop a computer model of the cell's transcriptional response to drugs for improved understanding of their mechanisms of action. The model is based on ensembles of artificial neural networks and simultaneously infers drug-target interactions and their downstream effects on intracellular signaling. With this, it predicts transcription factors' activities, while recovering known drug-target interactions and inferring many new ones, which we validate with an independent dataset. As a case study, we analyze the effects of the drug Lestaurtinib on downstream signaling. Alongside its intended target, FLT3, the model predicts an inhibition of CDK2 that enhances the downregulation of the cell cycle-critical transcription factor FOXM1. Our approach can therefore enhance our understanding of drug signaling for therapeutic design.© 2024 The Author(s).",1.1073842918408334e-33
38585946,moPepGen: Rapid and Comprehensive Proteoform Identification.,bioRxiv,"Gene expression is a multi-step transformation of biological information from its storage form (DNA) into functional forms (protein and some RNAs). Regulatory activities at each step of this transformation multiply a single gene into a myriad of proteoforms. Proteogenomics is the study of how genomic and transcriptomic variation creates this proteoform diversity, and is limited by the challenges of modeling the complexities of gene-expression. We therefore created moPepGen, a graph-based algorithm that comprehensively enumerates proteoforms in linear time. moPepGen works with multiple technologies, in multiple species and on all types of genetic and transcriptomic data. In human cancer proteomes, it detects and quantifies previously unobserved noncanonical peptides arising from germline and somatic genomic variants, noncoding open reading frames, RNA fusions and RNA circularization. By enabling efficient identification and quantitation of previously hidden proteins in both existing and new proteomic data, moPepGen facilitates all proteogenomics applications.

38565920,Direct and selective pharmacological disruption of the YAP-TEAD interface by IAG933 inhibits Hippo-dependent and RAS-MAPK-altered cancers.,Nat Cancer,"The YAP-TEAD protein-protein interaction mediates YAP oncogenic functions downstream of the Hippo pathway. To date, available YAP-TEAD pharmacologic agents bind into the lipid pocket of TEAD, targeting the interaction indirectly via allosteric changes. However, the consequences of a direct pharmacological disruption of the interface between YAP and TEADs remain largely unexplored. Here, we present IAG933 and its analogs as potent first-in-class and selective disruptors of the YAP-TEAD protein-protein interaction with suitable properties to enter clinical trials. Pharmacologic abrogation of the interaction with all four TEAD paralogs resulted in YAP eviction from chromatin and reduced Hippo-mediated transcription and induction of cell death. In vivo, deep tumor regression was observed in Hippo-driven mesothelioma xenografts at tolerated doses in animal models as well as in Hippo-altered cancer models outside mesothelioma. Importantly this also extended to larger tumor indications, such as lung, pancreatic and colorectal cancer, in combination with RTK, KRAS-mutant selective and MAPK inhibitors, leading to more efficacious and durable responses. Clinical evaluation of IAG933 is underway.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.0463328674211894e-45
38559245,Inhibition of Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Isozymes Decreases Multiple Myeloma Cell Proliferation and Causes Mitochondrial Dysfunction.,bioRxiv,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable cancer of plasma cells with a 5-year survival rate of 59%. Dysregulation of fatty acid (FA) metabolism is associated with MM development and progression; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family members (ACSLs) convert free long-chain fatty acids into fatty acyl-CoA esters and play key roles in catabolic and anabolic fatty acid metabolism. The Cancer Dependency Map data suggested that ACSL3 and ACSL4 were among the top 25% Hallmark Fatty Acid Metabolism genes that support MM fitness. Here, we show that inhibition of ACSLs in human myeloma cell lines using the pharmacological inhibitor Triascin C (TriC) causes apoptosis and decreases proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. RNA-seq of MM.1S cells treated with TriC for 24 h showed a significant enrichment in apoptosis, ferroptosis, and ER stress. Proteomics of MM.1S cells treated with TriC for 48 h revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation were significantly enriched pathways of interest, consistent with our observations of decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and increased mitochondrial superoxide levels. Interestingly, MM.1S cells treated with TriC for 24 h also showed decreased mitochondrial ATP production rates and overall lower cellular respiration.",1.103032344781846e-50
38551001,Systematic omics analysis identifies CCR6 as a therapeutic target to overcome cancer resistance to EGFR inhibitors.,iScience,"Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRi) have exhibited promising clinical outcomes in the treatment of various cancers. However, their widespread application has been limited by low patient eligibility and the emergence of resistance. Leveraging a multi-omics approach (>1000 cancer cell lines), we explored molecular signatures linked to EGFRi responsiveness and found that expression signatures involved in the estrogen response could recapitulate cancer cell dependency on EGFR, a phenomenon not solely attributable to EGFR-activating mutations. By correlating genome-wide function screening data with EGFRi responses, we identified chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) as a potential druggable target to mitigate EGFRi resistance. In isogenic cell models, pharmacological inhibition of CCR6 effectively reversed acquired EGFRi resistance, disrupting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, a cellular process commonly associated with therapy resistance. Our data-driven strategy unveils drug-response biomarkers and therapeutic targets for resistance, thus potentially expanding EGFRi applicability and efficacy.© 2024 The Author(s).",2.5092731627184293e-32
38546323,Review and meta-analysis of the genetic Minimal Cut Set approach for gene essentiality prediction in cancer metabolism.,Brief Bioinform,"Cancer metabolism is a marvellously complex topic, in part, due to the reprogramming of its pathways to self-sustain the malignant phenotype in the disease, to the detriment of its healthy counterpart. Understanding these adjustments can provide novel targeted therapies that could disrupt and impair proliferation of cancerous cells. For this very purpose, genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) have been developed, with Human1 being the most recent reconstruction of the human metabolism. Based on GEMs, we introduced the genetic Minimal Cut Set (gMCS) approach, an uncontextualized methodology that exploits the concepts of synthetic lethality to predict metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer. gMCSs define a set of genes whose knockout would render the cell unviable by disrupting an essential metabolic task in GEMs, thus, making cellular proliferation impossible. Here, we summarize the gMCS approach and review the current state of the methodology by performing a systematic meta-analysis based on two datasets of gene essentiality in cancer. First, we assess several thresholds and distinct methodologies for discerning highly and lowly expressed genes. Then, we address the premise that gMCSs of distinct length should have the same predictive power. Finally, we question the importance of a gene partaking in multiple gMCSs and analyze the importance of all the essential metabolic tasks defined in Human1. Our meta-analysis resulted in parameter evaluation to increase the predictive power for the gMCS approach, as well as a significant reduction of computation times by only selecting the crucial gMCS lengths, proposing the pertinency of particular parameters for the peak processing of gMCS.© The Author(s) 2024.

38538696,Pan-cancer evaluation of regulated cell death to predict overall survival and immune checkpoint inhibitor response.,NPJ Precis Oncol,"Regulated cell death (RCD) plays a pivotal role in various biological processes, including development, tissue homeostasis, and immune response. However, a comprehensive assessment of RCD status and its associated features at the pan-cancer level remains unexplored. Furthermore, despite significant advancements in immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), only a fraction of cancer patients currently benefit from treatments. Given the emerging evidence linking RCD and ICI efficacy, we hypothesize that the RCD status could serve as a promising biomarker for predicting the ICI response and overall survival (OS) in patients with malignant tumors. We defined the RCD levels as the RCD score, allowing us to delineate the RCD landscape across 30 cancer types, 29 normal tissues in bulk, and 2,573,921 cells from 82 scRNA-Seq datasets. By leveraging large-scale datasets, we aimed to establish the positive association of RCD with immunity and identify the RCD signature. Utilizing 7 machine-learning algorithms and 18 ICI cohorts, we developed an RCD signature (RCD.Sig) for predicting ICI response. Additionally, we employed 101 combinations of 10 machine-learning algorithms to construct a novel RCD survival-related signature (RCD.Sur.Sig) for predicting OS. Furthermore, we obtained CRISPR data to identify potential therapeutic targets. Our study presents an integrative framework for assessing RCD status and reveals a strong connection between RCD status and ICI effectiveness. Moreover, we establish two clinically applicable signatures and identify promising potential therapeutic targets for patients with tumors.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.6644462283512165e-35
38530197,Induction of Viral Mimicry Upon Loss of DHX9 and ADAR1 in Breast Cancer Cells.,Cancer Res Commun,"Detection of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is an important component of innate immunity. However, many endogenous RNAs containing double-stranded regions can be misrecognized and activate innate immunity. The IFN-inducible ADAR1-p150 suppresses dsRNA sensing, an essential function for adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) in many cancers, including breast. Although ADAR1-p150 has been well established in this role, the functions of the constitutively expressed ADAR1-p110 isoform are less understood. We used proximity labeling to identify putative ADAR1-p110-interacting proteins in breast cancer cell lines. Of the proteins identified, the RNA helicase DHX9 was of particular interest. Knockdown of DHX9 in ADAR1-dependent cell lines caused cell death and activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR. In ADAR1-independent cell lines, combined knockdown of DHX9 and ADAR1, but neither alone, caused activation of multiple dsRNA sensing pathways leading to a viral mimicry phenotype. Together, these results reveal an important role for DHX9 in suppressing dsRNA sensing by multiple pathways.These findings implicate DHX9 as a suppressor of dsRNA sensing. In some cell lines, loss of DHX9 alone is sufficient to cause activation of dsRNA sensing pathways, while in other cell lines DHX9 functions redundantly with ADAR1 to suppress pathway activation.© 2024 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.",1.1989022373009438e-49
38508140,STAT3 couples activated tyrosine kinase signaling to the oncogenic core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of anaplastic large cell lymphoma.,Cell Rep Med,"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is an aggressive, CD30+T cell lymphoma of children and adults. ALK fusion transcripts or mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway are observed in most ALCL tumors, but the mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis are not fully understood. Here, we show that dysregulated STAT3 in ALCL cooccupies enhancers with master transcription factors BATF3, IRF4, and IKZF1 to form a core regulatory circuit that establishes and maintains the malignant cell state in ALCL. Critical downstream targets of this network in ALCL cells include the protooncogene MYC, which requires active STAT3 to facilitate high levels of MYC transcription. The core autoregulatory transcriptional circuitry activity is reinforced by MYC binding to the enhancer regions associated with STAT3 and each of the core regulatory transcription factors. Thus, activation of STAT3 provides the crucial link between aberrant tyrosine kinase signaling and the core transcriptional machinery that drives tumorigenesis and creates therapeutic vulnerabilities in ALCL.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

38506093,Glutamine metabolism prognostic index predicts tumour microenvironment characteristics and therapeutic efficacy in ovarian cancer.,J Cell Mol Med,"Mounting evidence has highlighted the multifunctional characteristics of glutamine metabolism (GM) in cancer initiation, progression and therapeutic regimens. However, the overall role of GM in the tumour microenvironment (TME), clinical stratification and therapeutic efficacy in patients with ovarian cancer (OC) has not been fully elucidated. Here, three distinct GM clusters were identified and exhibited different prognostic values, biological functions and immune infiltration in TME. Subsequently, glutamine metabolism prognostic index (GMPI) was constructed as a new scoring model to quantify the GM subtypes and was verified as an independent predictor of OC. Patients with low-GMPI exhibited favourable survival outcomes, lower enrichment of several oncogenic pathways, less immunosuppressive cell infiltration and better immunotherapy responses. Single-cell sequencing analysis revealed a unique evolutionary trajectory of OC cells from high-GMPI to low-GMPI, and OC cells with different GMPI might communicate with distinct cell populations through ligand-receptor interactions. Critically, the therapeutic efficacy of several drug candidates was validated based on patient-derived organoids (PDOs). The proposed GMPI could serve as a reliable signature for predicting patient prognosis and contribute to optimising therapeutic strategies for OC.© 2024 The Authors.

Roughly 70% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor-positive (ER+). MicroRNA-190b (miR-190b) has previously been reported to be upregulated in ER+ breast cancers. Previously, we have demonstrated that miR-190b is hypomethylated in ER+ breast cancers, potentially leading to its upregulation.To further study the role of miR-190b in ER+ breast cancer and to identify its clinically relevant targets in breast cancer.Patient cohort and cell line-based RNA-sequencing analysis.The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to obtain gene expression data and clinical information on patients with breast cancer. To identify messenger RNA (mRNA) targets for miR-190b, the ER+ breast cancer cell line T-47D was used to immunoprecipitate biotin-labeled miR-190b followed by RNA sequencing. Western blot was used to confirm miR-190b target. Patient survival based on miR-190b and selected target was studied using the Cancer Genome Atlas.In this study, we confirm that miR-190b is overexpressed in breast cancer via differential expression analysis and show that high expression of miR-190b results in more favorable outcomes in Luminal A patients, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.12-0.71,P = .0063. MicroRNA-190b target analysis identified RING finger and WD repeat domain 3 (RFWD3) as one of miR-190b regulatory targets in ER+ breast cancer. Survival analysis of RFWD3 showed that elevated levels result in poorer overall survival in patients with Luminal A breast cancer (HR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.33-3.71,P = .002). Gene ontology analysis of our sequencing results indicates that miR-190b may have a role in breast cancer development and/or tumorigenesis and that it may be a suitable tool in characterization between the ER+ subtypes, Luminal A, and Luminal B.We show that miR-190b targets RFWD3 in ER+ breast cancers leading to lower RFWD3 protein expression. Low levels of RFWD3 are associated with better outcomes in patients with Luminal A breast cancer but not in patients with Luminal B breast cancer. These findings provide novel insights into miR-190b role in breast cancer and that its clinical relevance is subtype specific.© The Author(s) 2024.",4.7016662779551134e-51

It anchors a gene of interest, which often involves driver fusion events, and recovers non-unique matches of short-read sequences that are typically filtered out by conventional algorithms. In addition, Anchored-fusion contains a module based on a deep learning hierarchical structure that incorporates self-distillation learning (hierarchical view learning and distillation [HVLD]), which effectively filters out false positive chimeric fragments generated during sequencing while maintaining true fusion genes. Anchored-fusion enables highly sensitive detection of fusion genes, thus allowing for application in cases with low sequencing depths. We benchmark Anchored-fusion under various conditions and found it outperformed other tools in detecting fusion events in simulated data, bulk RNA sequencing (bRNA-seq) data, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.

Here we used single cell RNA sequencing to studyAPOBEC3AandAPOBEC3Bexpression in healthy and malignant mucosal epithelia, validating key observations with immunohistochemistry, spatial transcriptomics and functional experiments. WhereasAPOBEC3Bis expressed in keratinocytes entering mitosis, we show thatAPOBEC3Aexpression is confined largely to terminally differentiating cells and requires Grainyhead-like transcription factor 3 (GRHL3). Thus, in normal tissue, neither deaminase appears to be expressed at high levels during DNA replication, the cell cycle stage associated with APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis. In contrast, we show that in squamous cell carcinoma tissues, there is expansion ofGRHL3expression and activity to a subset of cells undergoing DNA replication and concomitant extension ofAPOBEC3Aexpression to proliferating cells. These findings indicate a mechanism for acquisition of APOBEC3A mutagenic activity in tumours.",5.042994174432612e-31

Evidence suggests that the risk variants, which show a recessive mode of inheritance, lead to toxic gain-of-function changes of the APOL1 protein. Disease occurrence and presentation vary, likely due to modifiers or second hits. To understand the role of the epigenetic landscape in relation to APOL1 risk variants, we performed methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) analysis to identify differentially methylated CpGs influenced by APOL1 risk variants in 611 African American individuals. We identified five CpGs that were significantly associated with APOL1 risk alleles in discovery and replication studies, and one CpG-APOL1 association was independent of other genomic variants.

Growing evidence points to epigenetic changes as playing a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The dynamic interplay between genetic and environmental factors influences the epigenetic landscape in AD, altering gene expression patterns associated with key pathological events associated with disease pathogenesis. To this end, epigenetic alterations not only impact the expression of genes implicated in AD pathogenesis but also contribute to the dysregulation of crucial cellular processes, including synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Understanding the complex epigenetic mechanisms in AD provides new avenues for therapeutic interventions.

Using antemortem assessments of BPSD in AD, we demonstrate that individual BPSD can be grouped into 4 domain factors in our cohort: affective, apathy, agitation, and psychosis. Then, we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis for each domain utilizing bulk RNA-seq of post-mortem anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) tissues. Though all 4 domains are associated with a predominantly downregulated pattern of hundreds of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), most DEGs are unique to each domain, with only 22 DEGs being common to all BPSD domains, including TIMP1. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) yielded multiple transcriptional modules that were shared between BPSD domains or unique to each domain, and NetDecoder was used to analyze context-dependent information flow through the biological network. For the agitation domain, we found that all DEGs and a highly associated transcriptional module were functionally enriched for ECM-related genes including TIMP1, TAGLN, and FLNA. Another unique transcriptional module also associated with the agitation domain was enriched with genes involved in post-synaptic signaling, including DRD1, PDE1B, CAMK4, and GABRA4. By comparing context-dependent changes in DEGs between cases and control networks, ESR1 and PARK2 were implicated as two high-impact genes associated with agitation that mediated significant information flow through the biological network. Overall, our work establishes unique targets for future study of the biological mechanisms of BPSD and resultant drug development.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.1378854648037766e-25
38546891,An Emerging Role for Enhancer RNAs in Brain Disorders.,Neuromolecular Med,"Noncoding DNA undergoes widespread context-dependent transcription to produce noncoding RNAs. In recent decades, tremendous advances in genomics and transcriptomics have revealed important regulatory roles for noncoding DNA elements and the RNAs that they produce. Enhancers are one such element that are well-established drivers of gene expression changes in response to a variety of factors such as external stimuli, cellular responses, developmental cues, and disease states. They are known to act at long distances, interact with multiple target gene loci simultaneously, synergize with other enhancers, and associate with dynamic chromatin architectures to form a complex regulatory network. Recent advances in enhancer biology have revealed that upon activation, enhancers transcribe long noncoding RNAs, known as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), that have been shown to play important roles in enhancer-mediated gene regulation and chromatin-modifying activities. In the brain, enhancer dysregulation and eRNA transcription has been reported in numerous disorders from acute injuries to chronic neurodegeneration. Because this is an emerging area, a comprehensive understanding of eRNA function has not yet been achieved in brain disorders; however, the findings to date have illuminated a role for eRNAs in activity-driven gene expression and phenotypic outcomes. In this review, we highlight the breadth of the current literature on eRNA biology in brain health and disease and discuss the challenges as well as focus areas and strategies for future in-depth research on eRNAs in brain health and disease.© 2024.

38529500,Sexually dimorphic renal expression of Klotho is directed by a kidney-specific distal enhancer responsive to HNF1b.,bioRxiv,"Transcription enhancers are genomic sequences regulating common and tissue-specific genes and their disruption can contribute to human disease development and progression.Klotho, a sexually dimorphic gene specifically expressed in kidney, is well-linked to kidney dysfunction and its deletion from the mouse genome leads to premature aging and death. However, the sexually dimorphic regulation ofKlothois not understood. Here, we characterize two candidateKlothoenhancers using H3K27ac epigenetic marks and transcription factor binding and investigate their functions, individually and combined, through CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering. We discovered that only the distal (E1), but not the proximal (E2) candidate region constitutes a functional enhancer, with the double deletion not causingKlothoexpression to further decrease. E1 activity is dependent on HNF1b transcription factor binding site within the enhancer. Further, E1 controls the sexual dimorphism ofKlothoas evidenced by qPCR and RNA-seq. Despite the sharp reduction ofKlothomRNA, unlike germlineKlothoknockouts, mutant mice presented normal phenotype, including weight, lifespan, and serum biochemistry. Lastly, only males lacking E1 display more prominent acute, but not chronic kidney injury responses, indicating a remarkable range of potential adaptation to isolatedKlotholoss, especially in female E1 knockouts, retaining renoprotection despite over 80%Klothoreduction.",1.0896913378718107e-35
38528256,The Contributions of Thrombospondin-1 to Epilepsy Formation.,Neurosci Bull,"Epilepsy is a neural network disorder caused by uncontrolled neuronal hyperexcitability induced by an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory networks. Abnormal synaptogenesis plays a vital role in the formation of overexcited networks. Recent evidence has confirmed that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), mainly secreted by astrocytes, is a critical cytokine that regulates synaptogenesis during epileptogenesis. Furthermore, numerous studies have reported that TSP-1 is also involved in other processes, such as angiogenesis, neuroinflammation, and regulation of Ca2+homeostasis, which are closely associated with the occurrence and development of epilepsy. In this review, we summarize the potential contributions of TSP-1 to epilepsy development.© 2024.

38625940,Structure and dynamics of a pentameric KCTD5/CUL3/Gβγ E3 ubiquitin ligase complex.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"Heterotrimeric G proteins can be regulated by posttranslational modifications, including ubiquitylation. KCTD5, a pentameric substrate receptor protein consisting of an N-terminal BTB domain and a C-terminal domain, engages CUL3 to form the central scaffold of a cullin-RING E3 ligase complex (CRL3KCTD5) that ubiquitylates Gβγ and reduces Gβγ protein levels in cells. The cryo-EM structure of a 5:5:5 KCTD5/CUL3NTD/Gβ1γ2assembly reveals a highly dynamic complex with rotations of over 60° between the KCTD5BTB/CUL3NTDand KCTD5CTD/Gβγ moieties of the structure. CRL3KCTD5engages the E3 ligase ARIH1 to ubiquitylate Gβγ in an E3-E3 superassembly, and extension of the structure to include full-length CUL3 with RBX1 and an ARIH1~ubiquitin conjugate reveals that some conformational states position the ARIH1~ubiquitin thioester bond to within 10 Å of lysine-23 of Gβ and likely represent priming complexes. Most previously described CRL/substrate structures have consisted of monovalent complexes and have involved flexible peptide substrates. The structure of the KCTD5/CUL3NTD/Gβγ complex shows that the oligomerization of a substrate receptor can generate a polyvalent E3 ligase complex and that the internal dynamics of the substrate receptor can position a structured target for ubiquitylation in a CRL3 complex.",2.74121408191347e-25
38710707,Genetic influence on within-person longitudinal change in anthropometric traits in the UK Biobank.,Nat Commun,"The causes of temporal fluctuations in adult traits are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the genetic determinants of within-person trait variability of 8 repeatedly measured anthropometric traits in 50,117 individuals from the UK Biobank. We found that within-person (non-directional) variability had a SNP-based heritability of 2-5% for height, sitting height, body mass index (BMI) and weight (P≤2.4 × 10-3). We also analysed longitudinal trait change and show a loss of both average height and weight beyond about 70 years of age. A variant tracking the Alzheimer's risk APOE-E4allele (rs429358) was significantly associated with weight loss (β = -0.047 kg per yr, s.e. 0.007, P = 2.2 × 10-11), and using 2-sample Mendelian Randomisation we detected a relationship consistent with causality between decreased lumbar spine bone mineral density and height loss (bxy = 0.011, s.e. 0.003, P = 3.5 × 10-4). Finally, population-level variance quantitative trait loci (vQTL) were consistent with within-person variability for several traits, indicating an overlap between trait variability assessed at the population or individual level. Our findings help elucidate the genetic influence on trait-change within an individual and highlight disease risks associated with these changes.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.665392255368176e-07
38540988,Machine Learning Prediction of Treatment Response to Inhaled Corticosteroids in Asthma.,J Pers Med,"Although inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the first-line therapy for patients with persistent asthma, many patients continue to have exacerbations. We developed machine learning models to predict the ICS response in patients with asthma.The subjects included asthma patients of European ancestry (n= 1371; 448 children; 916 adults). A genome-wide association study was performed to identify the SNPs associated with ICS response. Using the SNPs identified, two machine learning models were developed to predict ICS response: (1) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and (2) random forest.The LASSO regression model achieved an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.67-0.76; sensitivity: 0.57; specificity: 0.75) in an independent test cohort, and the random forest model achieved an AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.70-0.78; sensitivity: 0.70; specificity: 0.68). The genes contributing to the prediction of ICS response included those associated with ICS responses in asthma (TPSAB1, FBXL16), asthma symptoms and severity (ABCA7, CNN2, PTRN3,andBSG/CD147), airway remodeling (ELANE, FSTL3), mucin production (GAL3ST), leukotriene synthesis (GPX4), allergic asthma (ZFPM1, SBNO2), and others.An accurate risk prediction of ICS response can be obtained using machine learning methods, with the potential to inform personalized treatment decisions. Further studies are needed to examine if the integration of richer phenotype data could improve risk prediction.",1.0127536624594339e-13
38658973,DNA methylation of imprint control regions associated with Alzheimer's disease in non-Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites.,Clin Epigenetics,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence is twice as high in non-Hispanic Blacks (NHBs) as in non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). The objective of this study was to determine whether aberrant methylation at imprint control regions (ICRs) is associated with AD. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were bioinformatically identified from whole-genome bisulfite sequenced DNA derived from brain tissue of 9 AD (5 NHBs and 4 NHWs) and 8 controls (4 NHBs and 4 NHWs). We identified DMRs located within 120 regions defined as candidate ICRs in the human imprintome ( https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/imprintome/hg38.AD.Brain_track ). Eighty-one ICRs were differentially methylated in NHB-AD, and 27 ICRs were differentially methylated in NHW-AD, with two regions common to both populations that are proximal to the inflammasome gene, NLRP1, and a known imprinted gene, MEST/MESTIT1. These findings indicate that early developmental alterations in DNA methylation of regions regulating genomic imprinting may contribute to AD risk and that this epigenetic risk differs between NHBs and NHWs.© 2024.

38514698,DNA methylation fine-tunes pro-and anti-inflammatory signalling pathways in inactive ulcerative colitis tissue biopsies.,Sci Rep,"DNA methylation has been implied to play a role in the immune dysfunction associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the disease development of ulcerative colitis (UC). Changes of the DNA methylation and correlated gene expression in patient samples with inactive UC might reveal possible regulatory features important for further treatment options for UC. Targeted bisulfite sequencing and whole transcriptome sequencing were performed on mucosal biopsies from patients with active UC (UC, n = 14), inactive UC (RM, n = 20), and non-IBD patients which served as controls (NN, n = 11). The differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified by DMRseq. Correlation analysis was performed between DMRs and their nearest differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed based on correlated DMR regulated genes. DMR regulated genes then were functional annotated. Cell-type deconvolutions were performed based on methylation levels. The comparisons revealed a total of 38 methylation-regulated genes in inactive UC that are potentially regulated by DMRs (correlation p value < 0.1). Several methylation-regulated genes could be identified in inactive UC participating in IL-10 and cytokine signalling pathways such as IL1B and STAT3. DNA methylation events in inactive UC seem to be fine-tuned by the balancing pro- and anti- inflammatory pathways to maintain a prevailed healing process to restore dynamic epithelium homeostasis.© 2024.

38744814,Disentangling oncogenic amplicons in esophageal adenocarcinoma.,Nat Commun,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma is a prominent example of cancer characterized by frequent amplifications in oncogenes. However, the mechanisms leading to amplicons that involve breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and extrachromosomal DNA are poorly understood. Here, we use 710 esophageal adenocarcinoma cases with matched samples and patient-derived organoids to disentangle complex amplicons and their associated mechanisms. Short-read sequencing identifies ERBB2, MYC, MDM2, and HMGA2 as the most frequent oncogenes amplified in extrachromosomal DNAs. We resolve complex extrachromosomal DNA and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles amplicons by integrating of de-novo assemblies and DNA methylation in nine long-read sequenced cases. Complex amplicons shared between precancerous biopsy and late-stage tumor, an enrichment of putative enhancer elements and mobile element insertions are potential drivers of complex amplicons' origin. We find that patient-derived organoids recapitulate extrachromosomal DNA observed in the primary tumors and single-cell DNA sequencing capture extrachromosomal DNA-driven clonal dynamics across passages. Prospectively, long-read and single-cell DNA sequencing technologies can lead to better prediction of clonal evolution in esophageal adenocarcinoma.© 2024. The Author(s).",6.385899199429802e-34
38744869,Multi-omics integration of scRNA-seq time series data predicts new intervention points for Parkinson's disease.,Sci Rep,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder without a cure. The onset of PD symptoms corresponds to 50% loss of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons, limiting early-stage understanding of PD. To shed light on early PD development, we study time series scRNA-seq datasets of mDA neurons obtained from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation. We develop a new data integration method based on Non-negative Matrix Tri-Factorization that integrates these datasets with molecular interaction networks, producing condition-specific ""gene embeddings"". By mining these embeddings, we predict 193 PD-related genes that are largely supported (49.7%) in the literature and are specific to the investigated PINK1 mutation. Enrichment analysis in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways highlights 10 PD-related molecular mechanisms perturbed during early PD development. Finally, investigating the top 20 prioritized genes reveals 12 previously unrecognized genes associated with PD that represent interesting drug targets.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.4710893528721315e-31
38711017,Data normalization for addressing the challenges in the analysis of single-cell transcriptomic datasets.,BMC Genomics,"Normalization is a critical step in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. Its main goal is to make gene counts comparable within and between cells. To do so, normalization methods must account for technical and biological variability. Numerous normalization methods have been developed addressing different sources of dispersion and making specific assumptions about the count data.The selection of a normalization method has a direct impact on downstream analysis, for example differential gene expression and cluster identification. Thus, the objective of this review is to guide the reader in making an informed decision on the most appropriate normalization method to use. To this aim, we first give an overview of the different single cell sequencing platforms and methods commonly used including isolation and library preparation protocols. Next, we discuss the inherent sources of variability of scRNA-seq datasets. We describe the categories of normalization methods and include examples of each. We also delineate imputation and batch-effect correction methods. Furthermore, we describe data-driven metrics commonly used to evaluate the performance of normalization methods. We also discuss common scRNA-seq methods and toolkits used for integrated data analysis.According to the correction performed, normalization methods can be broadly classified as within and between-sample algorithms. Moreover, with respect to the mathematical model used, normalization methods can further be classified into: global scaling methods, generalized linear models, mixed methods, and machine learning-based methods. Each of these methods depict pros and cons and make different statistical assumptions. However, there is no better performing normalization method. Instead, metrics such as silhouette width, K-nearest neighbor batch-effect test, or Highly Variable Genes are recommended to assess the performance of normalization methods.© 2024.

38695952,Characterisation of premature cell senescence in Alzheimer's disease using single nuclear transcriptomics.,Acta Neuropathol,"Aging is associated with cell senescence and is the major risk factor for AD. We characterized premature cell senescence in postmortem brains from non-diseased controls (NDC) and donors with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and single nuclear RNA (snRNA) sequencing (> 200,000 nuclei). We found increases in numbers of glia immunostaining for galactosidase beta (> fourfold) and p16INK4A(up to twofold) with AD relative to NDC. Increased glial expression of genes related to senescence was associated with greater β-amyloid load. Prematurely senescent microglia downregulated phagocytic pathways suggesting reduced capacity for β-amyloid clearance. Gene set enrichment and pseudo-time trajectories described extensive DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress associated with increased β-amyloid leading to premature senescence in microglia. We replicated these observations with independent AD snRNA-seq datasets. Our results describe a burden of senescent glia with AD that is sufficiently high to contribute to disease progression. These findings support the hypothesis that microglia are a primary target for senolytic treatments in AD.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.6294563432707193e-32
38689234,The effect of data transformation on low-dimensional integration of single-cell RNA-seq.,BMC Bioinformatics,"Recent developments in single-cell RNA sequencing have opened up a multitude of possibilities to study tissues at the level of cellular populations. However, the heterogeneity in single-cell sequencing data necessitates appropriate procedures to adjust for technological limitations and various sources of noise when integrating datasets from different studies. While many analysis procedures employ various preprocessing steps, they often overlook the importance of selecting and optimizing the employed data transformation methods.This work investigates data transformation approaches used in single-cell clustering analysis tools and their effects on batch integration analysis. In particular, we compare 16 transformations and their impact on the low-dimensional representations, aiming to reduce the batch effect and integrate multiple single-cell sequencing data. Our results show that data transformations strongly influence the results of single-cell clustering on low-dimensional data space, such as those generated by UMAP or PCA. Moreover, these changes in low-dimensional space significantly affect trajectory analysis using multiple datasets, as well. However, the performance of the data transformations greatly varies across datasets, and the optimal method was different for each dataset. Additionally, we explored how data transformation impacts the analysis of deep feature encodings using deep neural network-based models, including autoencoder-based models and proto-typical networks. Data transformation also strongly affects the outcome of deep neural network models.Our findings suggest that the batch effect and noise in integrative analysis are highly influenced by data transformation. Low-dimensional features can integrate different batches well when proper data transformation is applied. Furthermore, we found that the batch mixing score on low-dimensional space can guide the selection of the optimal data transformation. In conclusion, data preprocessing is one of the most crucial analysis steps and needs to be cautiously considered in the integrative analysis of multiple scRNA-seq datasets.© 2024.

However, we still know little about their emergence and diversification. We used the zebrafish D. rerio as a distant vertebrate model with moderate glial diversity as anchor to reanalyze datasets covering over 600 million years of evolution. We identify core features of adult neurogenesis and innovations in the mammalian lineage with a potential link to the rarity of radial glia-like cells in adult humans. Our results also suggest that functions associated with astrocytes originated in a multifunctional cell type fulfilling both neural stem cell and astrocytic functions before these diverged. Finally, we identify conserved elements of macroglial cell identity and function and their time of emergence during evolution.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.640228151649883e-25
38557675,SpatialcoGCN: deconvolution and spatial information-aware simulation of spatial transcriptomics data via deep graph co-embedding.,Brief Bioinform,"Spatial transcriptomics (ST) data have emerged as a pivotal approach to comprehending the function and interplay of cells within intricate tissues. Nonetheless, analyses of ST data are restricted by the low spatial resolution and limited number of ribonucleic acid transcripts that can be detected with several popular ST techniques. In this study, we propose that both of the above issues can be significantly improved by introducing a deep graph co-embedding framework. First, we establish a self-supervised, co-graph convolution network-based deep learning model termed SpatialcoGCN, which leverages single-cell data to deconvolve the cell mixtures in spatial data. Evaluations of SpatialcoGCN on a series of simulated ST data and real ST datasets from human ductal carcinoma in situ, developing human heart and mouse brain suggest that SpatialcoGCN could outperform other state-of-the-art cell type deconvolution methods in estimating per-spot cell composition. Moreover, with competitive accuracy, SpatialcoGCN could also recover the spatial distribution of transcripts that are not detected by raw ST data. With a similar co-embedding framework, we further established a spatial information-aware ST data simulation method, SpatialcoGCN-Sim. SpatialcoGCN-Sim could generate simulated ST data with high similarity to real datasets. Together, our approaches provide efficient tools for studying the spatial organization of heterogeneous cells within complex tissues.© The Author(s) 2024.

38504113,scPROTEIN: a versatile deep graph contrastive learning framework for single-cell proteomics embedding.,Nat Methods,"Single-cell proteomics sequencing technology sheds light on protein-protein interactions, posttranslational modifications and proteoform dynamics in the cell. However, the uncertainty estimation for peptide quantification, data missingness, batch effects and high noise hinder the analysis of single-cell proteomic data. It is important to solve this set of tangled problems together, but the existing methods tailored for single-cell transcriptomes cannot fully address this task. Here we propose a versatile framework designed for single-cell proteomics data analysis called scPROTEIN, which consists of peptide uncertainty estimation based on a multitask heteroscedastic regression model and cell embedding generation based on graph contrastive learning. scPROTEIN can estimate the uncertainty of peptide quantification, denoise protein data, remove batch effects and encode single-cell proteomic-specific embeddings in a unified framework. We demonstrate that scPROTEIN is efficient for cell clustering, batch correction, cell type annotation, clinical analysis and spatially resolved proteomic data exploration.© 2024.

38495443,Progress in single-cell multimodal sequencing and multi-omics data integration.,Biophys Rev,"With the rapid advance of single-cell sequencing technology, cell heterogeneity in various biological processes was dissected at different omics levels. However, single-cell mono-omics results in fragmentation of information and could not provide complete cell states. In the past several years, a variety of single-cell multimodal omics technologies have been developed to jointly profile multiple molecular modalities, including genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome, from the same single cell. With the availability of single-cell multimodal omics data, we can simultaneously investigate the effects of genomic mutation or epigenetic modification on transcription and translation, and reveal the potential mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis. Driven by the massive single-cell omics data, the integration method of single-cell multi-omics data has rapidly developed. Integration of the massive multi-omics single-cell data in public databases in the future will make it possible to construct a cell atlas of multi-omics, enabling us to comprehensively understand cell state and gene regulation at single-cell resolution.

Maternal body composition was assessed using bioimpedance analysis between 14 and 22 weeks of gestation.Among the 1508 participants, a total of 1420 individuals (94.2%) were diagnosed with dyslipidemia. Notably, there were significant differences in body composition between the normal lipid group and the dyslipidemia group.

All participants were assessed for the severity of panic symptoms using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS). The expression of HPA-axis genes was measured using real-time quantitative fluorescent PCR, and ACTH and cortisol levels were measured using chemiluminescence at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment.At baseline, patients with PD had elevated levels of ACTH and cortisol, and FKBP51 expression in comparison to healthy controls (all p < 0.01). Correlation analysis revealed that FKBP51 expression levels were significantly positively related to cortisol levels and the severity of PD (all p < 0.01). Furthermore, baseline ACTH and cortisol levels, and FKBP51 expression levels were significantly reduced after 12 weeks of treatment, and the change in the PDSS score from baseline to post-treatment was significantly and positively related to the change in cortisol (p < 0.01).The results suggest that PD may be associated with elevated levels of ACTH and cortisol, and FKBP51 expression, and that all three biomarkers are substantially decreased in patients who have received escitalopram treatment.© 2024.

While current treatments for AUD have provided relief to individuals, their effectiveness on the long term is often limited, leaving a number of affected individuals without sustainable solutions.

By examining preclinical studies, different animal species and procedures, we delve into the potential benefits of each of these treatments in terms of addictive behaviors (alcohol drinking and seeking, motivation to drink alcohol and prevention of relapse). Because psychedelics and epidrugs may share common and complementary mechanisms of action, there is an exciting opportunity for exploring synergies between these approaches and their parallel effectiveness in treating AUD and the diverse associated psychiatric conditions.© 2024.

38528631,Head and neck cancer of unknown primary: unveiling primary tumor sites through machine learning on DNA methylation profiles.,Clin Epigenetics,"The unknown tissue of origin in head and neck cancer of unknown primary (hnCUP) leads to invasive diagnostic procedures and unspecific and potentially inefficient treatment options for patients. The most common histologic subtype, squamous cell carcinoma, can stem from various tumor primary sites, including the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, head and neck skin, lungs, and esophagus. DNA methylation profiles are highly tissue-specific and have been successfully used to classify tissue origin. We therefore developed a support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained with publicly available DNA methylation profiles of commonly cervically metastasizing squamous cell carcinomas (n = 1103) in order to identify the primary tissue of origin of our own cohort of squamous cell hnCUP patient's samples (n = 28). Methylation analysis was performed with Infinium MethylationEPIC v1.0 BeadChip by Illumina.The SVM algorithm achieved the highest overall accuracy of tested classifiers, with 87%. Squamous cell hnCUP samples on DNA methylation level resembled squamous cell carcinomas commonly metastasizing into cervical lymph nodes. The most frequently predicted cancer localization was the oral cavity in 11 cases (39%), followed by the oropharynx and larynx (both 7, 25%), skin (2, 7%), and esophagus (1, 4%). These frequencies concord with the expected distribution of lymph node metastases in epidemiological studies.On DNA methylation level, hnCUP is comparable to primary tumor tissue cancer types that commonly metastasize to cervical lymph nodes. Our SVM-based classifier can accurately predict these cancers' tissues of origin and could significantly reduce the invasiveness of hnCUP diagnostics and enable a more precise therapy after clinical validation.© 2024.

38665176,Neuroimmune mechanisms in autism etiology - untangling a complex problem using human cellular models.,Oxf Open Neurosci,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 36 people and is more often diagnosed in males than in females. Core features of ASD are impaired social interactions, repetitive behaviors and deficits in verbal communication. ASD is a highly heterogeneous and heritable disorder, yet its underlying genetic causes account only for up to 80% of the cases. Hence, a subset of ASD cases could be influenced by environmental risk factors. Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a response to inflammation during pregnancy, which can lead to increased inflammatory signals to the fetus. Inflammatory signals can cross the placenta and blood brain barriers affecting fetal brain development. Epidemiological and animal studies suggest that MIA could contribute to ASD etiology. However, human mechanistic studies have been hindered by a lack of experimental systems that could replicate the impact of MIA during fetal development. Therefore, mechanisms altered by inflammation during human pre-natal brain development, and that could underlie ASD pathogenesis have been largely understudied. The advent of human cellular models with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and organoid technology is closing this gap in knowledge by providing both access to molecular manipulations and culturing capability of tissue that would be otherwise inaccessible. We present an overview of multiple levels of evidence from clinical, epidemiological, and cellular studies that provide a potential link between higher ASD risk and inflammation. More importantly, we discuss how stem cell-derived models may constitute an ideal experimental system to mechanistically interrogate the effect of inflammation during the early stages of brain development.© The Author(s) 2024.

38730241,Comprehensive assessment of mRNA isoform detection methods for long-read sequencing data.,Nat Commun,"The advancement of Long-Read Sequencing (LRS) techniques has significantly increased the length of sequencing to several kilobases, thereby facilitating the identification of alternative splicing events and isoform expressions. Recently, numerous computational tools for isoform detection using long-read sequencing data have been developed. Nevertheless, there remains a deficiency in comparative studies that systemically evaluate the performance of these tools, which are implemented with different algorithms, under various simulations that encompass potential influencing factors. In this study, we conducted a benchmark analysis of thirteen methods implemented in nine tools capable of identifying isoform structures from long-read RNA-seq data. We evaluated their performances using simulated data, which represented diverse sequencing platforms generated by an in-house simulator, RNA sequins (sequencing spike-ins) data, as well as experimental data. Our findings demonstrate IsoQuant as a highly effective tool for isoform detection with LRS, with Bambu and StringTie2 also exhibiting strong performance. These results offer valuable guidance for future research on alternative splicing analysis and the ongoing improvement of tools for isoform detection using LRS data.© 2024.

38647153,A comparative benchmarking and evaluation framework for heterogeneous network-based drug repositioning methods.,Brief Bioinform,"Computational drug repositioning, which involves identifying new indications for existing drugs, is an increasingly attractive research area due to its advantages in reducing both overall cost and development time. As a result, a growing number of computational drug repositioning methods have emerged. Heterogeneous network-based drug repositioning methods have been shown to outperform other approaches. However, there is a dearth of systematic evaluation studies of these methods, encompassing performance, scalability and usability, as well as a standardized process for evaluating new methods. Additionally, previous studies have only compared several methods, with conflicting results. In this context, we conducted a systematic benchmarking study of 28 heterogeneous network-based drug repositioning methods on 11 existing datasets. We developed a comprehensive framework to evaluate their performance, scalability and usability. Our study revealed that methods such as HGIMC, ITRPCA and BNNR exhibit the best overall performance, as they rely on matrix completion or factorization. HINGRL, MLMC, ITRPCA and HGIMC demonstrate the best performance, while NMFDR, GROBMC and SCPMF display superior scalability. For usability, HGIMC, DRHGCN and BNNR are the top performers. Building on these findings, we developed an online tool called HN-DREP (http://hn-drep.lyhbio.com/) to facilitate researchers in viewing all the detailed evaluation results and selecting the appropriate method. HN-DREP also provides an external drug repositioning prediction service for a specific disease or drug by integrating predictions from all methods. Furthermore, we have released a Snakemake workflow named HN-DRES (https://github.com/lyhbio/HN-DRES) to facilitate benchmarking and support the extension of new methods into the field.© The Author(s) 2024.

38683846,"Identification of bone mineral density associated genes with shared genetic architectures across multiple tissues: Functional insights for EPDR1, PKDCC, and SPTBN1.",PLoS One,"Recent studies suggest a shared genetic architecture between muscle and bone, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. This study aims to identify the functionally annotated genes with shared genetic architecture between muscle and bone using the most up-to-date genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics from bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture-related genetic variants. We employed an advanced statistical functional mapping method to investigate shared genetic architecture between muscle and bone, focusing on genes highly expressed in muscle tissue. Our analysis identified three genes, EPDR1, PKDCC, and SPTBN1, which are highly expressed in muscle tissue and previously unlinked to bone metabolism. About 90% and 85% of filtered Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms were in the intronic and intergenic regions for the threshold at P≤5×10-8 and P≤5×10-100, respectively. EPDR1 was highly expressed in multiple tissues, including muscles, adrenal glands, blood vessels, and the thyroid. SPTBN1 was highly expressed in all 30 tissue types except blood, while PKDCC was highly expressed in all 30 tissue types except the brain, pancreas, and skin. Our study provides a framework for using GWAS findings to highlight functional evidence of crosstalk between multiple tissues based on shared genetic architecture between muscle and bone. Further research should focus on functional validation, multi-omics data integration, gene-environment interactions, and clinical relevance in musculoskeletal disorders.Copyright: © 2024 Jung, Wu.

38524697,An artificial intelligence model for embryo selection in preimplantation DNA methylation screening in assisted reproductive technology.,Biophys Rep,"Embryo quality is a critical determinant of clinical outcomes in assisted reproductive technology (ART). A recent clinical trial investigating preimplantation DNA methylation screening (PIMS) revealed that whole genome DNA methylation level is a novel biomarker for assessing ART embryo quality. Here, we reinforced and estimated the clinical efficacy of PIMS. We introduce PIMS-AI, an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) based model, to predict the probability of an embryo producing live birth and subsequently assist ART embryo selection. Our model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 in cross-validation and 0.80 in independent testing. In simulated embryo selection, PIMS-AI attained an accuracy of 81% in identifying viable embryos for patients. Notably, PIMS-AI offers significant advantages over conventional preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A), including enhanced embryo discriminability and the potential to benefit a broader patient population. In conclusion, our approach holds substantial promise for clinical application and has the potential to significantly improve the ART success rate.© The Author(s) 2023.",8.112998591246808e-19
38610915,Association of Obesity with Telomere Length in Human Sperm.,J Clin Med,"Background:Telomere attrition and mitochondrial dysfunction are two fundamental aspects of aging. Calorie restriction (CR) is the best strategy to postpone aging since it can enhance telomere attrition, boost antioxidant capacity, and lower the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since ROS is produced by mitochondria and can readily travel to cell nuclei, it is thought to be a crucial molecule for information transfer between mitochondria and cell nuclei. Important variables that affect the quality and functionality of sperm and may affect male reproductive health and fertility include telomere length, mitochondrial content, and the ratio of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to nuclear DNA (nDNA). Telomere damage results from mitochondrial failure, whereas nuclear DNA remains unaffected. This research aims to investigate potential associations between these three variables and how they might relate to body mass index.Methods:Data were collected from 82 men who underwent IVF/ICSI at the University Hospital of Ioannina's IVF Unit in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department. Evaluations included sperm morphology, sperm count, sperm motility, and participant history. To address this, male participants who were categorized into three body mass index (ΒΜΙ) groups-normal, overweight, and obese-had their sperm samples tested.Results:For both the normal and overweight groups, our results show a negative connection between relative telomere length and ΒΜI. As an illustration of a potential connection between mitochondrial health and telomere maintenance, a positive correlation was found for the obese group. Only the obese group's results were statistically significant (p< 0.05). More evidence that longer telomeres are associated with lower mitochondrial content can be found in the negative connection between telomere length and mitochondrial content in both the normal and overweight groups. However, the obese group showed a positive association. The data did not reach statistical significance for any of the three groups. These associations may affect sperm quality since telomere length and mitochondrial concentration are indicators of cellular integrity and health. Moreover, the ratio of mtDNA to nDNA was positively correlated with the relative telomere lengths of the obese group, but negatively correlated with the normal and overweight groups. In every group that was studied, the results were not statistically significant. According to this, male fertility may be negatively impacted by an imbalance in the copy number of the mitochondrial genome compared to the nuclear DNA in sperm.Conclusions:Essentially, the goal of our work is to determine whether mitochondria and telomere length in human sperm interact. Understanding these connections may aid in the explanation of some male infertility causes and possibly contribute to the creation of new treatment modalities for problems pertaining to reproductive health. The functional implications of these connections and their applications in therapeutic settings require further investigation.",9.589543878088917e-52

The aim of this study was to analyze the pregnancy period, perinatal period, and infancy period risk factors for IBD in a well-characterized birth cohort from Northern Finland.The Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966) population comprises mothers living in the two northernmost provinces of Finland, Oulu, and Lapland, with dates of delivery between Jan 1st and Dec 31st, 1966 (12 055 mothers, 12 058 live-born children, 96.3% of all births during 1966). IBD patients were identified using hospital registries (from 1966 to 2020) and Social Insurance Institution (SII) registry reimbursement data for IBD drugs (from 1978 to 2016). The data were analyzed by Fisher's exact test and logistic regression.In total, 6972 individuals provided informed consent for the use of combined SII and hospital registry data.

38723244,IL21R hypomethylation as a biomarker for distinguishing benign and malignant breast tumours.,Epigenetics,"Some benign and malignant breast tumours are similar in pathological morphology, which are difficult to be distinguished in clinical diagnosis. In this study, we intended to explore novel biomarkers for differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast tumours. Methylation EPIC 850K beadchip and RNA-sequencing were used to analyse 29 tissue samples from patients with early-stage breast cancer (BC) and benign breast tumours for differently methylated and expressed genes. The altered methylation ofIL21Rwas semi-quantitatively validated in an independent study with 566 tissue samples (279 BC vs. 287 benign breast tumours) using mass spectrometry. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association betweenIL21Rmethylation and BC. BC-associatedIL21Rhypomethylation and overexpression were identified in the discovery round. In the validation round, BC patients presented significantIL21Rhypomethylation compared to women with benign breast tumours (ORs ≥1.29 per-10% methylation,p-values ≤ 5.69E-14), and this hypomethylation was even enhanced in BC patients with ER-negative and PR-negative tumours as well as with triple-negative tumours. The methylation ofIL21Rshowed efficient discriminatory power to distinguish benign breast tumours from BC (area under curve (AUC) = 0.88), and especially from ER-negative BC (AUC = 0.95), PR-negative BC (AUC = 0.93) and triple-negative BC (AUC = 0.96). We disclosed significantIL21Rhypomethylation in patients with BC compared to women with benign breast tumours, and revealed the somatic change of DNA methylation could be a potential biomarker for molecular pathology of BC.",7.446311996222069e-22
38643219,Discovery and technical validation of high-performance methylated DNA markers for the detection of cervical lesions at risk of malignant progression in low- and middle-income countries.,Clin Epigenetics,"Cervical cancer remains a leading cause of death, particularly in developing countries. WHO screening guidelines recommend human papilloma virus (HPV) detection as a means to identify women at risk of developing cervical cancer. While HPV testing identifies those at risk, it does not specifically distinguish individuals with neoplasia. We investigated whether a quantitative molecular test that measures methylated DNA markers could identify high-risk lesions in the cervix with accuracy.Marker discovery was performed in TCGA-CESC Infinium Methylation 450 K Array database and verified in three other public datasets. The panel was technically validated using Quantitative Multiplex-Methylation-Specific PCR in tissue sections (N = 252) and cervical smears (N = 244) from the USA, South Africa, and Vietnam. The gene panel consisted of FMN2, EDNRB, ZNF671, TBXT, and MOS. Cervical tissue samples from all three countries showed highly significant differential methylation in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with a sensitivity of 100% [95% CI 74.12-100.00], and specificity of 91% [95% CI 62.26-99.53] to 96% [95% CI 79.01-99.78], and receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) = 1.000 [95% CI 1.00-1.00] compared to benign cervical tissue, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 with sensitivity of 55% [95% CI 37.77-70.84] to 89% [95% CI 67.20-98.03], specificity of 93% [95% CI 84.07-97.38] to 96% [95% CI 79.01-99.78], and a ROC AUC ranging from 0.793 [95% CI 0.68-0.89] to 0.99 [95% CI 0.97-1.00] compared to CIN1. In cervical smears, the marker panel detected SCC with a sensitivity of 87% [95% CI 77.45-92.69], specificity 95% [95% CI 88.64-98.18], and ROC AUC = 0.925 [95% CI 0.878-0.974] compared to normal, and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) at a sensitivity of 70% (95% CI 58.11-80.44), specificity of 94% (95% CI 88.30-97.40), and ROC AUC = 0.884 (95% CI 0.822-0.945) compared to low-grade intraepithelial lesion (LSIL)/normal in an analysis of pooled data from the three countries. Similar to HPV-positive, HPV-negative cervical carcinomas were frequently hypermethylated for these markers.This 5-marker panel detected SCC and HSIL in cervical smears with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Molecular tests with the ability to rapidly detect high-risk HSIL will lead to timely treatment for those in need and prevent unnecessary procedures in women with low-risk lesions throughout the world. Validation of these markers in prospectively collected cervical smear cells followed by the development of a hypermethylated marker-based cervical cancer detection test is warranted.© 2024.

DNA methylation is thought to mediate the effects of social status on gene expression and phenotypic outcomes, yet a study of social status-specific DNA methylation profiles in different age classes in a wild social mammal is missing. We tested for social status signatures in DNA methylation profiles in wild female spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), cubs and adults, using non-invasively collected gut epithelium samples. In spotted hyena clans, female social status influences access to resources, foraging behavior, health, reproductive performance and survival. We identified 149 differentially methylated regions between 42 high- and low-ranking female spotted hyenas (cubs and adults). Differentially methylated genes were associated with energy conversion, immune function, glutamate receptor signalling and ion transport. Our results provide evidence that socio-environmental inequalities are reflected at the molecular level in cubs and adults in a wild social mammal.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.0

38531929,Genetic similarity between relatives provides evidence on the presence and history of assortative mating.,Nat Commun,"Assortative mating - the non-random mating of individuals with similar traits - is known to increase trait-specific genetic variance and genetic similarity between relatives. However, empirical evidence is limited for many traits, and the implications hinge on whether assortative mating has started recently or many generations ago. Here we show theoretically and empirically that genetic similarity between relatives can provide evidence on the presence and history of assortative mating. First, we employed path analysis to understand how assortative mating affects genetic similarity between family members across generations, finding that similarity between distant relatives is more affected than close relatives. Next, we correlated polygenic indices of 47,135 co-parents from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and found genetic evidence of assortative mating in nine out of sixteen examined traits. The same traits showed elevated similarity between relatives, especially distant relatives. Six of the nine traits, including educational attainment, showed greater genetic variance among offspring, which is inconsistent with stable assortative mating over many generations. These results suggest an ongoing increase in familial similarity for these traits. The implications of this research extend to genetic methodology and the understanding of social and economic disparities.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.7400360979170592e-29

Recent technological advances have facilitated large-scale hPS cell studies that allow investigation of the genetic regulation of molecular phenotypes and their contribution to high-order phenotypes such as human disease. Integrating hPS cells with single-cell sequencing makes identifying context-dependent genetic effects during cell development or upon experimental manipulation possible. Here we discuss how the intersection of stem cell biology, population genetics and cellular genomics can help resolve the functional consequences of human genetic variation. We examine the critical challenges of integrating these fields and approaches to scaling them cost-effectively and practically. We highlight two areas of human biology that can particularly benefit from population-scale hPS cell studies, elucidating mechanisms underlying complex disease risk loci and evaluating relationships between common genetic variation and pharmacotherapeutic phenotypes.© 2024.

Building enhancer-gene maps is essential but challenging with current experimental methods in primary human tissues. Here we developed a nonparametric statistical method, SCENT (single-cell enhancer target gene mapping), that models association between enhancer chromatin accessibility and gene expression in single-cell or nucleus multimodal RNA sequencing and ATAC sequencing data. We applied SCENT to 9 multimodal datasets including >120,000 single cells or nuclei and created 23 cell-type-specific enhancer-gene maps. These maps were highly enriched for causal variants in expression quantitative loci and GWAS for 1,143 diseases and traits. We identified likely causal genes for both common and rare diseases and linked somatic mutation hotspots to target genes. We demonstrate that application of SCENT to multimodal data from disease-relevant human tissue enables the scalable construction of accurate cell-type-specific enhancer-gene maps, essential for defining noncoding variant function.© 2024.

Defining the genetic control of gene expression in a cell-type-specific and context-dependent manner is critical for understanding the mechanisms through which genetic variation influences complex traits and disease pathobiology. To this end, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of lung tissue from 66 individuals with pulmonary fibrosis and 48 unaffected donors. Using a pseudobulk approach, we mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across 38 cell types, observing both shared and cell-type-specific regulatory effects. Furthermore, we identified disease interaction eQTLs and demonstrated that this class of associations is more likely to be cell-type-specific and linked to cellular dysregulation in pulmonary fibrosis. Finally, we connected lung disease risk variants to their regulatory targets in disease-relevant cell types. These results indicate that cellular context determines the impact of genetic variation on gene expression and implicates context-specific eQTLs as key regulators of lung homeostasis and disease.© 2024.

A comprehensive immune cell phenotype evaluation in T1DM has not been performed thus far at the single-cell level.In this cross-sectional analysis, we generated a single-cell transcriptomic dataset of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 46 manifest T1DM (stage 3) cases and 31 matched controls.We surprisingly detected profound alterations in circulatory immune cells (1784 dysregulated genes in 13 immune cell types), far exceeding the count in the comparator systemic autoimmune disease SLE. Genes upregulated in T1DM were involved in WNT signaling, interferon signaling and migration of T/NK cells, antigen presentation by B cells, and monocyte activation. A significant fraction of these differentially expressed genes were also altered in T1DM pancreatic islets. We used the single-cell data to construct a T1DM metagene z-score (TMZ score) that distinguished cases and controls and classified patients into molecular subtypes. This score correlated with known prognostic immune markers of T1DM, as well as with drug response in clinical trials.Our study reveals a surprisingly strong systemic dimension at the level of immune cell network in T1DM, defines disease-relevant molecular subtypes, and has the potential to guide non-invasive test development and patient stratification.© 2024.

They are typically derived via penalised regression, whereby a linear weighted sum of DNA methylation (DNAm) levels at CpG sites are predictive of protein levels. Here, we examine 84 previously published protein EpiScores as possible biomarkers of cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of general cognitive function and brain health, and incident dementia across three independent cohorts.Using 84 protein EpiScores as candidate biomarkers, associations with general cognitive function (both cross-sectionally and longitudinally) were tested in three independent cohorts: Generation Scotland (GS), and the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 (LBC1921 and LBC1936, respectively). A meta-analysis of general cognitive functioning results in all three cohorts identified 18 EpiScore associations (absolute meta-analytic standardised estimates ranged from 0.03 to 0.14, median of 0.04, PFDR < 0.05). Several associations were also observed between EpiScores and global brain volumetric measures in the LBC1936. An EpiScore for the S100A9 protein (a known Alzheimer disease biomarker) was associated with general cognitive functioning (meta-analytic standardised beta: - 0.06, P = 1.3 × 10-9), and with time-to-dementia in GS (Hazard ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.44, P = 0.003), but not in LBC1936 (Hazard ratio 1.11, P = 0.32).EpiScores might make a contribution to the risk profile of poor general cognitive function and global brain health, and risk of dementia, however these scores require replication in further studies.© 2024.

To identify cell type-specific alterations to cytosine modifications in pediatric central nervous system tumors, we utilize a multi-omic approach that integrated bulk DNA cytosine modification data (methylation and hydroxymethylation) with both bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We demonstrate a large reduction in the scope of significantly differentially modified cytosines in tumors when accounting for tumor cell type composition. In the progenitor-like cell types of tumors, we identify a preponderance differential Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine site hydroxymethylation rather than methylation. Genes with differential hydroxymethylation, like histone deacetylase 4 and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, are associated with cell type-specific changes in gene expression in tumors.

38708414,Gut microbiota induced epigenetic modifications in the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease pathogenesis.,Eng Life Sci,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a growing global health concern that can lead to liver disease and cancer. It is characterized by an excessive accumulation of fat in the liver, unrelated to excessive alcohol consumption. Studies indicate that the gut microbiota-host crosstalk may play a causal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, with epigenetic modification serving as a key mechanism for regulating this interaction. In this review, we explore how the interplay between gut microbiota and the host epigenome impacts the development of NAFLD. Specifically, we discuss how gut microbiota-derived factors, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), can modulate the DNA methylation and histone acetylation of genes associated with NAFLD, subsequently affecting lipid metabolism and immune homeostasis. Although the current literature suggests a link between gut microbiota and NAFLD development, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways underlying this crosstalk remains limited. Therefore, more comprehensive epigenomic and multi-omic studies, including broader clinical and animal experiments, are needed to further explore the mechanisms linking the gut microbiota to NAFLD-associated genes. These studies are anticipated to improve microbial markers based on epigenetic strategies and provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of NAFLD, ultimately addressing a significant unmet clinical need.© 2023 The Authors.

To understand the underlying mechanisms, we explored the associations of early-life tobacco exposure with accelerated biological aging and further assessed the joint effects of tobacco exposure and genetic susceptibility. Compared with those without in utero exposure, participants with in utero tobacco exposure had an increase in Klemera-Doubal biological age (KDM-BA) and PhenoAge acceleration of 0.26 and 0.49 years, respectively, but a decrease in telomere length of 5.34% among 276,259 participants. We also found significant dose-response associations between the age of smoking initiation and accelerated biological aging. Furthermore, the joint effects revealed that high-polygenic risk score participants with in utero exposure and smoking initiation in childhood had the highest accelerated biological aging. There were interactions between early-life tobacco exposure and age, sex, deprivation, and diet on KDM-BA and PhenoAge acceleration. These findings highlight the importance of reducing early-life tobacco exposure to improve healthy aging.",0.6781539346323208

38744973,GAGE-seq concurrently profiles multiscale 3D genome organization and gene expression in single cells.,Nat Genet,"The organization of mammalian genomes features a complex, multiscale three-dimensional (3D) architecture, whose functional significance remains elusive because of limited single-cell technologies that can concurrently profile genome organization and transcriptional activities. Here, we introduce genome architecture and gene expression by sequencing (GAGE-seq), a scalable, robust single-cell co-assay measuring 3D genome structure and transcriptome simultaneously within the same cell. Applied to mouse brain cortex and human bone marrow CD34+cells, GAGE-seq characterized the intricate relationships between 3D genome and gene expression, showing that multiscale 3D genome features inform cell-type-specific gene expression and link regulatory elements to target genes. Integration with spatial transcriptomic data revealed in situ 3D genome variations in mouse cortex. Observations in human hematopoiesis unveiled discordant changes between 3D genome organization and gene expression, underscoring a complex, temporal interplay at the single-cell level. GAGE-seq provides a powerful, cost-effective approach for exploring genome structure and gene expression relationships at the single-cell level across diverse biological contexts.© 2024.

38712075,Droplet Hi-C for Fast and Scalable Profiling of Chromatin Architecture in Single Cells.,bioRxiv,"Comprehensive analysis of chromatin architecture is crucial for understanding the gene regulatory programs during development and in disease pathogenesis, yet current methods often inadequately address the unique challenges presented by analysis of heterogeneous tissue samples. Here, we introduce Droplet Hi-C, which employs a commercial microfluidic device for high-throughput, single-cell chromatin conformation profiling in droplets. Using Droplet Hi-C, we mapped the chromatin architecture at single-cell resolution from the mouse cortex and analyzed gene regulatory programs in major cortical cell types. Additionally, we used this technique to detect copy number variation (CNV), structural variations (SVs) and extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cancer cells, revealing clonal dynamics and other oncogenic events during treatment. We further refined this technique to allow for joint profiling of chromatin architecture and transcriptome in single cells, facilitating a more comprehensive exploration of the links between chromatin architecture and gene expression in both normal tissues and tumors. Thus, Droplet Hi-C not only addresses critical gaps in chromatin analysis of heterogeneous tissues but also emerges as a versatile tool enhancing our understanding of gene regulation in health and disease.",2.742387706012749e-38
38570626,The high FKBP1A expression in WBCs as a potential screening biomarker for pancreatic cancer.,Sci Rep,"Given the limitation of current routine approaches for pancreatic cancer screening and detection, the mortality rate of pancreatic cancer cases is still critical. The development of blood-based molecular biomarkers for pancreatic cancer screening and early detection which provide less-invasive, high-sensitivity, and cost-effective, is urgently needed. The goal of this study is to identify and validate the potential molecular biomarkers in white blood cells (WBCs) of pancreatic cancer patients. Gene expression profiles of pancreatic cancer patients from NCBI GEO database were analyzed by CU-DREAM. Then, mRNA expression levels of three candidate genes were determined by quantitative RT-PCR in WBCs of pancreatic cancer patients (N = 27) and healthy controls (N = 51). ROC analysis was performed to assess the performance of each candidate gene. A total of 29 upregulated genes were identified and three selected genes were performed gene expression analysis. Our results revealed high mRNA expression levels in WBCs of pancreatic cancer patients in all selected genes, including FKBP1A (p < 0.0001), PLD1 (p < 0.0001), and PSMA4 (p = 0.0002). Among candidate genes, FKBP1A mRNA expression level was remarkably increased in the pancreatic cancer samples and also in the early stage (p < 0.0001). Moreover, FKBP1A showed the greatest performance to discriminate patients with pancreatic cancer from healthy individuals than other genes with the 88.9% sensitivity, 84.3% specificity, and 90.1% accuracy. Our findings demonstrated that the alteration of FKBP1A gene in WBCs serves as a novel valuable biomarker for patients with pancreatic cancer. Detection of FKBP1A mRNA expression level in circulating WBCs, providing high-sensitive, less-invasive, and cost-effective, is simple and feasible for routine clinical setting that can be applied for pancreatic cancer screening and early detection.© 2024.

38707433,Machine learning deciphers the significance of mitochondrial regulators on the diagnosis and subtype classification in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.,Heliyon,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent liver disease worldwide and lack of research on the diagnostic utility of mitochondrial regulators in NAFLD. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of NAFLD, especially oxidative stress and acidity β-oxidative overload. Thus, we aimed to identify and validate a panel of mitochondrial gene expression biomarkers for detection of NAFLD.We selected the GSE89632 dataset and identified key mitochondrial regulators by intersecting DEGs, WGCNA modules, and MRGs. Classification of NAFLD subtypes based on these key mitochondrial regulatory factors was performed, and the pattern of immune system infiltration in different NAFLD subtypes were also investigated. RF, LASSO, and SVM-RFE were employed to identify possible diagnostic biomarkers from key mitochondrial regulatory factors and the predictive power was demonstrated through ROC curves. Finally, we validated these potential diagnostic biomarkers in human peripheral blood samples and a high-fat diet-induced NAFLD mouse model.We identified 25 key regulators of mitochondria and two NAFLD subtypes with different immune infiltration patterns. Four potential diagnostic biomarkers (BCL2L11, NAGS, HDHD3, and RMND1) were screened by three machine learning methods thereby establishing the diagnostic model, which showed favorable predictive power and achieved significant clinical benefit at certain threshold probabilities. Then, through internal and external validation, we identified and confirmed that BCL2L11 was significantly downregulated in NAFLD, while the other three were significantly upregulated.The four MRGs, namely BCL2L11, NAGS, HDHD3, and RMND1, are novel potential biomarkers for diagnosing NAFLD. A diagnostic model constructed using the four MRGs may aid early diagnosis of NAFLD in clinics.© 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2.1838459705680701e-41
38665551,Identification of exosome-related gene signature as a promising diagnostic and therapeutic tool for breast cancer.,Heliyon,"Exosomes are promising tools for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Exosomes possess the ability to activate signaling pathways that contribute to the remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, angiogenesis, and the regulation of immune responses. We aimed to develop a prognostic score based on exosomes derived from breast cancer.Training was conducted on the TCGA-BRCA dataset, while validation was conducted on GSE20685, GSE5764, GSE7904, and GSE29431. A total of 121 genes related to exosomes were retrieved from the ExoBCD database. The Cox proportional hazards model is used to develop risk score model. The GSVA package was utilized to analyze single-sample gene sets and identify exosome signatures, while the WGCNA package was utilized to identify gene modules associated with clinical outcomes. The clusterProfiler and GSVA R packages facilitated gene set enrichment and variation analyses. Furthermore, CIBERSORT quantified immune infiltration, and a correlation between gene expression and drug sensitivity was assessed using the TIDE algorithm.An exosome-related prognostic score was established using the following selected genes:ABCC9,PIGR,CXCL13,DOK7,CD24, andIVL. Various immune cells that promote cancer immune evasion were associated with a high-risk prognostic score, which was an independent predictor of outcome. High-risk and low-risk groups exhibited significantly different infiltration abundances (p < 0.05). By conducting a sensitivity comparison, we found that patients with high-risk scores exhibited more favorable responses to immunotherapy than those with low-risk scores.The exosome-related gene signature exhibits outstanding performance in predicting the prognosis and cancer status of patients with breast cancer and guiding immunotherapy.© 2024 The Author(s).",2.6048217930876836e-50
38656728,Integrative Analyses of Bulk and Single-Cell RNA Seq Identified the Shared Genes in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Rheumatoid Arthritis.,Mol Biotechnol,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a progressive status of acute lung injury (ALI), is primarily caused by an immune-mediated inflammatory disorder, which can be an acute pulmonary complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). As a chronic inflammatory disease regulated by the immune system, RA is closely associated with the occurrence and progression of respiratory diseases. However, it remains elusive whether there are shared genes between the molecular mechanisms underlying RA and ARDS. The objective of this study is to identify potential shared genes for further clinical drug discovery through integrated analysis of bulk RNA sequencing datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, employing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The hub genes were identified through the intersection of common DEGs and WGCNA-derived genes. The Random Forest (RF) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms were subsequently employed to identify key shared target genes associated with two diseases. Additionally, RA immune infiltration analysis and COVID-19 single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed the correlation between these key genes and immune cells. A total of 59 shared genes were identified from the intersection of DEGs and gene clusters obtained through WGCNA, which analyzed the integrated gene matrix of ALI/ARDS and RA. The RF and LASSO algorithms were employed to screen for target genes specific to ALI/ARDS and RA, respectively. The final set of overlapping genes (FCMR, ADAM28, HK3, GRB10, UBE2J1, HPSE, DDX24, BATF, and CST7) all exhibited a strong predictive effect with an area under the curve (AUC) value greater than 0.8. Then, the immune infiltration analysis revealed a strong correlation between UBE2J1 and plasma cells in RA. Furthermore, scRNA-seq analysis demonstrated differential expression of these nine target genes primarily in T cells and NK cells, with CST7 showing a significant positive correlation specifically with NK cells. Beyond that, transcriptome sequencing was conducted on lung tissue collected from ALI mice, confirming the substantial differential expression of FCMR, HK3, UBE2J1, and BATF. This study provides unprecedented evidence linking the pathophysiological mechanisms of ALI/ARDS and RA to immune regulation, which offers novel understanding for future clinical treatment and experimental research.© 2024.

38654165,Prognostic analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma based on cuproptosis -associated lncRNAs.,BMC Gastroenterol,"Cuproptosis represents an innovative type of cell death, distinct from apoptosis, driven by copper dependency, yet the involvement of copper apoptosis-associated long non-coding RNAs (CRLncRNAs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. This study is dedicated to unveiling the role and significance of these copper apoptosis-related lncRNAs within the context of HCC, focusing on their impact on both the development of the disease and its prognosis.We conducted an analysis of gene transcriptomic and clinical data for HCC cases by sourcing information from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. By incorporating cuproptosis-related genes, we established prognostic features associated with cuproptosis-related lncRNAs. Furthermore, we elucidated the mechanism of cuproptosis-related lncRNAs in the prognosis and treatment of HCC through comprehensive approaches, including Lasso and Cox regression analyses, survival analyses of samples, as well as examinations of tumor mutation burden and immune function.We developed a prognostic model featuring six cuproptosis-related lncRNAs: AC026412.3, AC125437.1, AL353572.4, MKLN1-AS, TMCC1-AS1, and SLC6A1-AS1. This model demonstrated exceptional prognostic accuracy in both training and validation cohorts for patients with tumors, showing significantly longer survival times for those categorized in the low-risk group compared to the high-risk group. Additionally, our analyses, including tumor mutation burden, immune function, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment, and drug sensitivity, further elucidated the potential mechanisms through which cuproptosis-associated lncRNAs may influence disease outcome.The model developed using cuproptosis-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) demonstrates promising predictive capabilities for both the prognosis and immunotherapy outcomes of tumor patients. This could play a crucial role in patient management and the optimization of immunotherapeutic strategies, offering valuable insights for future research.© 2024.

38653779,Potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19 complicated with pulmonary hypertension: a bioinformatics and early validation study.,Sci Rep,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) are closely correlated. However, the mechanism is still poorly understood. In this article, we analyzed the molecular action network driving the emergence of this event. Two datasets (GSE113439 and GSE147507) from the GEO database were used for the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs).Common DEGs were selected by VennDiagram and their enrichment in biological pathways was analyzed. Candidate gene biomarkers were selected using three different machine-learning algorithms (SVM-RFE, LASSO, RF).The diagnostic efficacy of these foundational genes was validated using independent datasets. Eventually, we validated molecular docking and medication prediction. We found 62 common DEGs, including several ones that could be enriched for Immune Response and Inflammation. Two DEGs (SELE and CCL20) could be identified by machine-learning algorithms. They performed well in diagnostic tests on independent datasets. In particular, we observed an upregulation of functions associated with the adaptive immune response, the leukocyte-lymphocyte-driven immunological response, and the proinflammatory response. Moreover, by ssGSEA, natural killer T cells, activated dendritic cells, activated CD4 T cells, neutrophils, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells were correlated with COVID-19 and PH, with SELE and CCL20 showing the strongest correlation with dendritic cells. Potential therapeutic compounds like FENRETI-NIDE, AFLATOXIN B1 and 1-nitropyrene were predicted. Further molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that 1-nitropyrene had the most stable binding with SELE and CCL20.The findings indicated that SELE and CCL20 were identified as novel diagnostic biomarkers for COVID-19 complicated with PH, and the target of these two key genes, FENRETI-NIDE and 1-nitropyrene, was predicted to be a potential therapeutic target, thus providing new insights into the prediction and treatment of COVID-19 complicated with PH in clinical practice.© 2024.

Their common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and the functional enrichment analysis performed by the DAVID platform determined relevant biological processes and pathways. Then, the STRING database established a PPI network of such DEGs and topological analysis through Cytoscape 3.7.1 software along with the machine-learning analysis by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm screened out hub characteristic genes. Their efficacy was validated by external datasets using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and gene expression and location of the most robust one was determined using single-cell sequencing and immunohistochemical staining. Finally, the promising drugs were predicted through the CTD database, and the CB-DOCK 2 and Pymol platform mimicked molecular docking.Intersection of differentially expressed genes from three datasets identified 25 shared DEGs of the three diseases, which were enriched in MHC II-mediated antigen presenting process. PPI network and LASSO machine-learning analysis determined 4 feature genes, of which the MS4A6A gene mainly expressed by macrophages was the hub gene and key immune cell type. Molecular docking simulation chosen fenretinide as the most promising medicant for MS4A6A+macrophages.MS4A6A+macrophages were suggested to be important immune-related mediators in the progression of NAFLD, PD, and T2DM pathologies.© 2024 The Authors.",2.1340252816030024e-48
38644411,Identification and validation of a costimulatory molecule-related signature to predict the prognosis for uveal melanoma patients.,Sci Rep,"Uveal melanoma (UVM) is the most common primary tumor in adult human eyes. Costimulatory molecules (CMs) are important in maintaining T cell biological functions and regulating immune responses. To investigate the role of CMs in UVM and exploit prognostic signature by bioinformatics analysis. This study aimed to identify and validate a CMs associated signature and investigate its role in the progression and prognosis of UVM. The expression profile data of training cohort and validation cohort were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. 60 CM genes were identified, and 34 genes were associated with prognosis by univariate Cox regression. A prognostic signature was established with six CM genes. Further, high- and low-risk groups were divided by the median, and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves indicated that high-risk patients presented a poorer prognosis. We analyzed the correlation of gender, age, stage, and risk score on prognosis by univariate and multivariate regression analysis. We found that risk score was the only risk factor for prognosis. Through the integration of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), it was found that the high-risk group presented more immune cell infiltration and expression of immune checkpoints and obtained higher immune scores. Enrichment analysis of the biological functions of the two groups revealed that the differential parts were mainly related to cell-cell adhesion, regulation of T-cell activation, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. No differences in tumor mutation burden (TMB) were found between the two groups. GNA11 and BAP1 have higher mutation frequencies in high-risk patients. Finally, based on the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer 2 (GDSC2) dataset, drug sensitivity analysis found that high-risk patients may be potential beneficiaries of the treatment of crizotinib or temozolomide. Taken together, our CM-related prognostic signature is a reliable biomarker that may provide ideas for future treatments for the disease.© 2024. The Author(s).",5.049773198516611e-61
38627714,A hypoxia-glycolysis-lactate-related gene signature for prognosis prediction in hepatocellular carcinoma.,BMC Med Genomics,"Liver cancer ranks sixth in incidence and third in mortality globally and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 90% of it. Hypoxia, glycolysis, and lactate metabolism have been found to regulate the progression of HCC separately. However, there is a lack of studies linking the above three to predict the prognosis of HCC. The present study aimed to identify a hypoxia-glycolysis-lactate-related gene signature for assessing the prognosis of HCC.This study collected 510 hypoxia-glycolysis-lactate genes from Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and then classified HCC patients from TCGA-LIHC by analyzing their hypoxia-glycolysis-lactate genes expression. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out to construct a gene signature by LASSO-Cox analysis. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to evaluate the independent prognostic value of the gene signature. Analyses of immune infiltration, somatic cell mutations, and correlation heatmap were conducted by ""GSVA"" R package. Single-cell analysis conducted by ""SingleR"", ""celldex"", ""Seurat"", and ""CellCha"" R packages revealed how signature genes participated in hypoxia/glycolysis/lactate metabolism and PPI network identified hub genes.We classified HCC patients from TCGA-LIHC into two clusters and screened out DEGs. An 18-genes prognostic signature including CDCA8, CBX2, PDE6A, MED8, DYNC1LI1, PSMD1, EIF5B, GNL2, SEPHS1, CCNJL, SOCS2, LDHA, G6PD, YBX1, RTN3, ADAMTS5, CLEC3B, and UCK2 was built to stratify the risk of HCC. The risk score of the hypoxia-glycolysis-lactate gene signature was further identified as a valuable independent factor for estimating the prognosis of HCC. Then we found that the features of clinical characteristics, immune infiltration, somatic cell mutations, and correlation analysis differed between the high-risk and low-risk groups. Furthermore, single-cell analysis indicated that the signature genes could interact with the ligand-receptors of hepatocytes/fibroblasts/plasma cells to participate in hypoxia/glycolysis/lactate metabolism and PPI network identified potential hub genes in this process: CDCA8, LDHA, YBX1.The hypoxia-glycolysis-lactate-related gene signature we built could provide prognostic value for HCC and suggest several hub genes for future HCC studies.© 2024.

We aimed to examine the associations of BAs with the risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in ACS. We conducted a prospective study on 309 ACS patients who were followed for 10 years. Plasma BAs were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Cox regression analyses with elastic net penalties were performed to associate BAs with MACE and all-cause mortality. Weighted scores were computed using the 100 iterated coefficients corresponding to each selected BA, and the associations of these scores with these adverse outcomes were assessed using multivariable Cox regression models. A panel of 10 BAs was significantly associated with the increased risk of MACE. The hazard ratio of MACE per SD increase in the estimated BA score was 1.35 (95% CI 1.12-1.63). Furthermore, four BAs were selected from the elastic net model for all-cause mortality, although their weighted score was not independently associated with mortality. Our findings indicate that primary and secondary BAs may play a significant role in the development of MACE.

Cell senescence is one of the newly identified tumor characteristics. However, there is a dearth of methodical and all-encompassing investigations regarding the correlation between the broad-ranging alterations in metabolic processes associated with aging and ccRCC. We utilized a range of analytical methodologies, such as protein‒protein interaction network analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis, to form and validate a risk score model known as the senescence-metabolism-related risk model (SeMRM). Our study demonstrated that SeMRM could more precisely predict the OS of ccRCC patients than the clinical prognostic markers in use. By utilizing two distinct datasets of ccRCC, ICGC-KIRC (the International Cancer Genome Consortium) and GSE29609, as well as a single-cell dataset (GSE156632) and real patient clinical information, and further confirmed the relationship between the senescence-metabolism-related risk score (SeMRS) and ccRCC patient progression. It is worth noting that patients who were classified into different subgroups based on the SeMRS exhibited notable variations in metabolic activity, immune microenvironment, immune cell type transformation, mutant landscape, and drug responsiveness. We also demonstrated that PTGER4, a key gene in SeMRM, regulated ccRCC cell proliferation, lipid levels and the cell cycle in vivo and in vitro. Together, the utilization of SeMRM has the potential to function as a dependable clinical characteristic to increase the accuracy of prognostic assessment for patients diagnosed with ccRCC, thereby facilitating the selection of suitable treatment strategies.© 2024.

This study aims to identify Hub mitophagy-related genes (MRGs), and explore the underlying pathological mechanisms through which these hub genes regulate NAFLD.A total of 3 datasets were acquired from the GEO database and integrated to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in NAFLD and perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). By intersecting DEGs with MRGs, mitophagy-related differentially expressed genes (MRDEGs) were obtained. Then, hub MRGs with diagnostic biomarker capability for NAFLD were screened and a diagnostic prediction model was constructed and assessed using Nomogram, Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), and ROC curves. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted on the identified hub genes to explore their biological significance. Additionally, regulatory networks were constructed using databases. NAFLD was stratified into high and low-risk groups based on the Riskscore from the diagnostic prediction model. Furthermore, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and CIBERSORT algorithms were employed to analyze immune cell infiltration patterns and the relationship between Hub MRGs and immune cells.The integrated dataset comprised 122 NAFLD samples and 31 control samples. After screening, 18 MRDEGs were identified. Subsequently, six hub MRGs (NR4A1, PPP2R2A, P4HA1, TUBB6, DUSP1, NAMPT) with diagnostic potential were selected through WGCNA, logistic regression, SVM, RF, and LASSO models, all significantly downregulated in NAFLD samples compared to the control group. A diagnostic prediction model based on these six genes demonstrated robust predictive performance. Functional enrichment analysis of the six hub genes revealed involvement in processes such as protein phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. Correlation analysis demonstrated a significant association between hub MRGs and infiltrating immune cells.We identified six hub MRGs in NAFLD and constructed a diagnostic prediction model based on these six genes, applicable for early NAFLD diagnosis.

38573391,Signature Construction and Disulfidptosis-Related Molecular Cluster Identification for Better Prediction of Prognosis in Glioma.,J Mol Neurosci,"Disulfidptosis is a newly discovered form of regulatory cell death. However, the identification of disulfidptosis-related molecular subtypes and potential biomarkers in gliomas and their prognostic predictive potential need to be further elucidated. RNA sequencing profiles and the relevant clinical data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). Disulfidptosis-related clusters were identified by unsupervised clustering analysis. Immune cell infiltration analysis and drug sensitivity analysis were used to explore the differences between clusters. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of differential genes between clusters was performed to explore the potential biological functions and signaling. A disulfidptosis-related scoring system (DRSS) was constructed based on a combined COX and LASSO analysis. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were used to further explore the causal relationship between levels of genes in DRSS and an increased risk of glioma. A prognosis nomogram was constructed based on the DRSS and 3 clinical features (age, WHO stage, and IDH status). The accuracy and stability of the prognosis nomogram were also validated in different cohorts. We identified two clusters that exhibited different prognoses, drug sensitivity profiles, and tumor microenvironment infiltration profiles. The overall survival (OS) of Cluster2 was significantly better than Cluster1. Cluster1 had an overall greater infiltration of immune cells compared to Cluster2. However, the Monocytes, activated B cells had higher infiltration abundance in Cluster2. GSEA results showed significant enrichment of immune-related biological processes in Cluster1, while Cluster2 was more enriched for functions related to neurotransmission and regulation. PER3, RAB34, NKX3-2, GPX7, FRA10AC1, and TGIF1 were finally included to construct DRSS. DRSS was independently related to prognosis. There was a significant difference in overall survival between the low-risk score group and the high-risk score group. Among six genes in DRSS, GPX7 levels were demonstrated to have a causal relationship with an increased risk of glioma. GPX7 may become a more promising biomarker for gliomas. The prognosis nomogram constructed based on the DRSS and three clinical features has considerable potential for predicting the prognosis of patients with glioma. Free online software for implementing this nomogram was established:  https://yekun-zhuang.shinyapps.io/DynNomapp/ .

Although a few potential signaling pathways have been reported, knowledge of TED remains limited. Our objective is to explore the fundamental mechanism of TED and identify potential therapeutic targets using diverse approaches. To perform a range of bioinformatic analyses, such as identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs), conducting enrichment analysis, establishing nomograms, analyzing weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), and studying immune infiltration, the datasets GSE58331, GSE105149, and GSE9340 were integrated. Further validation was conducted using qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry techniques. Eleven ferroptosis-related DEGs derived from the lacrimal gland were originally screened. Their high diagnostic value was proven, and diagnostic prediction nomogram models with high accuracy and robustness were established by using machine learning. A total of 15 hub gene-related DEGs were identified by WGCNA. Through CIBERSORTx, we uncovered five immune cells highly correlated with TED and found several special associations between these immune cells and the above DEGs. Furthermore, EGR2 from the thyroid sample was revealed to be closely negatively correlated with most DEGs from the lacrimal gland. High expression of APOD, COPB2, MYH11, and MYCN, as well as CD4/CD8 T cells and B cells, was verified in the periorbital adipose tissues of TED patients.

Key EMRGs of BC were then identified and validated by functional enrichment analysis, interaction analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, Cox analysis, and immune infiltration. Western blot, qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC), MTT assay, colony formation assay and flow cytometry assay were then used to analyze DHCR7 expression and its biological effects on BC cells.We identified 31 EMRGs in BC. These 31 EMRGs and related transcription factors (TFs), miRNAs, and drugs were enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycoprotein metabolic process, breast cancer, and cell cycle. Crucially, DHCR7 was a key EMRG in BC identified and validated by WGCNA, LASSO regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. High DHCR7 expression was significantly associated with tumor immune infiltration level, pathological M, and poor prognosis in BC. In addition, DHCR7 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and affected mitochondrial function in BC cells.DHCR7 was found to be a key EMRG up-regulated in BC cells. This study is the first to our knowledge to report that DHCR7 acts as an oncogene in BC, which might become a novel therapeutic target for BC patients.",3.32523027301834e-54
38509983,Identification of circadian rhythm-related gene classification patterns and immune infiltration analysis in heart failure based on machine learning.,Heliyon,"Circadian rhythms play a key role in the failing heart, but the exact molecular mechanisms linking changes in the expression of circadian rhythm-related genes to heart failure (HF) remain unclear.By intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal and HF samples in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with circadian rhythm-related genes (CRGs), differentially expressed circadian rhythm-related genes (DE-CRGs) were obtained. Machine learning algorithms were used to screen for feature genes, and diagnostic models were constructed based on these feature genes. Subsequently, consensus clustering algorithms and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms were used for clustering analysis of HF samples. On this basis, immune infiltration analysis was used to score the immune infiltration status between HF and normal samples as well as among different subclusters. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) evaluated the biological functional differences among subclusters.13 CRGs showed differential expression between HF patients and normal samples. Nine feature genes were obtained through cross-referencing results from four distinct machine learning algorithms. Multivariate LASSO regression and external dataset validation were performed to select five key genes with diagnostic value, including NAMPT, SERPINA3, MAPK10, NPPA, and SLC2A1. Moreover, consensus clustering analysis could divide HF patients into two distinct clusters, which exhibited different biological functions and immune characteristics. Additionally, two subgroups were distinguished using the NMF algorithm based on circadian rhythm associated differentially expressed genes. Studies on immune infiltration showed marked variances in levels of immune infiltration between these subgroups. Subgroup A had higher immune scores and more widespread immune infiltration. Finally, the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) method was utilized to discern the modules that had the closest association with the two observed subgroups, and hub genes were pinpointed via protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. GRIN2A, DLG1, ERBB4, LRRC7, and NRG1 were circadian rhythm-related hub genes closely associated with HF.This study provides valuable references for further elucidating the pathogenesis of HF and offers beneficial insights for targeting circadian rhythm mechanisms to regulate immune responses and energy metabolism in HF treatment. Five genes identified by us as diagnostic features could be potential targets for therapy for HF.© 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2.5114484282427997e-54

Data extraction and quality assessment were performed for key study characteristics. Qualitative methods were used to synthesize the study results.A total of 21 studies were included, with the majority exhibiting average to moderate quality. Six SNPs (rs3800373, rs1360780, rs9470080, rs4713916, rs9296158, rs9394309) were broadly implicated in susceptibility to depression, while rs1360780 and rs3800373 were linked to antidepressant treatment sensitivity. Additionally, rs1360780 was associated with adverse reactions to antidepressant drug treatment. However, these associations were largely unconfirmed in replication studies.Depression is recognized as a polygenic genetic disorder, with multiple genes contributing, each exerting relatively small effects. Future studies should explore not only multiple gene interactions but also epigenetic changes. Presently, research on FKBP5 in affective disorders remains notably limited, highlighting the necessity for further investigations in this domain.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.009813851714631e-22
38724747,Systematic epigenome editing captures the context-dependent instructive function of chromatin modifications.,Nat Genet,"Chromatin modifications are linked with regulating patterns of gene expression, but their causal role and context-dependent impact on transcription remains unresolved. Here we develop a modular epigenome editing platform that programs nine key chromatin modifications, or combinations thereof, to precise loci in living cells. We couple this with single-cell readouts to systematically quantitate the magnitude and heterogeneity of transcriptional responses elicited by each specific chromatin modification. Among these, we show that installing histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at promoters can causally instruct transcription by hierarchically remodeling the chromatin landscape. We further dissect how DNA sequence motifs influence the transcriptional impact of chromatin marks, identifying switch-like and attenuative effects within distinct cis contexts. Finally, we examine the interplay of combinatorial modifications, revealing that co-targeted H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and H2AK119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119ub) maximizes silencing penetrance across single cells. Our precision-perturbation strategy unveils the causal principles of how chromatin modification(s) influence transcription and dissects how quantitative responses are calibrated by contextual interactions.© 2024.

38627502,Combined and differential roles of ADD domains of DNMT3A and DNMT3L on DNA methylation landscapes in mouse germ cells.,Nat Commun,"DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and its catalytically inactive cofactor DNA methyltransferase 3-Like (DNMT3L) proteins form functional heterotetramers to deposit DNA methylation in mammalian germ cells. While both proteins have an ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain that recognizes histone H3 tail unmethylated at lysine-4 (H3K4me0), the combined and differential roles of the domains in the two proteins have not been fully defined in vivo. Here we investigate DNA methylation landscapes in female and male germ cells derived from mice with loss-of-function amino acid substitutions in the ADD domains of DNMT3A and/or DNMT3L. Mutations in either the DNMT3A-ADD or the DNMT3L-ADD domain moderately decrease global CG methylation levels, but to different degrees, in both germ cells. Furthermore, when the ADD domains of both DNMT3A and DNMT3L lose their functions, the CG methylation levels are much more reduced, especially in oocytes, comparable to the impact of the Dnmt3a/3L knockout. In contrast, aberrant accumulation of non-CG methylation occurs at thousands of genomic regions in the double mutant oocytes and spermatozoa. These results highlight the critical role of the ADD-H3K4me0 binding in proper CG and non-CG methylation in germ cells and the various impacts of the ADD domains of the two proteins.© 2024.

38600075,Structure-guided functional suppression of AML-associated DNMT3A hotspot mutations.,Nat Commun,"DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A- and DNMT3B-mediated DNA methylation critically regulate epigenomic and transcriptomic patterning during development. The hotspot DNMT3A mutations at the site of Arg822 (R882) promote polymerization, leading to aberrant DNA methylation that may contribute to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the molecular basis underlying the mutation-induced functional misregulation of DNMT3A remains unclear. Here, we report the crystal structures of the DNMT3A methyltransferase domain, revealing a molecular basis for its oligomerization behavior distinct to DNMT3B, and the enhanced intermolecular contacts caused by the R882H or R882C mutation. Our biochemical, cellular, and genomic DNA methylation analyses demonstrate that introducing the DNMT3B-converting mutations inhibits the R882H-/R882C-triggered DNMT3A polymerization and enhances substrate access, thereby eliminating the dominant-negative effect of the DNMT3A R882 mutations in cells. Together, this study provides mechanistic insights into DNMT3A R882 mutations-triggered aberrant oligomerization and DNA hypomethylation in AML, with important implications in cancer therapy.© 2024.

38581056,Epigenetics in diabetic cardiomyopathy.,Clin Epigenetics,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a critical complication that poses a significant threat to the health of patients with diabetes. The intricate pathological mechanisms of DCM cause diastolic dysfunction, followed by impaired systolic function in the late stages. Accumulating researches have revealed the association between DCM and various epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and other epigenetic molecules. Recently, a profound understanding of epigenetics in the pathophysiology of DCM has been broadened owing to advanced high-throughput technologies, which assist in developing potential therapeutic strategies. In this review, we briefly introduce the epigenetics regulation and update the relevant progress in DCM. We propose the role of epigenetic factors and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) as potential biomarkers and drugs in DCM diagnosis and treatment, providing a new perspective and understanding of epigenomics in DCM.© 2024.

38554704,Targeting DNMT3A-mediated oxidative phosphorylation to overcome ibrutinib resistance in mantle cell lymphoma.,Cell Rep Med,"The use of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors such as ibrutinib achieves a remarkable clinical response in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Acquired drug resistance, however, is significant and affects long-term survival of MCL patients. Here, we demonstrate that DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is involved in ibrutinib resistance. We find that DNMT3A expression is upregulated upon ibrutinib treatment in ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells. Genetic and pharmacological analyses reveal that DNMT3A mediates ibrutinib resistance independent of its DNA-methylation function. Mechanistically, DNMT3A induces the expression of MYC target genes through interaction with the transcription factors MEF2B and MYC, thus mediating metabolic reprogramming to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Targeting DNMT3A with low-dose decitabine inhibits the growth of ibrutinib-resistant lymphoma cells both in vitro and in a patient-derived xenograft mouse model. These findings suggest that targeting DNMT3A-mediated metabolic reprogramming to OXPHOS with decitabine provides a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome ibrutinib resistance in relapsed/refractory MCL.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

38536233,Integrative methylome and transcriptome analysis reveals epigenetic regulation of Fusobacterium nucleatum in laryngeal cancer.,Microb Genom,The aetiological mechanisms ofFusobacterium nucleatumin laryngeal cancer remain unclear. This study aimed to reveal the epigenetic signature induced byF. nucleatumin laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Combined analysis of methylome and transcriptome data was performed to address the functional role ofF. nucleatumin laryngeal cancer. Twenty-nine differentially expressed methylation-driven genes were identified by mapping the methylation levels of significant differential methylation sites to the expression levels of related genes. The combined analysis revealed thatF. nucleatumpromoted Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) gene expression in LSCC. Further validation found decreased methylation and elevated expression of JAK3 in theF. nucleatum-treated LSCC cell group;F. nucleatumabundance and JAK3 gene expression had a positive correlation in tumour tissues. This analysis provides a novel understanding of the impact ofF. nucleatumin the methylome and transcriptome of laryngeal cancer.

38506728,Crosstalk within and beyond the Polycomb repressive system.,J Cell Biol,"The development of multicellular organisms depends on spatiotemporally controlled differentiation of numerous cell types and their maintenance. To generate such diversity based on the invariant genetic information stored in DNA, epigenetic mechanisms, which are heritable changes in gene function that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence, are required to establish and maintain unique gene expression programs. Polycomb repressive complexes represent a paradigm of epigenetic regulation of developmentally regulated genes, and the roles of these complexes as well as the epigenetic marks they deposit, namely H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub, have been extensively studied. However, an emerging theme from recent studies is that not only the autonomous functions of the Polycomb repressive system, but also crosstalks of Polycomb with other epigenetic modifications, are important for gene regulation. In this review, we summarize how these crosstalk mechanisms have improved our understanding of Polycomb biology and how such knowledge could help with the design of cancer treatments that target the dysregulated epigenome.© 2024 Shi et al.",1.4277623306005673e-33

Our method also selects the proteins contributing to the cellular heterogeneity shared between bulk transcriptome and proteome. The deconvoluted result enables downstream analyses such as cs-protein Quantitative Trait Loci (cspQTL) mapping. We benchmarked the performance of this multimodal deconvolution approach through CITE-seq pseudo bulk data, a simulation study, and the bulk multi-omics data from human brain normal tissues and breast cancer tumors, individually, showing robust and accurate cell abundance quantification across different datasets.

38569549,Iterative oxidation by TET1 is required for reprogramming of imprinting control regions and patterning of mouse sperm hypomethylated regions.,Dev Cell,"Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes iteratively oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to generate 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine, and 5-carboxylcytosine to facilitate active genome demethylation. Whether these bases are required to promote replication-coupled dilution or activate base excision repair during mammalian germline reprogramming remains unresolved due to the inability to decouple TET activities. Here, we generated two mouse lines expressing catalytically inactive TET1 (Tet1-HxD) and TET1 that stalls oxidation at 5hmC (Tet1-V). Tet1 knockout and catalytic mutant primordial germ cells (PGCs) fail to erase methylation at select imprinting control regions and promoters of meiosis-associated genes, validating the requirement for the iterative oxidation of 5mC for complete germline reprogramming. TET1Vand TET1HxDrescue most hypermethylation of Tet1-/-sperm, suggesting the role of TET1 beyond its oxidative capability. We additionally identify a broader class of hypermethylated regions in Tet1 mutant mouse sperm that depend on TET oxidation for reprogramming. Our study demonstrates the link between TET1-mediated germline reprogramming and sperm methylome patterning.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",1.4336272065181515e-38
38605018,Impact of genetic predisposition to late-onset neurodegenerative diseases on early life outcomes and brain structure.,Transl Psychiatry,"Most patients with late-onset neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's have a complex aetiology resulting from numerous genetic risk variants of small effects located across the genome, environmental factors, and the interaction between genes and environment. Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and post-GWAS analyses have shed light on the polygenic architecture of these diseases, enabling polygenic risk scores (PRS) to estimate an individual's relative genetic liability for presenting with the disease. PRS can screen and stratify individuals based on their genetic risk, potentially years or even decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. An emerging body of evidence from various research studies suggests that genetic susceptibility to late-onset neurodegenerative diseases might impact early life outcomes, including cognitive function, brain structure and function, and behaviour. This article summarises recent findings exploring the potential impact of genetic susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases on early life outcomes. A better understanding of the impact of genetic susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases early in life could be valuable in disease screening, detection, and prevention and in informing treatment strategies before significant neural damage has occurred. However, ongoing studies have limitations. Overall, our review found several studies focused on APOE haplotypes and Alzheimer's risk, but a limited number of studies leveraging polygenic risk scores or focused on genetic susceptibility to other late-onset conditions.© 2024.

38596783,Senescence: A DNA damage response and its role in aging and Neurodegenerative Diseases.,Front Aging,"Senescence is a complicated, multi-factorial, irreversible cell cycle halt that has a tumor-suppressing effect in addition to being a significant factor in aging and neurological diseases. Damaged DNA, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and disrupted proteostasis are a few of the factors that cause senescence. Senescence is triggered by DNA damage which initiates DNA damage response. The DNA damage response, which includes the formation of DNA damage foci containing activated H2AX, which is a key factor in cellular senescence, is provoked by a double strand DNA break. Oxidative stress impairs cognition, inhibits neurogenesis, and has an accelerated aging effect. Senescent cells generate pro-inflammatory mediators known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines have an impact on neuroinflammation, neuronal death, and cell proliferation. While it is tempting to think of neurodegenerative diseases as manifestations of accelerated aging and senescence, this review will present information on brain ageing and neurodegeneration as a result of senescence and DNA damage response.Copyright © 2024 Shreeya, Ansari, Kumar, Saifi, Shati, Alfaifi and Elbehairi.",1.8960739907663406e-40

38645167,Risk factors affecting polygenic score performance across diverse cohorts.,medRxiv,"Apart from ancestry, personal or environmental covariates may contribute to differences in polygenic score (PGS) performance. We analyzed effects of covariate stratification and interaction on body mass index (BMI) PGS (PGSBMI) across four cohorts of European (N=491,111) and African (N=21,612) ancestry. Stratifying on binary covariates and quintiles for continuous covariates, 18/62 covariates had significant and replicable R2differences among strata. Covariates with the largest differences included age, sex, blood lipids, physical activity, and alcohol consumption, with R2being nearly double between best and worst performing quintiles for certain covariates. 28 covariates had significant PGSBMI-covariate interaction effects, modifying PGSBMIeffects by nearly 20% per standard deviation change. We observed overlap between covariates that had significant R2differences among strata and interaction effects - across all covariates, their main effects on BMI were correlated with their maximum R2differences and interaction effects (0.56 and 0.58, respectively), suggesting high-PGSBMIindividuals have highest R2and increase in PGS effect. Using quantile regression, we show the effect of PGSBMIincreases as BMI itself increases, and that these differences in effects are directly related to differences in R2when stratifying by different covariates. Given significant and replicable evidence for context-specific PGSBMIperformance and effects, we investigated ways to increase model performance taking into account non-linear effects. Machine learning models (neural networks) increased relative model R2(mean 23%) across datasets. Finally, creating PGSBMIdirectly from GxAge GWAS effects increased relative R2by 7.8%. These results demonstrate that certain covariates, especially those most associated with BMI, significantly affect both PGSBMIperformance and effects across diverse cohorts and ancestries, and we provide avenues to improve model performance that consider these effects.",0.9976118654986672

Prior large-scale transcriptome analyses for sex differences in schizophrenia have focused on the prefrontal cortex. Analyzing BrainSeq Consortium data (caudate nucleus: n = 399, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: n = 377, and hippocampus: n = 394), we identified 831 unique genes that exhibit sex differences across brain regions, enriched for immune-related pathways. We observed X-chromosome dosage reduction in the hippocampus of male individuals with schizophrenia. Our sex interaction model revealed 148 junctions dysregulated in a sex-specific manner in schizophrenia. Sex-specific schizophrenia analysis identified dozens of differentially expressed genes, notably enriched in immune-related pathways. Finally, our sex-interacting expression quantitative trait loci analysis revealed 704 unique genes, nine associated with schizophrenia risk.

38698395,Exploring machine learning strategies for predicting cardiovascular disease risk factors from multi-omic data.,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,"Machine learning (ML) classifiers are increasingly used for predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) and related risk factors using omics data, although these outcomes often exhibit categorical nature and class imbalances. However, little is known about which ML classifier, omics data, or upstream dimension reduction strategy has the strongest influence on prediction quality in such settings. Our study aimed to illustrate and compare different machine learning strategies to predict CVD risk factors under different scenarios.We compared the use of six ML classifiers in predicting CVD risk factors using blood-derived metabolomics, epigenetics and transcriptomics data. Upstream omic dimension reduction was performed using either unsupervised or semi-supervised autoencoders, whose downstream ML classifier performance we compared. CVD risk factors included systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements and ultrasound-based biomarkers of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD; E/e' ratio, E/A ratio, LAVI) collected from 1,249 Finnish participants, of which 80% were used for model fitting. We predicted individuals with low, high or average levels of CVD risk factors, the latter class being the most common. We constructed multi-omic predictions using a meta-learner that weighted single-omic predictions. Model performance comparisons were based on the F1 score. Finally, we investigated whether learned omic representations from pre-trained semi-supervised autoencoders could improve outcome prediction in an external cohort using transfer learning.Depending on the ML classifier or omic used, the quality of single-omic predictions varied. Multi-omics predictions outperformed single-omics predictions in most cases, particularly in the prediction of individuals with high or low CVD risk factor levels. Semi-supervised autoencoders improved downstream predictions compared to the use of unsupervised autoencoders. In addition, median gains in Area Under the Curve by transfer learning compared to modelling from scratch ranged from 0.09 to 0.14 and 0.07 to 0.11 units for transcriptomic and metabolomic data, respectively.By illustrating the use of different machine learning strategies in different scenarios, our study provides a platform for researchers to evaluate how the choice of omics, ML classifiers, and dimension reduction can influence the quality of CVD risk factor predictions.© 2024.

38694658,A Comprehensive Analysis of Y-Chromosome Microdeletions and Their Relationship to Male Infertility and Lifestyle Variables.,Cureus,"Male infertility is the inability of a male to conceive a fertile female during at least a year of unprotected sexual activity. A variety of medical conditions and treatments cause male infertility. Y chromosome microdeletion is an important cause of infertility among males. Various epidemiological factors also play a role in the occurrence of infertility. Our study aims to determine the association between Y-chromosome microdeletion and age, sperm count, body mass index (BMI), alcohol, and tobacco consumption.This study was conducted in 70 male infertility cases. Data was collected from 2018 to 2023 at the Genetic Lab, Department of Anatomy, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raipur, Chhattisgarh, India. Demographic profiles, including age, sperm count, weight and height, and history of smoking and drinking, were collected from individuals. BMI was calculated, and chromosome analysis was done for Y chromosome microdeletion. Both multiplex and singleplex methods were used to determine the microdeletion using a thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, VeritiTM 96-well Fast Thermal Cycler, 0.2 ml USA) in AZF, and the association between age, sperm count, BMI, alcohol, and tobacco was determined.The number of regions deleted among individuals varies from one to seven. Regions Sy746, Sy143, and Sy145 were found to be commonly deleted. We found a positive, but not statistically significant, correlation between age and microdeletion (point biserial correlation coefficient (r) = 0.2, p-value = 0.097). When comparing age with sperm count, the results showed a negative correlation, highlighting the influence of age on sperm count (r (68) = 0.284, p = 0.017). In comparing BMI and microdeletion, no significant relationship (χ² = 3.7, p = 0.296) indicated independence between them. According to our observations, microdeletion affects all smokers and 45% of non-smokers. We found a significant association between smoking and microdeletion (χ2= 4.49, P = 0.034). There was no statistically significant relationship between microdeletion and drinking (χ²(3) = 5.65, p = 0.13).We discovered a significant positive association between smoking and a positive, but not statistically significant, correlation between age, BMI, and drinking, as well as a microdeletion. There are probably a lot of unidentified variables that affect successful fertilization and implantation. These could include variables that affect fertility and the success of reproduction on an environmental, genetic, and epigenetic level. The study reveals that Y chromosome microdeletion and other epidemiological factors coexist concurrently in cases of infertility. Assessing these variables is crucial for infertile patients. A community-based, comprehensive survey is required to assess the overall consequences of various epidemiological factors on infertility.Copyright © 2024, Sinha et al.",6.683612958727184e-22
38654235,Obstructive sleep apnea and mental disorders: a bidirectional mendelian randomization study.,BMC Psychiatry,"Previous studies have reported associations between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and several mental disorders. However, further research is required to determine whether these associations are causal. Therefore, we evaluated the bidirectional causality between the genetic liability for OSA and nine mental disorders by using Mendelian randomization (MR).We performed two-sample bidirectional MR of genetic variants for OSA and nine mental disorders. Summary statistics on OSA and the nine mental disorders were extracted from the FinnGen study and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. The primary analytical approach for estimating causal effects was the inverse-variance weighted (IVW), with the weighted median and MR Egger as complementary methods. The MR Egger intercept test, Cochran's Q test, Rucker's Q test, and the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test were used for sensitivity analyses.MR analyses showed that genetic liability for major depressive disorder (MDD) was associated with an increased risk of OSA (odds ratio [OR] per unit increase in the risk of MDD, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.11-1.49; P < 0.001). In addition, genetic liability for OSA may be associated with an increased risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.02-1.56; p = 0.032). There was no evidence that OSA is associated with other mental disorders.Our study indicated that genetic liability for MDD is associated with an increased risk of OSA without a bidirectional relationship. Additionally, there was suggestive evidence that genetic liability for OSA may have a causal effect on ADHD. These findings have implications for prevention and intervention strategies targeting OSA and ADHD. Further research is needed to investigate the biological mechanisms underlying our findings and the relationship between OSA and other mental disorders.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.2184968499508543e-31
38587666,Genetic predisposition for negative affect predicts mental health burden during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was accompanied by an increase in mental health challenges including depression, stress, loneliness, and anxiety. Common genetic variants can contribute to the risk for psychiatric disorders and may present a risk factor in times of crises. However, it is unclear to what extent polygenic risk played a role in the mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we investigate whether polygenic scores (PGSs) for mental health-related traits can distinguish between four resilience-vulnerability trajectories identified during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns in 2020/21. We used multinomial regression in a genotyped subsample (n = 1316) of the CovSocial project. The most resilient trajectory characterized by the lowest mental health burden and the highest recovery rates served as the reference group. Compared to this most resilient trajectory, a higher value on the PGS for the well-being spectrum decreased the odds for individuals to be in one of the more vulnerable trajectories (adjusted R-square = 0.3%). Conversely, a higher value on the PGS for neuroticism increased the odds for individuals to be in one of the more vulnerable trajectories (adjusted R-square = 0.2%). Latent change in mental health burden extracted from the resilience-vulnerability trajectories was not associated with any PGS. Although our findings support an influence of PGS on mental health during COVID-19, the small added explained variance suggests limited utility of such genetic markers for the identification of vulnerable individuals in the general population.© 2024.

38585791,"Lingo: an automated, web-based deep phenotyping platform for language ability.",medRxiv,"Language and the ability to communicate effectively are key factors in mental health and well-being. Despite this critical importance, research on language is limited by the lack of a scalable phenotyping toolkit.Here, we describe and showcase Lingo - a flexible online battery of language and nonverbal reasoning skills based on seven widely used tasks (COWAT, picture narration, vocal rhythm entrainment, rapid automatized naming, following directions, sentence repetition, and nonverbal reasoning). The current version of Lingo takes approximately 30 minutes to complete, is entirely open source, and allows for a wide variety of performance metrics to be extracted. We asked > 1,300 individuals from multiple samples to complete Lingo, then investigated the validity and utility of the resulting data.We conducted an exploratory factor analysis across 14 features derived from the seven assessments, identifying five factors. Four of the five factors showed acceptable test-retest reliability (Pearson's R > 0.7). Factor 2 showed the highest reliability (Pearson's R = 0.95) and loaded primarily on sentence repetition task performance. We validated Lingo with objective measures of language ability by comparing performance to gold-standard assessments: CELF-5 and the VABS-3. Factor 2 was significantly associated with the CELF-5 ""core language ability"" scale (Pearson's R = 0.77, p-value < 0.05) and the VABS-3 ""communication"" scale (Pearson's R = 0.74, p-value < 0.05). Factor 2 was positively associated with phenotypic and genetic measures of socieconomic status. Interestingly, we found the parents of children with language impairments had lower Factor 2 scores (p-value < 0.01). Finally, we found Lingo factor scores were significantly predictive of numerous psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions.Together, these analyses support Lingo as a powerful platform for scalable deep phenotyping of language and other cognitive abilities. Additionally, exploratory analyses provide supporting evidence for the heritability of language ability and the complex relationship between mental health and language.",1.1797197413130876e-18
38496567,Brain dynamics reflecting an intra-network brain state is associated with increased posttraumatic stress symptoms in the early aftermath of trauma.,Res Sq,"This study examines the association between brain dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) and current/future posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptom severity, and the impact of sex on this relationship. By analyzing 275 participants' dFNC data obtained ~2 weeks after trauma exposure, we noted that brain dynamics of an inter-network brain state link negatively with current (r=-0.179,pcorrected= 0.021) and future (r=-0.166,pcorrected= 0.029) PTS symptom severity. Also, dynamics of an intra-network brain state correlated with future symptom intensity (r = 0.192,pcorrected= 0.021). We additionally observed that the association between the network dynamics of the inter-network brain state with symptom severity is more pronounced in females (r=-0.244,pcorrected= 0.014). Our findings highlight a potential link between brain network dynamics in the aftermath of trauma with current and future PTSD outcomes, with a stronger protective effect of inter-network brain states against symptom severity in females, underscoring the importance of sex differences.",4.4446401134908816e-12
38491344,Correlates of suicidal behaviors and genetic risk among United States veterans with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder.,Mol Psychiatry,"Persons diagnosed with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar I disorder (BPI) are at high risk for self-injurious behavior, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behaviors (SB). Characterizing associations between diagnosed health problems, prior pharmacological treatments, and polygenic scores (PGS) has potential to inform risk stratification. We examined self-reported SB and ideation using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) among 3,942 SCZ and 5,414 BPI patients receiving care within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). These cross-sectional data were integrated with electronic health records (EHRs), and compared across lifetime diagnoses, treatment histories, follow-up screenings, and mortality data. PGS were constructed using available genomic data for related traits. Genome-wide association studies were performed to identify and prioritize specific loci. Only 20% of the veterans who reported SB had a corroborating ICD-9/10 EHR code. Among those without prior SB, more than 20% reported new-onset SB at follow-up. SB were associated with a range of additional clinical diagnoses, and with treatment with specific classes of psychotropic medications (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics, etc.). PGS for externalizing behaviors, smoking initiation, suicide attempt, and major depressive disorder were associated with SB. The GWAS for SB yielded no significant loci. Among individuals with a diagnosed mental illness, self-reported SB were strongly associated with clinical variables across several EHR domains. Analyses point to sequelae of substance-related and psychiatric comorbidities as strong correlates of prior and subsequent SB. Nonetheless, past SB was frequently not documented in health records, underscoring the value of regular screening with direct, in-person assessments, especially among high-risk individuals.© 2024.

38611617,"Neuropathology, Neuroimaging, and Fluid Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease.",Diagnostics (Basel),"An improved understanding of the pathobiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) should lead ultimately to an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of AD, providing the opportunity to intervene earlier in the disease process and to improve outcomes. The known hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease include amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. It is now clear that an imbalance between production and clearance of the amyloid beta protein and related Aβ peptides, especially Aβ42, is a very early, initiating factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, leading to aggregates of hyperphosphorylation and misfolded tau protein, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. In this article, we review how the AD diagnostic process has been transformed in recent decades by our ability to measure these various elements of the pathological cascade through the use of imaging and fluid biomarkers. The more recently developed plasma biomarkers, especially phosphorylated-tau217 (p-tau217), have utility for screening and diagnosis of the earliest stages of AD. These biomarkers can also be used to measure target engagement by disease-modifying therapies and the response to treatment.",5.884925552300608e-33
38644369,Dynamics of CD44(+) bovine nucleus pulposus cells with inflammation.,Sci Rep,"Intervertebral Disc (IVD) degeneration has been associated with a chronic inflammatory response, but knowledge on the contribution of distinct IVD cells, namely CD44, to the progression of IVD degeneration remains elusive. Here, bovine nucleus pulposus (NP) CD44 cells were sorted and compared by gene expression and proteomics with the negative counterpart. NP cells were then stimulated with IL-1b (10 ng/ml) and dynamics of CD44 gene and protein expression was analyzed upon pro-inflammatory treatment. The results emphasize that CD44 has a multidimensional functional role in IVD metabolism, ECM synthesis and production of neuropermissive factors. CD44 widespread expression in NP was partially associated with CD14 and CD45, resulting in the identification of distinct cell subsets. In conclusion, this study points out CD44 and CD44-based cell subsets as relevant targets in the modulation of the IVD pro-inflammatory/degenerative cascade.© 2024.

38589516,scGHOST: identifying single-cell 3D genome subcompartments.,Nat Methods,"Single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) technologies allow for probing of genome-wide cell-to-cell variability in three-dimensional (3D) genome organization from individual cells. Computational methods have been developed to reveal single-cell 3D genome features based on scHi-C, including A/B compartments, topologically associating domains and chromatin loops. However, no method exists for annotating single-cell subcompartments, which is important for understanding chromosome spatial localization in single cells. Here we present scGHOST, a single-cell subcompartment annotation method using graph embedding with constrained random walk sampling. Applications of scGHOST to scHi-C data and contact maps derived from single-cell 3D genome imaging demonstrate reliable identification of single-cell subcompartments, offering insights into cell-to-cell variability of nuclear subcompartments. Using scHi-C data from complex tissues, scGHOST identifies cell-type-specific or allele-specific subcompartments linked to gene transcription across various cell types and developmental stages, suggesting functional implications of single-cell subcompartments. scGHOST is an effective method for annotating single-cell 3D genome subcompartments in a broad range of biological contexts.© 2024.

38664739,Gene-expression profiling of individuals resilient to Alzheimer's disease reveals higher expression of genes related to metallothionein and mitochondrial processes and no changes in the unfolded protein response.,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Some individuals show a discrepancy between cognition and the amount of neuropathological changes characteristic for Alzheimer's disease (AD). This phenomenon has been referred to as 'resilience'. The molecular and cellular underpinnings of resilience remain poorly understood. To obtain an unbiased understanding of the molecular changes underlying resilience, we investigated global changes in gene expression in the superior frontal gyrus of a cohort of cognitively and pathologically well-defined AD patients, resilient individuals and age-matched controls (n = 11-12 per group). 897 genes were significantly altered between AD and control, 1121 between resilient and control and 6 between resilient and AD. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that the expression of metallothionein (MT) and of genes related to mitochondrial processes was higher in the resilient donors. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified gene modules related to the unfolded protein response, mitochondrial processes and synaptic signaling to be differentially associated with resilience or dementia. As changes in MT, mitochondria, heat shock proteins and the unfolded protein response (UPR) were the most pronounced changes in the GSEA and/or WGCNA, immunohistochemistry was used to further validate these processes. MT was significantly increased in astrocytes in resilient individuals. A higher proportion of the mitochondrial gene MT-CO1 was detected outside the cell body versus inside the cell body in the resilient compared to the control group and there were higher levels of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and X-box-binding protein 1 spliced (XBP1s), two proteins related to heat shock proteins and the UPR, in the AD donors. Finally, we show evidence for putative sex-specific alterations in resilience, including gene expression differences related to autophagy in females compared to males. Taken together, these results show possible mechanisms involving MTs, mitochondrial processes and the UPR by which individuals might maintain cognition despite the presence of AD pathology.© 2024.

38562743,Microbial determinants of dementia risk in subjects of Mexican descent with type 2 diabetes living in South Texas.,medRxiv,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common forerunner of neurodegeneration and dementia, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD), yet the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. Individuals of Mexican descent living in South Texas have increased prevalence of comorbid T2D and early onset AD, despite low incidence of the predisposing APOE-e4 variant and an absence of the phenotype among relatives residing in Mexico - suggesting a role for environmental factors in coincident T2D and AD susceptibility. Here, in a small clinical trial, we show dysbiosis of the human gut microbiome could contribute to neuroinflammation and risk for AD in this population. Divergent Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) responses, despite no differences in expressed dietary preferences, provided the first evidence for altered gut microbial ecology among T2D subjects (sT2D)versuspopulation-matched healthy controls (HC). Metataxonomic 16S rRNA sequencing of participant stool revealed a decrease in alpha diversity of sT2DversusHC gut communities and identified BMI as a driver of gut community structure. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) identified a significant decrease in the relative abundance of the short-chain fatty acid-producing taxaLachnospiraceae,Faecalibacterium, andAlistipesand an increase in pathobiontsEscherichia-Shigella,Enterobacter, andClostridia innocuumamong sT2D gut microbiota, as well as differentially abundant gene and metabolic pathways. These results suggest characterization of the gut microbiome of individuals with T2D could identify key actors among ""disease state"" microbiota which may increase risk for or accelerate the onset of neurodegeneration. Furthermore, they identify candidate microbiome-targeted approaches for prevention and treatment of neuroinflammation in AD.",2.5127644504940706e-36
38645217,Recalibrating differential gene expression by genetic dosage variance prioritizes functionally relevant genes.,bioRxiv,"Differential expression (DE) analysis is a widely used method for identifying genes that are functionally relevant for an observed phenotype or biological response. However, typical DE analysis includes selection of genes based on a threshold of fold change in expression under the implicit assumption that all genes are equally sensitive to dosage changes of their transcripts. This tends to favor highly variable genes over more constrained genes where even small changes in expression may be biologically relevant. To address this limitation, we have developed a method to recalibrate each gene's differential expression fold change based on genetic expression variance observed in the human population. The newly established metric ranks statistically differentially expressed genes not by nominal change of expression, but by relative change in comparison to natural dosage variation for each gene. We apply our method to RNA sequencing datasets from rare disease and in-vitro stimulus response experiments. Compared to the standard approach, our method adjusts the bias in discovery towards highly variable genes, and enriches for pathways and biological processes related to metabolic and regulatory activity, indicating a prioritization of functionally relevant driver genes. With that, our method provides a novel view on DE and contributes towards bridging the existing gap between statistical and biological significance. We believe that this approach will simplify the identification of disease causing genes and enhance the discovery of therapeutic targets.",2.483582575995985e-24
38627676,Identification of skewed X chromosome inactivation using exome and transcriptome sequencing in patients with suspected rare genetic disease.,BMC Genomics,"X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is an epigenetic process that occurs during early development in mammalian females by randomly silencing one of two copies of the X chromosome in each cell. The preferential inactivation of either the maternal or paternal copy of the X chromosome in a majority of cells results in a skewed or non-random pattern of X inactivation and is observed in over 25% of adult females. Identifying skewed X inactivation is of clinical significance in patients with suspected rare genetic diseases due to the possibility of biased expression of disease-causing genes present on the active X chromosome. The current clinical test for the detection of skewed XCI relies on the methylation status of the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme (Hpall) binding site present in proximity of short tandem polymorphic repeats on the androgen receptor (AR) gene. This approach using one locus results in uninformative or inconclusive data for 10-20% of tests. Further, recent studies have shown inconsistency between methylation of the AR locus and the state of inactivation of the X chromosome. Herein, we develop a method for estimating X inactivation status, using exome and transcriptome sequencing data derived from blood in 227 female samples. We built a reference model for evaluation of XCI in 135 females from the GTEx consortium. We tested and validated the model on 11 female individuals with different types of undiagnosed rare genetic disorders who were clinically tested for X-skew using the AR gene assay and compared results to our outlier-based analysis technique.In comparison to the AR clinical test for identification of X inactivation, our method was concordant with the AR method in 9 samples, discordant in 1, and provided a measure of X inactivation in 1 sample with uninformative clinical results. We applied this method on an additional 81 females presenting to the clinic with phenotypes consistent with different hereditary disorders without a known genetic diagnosis.This study presents the use of transcriptome and exome sequencing data to provide an accurate and complete estimation of X-inactivation and skew status in a cohort of female patients with different types of suspected rare genetic disease.© 2024.

A recently published study has even revealed that rs35006907 was associated with bothMTSS1expression and the risk of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).Our study intended to investigate the relationship between rs35006907 and the risk of DCM in the Han Chinese population.A total of 529 DCM and 600 healthy controls were recruited. We conducted genotyping for rs35006907 in all participants. Gene association studies were performed to assess the association between rs35006907 and the risk of DCM. A series of functional assays including western blot, realtime PCR and firefly luciferase reporter gene assays were conducted to illuminate the underlying mechanism.We found that rs35006907-A allele was significantly associated with reduced risk of DCM in additive (p= 0.004; OR=0.78; 95% CI=0.66-0.93) and recessive models (p= 0.0005; OR=0.56; 95%CI=0.41-0.78) when compared with the rs35006907-C allele. There were significant differences in the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between rs35006907-CC/AC and AA genotypes. Furthermore, the variant rs35006907-A allele presented lower reporter gene activity, reduced mRNA and protein expression levels when compared with the C allele.Our findings demonstrated that rs35006907-C allele increased the risk of DCM in Han Chinese population.

38685067,Deubiquitination of CDC6 by OTUD6A promotes tumour progression and chemoresistance.,Mol Cancer,"CDC6 is an oncogenic protein whose expression level fluctuates during the cell cycle. Although several E3 ubiquitin ligases responsible for the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of CDC6 have been identified, the deubiquitination pathway for CDC6 has not been investigated.The proteome-wide deubiquitinase (DUB) screening was used to identify the potential regulator of CDC6. Immunofluorescence, protein half-life and deubiquitination assays were performed to determine the protein stability of CDC6. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were implemented to analyse the impacts of OUTD6A-CDC6 axis on tumour growth and chemosensitivity in vitro. N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN)-induced conditional Otud6a knockout (CKO) mouse model and tumour xenograft model were performed to analyse the role of OTUD6A-CDC6 axis in vivo. Tissue specimens were used to determine the association between OTUD6A and CDC6.OTUD6A interacts with, depolyubiquitinates and stabilizes CDC6 by removing K6-, K33-, and K48-linked polyubiquitination. Moreover, OTUD6A promotes cell proliferation and decreases sensitivity to chemotherapy by upregulating CDC6. CKO mice are less prone to BCa tumorigenesis induced by BBN, and knockdown of OTUD6A inhibits tumour progression in vivo. Furthermore, OTUD6A protein level has a positive correlation with CDC6 protein level, and high protein levels of OTUD6A and CDC6 are associated with poor prognosis in patients with bladder cancer.We reveal an important yet missing piece of novel DUB governing CDC6 stability. In addition, our findings propose a model for the OTUD6A-CDC6 axis that provides novel insights into cell cycle and chemosensitivity regulation, which may become a potential biomarker and promising drug target for cancer treatment.© 2024.

This study aims to identify genes that are associated with vascular health effects of flavonoids and whose polymorphisms could explain interindividual variability in response to their intake. Applying the predetermined literature search criteria, we identified five human intervention studies reporting positive effects of flavonoids on vascular function together with global genomic changes analyzed using microarray methods. Genes involved in vascular dysfunction were identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By extracting data from the eligible human intervention studies, we obtained 5807 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The number of identified upstream regulators (URs) varied across the studies, from 227 to 1407. The search of the GWAS Catalog revealed 493 genes associated with vascular dysfunction.

To identify genetic mechanisms that affect cardiovascular risks in the LLFS population, we developed a multi-omics integration pipeline and applied it to 11 traits associated with cardiovascular risks. Using our pipeline, we aggregated gene-level statistics from rare-variant analysis, GWAS, and gene expression-trait association by Correlated Meta-Analysis (CMA). Across all traits, CMA identified 64 significant genes after Bonferroni correction (p ≤ 2.8×10-7), 29 of which replicated in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) cohort. Notably, 20 of the 29 replicated genes do not have a previously known trait-associated variant in the GWAS Catalog within 50 kb. Thirteen modules in Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks are significantly enriched in genes with low meta-analysis p-values for at least one trait, three of which are replicated in the FHS cohort. The functional annotation of genes in these modules showed a significant over-representation of trait-related biological processes including sterol transport, protein-lipid complex remodeling, and immune response regulation. Among major findings, our results suggest a role of triglyceride-associated and mast-cell functional genesFCER1A,MS4A2,GATA2,HDC, andHRH4in atherosclerosis risks.

38507271,New insights on testicular cancer prevalence with novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.,Cancer Rep (Hoboken),"Testicular cancer (TC), comprising merely 1% of male neoplasms, holds the distinction of being the most commonly encountered neoplasm among young males.Most cases of testicular neoplasms can be classified into two main groups, namely germ cell tumors representing approximately 95% of the cases, and sex cord-stromal tumors accounting for about 5% of the cases. Moreover, its prevalence is on the rise across the globe. TC is a neoplastic condition characterized by a favorable prognosis. The advent of cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic agents in the latter part of the 1970s has led to a significant enhancement in the 5-year survival rate, which presently surpasses 95%. Given that TC is commonly detected before reaching the age of 40, it can be anticipated that these individuals will enjoy an additional 40-50 years of life following successful treatment. The potential causes of TC are multifactorial and related to different pathologies. Accurate identification is imperative to guarantee the utmost efficacious and suitable therapy. To a certain degree, this can be accomplished through the utilization of blood examinations for neoplastic indicators; nonetheless, an unequivocal diagnosis necessitates an evaluation of the histological composition of a specimen via a pathologist.TC is multifactorial and has various pathologies, therefore this review aimed to revise the prenatal and postnatal causes as well as novel diagnostic biomarkers and the therapeutic strategies of TC.© 2024 The Authors.

38525738,Epigenetic Features in Newborns Associated with Preadolescence Lung Function and Asthma Acquisition during Adolescence.,Epigenomes,"The association between newborn DNA methylation (DNAm) and asthma acquisition (AA) during adolescence has been suggested. Lung function (LF) has been shown to be associated with asthma risk and its severity. However, the role of LF in the associations between DNAm and AA is unclear, and it is also unknown whether the association between DNAm and AA is consistent with that between DNAm and LF. We address this question through assessing newborn epigenetic features of preadolescence LF and of AA during adolescence, along with their biological pathways and processes. Our study's primary medical significance lies in advancing the understanding of asthma's early life origins. By investigating epigenetic markers in newborns and their association with lung function in preadolescence, we aim to uncover potential early biomarkers of asthma risk. This could facilitate earlier detection and intervention strategies. Additionally, exploring biological pathways linking early lung function to later asthma development can offer insights into the disease's pathogenesis, potentially leading to novel therapeutic targets.The study was based on the Isle of Wight Birth cohort (IOWBC). Female subjects with DNAm data at birth and with no asthma at age 10 years were included (n = 249). The R package ttScreening was applied to identify CpGs potentially associated with AA from 10 to 18 years and with LF at age 10 (FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC), respectively. Agreement in identified CpGs between AA and LF was examined, along with their biological pathways and processes via the R function gometh. We tested the findings in an independent cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), to examine overall replicability.In IOWBC, 292 CpGs were detected with DNAm associated with AA and 1517 unique CpGs for LF (514 for FEV1, 436 for FVC, 408 for FEV1/FVC), with one overlapping CpG, cg23642632 (NCKAP1) between AA and LF. Among the IOWBC-identified CpGs, we further tested in ALSPAC and observed the highest agreement between the two cohorts in FVC with respect to the direction of association and statistical significance. Epigenetic enrichment analyses indicated non-specific connections in the biological pathways and processes between AA and LF.The present study suggests that FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC (as objective measures of LF) and AA (incidence of asthma) are likely to have their own specific epigenetic features and biological pathways at birth. More replications are desirable to fully understand the complexity between DNAm, lung function, and asthma acquisition.",1.0

Existing data resources for drug discovery and repurposing fail to capture relationships central to the disease's etiology and response to drugs.We designed the Alzheimer's Knowledge Base (AlzKB) to alleviate this need by providing a comprehensive knowledge representation of AD etiology and candidate therapeutics.We designed the AlzKB as a large, heterogeneous graph knowledge base assembled using 22 diverse external data sources describing biological and pharmaceutical entities at different levels of organization (eg, chemicals, genes, anatomy, and diseases). AlzKB uses a Web Ontology Language 2 ontology to enforce semantic consistency and allow for ontological inference. We provide a public version of AlzKB and allow users to run and modify local versions of the knowledge base.AlzKB is freely available on the web and currently contains 118,902 entities with 1,309,527 relationships between those entities. To demonstrate its value, we used graph data science and machine learning to (1) propose new therapeutic targets based on similarities of AD to Parkinson disease and (2) repurpose existing drugs that may treat AD. For each use case, AlzKB recovers known therapeutic associations while proposing biologically plausible new ones.AlzKB is a new, publicly available knowledge resource that enables researchers to discover complex translational associations for AD drug discovery.

The objective of this study was to acquire valid reference data for a northern Chinese population. The study was guided by the criteria for reference studies in age assessment.To this end, a study population from China comprising 917 panoramic radiographs obtained from 430 females and 487 males aged between 15.00 and 25.99 years was analysed. Of the 917 PANs, a total of 1230 mandibular third molars were evaluated.The PANs, retrospectively evaluated, were performed for medical indication during the period from 2016 to 2021. The assessment of mandibular third molars was conducted using the staging scale presented by Olze et al. in 2012. Two independent examiners, trained in assessing PANs for forensic age estimation, evaluated the images. In instances where the two examiners diverged in their assessments these were subsequently deliberated, and a consensus stage was assigned.The mean age increased with higher stages for both teeth and both sexes. The minimum age recorded for stage D, indicating complete tooth eruption, was 15.6 years in females and 16.1 years in males. Consequently, the completion of mandibular third molar eruption was observed in both sexes well before reaching the age of 18. In light of our results, it is evident that relying solely on the assessment of mandibular third molar eruption may not be sufficient for accurately determining the age of majority. Contrary to previous literature, this finding of a completed eruption of the mandibular third molars in northern Chinese individuals is only suitable for detecting the completion of the 16th year of life in males according to our results. However, as the results are inconsistent compared to other studies in the literature, the trait should not be used as the only decisive marker to prove this age threshold in males from northern China.© 2024.

38641429,Influence of age and sex on longitudinal metabolic profiles and body weight trajectories in the UK Biobank.,Int J Epidemiol,"Accurate characterization of how age influences body weight and metabolism at different stages of life is important for understanding ageing processes. Here, we explore observational longitudinal associations between metabolic health and weight from the fifth to the seventh decade of life, using carefully adjusted statistical designs.Body measures and biochemical data from blood and urine (220 measures) across two visits were available from 10 104 UK Biobank participants. Participants were divided into stable (within ±4% per decade), weight loss and weight gain categories. Final subgroups were metabolically matched at baseline (48% women, follow-up 4.3 years, ages 41-70; n = 3368 per subgroup) and further stratified by the median age of 59.3 years and sex.Pulse pressure, haemoglobin A1c and cystatin-C tracked ageing consistently (P < 0.0001). In women under 59, age-associated increases in citrate, pyruvate, alkaline phosphatase and calcium were observed along with adverse changes across lipoprotein measures, fatty acid species and liver enzymes (P < 0.0001). Principal component analysis revealed a qualitative sex difference in the temporal relationship between body weight and metabolism: weight loss was not associated with systemic metabolic improvement in women, whereas both age strata converged consistently towards beneficial (weight loss) or adverse (weight gain) phenotypes in men.We report longitudinal ageing trends for 220 metabolic measures in absolute concentrations, many of which have not been described for older individuals before. Our results also revealed a fundamental dynamic sex divergence that we speculate is caused by menopause-driven metabolic deterioration in women.© The Author(s) 2024.

38605849,"Resilience, Accelerated Aging and Persistently Poor Health: Diverse Trajectories of Health in Malawi.",Popul Dev Rev,"Individuals age at vastly different rates resulting in significant within-population heterogeneity in health and aging outcomes. This diversity in health and aging trajectories has rarely been investigated among low-income aging populations that have experienced substantial hardships throughout their lifecourses. Utilizing 2006-2018 data from the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health (MLSFH) and estimating group-based trajectory models (GBTM), our analyses identified three distinct lifecourse health trajectories: (1) comparatively good initial mental and physical health that persisted throughout the lifecourse (""resilient aging""); (2) relatively good initial mental and physical health that started to deteriorate during mid-adulthood (""accelerated aging""); and (3) poor initial mental and physical health that further declined over the lifecourse (""aging with persistently poor health""). For both physical and mental health, men were more likely to enjoy resilient aging than women. Predictors other than gender of trajectory membership sometimes confirmed, and sometimes contradicted, hypotheses derived from high-income country studies. Our analyses highlight the long arm of early life conditions and gender in determining aging trajectories and show that a non-trivial sub-population is characterized by aging with persistently poor health. The study uncovers widening gaps in health outcomes between those who age with resilience and those who experience accelerated aging.",8.695246839132875e-08
38519892,"Exploring the ageing methylome in the model insect, Nasonia vitripennis.",BMC Genomics,"The ageing process is a multifaceted phenomenon marked by the gradual deterioration of cellular and organismal functions, accompanied by an elevated susceptibility to diseases. The intricate interplay between genetic and environmental factors complicates research, particularly in complex mammalian models. In this context, simple invertebrate organisms have been pivotal, but the current models lack detectable DNA methylation limiting the exploration of this critical epigenetic ageing mechanism. This study introduces Nasonia vitripennis, the jewel wasp, as an innovative invertebrate model for investigating the epigenetics of ageing. Leveraging its advantages as a model organism and possessing a functional DNA methylation system, Nasonia emerges as a valuable addition to ageing research.Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing unveiled dynamic alterations in DNA methylation, with differentially methylated CpGs between distinct time points in both male and female wasps. These changes were associated with numerous genes, enriching for functions related to telomere maintenance, histone methylation, and mRNA catabolic processes. Additionally, other CpGs were found to be variably methylated at each timepoint. Sex-specific effects on epigenetic entropy were observed, indicating differential patterns in the loss of epigenetic stability over time. Constructing an epigenetic clock containing 19 CpGs revealed a robust correlation between epigenetic age and chronological age.Nasonia vitripennis emerges as a promising model for investigating the epigenetics of ageing, shedding light on the intricate dynamics of DNA methylation and their implications for age-related processes. This research not only expands the repertoire of ageing models but also opens avenues for deeper exploration of epigenetic mechanisms in the context of ageing.© 2024.

This comprehensive dataset allowed us to identify more than 3,000 unique cellular states and catalog over 200 distinct aging-associated cell populations experiencing significant depletion or expansion. Our panoramic analysis uncovered temporally structured, organ- and lineage-specific shifts of cellular dynamics during lifespan progression. Moreover, we investigated aging-associated alterations in immune cell populations, revealing both widespread shifts and organ-specific changes. We further explored the regulatory roles of the immune system on aging and pinpointed specific age-related cell population expansions that are lymphocyte-dependent.

We investigated the earliest molecular pathology of spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), a rare familial neurodegenerative disease that primarily induces death and dysfunction of cerebellum Purkinje cells. Extensive prior studies have identified involvement of transcription or RNA-splicing factors in the molecular pathology of SCA1. However, the regulatory network of SCA1 pathology, especially central regulators of the earliest developmental stages and inflammatory events, remains incompletely understood. Here, we elucidated the earliest developmental pathology of SCA1 using originally developed dynamic molecular network analyses of sequentially acquired RNA-seq data during differentiation of SCA1 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to Purkinje cells. Dynamic molecular network analysis implicated histone genes and cytokine-relevant immune response genes at the earliest stages of development, and revealed relevance of ISG15 to the following degradation and accumulation of mutant ataxin-1 in Purkinje cells of SCA1 model mice and human patients.© 2024.

Thus, we hypothesized that loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in the tumor micro-environment (TME) might be involved in oncogenesis. Previous studies show that LOY in circulating leukocytes of aging men was associated with shorter survival and non-hematological cancer, as well as higher LOY in CD4 + T-lymphocytes in men with prostate cancer vs. controls. However, nothing is known about LOY in leukocytes infiltrating TME and we address this aspect here. We studied frequency and functional effects of LOY in blood, TME and non-tumorous tissue. Regulatory T-lymphocytes (Tregs) in TME had the highest frequency of LOY (22%) in comparison to CD4 + T-lymphocytes and cytotoxic CD8 + T-lymphocytes. LOY score using scRNA-seq was also linked to higher expression of PDCD1, TIGIT and IKZF2 in Tregs. PDCD1 and TIGIT encode immune checkpoint receptors involved in the regulation of Tregs function. Our study sets the direction for further functional research regarding a probable role of LOY in intensifying features related to the suppressive phenotype of Tregs in TME and consequently a possible influence on immunotherapy response in CRC patients.© 2024.

38567294,Deciphering the relationship between temperature and immunity.,Discov Immunol,"Fever is a hallmark symptom of disease across the animal kingdom. Yet, despite the evidence linking temperature fluctuation and immune response, much remains to be discovered about the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, for instance, it is clinically accepted that joint temperature can predict disease progression. But it was only recently demonstrated that the mitochondria of stimulated T cells can rise to an extreme 50°C, potentially indicating a cellular source of these localized 'fevers'. A challenge to dissecting these mechanisms is a bidirectional interplay between temperature and immunity. Heat shock response is found in virtually all organisms, activating protective pathways when cells are exposed to elevated temperatures. However, the temperature threshold that activates these pathways can vary within the same organism, with human immune cells, in particular, demonstrating differential sensitivity to heat. Such inter-cellular variation may be clinically relevant given the small but significant temperature differences seen between tissues, ages, and sexes. Greater understanding of how such small temperature perturbations mediate immune responses may provide new explanations for persistent questions in disease such as sex disparity in disease prevalence. Notably, the prevalence and severity of many maladies are rising with climate change, suggesting temperature fluctuations can interact with disease on multiple levels. As global temperatures are rising, and our body temperatures are falling, questions regarding temperature-immune interactions are increasingly critical. Here, we review this aspect of environmental interplay to better understand temperature's role in immune variation and subsequent risk of disease.© The Author(s) 2024.

38672654,"DNA Damage Responses in Tumors Are Not Proliferative Stimuli, but Rather They Are DNA Repair Actions Requiring Supportive Medical Care.",Cancers (Basel),"In tumors, somatic mutagenesis presumably drives the DNA damage response (DDR) via altered regulatory pathways, increasing genomic instability and proliferative activity. These considerations led to the standard therapeutic strategy against cancer: the disruption of mutation-activated DNA repair pathways of tumors.Justifying that cancer cells are not enemies to be killed, but rather that they are ill human cells which have the remnants of physiologic regulatory pathways.1. Genomic instability and cancer development may be originated from a flaw in estrogen signaling rather than excessive estrogen signaling; 2. Healthy cells with genomic instability exhibit somatic mutations, helping DNA restitution; 3. Somatic mutations in tumor cells aim for the restoration of DNA damage, rather than further genomic derangement; 4. In tumors, estrogen signaling drives the pathways of DNA stabilization, leading to apoptotic death; 5. In peritumoral cellular infiltration, the genomic damage of the tumor induces inflammatory cytokine secretion and increased estrogen synthesis. In the inflammatory cells, an increased growth factor receptor (GFR) signaling confers the unliganded activation of estrogen receptors (ERs); 6. In breast cancer cells responsive to genotoxic therapy, constitutive mutations help the upregulation of estrogen signaling and consequential apoptosis. In breast tumors non-responsive to genotoxic therapy, the possibilities for ER activation via either liganded or unliganded pathways are exhausted, leading to farther genomic instability and unrestrained proliferation.Understanding the real character and behavior of human tumors at the molecular level suggests that we should learn the genome repairing methods of tumors and follow them by supportive therapy, rather than provoking additional genomic damages.",3.014375859904064e-55

However, the extensive rewiring of regulatory circuits driven by the attenuation of the KRAS pathway may induce vulnerabilities of therapeutic relevance. An in-depth molecular analysis of the transcriptional and epigenomic alterations occurring in PDAC cells in the initial hours after MEK1/2 inhibition by trametinib unveiled the induction of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) escaping epigenetic silencing, leading to the production of double-stranded RNAs and the increased expression of interferon (IFN) genes. We tracked ERV activation to the early induction of the transcription factor ELF3, which extensively bound and activated nonsilenced retroelements and synergized with IRF1 (interferon regulatory factor 1) in the activation of IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes. Trametinib-induced viral mimicry in PDAC may be exploited in the rational design of combination therapies in immuno-oncology.",7.298195234661259e-51
38671174,"Consumption of hookahs, e-cigarettes, and classic cigarettes and the impact on medically assisted reproduction treatment.",Sci Rep,"Smoking of classic cigarettes has been well-established as a health risk factor, including cardiovascular, neurological, and pulmonary diseases. Adverse effects on human reproduction have also been shown. Smokers are assumed to have a significantly lower chance of pregnancy, however, the impact of smoking on medically assisted reproduction (MAR) treatment outcomes is controversial. Moreover, smoking habits have changed during the last decades since e-cigarettes and hookahs, or water pipes, have become very popular, yet little is known regarding vaping or hookah-smoking patients undergoing MAR treatments. This prospective study aimed to examine the presence of benzo[a]pyrene, nicotine, and its main metabolite, cotinine, in human follicular fluid (FF) in non-smoking, smoking, and vaping/hookah-smoking patients and to evaluate the impact on female fertility. Human FF samples were collected from 320 women subjected to intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles due to male subfertility. Gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry was used to analyse the presence of benzo[a]pyrene, nicotine, and cotinine. A questionnaire was provided to assess patient consumption behaviour and to identify (1) non-smoking patients, (2) patients who consumed cigarettes, and (3) patients with exclusive consumption of e-cigarettes or hookahs. Data were analysed using linear and logistic regression, Fisher's exact test, and the Mann-Whitney U Test. Nicotine was present in 22 (6.8%) and cotinine in 65 (20.3%) of the 320 samples. The nicotine and cotinine concentrations per sample ranged from 0 to 26.3 ng/ml and 0-363.0 ng/ml, respectively. Benzo[a]pyrene was not detectable in any of the samples analysed. Nicotine and cotinine were also present in the FF of patients with exclusive consumption of e-cigarettes or hookahs. The clinical pregnancy rate, fertilization and maturation rates, and number of oocytes per oocyte pick-up were not statistically significantly different between non-smoking, smoking, or vaping/hookah-smoking patients. Smoking and the accumulation of smoking toxins in the FF have no impact on the outcome of MAR treatments-neither the clinical pregnancy rate, maturation and fertilization rates, nor the number of retrieved oocytes were affected. For the first time, nicotine and cotinine were quantified in the FF of patients exclusively vaping e-cigarettes or smoking hookahs. Since vaping liquids and hookah tobaccos contain potentially harmful substances, other adverse effects cannot be excluded.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03414567.© 2024.

38497478,Exercise-Dependent Modulation of Immunological Response Pathways in Endurance Athletes With and Without Atrial Fibrillation.,J Am Heart Assoc,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial electrical activity. Lone AF occurs in the absence of traditional risk factors and is frequently observed in male endurance athletes, who face a 2- to 5-fold higher risk of AF compared with healthy, moderately active males. Our understanding of how endurance exercise contributes to the pathophysiology of lone AF remains limited. This study aimed to characterize the circulating protein fluctuations during high-intensity exercise as well as explore potential biomarkers of exercise-associated AF.A prospective cohort of 12 male endurance cyclists between the ages of 40 and 65 years, 6 of whom had a history of exercise-associated AF, were recruited to participate using a convenience sampling method. The circulating proteome was subsequently analyzed using multiplex immunoassays and aptamer-based proteomics before, during, and after an acute high-intensity endurance exercise bout to assess temporality and identify potential markers of AF. The endurance exercise bout resulted in significant alterations to proteins involved in immune modulation (eg, growth/differentiation factor 15), skeletal muscle metabolism (eg, α-actinin-2), cell death (eg, histones), and inflammation (eg, interleukin-6). Subjects with AF differed from those without, displaying modulation of proteins previously known to have associations with incident AF (eg, C-reactive protein, insulin-like growth factor-1, and angiopoietin-2), and also with proteins having no previous association (eg, tapasin-related protein and α2-Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein).These findings provide insights into the proteomic response to acute intense exercise, provide mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology behind AF in athletes, and identify targets for future study and validation.",4.860738609671849e-36

However, its prevalence and associated factors in this specific patient population remain understudied, particularly in the Saudi Arabian context.This cross-sectional study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from June to November 2022. Adult patients who had undergone bariatric surgery with a postoperative follow-up of 6 months were included. NES was assessed using the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ).A total of 154 patients were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 38.8 ± 11.4 years. The mean BMI before surgery was 44.8 ± 8.2 kg/m2, which reduced to 28.9 ± 5.8 kg/m2post-surgery. Of these, 52 patients (33.8%) met the criteria for NES based on NEQ scores. The prevalence of NES was significantly higher among female patients, with 35 out of 83 females (42.2%) compared to 17 out of 71 males (23.9%) experiencing NES. While NES was not significantly associated with age, nationality, diet adherence, BMI, or surgery type, chronic diseases-particularly diabetes-emerged as significant risk factors for NES in post-bariatric surgery patients.NES is a prevalent concern among post-bariatric surgery patients, with distinct associations with gender and chronic diseases, particularly diabetes. This study provides valuable insights into NES prevalence and its risk factors in the Saudi Arabian context, highlighting the importance of addressing eating disorders within the framework of bariatric surgery care.© 2024.

Cancer cells use the proteasome to modulate gene expression networks that promote tumor growth. Proteasome inhibitors have emerged as effective cancer therapeutics, but how they work mechanistically remains unclear. Here, using integrative genomic analysis, we discovered unexpected reprogramming of the chromatin landscape and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription initiation in breast cancer cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. The cells acquired dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility at specific genomic loci termed differentially open chromatin regions (DOCR). DOCRs with decreased accessibility were promoter proximal and exhibited unique chromatin architecture associated with divergent RNAPII transcription. Conversely, DOCRs with increased accessibility were primarily distal to transcription start sites and enriched in oncogenic superenhancers predominantly accessible in non-basal breast tumor subtypes. These findings describe the mechanisms by which the proteasome modulates the expression of gene networks intrinsic to breast cancer biology.Our study provides a strong basis for understanding the mechanisms by which proteasome inhibitors exert anticancer effects.

38600550,Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic data reveals distinct patterns for developmental and housekeeping gene regulation.,BMC Biol,"Regulation of transcription is central to the emergence of new cell types during development, and it often involves activation of genes via proximal and distal regulatory regions. The activity of regulatory elements is determined by transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic marks, but despite extensive mapping of such patterns, the extraction of regulatory principles remains challenging.Here we study differentially and similarly expressed genes along with their associated epigenomic profiles, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation, during lineage specification at gastrulation in mice. Comparison of the three lineages allows us to identify genomic and epigenomic features that distinguish the two classes of genes. We show that differentially expressed genes are primarily regulated by distal elements, while similarly expressed genes are controlled by proximal housekeeping regulatory programs. Differentially expressed genes are relatively isolated within topologically associated domains, while similarly expressed genes tend to be located in gene clusters. Transcription of differentially expressed genes is associated with differentially open chromatin at distal elements including enhancers, while that of similarly expressed genes is associated with ubiquitously accessible chromatin at promoters.Based on these associations of (linearly) distal genes' transcription start sites (TSSs) and putative enhancers for developmental genes, our findings allow us to link putative enhancers to their target promoters and to infer lineage-specific repertoires of putative driver transcription factors, within which we define subgroups of pioneers and co-operators.© 2024.

Transcription factors (TFs) regulate the expression of related gene sets, thereby controlling these diverse expression states. Apolipoprotein E (APOE), a pivotal risk-modifying gene in Alzheimer's disease (AD), is expressed in specific glial transcriptional states associated with AD. However, it is still unknown whether the upstream regulatory programs that modulate its expression are shared across brain cell types or specific to microglia and astrocytes.We used pySCENIC to construct state-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for resting and activated cell states within microglia and astrocytes based on single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from AD patients' cortices from the Knight ADRC-DIAN cohort. We then identified replicating TF using data from the ROSMAP cohort. We identified sets of genes co-regulated withAPOEby clustering the GRN target genes and identifying genes differentially expressed after the virtual knockout of TFs regulatingAPOE. We performed enrichment analyses on these gene sets and evaluated their overlap with genes found in AD GWAS loci.We identified an average of 96 replicating regulators for each microglial and astrocyte cell state. Our analysis identified the CEBP, JUN, FOS, and FOXO TF families as key regulators of microglial APOE expression. The steroid/thyroid hormone receptor families, including the THR TF family, consistently regulated APOE across astrocyte states, while CEBP and JUN TF families were also involved in resting astrocytes. AD GWAS-associated genes (PGRN,FCGR3A,CTSH,ABCA1,MARCKS,CTSB,SQSTM1,TSC22D4,FCER1G, and HLA genes) are co-regulated with APOE.

We found a comprehensive and cell-type-specific regulatory landscape forAPOE, revealing distinct and shared regulatory mechanisms across microglia and astrocytes, underscoring the complexity ofAPOEregulation.APOE-co-regulated genes might also affect AD risk.

The interplay between epigenetic regulation, transcriptional modifications, and location-specific alterations within white matter (WM) lesions at the single-cell level remains underexplored.We examined intracellular and intercellular pathways in the MS brain WM using a novel dataset obtained by integrated single-cell multi-omics techniques from 3 active lesions, 3 chronic active lesions, 3 remyelinating lesions, and 3 control WM of 6 patients with progressive MS and 3 non-neurologic controls. Single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq were combined and additionally enriched with newly conducted spatial transcriptomics from 1 chronic active lesion. Functional gene modules were then validated in our previously published bulk tissue transcriptome data obtained from 73 WM lesions of patients with progressive MS and 25 WM of non-neurologic disease controls.Our analysis uncovered an MS-specific oligodendrocyte genetic signature influenced by the KLF/SP gene family. This modulation has potential associations with the autocrine iron uptake signaling observed in transcripts of transferrin and its receptorLRP2. In addition, an inflammatory profile emerged within these oligodendrocytes. We observed unique cellular endophenotypes both at the periphery and within the chronic active lesion. These include a distinct metabolic astrocyte phenotype, the importance of FGF signaling among astrocytes and neurons, and a notable enrichment of mitochondrial genes at the lesion edge populated predominantly by astrocytes. Our study also identified B-cell coexpression networks indicating different functional B-cell subsets with differential location and specific tendencies toward certain lesion types.The use of single-cell multi-omics has offered a detailed perspective into the cellular dynamics and interactions in MS.

However, little is known about the stability of these astrocyte subsets and their ability to integrate past stimulation events. Here we report the identification of an epigenetically controlled memory astrocyte subset that exhibits exacerbated pro-inflammatory responses upon rechallenge. Specifically, using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, focused interrogation of cells by nucleic acid detection and sequencing, and cell-specific in vivo CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic perturbation studies we established that astrocyte memory is controlled by the metabolic enzyme ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), which produces acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) that is used by histone acetyltransferase p300 to control chromatin accessibility. The number of ACLY+p300+memory astrocytes is increased in acute and chronic EAE models, and their genetic inactivation ameliorated EAE. We also detected the pro-inflammatory memory phenotype in human astrocytes in vitro; single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry studies detected increased numbers of ACLY+p300+astrocytes in chronic multiple sclerosis lesions. In summary, these studies define an epigenetically controlled memory astrocyte subset that promotes CNS pathology in EAE and, potentially, multiple sclerosis.

Using hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers for each strain, differences in geometric mean ratios (GMRs) were calculated by sex. Risk ratios (RRs) comparing seroconversion proportions were pooled for females and males using random-effects models. Vaccine efficacy (VE) was assessed. Data were analyzed by age group (18-64 vs ≥65 years).A total of 33 092 healthy adults from 19 studies were included for immunogenicity analysis, and 6740 from 1 study for VE. Whereas no sex differences in immunogenicity were found in adults <65 years old, older females had a significantly greater chance to seroconvert compared to older males for all strains: RRH1N1= 1.17 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.12-1.23]; RRH3N2= 1.09 [95% CI, 1.05-1.14]; RRVictoria= 1.23 [95% CI, 1.14-1.31]; RRYamagata= 1.22 [95% CI, 1.14-1.30]. GMRs were also higher in older females for all strains compared to older males. VE in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza was higher in older females compared to older males with VEs of 27.32% (95% CI, 1.15%-46.56%) and 6.06% (95% CI, -37.68% to 35.90%), respectively.Our results suggest a higher immunogenicity and VE in females compared to males in older adults. These differences in immunogenicity and VE support the disaggregation of vaccine data by sex in clinical trials and observational studies.CRD42018112260.© The Author(s) 2024.

38701219,Altered X-chromosome inactivation predisposes to autoimmunity.,Sci Adv,"In mammals, males and females show marked differences in immune responses. Males are globally more sensitive to infectious diseases, while females are more susceptible to systemic autoimmunity. X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), the epigenetic mechanism ensuring the silencing of one X in females, may participate in these sex biases. We perturbed the expression of the trigger of XCI, the noncoding RNAXist, in female mice. This resulted in reactivation of genes on the inactive X, including members of the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) signaling pathway, in monocyte/macrophages and dendritic and B cells. Consequently, female mice spontaneously developed inflammatory signs typical of lupus, including anti-nucleic acid autoantibodies, increased frequencies of age-associated and germinal center B cells, and expansion of monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells. Mechanistically, TLR7 signaling is dysregulated in macrophages, leading to sustained expression of target genes upon stimulation. These findings provide a direct link between maintenance of XCI and female-biased autoimmune manifestations and highlight altered XCI as a cause of autoimmunity.",4.528811458449124e-36
38697975,Disease related changes in ATAC-seq of iPSC-derived motor neuron lines from ALS patients and controls.,Nat Commun,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), like many other neurodegenerative diseases, is highly heritable, but with only a small fraction of cases explained by monogenic disease alleles. To better understand sporadic ALS, we report epigenomic profiles, as measured by ATAC-seq, of motor neuron cultures derived from a diverse group of 380 ALS patients and 80 healthy controls. We find that chromatin accessibility is heavily influenced by sex, the iPSC cell type of origin, ancestry, and the inherent variance arising from sequencing. Once these covariates are corrected for, we are able to identify ALS-specific signals in the data. Additionally, we find that the ATAC-seq data is able to predict ALS disease progression rates with similar accuracy to methods based on biomarkers and clinical status. These results suggest that iPSC-derived motor neurons recapitulate important disease-relevant epigenomic changes.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.641015723388229e-22
38586055,Epigenomic landscape of the human dorsal root ganglion: sex differences and transcriptional regulation of nociceptive genes.,bioRxiv,"Gene expression is influenced by chromatin architecture via controlled access of regulatory factors to DNA. To better understand regulation of gene expression in the human dorsal root ganglion (hDRG) we used bulk and spatial transposase-accessible chromatin technology followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq). We detected a total of 3005 differentially accessible chromatin regions (DARs) between sexes using bulk ATAC-seq. DARs in female hDRG mapped mainly to the X chromosome. In males, DARs were found in autosomal genes. We also found differential transcription factor binding motifs within DARs. EGR1/3 and SP1/4 were abundant in females, and JUN, FOS and other AP-1 family members in males. With the aim of dissecting the open chromatin profile in hDRG neurons, we used spatial ATAC-seq. Consistent with our bulk ATAC-seq data, most of the DARs in female hDRG were located in X chromosome genes. Neuron cluster showed higher chromatin accessibility in GABAergic, glutamatergic, and interferon-related genes in females, and in Ca2+-signaling-related genes in males. Sex differences in open chromatin transcription factor binding sites in neuron-proximal barcodes were consistent with the bulk data, having EGR1 transcription factor activity in females and AP-1 family members in males. Accordingly, we showed higher expression ofEGR1in female hDRG compared to male with in-situ hybridization. Our findings point to epigenomic sex differences in the hDRG that likely underlie divergent transcriptional responses that determine mechanistic sex differences in pain.",1.642139348950245e-32
38578989,Multi-omics analysis reveals that linoleic acid metabolism is associated with variations of trained immunity induced by distinct BCG strains.,Sci Adv,"Trained immunity is one of the mechanisms by which BCG vaccination confers persistent nonspecific protection against diverse diseases. Genomic differences between the different BCG vaccine strains that are in global use could result in variable protection against tuberculosis and therapeutic effects on bladder cancer. In this study, we found that four representative BCG strains (BCG-Russia, BCG-Sweden, BCG-China, and BCG-Pasteur) covering all four genetic clusters differed in their ability to induce trained immunity and nonspecific protection. The trained immunity induced by BCG was associated with the Akt-mTOR-HIF1α axis, glycolysis, and NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. Multi-omics analysis (epigenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) showed that linoleic acid metabolism was correlated with the trained immunity-inducing capacity of different BCG strains. Linoleic acid participated in the induction of trained immunity and could act as adjuvants to enhance BCG-induced trained immunity, revealing a trained immunity-inducing signaling pathway that could be used in the adjuvant development.",3.2432261587052755e-28

While there have been advances in therapeutics with the emergence of biologics targeting T2-high asthma, there is still little clarity on the mechanisms underlying the origins of both the condition and all of its endotypes. Several biomarkers for particular asthma phenotypes have been documented. These are generally identified from transcriptomics and proteomics protocols and tend to be biased to T2-high phenotypes.

Common mechanisms, shared symptoms.",Am Heart J Plus,"In 2020 the World Health organization announced a pandemic due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus disease 19. Pneumonia was the most common manifestation of the Sars-Cov-2 infection, however, clinical papers describe Sars-Cov-2 associated cardiovascular pathologies, such as ACS, myopericarditis, cardiomyopathies, dysrhythmias, as leading causes of increased morbidity and mortality. The short and long term prognosis of Sars-Cov-2-related cardiovascular diseases was defined not only by the disease severity itself but also by associated conditions and complications, among which mental health issues (stress, depression and anxiety) have a negative impact. The interplay between Sars-Cov-2 infection, cardiovascular disease and depression may be explained by hyperinflammation, unhealthy lifestyle and inter-organ communication, mediated by extracellular vesicles (EV) and non-coding MicroRNA (miRNA). The long Covid syndrome is characterized with orthostatic hypotension, impaired cardiac and cerebral perfusion, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), syncope, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitation, chronic fatigue syndrome, 'brain fog', memory, cognitive and sleep difficulties, depression and anxiety. From a clinical point of view these symptoms may be considered as common symptoms representing not only a cardiac but also a neurological/psychiatric problem.

Previous studies have illustrated the landscape of decidual immune cells. However, the landscape of decidual immune cells in the maternal-fetal microenvironment during T. gondii infection remains unknown.In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the changes in human decidual immune cells following T. gondii infection. The results of scRNA-seq were further validated with flow cytometry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and immunofluorescence staining.Our results showed that the proportion of 17 decidual immune cell clusters and the expression levels of 21 genes were changed after T. gondii infection. Differential gene analysis demonstrated that T. gondii infection induced the differential expression of 279, 312, and 380 genes in decidual NK cells (dNK), decidual macrophages (dMφ), and decidual T cells (dT), respectively. Our results revealed for the first time that several previously unknown molecules in decidual immune cells changed following infection. This result revealed that the function of maternal-fetal immune tolerance declined, whereas the killing ability of decidual immune cells enhanced, eventually contributing to the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes.This study provides valuable resource for uncovering several novel molecules that play an important role in the occurrence of abnormal pregnancy outcomes induced by T. gondii infection.© 2024.

38678389,scBOL: a universal cell type identification framework for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data.,Brief Bioinform,"Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomic technologies have experienced remarkable advancements, enabling the simultaneous profiling of gene expressions across thousands of individual cells. Cell type identification plays an essential role in exploring tissue heterogeneity and characterizing cell state differences. With more and more well-annotated reference data becoming available, massive automatic identification methods have sprung up to simplify the annotation process on unlabeled target data by transferring the cell type knowledge. However, in practice, the target data often include some novel cell types that are not in the reference data. Most existing works usually classify these private cells as one generic 'unassigned' group and learn the features of known and novel cell types in a coupled way. They are susceptible to the potential batch effects and fail to explore the fine-grained semantic knowledge of novel cell types, thus hurting the model's discrimination ability. Additionally, emerging spatial transcriptomic technologies, such as in situ hybridization, sequencing and multiplexed imaging, present a novel challenge to current cell type identification strategies that predominantly neglect spatial organization. Consequently, it is imperative to develop a versatile method that can proficiently annotate single-cell transcriptomics data, encompassing both spatial and non-spatial dimensions.To address these issues, we propose a new, challenging yet realistic task called universal cell type identification for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data. In this task, we aim to give semantic labels to target cells from known cell types and cluster labels to those from novel ones. To tackle this problem, instead of designing a suboptimal two-stage approach, we propose an end-to-end algorithm called scBOL from the perspective of Bipartite prototype alignment. Firstly, we identify the mutual nearest clusters in reference and target data as their potential common cell types. On this basis, we mine the cycle-consistent semantic anchor cells to build the intrinsic structure association between two data. Secondly, we design a neighbor-aware prototypical learning paradigm to strengthen the inter-cluster separability and intra-cluster compactness within each data, thereby inspiring the discriminative feature representations. Thirdly, driven by the semantic-aware prototypical learning framework, we can align the known cell types and separate the private cell types from them among reference and target data. Such an algorithm can be seamlessly applied to various data types modeled by different foundation models that can generate the embedding features for cells. Specifically, for non-spatial single-cell transcriptomics data, we use the autoencoder neural network to learn latent low-dimensional cell representations, and for spatial single-cell transcriptomics data, we apply the graph convolution network to capture molecular and spatial similarities of cells jointly. Extensive results on our carefully designed evaluation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of scBOL over various state-of-the-art cell type identification methods. To our knowledge, we are the pioneers in presenting this pragmatic annotation task, as well as in devising a comprehensive algorithmic framework aimed at resolving this challenge across varied types of single-cell data. Finally, scBOL is implemented in Python using the Pytorch machine-learning library, and it is freely available at https://github.com/aimeeyaoyao/scBOL.© The Author(s) 2024.

We developed an approach,TopicVelo, that disentangles simultaneous, yet distinct, dynamics by using a probabilistic topic model, a highly interpretable form of latent space factorization, to infer cells and genes associated with individual processes, thereby capturing cellular pluripotency or multifaceted functionality. Focusing on process-associated cells and genes enables accurate estimation of process-specific velocities via a master equation for a transcriptional burst model accounting for intrinsic stochasticity. The method obtains a global transition matrix by leveraging cell topic weights to integrate process-specific signals. In challenging systems, this method accurately recovers complex transitions and terminal states, while our use of first-passage time analysis provides insights into transient transitions.

To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a selective inference approach to test for a difference in means between two clusters. Our procedure controls the selective type I error rate by accounting for the fact that the choice of null hypothesis was made based on the data. We describe how to efficiently compute exact p-values for clusters obtained using agglomerative hierarchical clustering with many commonly-used linkages.

38649810,Multiple transcriptome analyses reveal mouse testis developmental dynamics.,BMC Genomics,"The testes are the organs of gamete production and testosterone synthesis. Up to date, no model system is available for mammalian testicular development, and only few studies have characterized the mouse testis transcriptome from no more than three postnatal ages. To describe the transcriptome landscape of the developing mouse testis and identify the potential molecular mechanisms underlying testis maturation, we examined multiple RNA-seq data of mouse testes from 3-week-old (puberty) to 11-week-old (adult). Sperm cells appeared as expected in 5-week-old mouse testis, suggesting the proper sample collection. The principal components analysis revealed the genes from 3w to 4w clustered away from other timepoints, indicating they may be the important nodes for testicular development. The pairwise comparisons at two adjacent timepoints identified 7,612 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), resulting in 58 unique mRNA expression patterns. Enrichment analysis identified functions in tissue morphogenesis (3-4w), regulation of peptidase activity (4-5w), spermatogenesis (7-8w), and antigen processing (10-11w), suggesting distinct functions in different developmental periods. 50 hub genes and 10 gene cluster modules were identified in the testis maturation process by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, and the miRNA-lncRNA-mRNA, miRNA-circRNA-mRNA and miRNA-circRNA-lncRNA-mRNA competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed. The results suggest that testis maturation is a complex developmental process modulated by various molecules, and that some potential RNA-RNA interactions may be involved in specific developmental stages. In summary, this study provides an update on the molecular basis of testis development, which may help to understand the molecular mechanisms of mouse testis development and provide guidance for mouse reproduction.© 2024.

While rodent models of TNIK dysfunction have abnormal spontaneous synaptic activity and cognitive impairment, the role of mutations found in patients with TNIK protein deficiency and TNIK protein kinase activity during early stages of neuronal and synapse development has not been characterized. Here, using hiPSC-derived excitatory neurons, we show that TNIK mutations dysregulate neuronal activity in human immature synapses. Moreover, the lack of TNIK protein kinase activity impairs MAPK signaling and protein phosphorylation in structural components of the PSD.

38600665,scINRB: single-cell gene expression imputation with network regularization and bulk RNA-seq data.,Brief Bioinform,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitates the study of cell type heterogeneity and the construction of cell atlas. However, due to its limitations, many genes may be detected to have zero expressions, i.e. dropout events, leading to bias in downstream analyses and hindering the identification and characterization of cell types and cell functions. Although many imputation methods have been developed, their performances are generally lower than expected across different kinds and dimensions of data and application scenarios. Therefore, developing an accurate and robust single-cell gene expression data imputation method is still essential. Considering to maintain the original cell-cell and gene-gene correlations and leverage bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) data information, we propose scINRB, a single-cell gene expression imputation method with network regularization and bulk RNA-seq data. scINRB adopts network-regularized non-negative matrix factorization to ensure that the imputed data maintains the cell-cell and gene-gene similarities and also approaches the gene average expression calculated from bulk RNA-seq data. To evaluate the performance, we test scINRB on simulated and experimental datasets and compare it with other commonly used imputation methods.

In this study, we converted these primed iPSC to naïve iPSC, and then derived trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) and EVT to evaluate molecular mechanisms underlying PE. We found that primed (but not naïve) iPSC-derived PE-EVT have reduced surface HLA-G, blunted invasive capacity, and altered EVT-specific gene expression.

38720070,Mapping genotypes to chromatin accessibility profiles in single cells.,Nature,"In somatic tissue differentiation, chromatin accessibility changes govern priming and precursor commitment towards cellular fates1-3. Therefore, somatic mutations are likely to alter chromatin accessibility patterns, as they disrupt differentiation topologies leading to abnormal clonal outgrowth. However, defining the impact of somatic mutations on the epigenome in human samples is challenging due to admixed mutated and wild-type cells. Here, to chart how somatic mutations disrupt epigenetic landscapes in human clonal outgrowths, we developed genotyping of targeted loci with single-cell chromatin accessibility (GoT-ChA). This high-throughput platform links genotypes to chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution across thousands of cells within a single assay. We applied GoT-ChA to CD34+cells from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms with JAK2V617F-mutated haematopoiesis. Differential accessibility analysis between wild-type and JAK2V617F-mutant progenitors revealed both cell-intrinsic and cell-state-specific shifts within mutant haematopoietic precursors, including cell-intrinsic pro-inflammatory signatures in haematopoietic stem cells, and a distinct profibrotic inflammatory chromatin landscape in megakaryocytic progenitors. Integration of mitochondrial genome profiling and cell-surface protein expression measurement allowed expansion of genotyping onto DOGMA-seq through imputation, enabling single-cell capture of genotypes, chromatin accessibility, RNA expression and cell-surface protein expression. Collectively, we show that the JAK2V617Fmutation leads to epigenetic rewiring in a cell-intrinsic and cell type-specific manner, influencing inflammation states and differentiation trajectories. We envision that GoT-ChA will empower broad future investigations of the critical link between somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations across clonal populations in malignant and non-malignant contexts.© 2024.

38696033,Emerging DNA Methylome Targets in FLT3-ITD-Positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Combination Therapy with Clinically Approved FLT3 Inhibitors.,Curr Treat Options Oncol,"The internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation of the FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) is the most common mutation observed in approximately 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. It represents poor prognosis due to continuous activation of downstream growth-promoting signaling pathways such as STAT5 and PI3K/AKT. Hence, FLT3 is considered an attractive druggable target; selective small FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3Is), such as midostaurin and quizartinib, have been clinically approved. However, patients possess generally poor remission rates and acquired resistance when FLT3I used alone. Various factors in patients could cause these adverse effects including altered epigenetic regulation, causing mainly abnormal gene expression patterns. Epigenetic modifications are required for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and differentiation; however, critical driver mutations have been identified in genes controlling DNA methylation (such as DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2). These regulators cause leukemia pathogenesis and affect disease diagnosis and prognosis when they co-occur with FLT3-ITD mutation. Therefore, understanding the role of different epigenetic alterations in FLT3-ITD AML pathogenesis and how they modulate FLT3I's activity is important to rationalize combinational treatment approaches including FLT3Is and modulators of methylation regulators or pathways. Data from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will further precisely define the potential use of epigenetic therapy together with FLT3Is especially after characterized patients' mutational status in terms of FLT3 and DNA methlome regulators.© 2024.

38617287,Somatic epimutations enable single-cell lineage tracing in native hematopoiesis across the murine and human lifespan.,bioRxiv,"Current approaches to lineage tracing of stem cell clones require genetic engineering or rely on sparse somatic DNA variants, which are difficult to capture at single-cell resolution. Here, we show that targeted single-cell measurements of DNA methylation at single-CpG resolution deliver joint information about cellular differentiation state and clonal identities. We develop EPI-clone, a droplet-based method for transgene-free lineage tracing, and apply it to study hematopoiesis, capturing hundreds of clonal trajectories across almost 100,000 single-cells. Using ground-truth genetic barcodes, we demonstrate that EPI-clone accurately identifies clonal lineages throughout hematopoietic differentiation. Applied to unperturbed hematopoiesis, we describe an overall decline of clonal complexity during murine ageing and the expansion of rare low-output stem cell clones. In aged human donors, we identified expanded hematopoietic clones with and without genetic lesions, and various degrees of clonal complexity. Taken together, EPI-clone enables accurate and transgene-free single-cell lineage tracing at scale.",1.5793473867386048e-30
38548833,Genetic variation across and within individuals.,Nat Rev Genet,"Germline variation and somatic mutation are intricately connected and together shape human traits and disease risks. Germline variants are present from conception, but they vary between individuals and accumulate over generations. By contrast, somatic mutations accumulate throughout life in a mosaic manner within an individual due to intrinsic and extrinsic sources of mutations and selection pressures acting on cells. Recent advancements, such as improved detection methods and increased resources for association studies, have drastically expanded our ability to investigate germline and somatic genetic variation and compare underlying mutational processes. A better understanding of the similarities and differences in the types, rates and patterns of germline and somatic variants, as well as their interplay, will help elucidate the mechanisms underlying their distinct yet interlinked roles in human health and biology.© 2024.

38654047,Machine-learning prediction of a novel diagnostic model using mitochondria-related genes for patients with bladder cancer.,Sci Rep,"Bladder cancer (BC) is the ninth most-common cancer worldwide and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Mitochondrial Dysfunction is involved in the progression of BC. This study aimed to developed a novel diagnostic model based on mitochondria-related genes (MRGs) for BC patients using Machine Learning. In this study, we analyzed GSE13507 datasets and identified 752 DE-MRGs in BC specimens. Functional enrichment analysis uncovered the significant roles of 752 DE-MRGs in key processes such as cellular and organ development, as well as gene regulation. The analysis revealed the crucial functions of these genes in transcriptional regulation and protein-DNA interactions. Then, we performed LASSO and SVM-RFE, and identified four critical diagnostic genes including GLRX2, NMT1, OXSM and TRAF3IP3. Based on the above four genes, we developed a novel diagnostic model whose diagnostic value was confirmed in GSE13507, GSE3167 and GSE37816 datasets. Moreover, we reported the expressing pattern of GLRX2, NMT1, OXSM and TRAF3IP3 in BC samples. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that the four genes were associated with several immune cells. Finally, we performed RT-PCR and confirmed NMT1 was highly expressed in BC cells. Functional experiments revealed that knockdown of NMT1 suppressed the proliferation of BC cells. Overall, we have formulated a diagnostic potential that offered a comprehensive framework for delving into the underlying mechanisms of BC. Before proceeding with clinical implementation, it is essential to undertake further investigative efforts to validate its diagnostic effectiveness in BC patients.© 2024.

38575196,Machine learning identifies novel coagulation genes as diagnostic and immunological biomarkers in ischemic stroke.,Aging (Albany NY),"Coagulation system is currently known associated with the development of ischemic stroke (IS). Thus, the current study is designed to identify diagnostic value of coagulation genes (CGs) in IS and to explore their role in the immune microenvironment of IS.Aberrant expressed CGs in IS were input into unsupervised consensus clustering to classify IS subtypes. Meanwhile, key CGs involved in IS were further selected by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning methods, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), generalized linear model (GLM) and extreme-gradient boosting (XGB). The diagnostic performance of key CGs were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. At last, quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to validate the expressions of key CGs in IS.IS patients were classified into two subtypes with different immune microenvironments by aberrant expressed CGs. Further WGCNA, machine learning methods and ROC curves identified ACTN1, F5, TLN1, JMJD1C and WAS as potential diagnostic biomarkers of IS. In addition, their expressions were significantly correlated with macrophages, neutrophils and/or T cells. GSEA also revealed that those biomarkers may regulate IS via immune and inflammation. Moreover, qPCR verified the expressions of ACTN1, F5 and JMJD1C in IS.The current study identified ACTN1, F5 and JMJD1C as novel coagulation-related biomarkers associated with IS immune microenvironment, which enriches our knowledge of coagulation-mediated pathogenesis of IS and sheds light on next-stepin vivoandin vitroexperiments to elucidate the relevant molecular mechanisms.",5.28910505337562e-34
38672807,DNA Methylation Machinery in Gastropod Mollusks.,Life (Basel),"The role of DNA methylation in mollusks is just beginning to be understood. This review synthesizes current knowledge on this potent molecular hallmark of epigenetic control in gastropods-the largest class of mollusks and ubiquitous inhabitants of diverse habitats. Their DNA methylation machinery shows a high degree of conservation in CG maintenance methylation mechanisms, driven mainly by DNMT1 homologues, and the presence of MBD2 and MBD2/3 proteins as DNA methylation readers. The mosaic-like DNA methylation landscape occurs mainly in a CG context and is primarily confined to gene bodies and housekeeping genes. DNA methylation emerges as a critical regulator of reproduction, development, and adaptation, with tissue-specific patterns being observed in gonadal structures. Its dynamics also serve as an important regulatory mechanism underlying learning and memory processes. DNA methylation can be affected by various environmental stimuli, including as pathogens and abiotic stresses, potentially impacting phenotypic variation and population diversity. Overall, the features of DNA methylation in gastropods are complex, being an essential part of their epigenome. However, comprehensive studies integrating developmental stages, tissues, and environmental conditions, functional annotation of methylated regions, and integrated genomic-epigenomic analyses are lacking. Addressing these knowledge gaps will advance our understanding of gastropod biology, ecology, and evolution.",1.1859477109302049e-29
38500955,Respiratory function after 30+ years following sulfur mustard exposure in survivors in Sweden.,Front Med (Lausanne),"Sulfur mustard (SM) exposure causes acute and chronic respiratory diseases. The extent of small airway dysfunction (SAD) in individuals exposed to SM is unclear. This study evaluated and compared SAD in SM-exposed and SM-unexposed participants using noninvasive lung function tests assessing small airway function.This retrospective cohort study involved SM-exposed (n= 15, mean age: 53 ± 8 years) and SM-unexposed (n= 15, mean age: 53 ± 7 years) Kurdish-Swedish individuals in Sweden. Small airway resistance and reactance were assessed using impulse oscillometry (IOS). Nitrogen (N2) multiple breath washout (MBW) was employed to assess lung ventilation heterogeneity. The gas-exchanging capacity of the lungs was assessed using the diffusing capacity of the lungs for the carbon monoxide (DLCO) test. Lung function outcomes were reported as absolute values andz-scores. Group comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test.No statistically significant differences in age, height, or body mass index were observed between the two groups. IOS showed significantly increased small airway resistance, while N2MBW exhibited significantly increased global and acinar ventilation heterogeneity in SM-exposed individuals compared to that in unexposed individuals. SAD was identified in 14 of 15 SM-exposed individuals, defined as at least one abnormal IOS difference between resistance at 5 and 20 Hz (R5-R20) and/or area of reactance (AX) or N2MBW lung's acinar zone (Sacin), and DLCO adjusted to the alveolar volume (DLCO/VA) outcome. Of these 14 individuals, only 5 demonstrated concordant findings across the IOS and N2MBW tests.Exposure to SM was positively associated with long-term impairment of respiratory tract function in the small airways in the majority of the previously SM-exposed individuals in the present study. Furthermore, both IOS and N2MBW should be employed to detect SAD in SM-exposed survivors as they provide complementary information. Identifying and characterizing the remaining pathology of the small airways in survivors of SM exposure is a first step toward improved treatment and follow-up.Copyright © 2024 Moradi, Kjellberg, Li, Daka and Olin.",1.0996576591548502e-18

Here we introduce an adapted Pace of Aging method designed to quantify differences between individuals and populations in the speed of aging-related health declines. The adapted Pace of Aging method, implemented in data from N=13,626 older adults in the US Health and Retirement Study, integrates longitudinal data on blood biomarkers, physical measurements, and functional tests. It reveals stark differences in rates of aging between population subgroups and demonstrates strong and consistent prospective associations with incident morbidity, disability, and mortality.

38572400,Satisfaction With Children's Achievements and Health Outcomes in a Sample of Community Older Adults in Nigeria.,Innov Aging,"In most African societies with little or no social welfare services for older adults, many parents regard their children as personal investments and security for the future. As a result, satisfaction with children's achievements may be necessary for older parents' physical and mental health. This study examined the association between satisfaction with adult children's achievements (SACA) and health outcomes (regarding somatic health, self-rated health, anxiety, and depression) in a sample of Nigerian older adults.By using the multistage sampling technique in a cross-sectional survey, 465 older adults (mean age = 74.18 ± 9.42) consisting of 294 women were selected from 14 rural communities in a State in Nigeria. Data were collected using validated instruments and analyzed using multiple linear regression and multigroup analyses in SPSS AMOS.High SACA was significantly associated with low somatic health problems, positive self-rated health, and low levels of anxiety and depression, even after controlling for sociodemographic factors, children's support, social engagement, and loneliness. Further analyses indicated that the relationship between SACA and depression was only significant in women and more robust in the widowed. Also, SACA was associated with somatic health among the married but not the widowed. The level of children's support was not a significant moderator.Parents can experience positive emotions and, consequently, good health from being satisfied with their children's achievements regardless of perceived children's support. Assessing SACA may aid in better diagnoses and formulation of a more effective clinical intervention to improve the well-being of older adults in developing societies.© The Author(s) 2023.

38665228,Unraveling the association between major depressive disorder and senescent biomarkers in immune cells of older adults: a single-cell phenotypic analysis.,Front Aging,"Background:Little is known about the prevalence of cellular senescence among immune cells (i.e., immune cells expressing senescence markers, iSCs) nor is there a gold-standard to efficiently measure iSCs. Major depressive disorder (MDD) in older adults has been associated with many hallmarks of senescence in whole blood, leukocytes, and plasma, supporting a strong connection between iSCs and MDD. Here, we investigated the prevalence and phenotype of iSCs in older adults with MDD. Using a single-cell phenotypic approach, circulating immune cells were examined for iSC biomarkers and their relationship to depression and inflammation.Results:PBMCs from older adults with MDD (aged 69.75 ± 5.23 years) and healthy controls (aged 71.25 ± 8.8 years) were examined for immune subset distribution and senescence biomarkers (i.e., lack of proliferation, senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF), and DNA damage). Dual-expression of SAHF and DNA damage was categorized by low, intermediate, and high expression. A significant increase in the number of high expressing total PBMCs (p= 0.01), monocytes (p= 0.008), a trending increase in the number of high expressing CD4 T cells (p= 0.06) was observed overall in those with MDD. There was also a significantly lower proportion of intermediate expressing cells in monocytes and CD4 T cells in MDD (p= 0.01 andp= 0.05, respectively). Correlation analysis revealed associations between iSCs and mRNA expression of factors related to SASP and immune cell function.Conclusion:MDD is associated with increased senescent cell biomarkers in immune cell populations delineated by distinct levels of SAHF and DNA damage. Inflammatory markers might serve as potent indicators of iSC burden in MDD.Copyright © 2024 Lorenzo, Figueroa, Demirci, El-Tayyeb, Huggins, Illindala, Bartley, Haynes and Diniz.",4.4326854014460866e-26
38532386,The Mood and Resilience in Offspring (MARIO) project: a longitudinal cohort study among offspring of parents with and without a mood disorder.,BMC Psychiatry,"One of the most robust risk factors for developing a mood disorder is having a parent with a mood disorder. Unfortunately, mechanisms explaining the transmission of mood disorders from one generation to the next remain largely elusive. Since timely intervention is associated with a better outcome and prognosis, early detection of intergenerational transmission of mood disorders is of paramount importance. Here, we describe the design of the Mood and Resilience in Offspring (MARIO) cohort study in which we investigate: 1. differences in clinical, biological and environmental (e.g., psychosocial factors, substance use or stressful life events) risk and resilience factors in children of parents with and without mood disorders, and 2. mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of mood disorders via clinical, biological and environmental risk and resilience factors.MARIO is an observational, longitudinal cohort study that aims to include 450 offspring of parents with a mood disorder (uni- or bipolar mood disorders) and 100-150 offspring of parents without a mood disorder aged 10-25 years. Power analyses indicate that this sample size is sufficient to detect small to medium sized effects. Offspring are recruited via existing Dutch studies involving patients with a mood disorder and healthy controls, for which detailed clinical, environmental and biological data of the index-parent (i.e., the initially identified parent with or without a mood disorder) is available. Over a period of three years, four assessments will take place, in which extensive clinical, biological and environmental data and data on risk and resilience are collected through e.g., blood sampling, face-to-face interviews, online questionnaires, actigraphy and Experience Sampling Method assessment. For co-parents, information on demographics, mental disorder status and a DNA-sample are collected.The MARIO cohort study is a large longitudinal cohort study among offspring of parents with and without mood disorders. A unique aspect is the collection of granular data on clinical, biological and environmental risk and resilience factors in offspring, in addition to available parental data on many similar factors. We aim to investigate the mechanisms underlying intergenerational transmission of mood disorders, which will ultimately lead to better outcomes for offspring at high familial risk.© 2024.

This study endeavors to unravel the role of UBXN11within the context of CRC.UBXN11 expression level in CRC, stomach adenocarcinoma and esophageal carcinoma, and the overall survival in corresponding cancers were analyzed using UALCAN database. Human CRC cell lines and xenograft mouse model with UBXN11 overexpression were established to investigate the pathological role of UBXN11 in CRC progression. Luciferase assay, qPCR, and Western blot were performed to dissect the interaction between UBXN11 and NF-κB signaling.Heightened UBXN11 expression was observed in various digestive tract tumors, which was positively correlated with the reduced overall survival rates in CRC patients. Overexpression of UBXN11 significantly enhanced CRC cell proliferation in vitro and promoted tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, UBXN11 promoted CRC tumorigenesis through increasing the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway.This study underscores the pivotal role of UBXN11 in CRC progression and paves the way for novel therapeutic strategies for CRC treatment.© 2024.

Insects, as highly adaptable organisms, can survive under various environmental stresses, which induce oxidative damage and impair antioxidant systems. To investigate the peroxidase (POX) family in Tenebrio molitor, we characterized two POXs, namely TmPOX-iso1 and TmPOX-iso2. The full-length cDNA sequences of TmPox-iso1 and TmPox-iso2 respectively consisted of an open reading frame of 1815 bp encoding 605 amino acids and an open reading frame of 2229 bp encoding 743 amino acids. TmPOX-iso1 and TmPOX-iso2 homologs were found in five distinct insect orders. In the phylogenetic tree analysis, TmPOX-iso1 was clustered with the predicted POX protein of T. castaneum, and TmPOX-iso2 was clustered with the POX precursor protein of T. castaneum. During development, the highest expression level of TmPox-iso1 was observed in the pre-pupal stage, while that of TmPox-iso2 expression were observed in the pre-pupal and 4-day pupal stages. TmPox-iso1 was primarily expressed in the early and late larval gut, while TmPox-iso2 mRNA expression was higher in the fat bodies and Malpighian tubules. In response to cadmium chloride treatment, TmPox-iso1 expression increased at 3 hours and then declined until 24 hours, while in the zinc chloride-treated group, TmPox-iso1 expression peaked 24 hours after the treatment.

Recent evidence suggests that this may be at least partially due to increased oocyte aneuploidy. Reproductive juvenescence in mammals is associated with suboptimal oocyte quality.This was a prospective cohort study. Adolescents (10-19 years old, N=23) and oocyte donors (22-30 years old, N=31) undergoing ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval at the Northwestern Fertility and Reproductive Medicine Center between November 1, 2020 and May 1, 2023 were enrolled in this study.Patient demographics, ovarian stimulation, and oocyte retrieval outcomes were collected for all participants. The transcriptome of CCs associated with mature oocytes was compared between adolescents (10-19 years old, n=19), and oocyte donors (22-30 years old, n=19) using bulk RNA-sequencing. FF cytokine profiles (10-19 years old, n=18 vs. 25-30 years old, n=16) were compared using cytokine arrays.RNA-seq analysis revealed 581 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in cumulus cells of adolescents relative to oocyte donors, with 361 genes downregulated and 220 upregulated. Genes enriched in pathways involved in cell cycle and cell division (e.g., GO:1903047, p= 3.5 × 10-43; GO:0051983, p= 4.1 × 10-30; GO:0000281, p= 7.7 × 10-15; GO:0044839, p= 5.3 × 10-13) were significantly downregulated, while genes enriched in several pathways involved in cellular and vesicle organization (e.g., GO:0010256, p= 1.2 × 10-8; GO:0051129, p= 6.8 × 10-7; GO:0016050, p= 7.4 × 10-7; GO:0051640, p= 8.1 × 10-7) were upregulated in CCs of adolescents compared to oocyte donors. The levels of 9 cytokines were significantly increased in FF of adolescents compared to oocyte donors: IL-1 alpha (2-fold), IL-1 beta (1.7-fold), I-309 (2-fold), IL-15 (1.6-fold), TARC (1.9-fold), TPO (2.1-fold), IGFBP-4 (2-fold), IL-12-p40 (1.7-fold) and ENA-78 (1.4-fold). Interestingly, 7 of these cytokines have known pro-inflammatory roles. Importantly, neither the CC transcriptomes or FF cytokine profiles were different in adolescents with or without cancer.Original high-throughput sequencing data will be deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) before publication, and the GEO accession number will be provided here.This study aims to gain insights into the associated gamete quality by studying the immediate oocyte microenvironment. The direct study of oocytes is more challenging due to sample scarcity, as they are cryopreserved for future use, but will provide a more accurate assessment of oocyte reproductive potential.Understanding the underpinnings of altered immediate oocyte microenvironment of adolescent patients may provide insights into the reproductive potential of the associated gametes in the younger end of the age spectrum.

ComBat is a leading approach for addressing these site biases. However, despite its frequent use for harmonization, ComBat's robustness toward site dissimilarities and overall cohort size have not yet been evaluated in terms of DTI.As a baseline, we matchN=358participants from two sites to create a ""silver standard"" that simulates a cohort for multi-site harmonization. Across sites, we harmonize mean fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, calculated using participant DTI data, for the regions of interest defined by the JHU EVE-Type III atlas. We bootstrap 10 iterations at 19 levels of total sample size, 10 levels of sample size imbalance between sites, and 6 levels of mean age difference between sites to quantify (i) βAGE, the linear regression coefficient of the relationship between FA and age; (ii) γ^sf*, the ComBat-estimated site-shift; and (iii) δ^sf*, the ComBat-estimated site-scaling. We characterize the reliability of ComBat by evaluating the root mean squared error in these three metrics and examine if there is a correlation between the reliability of ComBat and a violation of assumptions.ComBat remains well behaved forβAGEwhenN>162and when the mean age difference is less than 4 years. The assumptions of the ComBat model regarding the normality of residual distributions are not violated as the model becomes unstable.Prior to harmonization of DTI data with ComBat, the input cohort should be examined for size and covariate distributions of each site. Direct assessment of residual distributions is less informative on stability than bootstrap analysis.

38545852,Mismatch repair protein deficiency and its implications on distant metastasis in colorectal cancer: A comprehensive analysis.,Cancer Med,"While previous studies have indicated variability in distant metastatic potential among different mismatch repair (MMR) states in colorectal cancer (CRC), their findings remain inconclusive, especially considering potential differences across various ethnic backgrounds. Furthermore, the gene regulatory networks and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these variances in metastatic potential across MMR states have yet to be elucidated.We collected 2058 consecutive primary CRC samples from the South West of China and assessed the expression of MMR proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) using immunohistochemistry. To explore the inconsistencies between different MMR statuses and recurrence, we performed a meta-analysis. To delve deeper, we employed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), ClueGo, and iRegulon, pinpointing gene expression networks and key regulatory molecules linked to metastasis and recurrence in CRC. Lastly, both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied to determine the impact of core regulatory molecules on metastasis.Of the samples, 8.2% displayed deficient MMR (dMMR), with losses of MLH1 and PSM2 observed in 40.8% and 63.9%, respectively. A unique 24.3% isolated loss of PMS2 without concurrent metastasis was identified, a result that diverges from established literature. Additionally, our meta-analysis further solidifies the reduced recurrence likelihood in dMMR CRC samples compared to proficient MMR (pMMR). Two gene expression networks tied to distant metastasis and recurrence were identified, with a majority of metastasis-related genes located on chromosomes 8 and 18. An IRF1 positive feedback loop was discerned in the metastasis-related network, and IRF1 was identified as a predictive marker for both recurrence-free and distant metastasis-free survival across multiple datasets.Geographical and ethnic factors might influence peculiarities in MMR protein loss. Our findings also highlight new gene expression networks and crucial regulatory molecules in CRC metastasis, enhancing our comprehension of the mechanisms driving distant metastasis.© 2024 The Authors.

38615060,Lipopolysaccharide binding protein resists hepatic oxidative stress by regulating lipid droplet homeostasis.,Nat Commun,"Oxidative stress-induced lipid accumulation is mediated by lipid droplets (LDs) homeostasis, which sequester vulnerable unsaturated triglycerides into LDs to prevent further peroxidation. Here we identify the upregulation of lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) and its trafficking through LDs as a mechanism for modulating LD homeostasis in response to oxidative stress. Our results suggest that LBP induces lipid accumulation by controlling lipid-redox homeostasis through its lipid-capture activity, sorting unsaturated triglycerides into LDs. N-acetyl-L-cysteine treatment reduces LBP-mediated triglycerides accumulation by phospholipid/triglycerides competition and Peroxiredoxin 4, a redox state sensor of LBP that regulates the shuttle of LBP from LDs. Furthermore, chronic stress upregulates LBP expression, leading to insulin resistance and obesity. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the role of LBP in regulating LD homeostasis and against cellular peroxidative injury. These insights could inform the development of redox-based therapies for alleviating oxidative stress-induced metabolic dysfunction.© 2024. The Author(s).",6.484178805846026e-32
38586826,Protein crotonylation: Basic research and clinical diseases.,Biochem Biophys Rep,"Crotonylation is an importantly conserved post-translational modification, which is completely different from acetylation. In recent years, it has been confirmed that crotonylation occurs on histone and non-histone. Crotonylated Histone primarily affects gene expression through transcriptional regulation, while non-histone Crotonylation mainly regulates protein functions including protein activity, localization, and stability, as well as protein-protein interactions. The change in protein expression and function will affect the physiological process of cells and even cause disease. Reviewing previous studies, this article summarizes the mechanisms of histone and non-histone crotonylation in regulating diseases and cellular physiological processes to explore the possibility of precise regulation of crotonylation sites as potential targets for disease treatment.© 2024 The Authors.",6.699817317545518e-25
38613677,Running in the FAMILY: understanding and predicting the intergenerational transmission of mental illness.,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,"Over 50% of children with a parent with severe mental illness will develop mental illness by early adulthood. However, intergenerational transmission of risk for mental illness in one's children is insufficiently considered in clinical practice, nor is it sufficiently utilised into diagnostics and care for children of ill parents. This leads to delays in diagnosing young offspring and missed opportunities for protective actions and resilience strengthening. Prior twin, family, and adoption studies suggest that the aetiology of mental illness is governed by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, potentially mediated by changes in epigenetic programming and brain development. However, how these factors ultimately materialise into mental disorders remains unclear. Here, we present the FAMILY consortium, an interdisciplinary, multimodal (e.g., (epi)genetics, neuroimaging, environment, behaviour), multilevel (e.g., individual-level, family-level), and multisite study funded by a European Union Horizon-Staying-Healthy-2021 grant. FAMILY focuses on understanding and prediction of intergenerational transmission of mental illness, using genetically informed causal inference, multimodal normative prediction, and animal modelling. Moreover, FAMILY applies methods from social sciences to map social and ethical consequences of risk prediction to prepare clinical practice for future implementation. FAMILY aims to deliver: (i) new discoveries clarifying the aetiology of mental illness and the process of resilience, thereby providing new targets for prevention and intervention studies; (ii) a risk prediction model within a normative modelling framework to predict who is at risk for developing mental illness; and (iii) insight into social and ethical issues related to risk prediction to inform clinical guidelines.© 2024.

38589616,Sample-to-answer lateral flow assay with integrated plasma separation and NT-proBNP detection.,Anal Bioanal Chem,"Through enabling whole blood detection in point-of-care testing (POCT), sedimentation-based plasma separation promises to enhance the functionality and extend the application range of lateral flow assays (LFAs). To streamline the entire process from the introduction of the blood sample to the generation of quantitative immune-fluorescence results, we combined a simple plasma separation technique, an immunoreaction, and a micropump-driven external suction control system in a polymer channel-based LFA. Our primary objective was to eliminate the reliance on sample-absorbing separation membranes, the use of active separation forces commonly found in POCT, and ultimately allowing finger prick testing. Combining the principle of agglutination of red blood cells with an on-device sedimentation-based separation, our device allows for the efficient and fast separation of plasma from a 25-µL blood volume within a mere 10 min and overcomes limitations such as clogging, analyte adsorption, and blood pre-dilution. To simplify this process, we stored the agglutination agent in a dried state on the test and incorporated a filter trench to initiate sedimentation-based separation. The separated plasma was then moved to the integrated mixing area, initiating the immunoreaction by rehydration of probe-specific fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. The biotinylated immune complex was subsequently trapped in the streptavidin-rich detection zone and quantitatively analyzed using a fluorescence microscope. Normalized to the centrifugation-based separation, our device demonstrated high separation efficiency of 96% and a yield of 7.23 µL (= 72%). Furthermore, we elaborate on its user-friendly nature and demonstrate its proof-of-concept through an all-dried ready-to-go NT-proBNP lateral flow immunoassay with clinical blood samples.© 2024.

38565871,Early screening of colorectal cancer using feature engineering with artificial intelligence-enhanced analysis of nanoscale chromatin modifications.,Sci Rep,"Colonoscopy is accurate but inefficient for colorectal cancer (CRC) prevention due to the low (~ 7 to 8%) prevalence of target lesions, advanced adenomas. We leveraged rectal mucosa to identify patients who harbor CRC field carcinogenesis by evaluating chromatin 3D architecture. Supranucleosomal disordered chromatin chains (~ 5 to 20 nm, ~1 kbp) fold into chromatin packing domains (~ 100 to 200 nm, ~ 100 to 1000 kbp). In turn, the fractal-like conformation of DNA within chromatin domains and the folding of the genome into packing domains has been shown to influence multiple facets of gene transcription, including the transcriptional plasticity of cancer cells. We deployed an optical spectroscopic nanosensing technique, chromatin-sensitive partial wave spectroscopic microscopy (csPWS), to evaluate the packing density scaling D of the chromatin chain conformation within packing domains from rectal mucosa in 256 patients with varying degrees of progression to colorectal cancer. We found average packing scaling D of chromatin domains was elevated in tumor cells, histologically normal-appearing cells 4 cm proximal to the tumor, and histologically normal-appearing rectal mucosa compared to cells from control patients (p < 0.001). Nuclear D had a robust correlation with the model of 5-year risk of CRC with r2 = 0.94. Furthermore, rectal D was evaluated as a screening biomarker for patients with advanced adenomas presenting an AUC of 0.85 and 85% sensitivity and specificity. artificial intelligence-enhanced csPWS improved diagnostic performance with AUC = 0.90. Considering the low sensitivity of existing CRC tests, including liquid biopsies, to early-stage cancers our work highlights the potential of chromatin biomarkers of field carcinogenesis in detecting early, significant precancerous colon lesions.© 2024.

38559579,Predicting early gastric cancer risk using machine learning: A population-based retrospective study.,Digit Health,"Early detection and treatment are crucial for reducing gastrointestinal tumour-related mortality. The diagnostic efficiency of the most commonly used diagnostic markers for gastric cancer (GC) is not very high. A single laboratory test cannot meet the requirements of early screening, and machine learning methods are needed to aid the early diagnosis of GC by combining multiple indicators.Based on the XGBoost algorithm, a new model was developed to distinguish between GC and precancerous lesions in newly admitted patients between 2018 and 2023 using multiple laboratory tests. We evaluated the ability of the prediction score derived from this model to predict early GC. In addition, we investigated the efficacy of the model in correctly screening for GC given negative protein tumour marker results.The XHGC20 model constructed using the XGBoost algorithm could distinguish GC from precancerous disease well (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.901), with a sensitivity, specificity and cut-off value of 0.830, 0.806 and 0.265, respectively. The prediction score was very effective in the diagnosis of early GC. When the cut-off value was 0.27, and the AUC was 0.888, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.797 and 0.807, respectively. The model was also effective at evaluating GC given negative conventional markers (AUC = 0.970), with the sensitivity and specificity of 0.941 and 0.906, respectively, which helped to reduce the rate of missed diagnoses.The XHGC20 model established by the XGBoost algorithm integrates information from 20 clinical laboratory tests and can aid in the early screening of GC, providing a useful new method for auxiliary laboratory diagnosis.© The Author(s) 2024.",3.841451217684723e-28

A single gavage exposure of male mice to Aroclor 1260 (Ar1260), an environmentally relevant mixture of non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), resulted in steatohepatitis and altered RNA modifications in selenocysteine tRNA 34 weeks post-exposure. Unbiased approaches identified the liver proteome, selenoproteins, and levels of 25 metals. Ar1260 altered the abundance of 128 proteins. Enrichment analysis of the liver Ar1260 proteome included glutathione metabolism and translation of selenoproteins. Hepatic glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and Selenoprotein O (SELENOO) were increased and Selenoprotein F (SELENOF), Selenoprotein S (SELENOS), Selenium binding protein 2 (SELENBP2) were decreased with Ar1260 exposure. Increased copper, selenium (Se), and zinc and reduced iron levels were detected. These data demonstrate that Ar1260 exposure alters the (seleno)proteome, Se, and metals in MASLD-associated pathways.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1.0225172477698245e-15
38704519,Identification of key eRNAs for intervertebral disc degeneration by integrated multinomial bioinformatics analysis.,BMC Musculoskelet Disord,"Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a common degenerative condition leading to abnormal stress distribution under load, causing intervertebral stenosis, facet joint degeneration, and foraminal stenosis. Very little is known about the molecular mechanism of eRNAs in IVDD.Gene expression profiles of 38 annulus disc samples composed of 27 less degenerated discs (LDs) and 11 more degenerated discs (MDs) were retrieved from the GEO database. Then, differentially expressed enhancer RNAs (DEeRNAs), differentially expressed target genes (DETGs), and differentially expressed transcription factors (DETFs), hallmark of cancer signalling pathways according to GSVA; the types and quantity of immune cells according to CIBERSORT; and immune gene sets according to ssGSEA were analysed to construct an IVDD-related eRNA network. Then, multidimensional validation was performed to explore the interactions among DEeRNAs, DETFs and DEGs in space.A total of 53 components, 14 DETGs, 15 DEeRNAs, 3 DETFs, 5 immune cells, 9 hallmarks, and 7 immune gene sets, were selected to construct the regulatory network. After validation by online multidimensional databases, 21 interactive DEeRNA-DEG-DETF axes related to IVDD exacerbation were identified, among which the C1S-CTNNB1-CHD4 axis was the most significant.Based upon the results of our study, we theorize that the C1S-CTNNB1-CHD4 axis plays a vital role in IVDD exacerbation. Specifically, C1S recruits CTNNB1 and upregulates the expression of CHD4 in IVDD, and subsequently, CHD4 suppresses glycolysis and activates oxidative phosphorylation, thus generating insoluble collagen fibre deposits and leading to the progression of IVDD. Overall, these DEeRNAs could comprise promising therapeutic targets for IVDD due to their high tissue specificity.© 2024. The Author(s).",6.759469596534394e-35
38585764,Multifaceted roles of cohesin in regulating transcriptional loops.,bioRxiv,"Cohesin is required for chromatin loop formation. However, its precise role in regulating gene transcription remains largely unknown. We investigated the relationship between cohesin and RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) using single-molecule mapping and live-cell imaging methods in human cells. Cohesin-mediated transcriptional loops were highly correlated with those of RNAPII and followed the direction of gene transcription. Depleting RAD21, a subunit of cohesin, resulted in the loss of long-range (>100 kb) loops between distal (super-)enhancers and promoters of cell-type-specific genes. By contrast, the short-range (<50 kb) loops were insensitive to RAD21 depletion and connected genes that are mostly housekeeping. This result explains why only a small fraction of genes are affected by the loss of long-range chromatin interactions due to cohesin depletion. Remarkably, RAD21 depletion appeared to up-regulate genes located in early initiation zones (EIZ) of DNA replication, and the EIZ signals were amplified drastically without RAD21. Our results revealed new mechanistic insights of cohesin's multifaceted roles in establishing transcriptional loops, preserving long-range chromatin interactions for cell-specific genes, and maintaining timely order of DNA replication.",6.482408342219313e-41
38528624,Transcriptionally active chromatin loops contain both 'active' and 'inactive' histone modifications that exhibit exclusivity at the level of nucleosome clusters.,Epigenetics Chromatin,"Chromatin state is thought to impart regulatory function to the underlying DNA sequence. This can be established through histone modifications and chromatin organisation, but exactly how these factors relate to one another to regulate gene expression is unclear. In this study, we have used super-resolution microscopy to image the Y loops of Drosophila melanogaster primary spermatocytes, which are enormous transcriptionally active chromatin fibres, each representing single transcription units that are individually resolvable in the nuclear interior. We previously found that the Y loops consist of regular clusters of nucleosomes, with an estimated median of 54 nucleosomes per cluster with wide variation.In this study, we report that the histone modifications H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3 are also clustered along the Y loops, with H3K4me3 more associated with diffuse chromatin compared to H3K27me3. These histone modifications form domains that can be stretches of Y loop chromatin micrometres long, or can be in short alternating domains. The different histone modifications are associated with different sizes of chromatin clusters and unique morphologies. Strikingly, a single chromatin cluster almost always only contains only one type of the histone modifications that were labelled, suggesting exclusivity, and therefore regulation at the level of individual chromatin clusters. The active mark H3K36me3 is more associated with actively elongating RNA polymerase II than H3K27me3, with polymerase often appearing on what are assumed to be looping regions on the periphery of chromatin clusters.These results provide a foundation for understanding the relationship between chromatin state, chromatin organisation, and transcription regulation - with potential implications for pause-release dynamics, splicing complex organisation and chromatin dynamics during polymerase progression along a gene.© 2024.

38555549,"Metabolic profiling of smoking, associations with type 2 diabetes and interaction with genetic susceptibility.",Eur J Epidemiol,"Smokers are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We investigated if the smoking-T2D association is mediated by alterations in the metabolome and assessed potential interaction with genetic susceptibility to diabetes or insulin resistance.In UK Biobank (n = 93,722), cross-sectional analyses identified 208 metabolites associated with smoking, of which 131 were confirmed in Mendelian Randomization analyses, including glycoprotein acetyls, fatty acids, and lipids. Elastic net regression was applied to create a smoking-related metabolic signature. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) of incident T2D in relation to baseline smoking/metabolic signature and calculated the proportion of the smoking-T2D association mediated by the signature. Additive interaction between the signature and genetic risk scores for T2D (GRS-T2D) and insulin resistance (GRS-IR) on incidence of T2D was assessed as relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI).The HR of T2D was 1·73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1·54 - 1·94) for current versus never smoking, and 38·3% of the excess risk was mediated by the metabolic signature. The metabolic signature and its mediation role were replicated in TwinGene. The metabolic signature was associated with T2D (HR: 1·61, CI 1·46 - 1·77 for values above vs. below median), with evidence of interaction with GRS-T2D (RERI: 0·81, CI: 0·23 - 1·38) and GRS-IR (RERI 0·47, CI: 0·02 - 0·92).The increased risk of T2D in smokers may be mediated through effects on the metabolome, and the influence of such metabolic alterations on diabetes risk may be amplified in individuals with genetic susceptibility to T2D or insulin resistance.© 2024.

38559218,Systematic Analysis of Biological Processes Reveals Gene Co-expression Modules Driving Pathway Dysregulation in Alzheimer's Disease.,bioRxiv,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests as a complex systems pathology with intricate interplay among various genes and biological processes. Traditional differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, while commonly employed to characterize AD-driven perturbations, does not sufficiently capture the full spectrum of underlying biological processes. Utilizing single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from postmortem brain samples across key regions-middle temporal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex-we provide a comprehensive systematic analysis of disrupted processes in AD. We go beyond the DEG-centric analysis by integrating pathway activity analysis with weighted gene co-expression patterns to comprehensively map gene interconnectivity, identifying region- and cell-type-specific drivers of biological processes associated with AD. Our analysis reveals profound modular heterogeneity in neurons and glia as well as extensive AD-related functional disruptions. Co-expression networks highlighted the extended involvement of astrocytes and microglia in biological processes beyond neuroinflammation, such as calcium homeostasis, glutamate regulation, lipid metabolism, vesicle-mediated transport, and TOR signaling. We find limited representation of DEGs within dysregulated pathways across neurons and glial cells, indicating that differential gene expression alone may not adequately represent the disease complexity. Further dissection of inferred gene modules revealed distinct dynamics of hub DEGs in neurons versus glia, highlighting the differential impact of DEGs on neurons compared to glial cells in driving modular dysregulations underlying perturbed biological processes. Interestingly, we note an overall downregulation of both astrocyte and microglia modules in AD across all brain regions, suggesting a prevailing trend of functional repression in glial cells across these regions. Notable genes, including those of the CALM and HSP90 family genes emerged as hub genes across neuronal modules in all brain regions, indicating conserved roles as drivers of synaptic dysfunction in AD. Our findings demonstrate the importance of an integrated, systems-oriented approach combining pathway and network analysis for a comprehensive understanding of the cell-type-specific roles of genes in AD-related biological processes.",1.662862869679672e-51

Germline DNA derived from blood was genotyped on whole-genome array platforms. The abundance of protein markers was quantified using a multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from plasma derived from peripheral venous blood collected at baseline. A robust rank-based method was used to assess the statistical significance of each variant and protein pair against a strict genome-wide level. A given pQTL was tested for validation in two external datasets of prostate (CALGB 90401) and pancreatic cancer (CALGB 80303) patients. Bioinformatics analyses were conducted to further establish biological bases for these findings.The final analysis was carried out based on data from 540,021 common typed genetic variants and 23 protein markers from 869 genetically estimated European patients with mCRC. Correcting for multiple testing, the analysis discovered a novel cis-pQTL in LINC02869, a long non-coding RNA gene, for circulating TGF-β2 levels (rs11118119; AAF = 0.11; P-value < 1.4e-14). This finding was validated in a cohort of 538 prostate cancer patients from CALGB 90401 (AAF = 0.10, P-value < 3.3e-25). The analysis also validated a cis-pQTL we had previously reported for VEGF-A in advanced pancreatic cancer, and additionally identified trans-pQTLs for VEGF-R3, and cis-pQTLs for CD73.This study has provided evidence of a novel cis germline genetic variant that regulates circulating TGF-β2 levels in plasma of patients with advanced mCRC and prostate cancer.

Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of genomic susceptibility loci with susceptibility to psychiatric disorders; however, the contribution of these loci to the underlying psychopathology and etiology remains elusive. Here we generated deep human brain proteomics data by quantifying 11,608 proteins across 268 subjects using 11-plex tandem mass tag coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Our analysis revealed 788 cis-acting protein quantitative trait loci associated with the expression of 883 proteins at a genome-wide false discovery rate <5%. In contrast to expression at the transcript level and complex diseases that are found to be mainly influenced by noncoding variants, we found protein expression level tends to be regulated by non-synonymous variants. We also provided evidence of 76 shared regulatory signals between gene expression and protein abundance. Mediation analysis revealed that for most (88%) of the colocalized genes, the expression levels of their corresponding proteins are regulated by cis-pQTLs via gene transcription. Using summary data-based Mendelian randomization analysis, we identified 4 proteins and 19 genes that are causally associated with schizophrenia. We further integrated multiple omics data with network analysis to prioritize candidate genes for schizophrenia risk loci. Collectively, our findings underscore the potential of proteome-wide linkage analysis in gaining mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders.© 2024.

Yet, the modalities of this cooperation are unclear. Here, we analyzed the co-binding of multiple TFs on single DNA molecules in mouse liver using single molecule footprinting (SMF). We found that SMF reads clustered in stereotypic chromatin states that reflect distinguishable organization of TFs and nucleosomes, and that were remarkably conserved between all samples. DNA protection at CLOCK:BMAL1 binding motif (E-box) varied between CREs, from E-boxes being solely bound by CLOCK:BMAL1 to situations where other TFs competed with CLOCK:BMAL1 for E-box binding. SMF also uncovered CLOCK:BMAL1 cooperative binding at E-boxes separated by 250 bp, which structurally altered the CLOCK:BMAL1-DNA interface. Importantly, we discovered multiple nucleosomes with E-boxes at entry/exit sites that were removed upon CLOCK:BMAL1 DNA binding, thereby promoting the formation of open chromatin states that facilitate DNA binding of other TFs and that were associated with rhythmic transcription. These results demonstrate the utility of SMF for studying how CLOCK:BMAL1 and other TFs regulate stereotypical chromatin states at CREs to promote transcription.",5.113754876367402e-28

Despite broad expression of ERG in all prostate epithelial cells, proliferation was enriched in a small, stem-like population with mixed-luminal basal identity (called intermediate cells). Through a series of lineage tracing and primary prostate tissue transplantation experiments, we find that tumor initiating activity resides in a subpopulation of basal cells that co-express the luminal genesTmprss2andNkx3.1(called BasalLum) but not in the larger population of classicalKrt8+ luminal cells. Upon ERG activation, BasalLumcells give rise to the highly proliferative intermediate state, which subsequently transitions to the larger population of Krt8+ luminal cells characteristic of ERG-positive human cancers. Furthermore, this proliferative population is characterized by an ERG-specific chromatin state enriched for NFkB, AP-1, STAT and NFAT binding, with implications for TF cooperativity. The fact that the proliferative potential of ERG is enriched in a small stem-like population implicates the chromatin context of these cells as a critical variable for unmasking its oncogenic activity.",3.4171534903857165e-46
38538340,Decoding Non-coding Variants: Recent Approaches to Studying Their Role in Gene Regulation and Human Diseases.,Front Biosci (Schol Ed),"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped over 90% of disease- and quantitative-trait-associated variants within the non-coding genome. Non-coding regulatory DNA (e.g., promoters and enhancers) and RNA (e.g., 5' and 3' UTRs and splice sites) are essential in regulating temporal and tissue-specific gene expressions. Non-coding variants can potentially impact the phenotype of an organism by altering the molecular recognition of thecis-regulatory elements, leading to gene dysregulation. However, determining causality between non-coding variants, gene regulation, and human disease has remained challenging. Experimental and computational methods have been developed to understand the molecular mechanism involved in non-coding variant interference at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This review discusses recent approaches to evaluating disease-associated single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and determines their impact on transcription factor (TF) binding, gene expression, chromatin conformation, post-transcriptional regulation, and translation.© 2024 The Author(s).

38524502,Causal role of immune cells in obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome: Mendelian randomization study.,World J Clin Cases,"Despite being one of the most prevalent sleep disorders, obstructive sleep apnea hypoventilation syndrome (OSAHS) has limited information on its immunologic foundation. The immunological underpinnings of certain major psychiatric diseases have been uncovered in recent years thanks to the extensive use of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genotyping techniques using high-density genetic markers (e.g., SNP or CNVs). But this tactic hasn't yet been applied to OSAHS. Using a Mendelian randomization analysis, we analyzed the causal link between immune cells and the illness in order to comprehend the immunological bases of OSAHS.To investigate the immune cells' association with OSAHSviagenetic methods, guiding future clinical research.A comprehensive two-sample mendelian randomization study was conducted to investigate the causal relationship between immune cell characteristics and OSAHS. Summary statistics for each immune cell feature were obtained from the GWAS catalog. Information on 731 immune cell properties, such as morphologic parameters, median fluorescence intensity, absolute cellular, and relative cellular, was compiled using publicly available genetic databases. The results' robustness, heterogeneity, and horizontal pleiotropy were confirmed using extensive sensitivity examination.Following false discovery rate (FDR) correction, no statistically significant effect of OSAHS on immunophenotypes was observed. However, two lymphocyte subsets were found to have a significant association with the risk of OSAHS: Basophil %CD33dim HLA DR- CD66b- (OR = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.01-1.03,P< 0.001); CD38 on IgD+ CD24- B cell (OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 1.02-1.04,P= 0.019).This study shows a strong link between immune cells and OSAHS through a gene approach, thus offering direction for potential future medical research.©The Author(s) 2024.

38492056,Use of tryptic peptide MALDI mass spectrometry imaging to identify the spatial proteomic landscape of colorectal cancer liver metastases.,Clin Exp Med,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. CRC liver metastases (CRLM) are often resistant to conventional treatments, with high rates of recurrence. Therefore, it is crucial to identify biomarkers for CRLM patients that predict cancer progression. This study utilised matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) in combination with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to spatially map the CRLM tumour proteome. CRLM tissue microarrays (TMAs) of 84 patients were analysed using tryptic peptide MALDI-MSI to spatially monitor peptide abundances across CRLM tissues. Abundance of peptides was compared between tumour vs stroma, male vs female and across three groups of patients based on overall survival (0-3 years, 4-6 years, and 7+ years). Peptides were then characterised and matched using LC-MS/MS. A total of 471 potential peptides were identified by MALDI-MSI. Our results show that two unidentified m/z values (1589.876 and 1092.727) had significantly higher intensities in tumours compared to stroma. Ten m/z values were identified to have correlation with biological sex. Survival analysis identified three peptides (Histone H4, Haemoglobin subunit alpha, and Inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2) and two unidentified m/z values (1305.840 and 1661.060) that were significantly higher in patients with shorter survival (0-3 years relative to 4-6 years and 7+ years). This is the first study using MALDI-MSI, combined with LC-MS/MS, on a large cohort of CRLM patients to identify the spatial proteome in this malignancy. Further, we identify several protein candidates that may be suitable for drug targeting or for future prognostic biomarker development.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.941191591233762e-33
38496654,MYT1L deficiency impairs excitatory neuron trajectory during cortical development.,bioRxiv,"Mutations that reduce the function of MYT1L, a neuron-specific transcription factor, are associated with a syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder. Furthermore, MYT1L is routinely used as a proneural factor in fibroblast-to-neuron transdifferentiation. MYT1L has been hypothesized to play a role in the trajectory of neuronal specification and subtype specific maturation, but this hypothesis has not been directly tested, nor is it clear which neuron types are most impacted by MYT1L loss. In this study, we profiled 313,335 nuclei from the forebrains of wild-type and MYT1L-deficient mice at two developmental stages: E14 at the peak of neurogenesis and P21, when neurogenesis is complete, to examine the role of MYT1L levels in the trajectory of neuronal development. We found that MYT1L deficiency significantly disrupted the relative proportion of cortical excitatory neurons at E14 and P21. Significant changes in gene expression were largely concentrated in excitatory neurons, suggesting that transcriptional effects of MYT1L deficiency are largely due to disruption of neuronal maturation programs. Most effects on gene expression were cell autonomous and persistent through development. In addition, while MYT1L can both activate and repress gene expression, the repressive effects were most sensitive to haploinsufficiency, and thus more likely mediate MYT1L syndrome. These findings illuminate the intricate role of MYT1L in orchestrating gene expression dynamics during neuronal development, providing insights into the molecular underpinnings of MYT1L syndrome.",2.839952603880317e-26
38653938,Neuroinflammation and the role of epigenetic-based therapies for Huntington's disease management: the new paradigm.,Inflammopharmacology,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited, autosomal, neurodegenerative ailment that affects the striatum of the brain. Despite its debilitating effect on its patients, there is no proven cure for HD management as of yet. Neuroinflammation, excitotoxicity, and environmental factors have been reported to influence the regulation of gene expression by modifying epigenetic mechanisms. Aside focusing on the etiology, changes in epigenetic mechanisms have become a crucial factor influencing the interaction between HTT protein and epigenetically transcribed genes involved in neuroinflammation and HD. This review presents relevant literature on epigenetics with special emphasis on neuroinflammation and HD. It summarizes pertinent research on the role of neuroinflammation and post-translational modifications of chromatin, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and miRNAs. To achieve this about 1500 articles were reviewed via databases like PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. They were reduced to 534 using MeSH words like 'epigenetics, neuroinflammation, and HD' coupled with Boolean operators. Results indicated that major contributing factors to the development of HD such as mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis are affected by epigenetic alterations. However, the association between neuroinflammation-altered epigenetics and the reported transcriptional changes in HD is unknown. Also, the link between epigenetically dysregulated genomic regions and specific DNA sequences suggests the likelihood that transcription factors, chromatin-remodeling proteins, and enzymes that affect gene expression are all disrupted simultaneously. Hence, therapies that target pathogenic pathways in HD, including neuroinflammation, transcriptional dysregulation, triplet instability, vesicle trafficking dysfunction, and protein degradation, need to be developed.© 2024.

The skin is the largest and the most intuitive organ that reflects the aging of the body. Under the interaction of endogenous and exogenous factors, there are cumulative changes in the structure, function, and appearance of the skin, which are characterized by decreased synthesis of collagen and elastin, increased wrinkles, relaxation, pigmentation, and other aging characteristics. skin aging is inevitable, but it can be delayed. The successful isolation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in 1991 has greatly promoted the progress of cell therapy in human diseases. The International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) points out that the MSC is a kind of pluripotent progenitor cells that have self-renewal ability (limited) in vitro and the potential for mesenchymal cell differentiation. This review mainly introduces the role of perinatal umbilical cord-derived MSC(UC-MSC) in the field of skin rejuvenation. An in-depth and systematic understanding of the mechanism of UC-MSCs against skin aging is of great significance for the early realization of the clinical transformation of UC-MSCs. This paper summarized the characteristics of skin aging and summarized the mechanism of UC-MSCs in skin rejuvenation reported in recent years.

Understanding the markers involved in inflammation and aging, as well as their interaction with environmental factors and bodily control mechanisms, can provide crucial tools for assessing the resilience (i.e. the ability to adapt and improve) of the human body, particularly in the presence of chronic degenerative conditions or vulnerable life stages, that place the individual and the community to which he belongs in a state of potential fragility. HEBE focuses on physical exercise, along with nutritional and lifestyle recommendations, to reduce systemic inflammation and promote healthy aging. HEBE encompasses multiple research lines (LR). In the ongoing LR1 (""proof of concept""), healthy lifestyle recommendations were provided to University of Milan employees, and changes in quality of life and well-being were assessed using a specialized questionnaire. The first 100 eligible subjects, who expressed their willingness to participate, underwent a personalized physical exercise protocol based on clinical and objective assessments. Biomedical samples were collected at baseline (T0) and follow-up (T1) to establish a shared biobank and identify non-invasive biomarkers that monitor the impact of physical exercise on individual characteristics such as cardiovascular and metabolic health. Subsequently (LR2-LR10), the proof of concept findings will be expanded to include various conditions of vulnerability such as obesity, cancer, endocrine disorders, cardiovascular diseases, infertility, functional syndromes, respiratory disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmune conditions. The research lines will leverage the expertise of the 94 participating investigators to form a collaborative network that maximizes the potential for investigation and knowledge exchange.

To explore anti-aging strategies, we develop a dynamic atlas covering 45 cell types in human lungs, spanning from embryonic development to aging. We aim to apply the discoveries of lung's development to address aging-related issues. We observe that both epithelial and immune cells undergo a process of acquisition and loss of essential function as they transition from development to aging. During aging, we identify cellular phenotypic alternations that result in reduced pulmonary compliance and compromised immune homeostasis. Furthermore, we find a distinctive expression pattern of the ferritin light chain (FTL) gene, which increases during development but decreases in various types of lung cells during the aging process.© 2024.

38516126,Senescence and fibrosis in salivary gland aging and disease.,J Oral Biol Craniofac Res,"Salivary gland hypofunction is highly prevalent in aged and diseased individuals leading to significant discomfort and morbidity. One factor that contributes to salivary gland hypofunction is cellular aging, or senescence. Senescent cells can impair gland function by secreting paracrine-acting growth factors and cytokines, known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors. These SASP factors stimulate inflammation, propagate the senescent phenotype through the bystander effect, and stimulate fibrosis. As senotherapeutics that target senescent cells have shown effectiveness in limiting disease manifestations in other conditions, there is interest in the use of these drugs to treat salivary gland hypofunction. In this review, we highlight the contribution of senescence and fibrosis to salivary gland pathologies. We also discuss therapeutic approaches to eliminate or modulate the senescent SASP phenotype for treating age-related salivary gland diseases and extending health span.© 2024 The Authors.",4.12407079735868e-35
38493129,NLRC4 methylation and its response to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in Kawasaki disease: a case control study.,BMC Pediatr,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis accompanied by many systemic physiological and biochemical changes. Elucidating its molecular mechanisms is crucial for diagnosing and developing effective treatments. NLR Family CARD Domain Containing 4 (NLRC4) encodes the key components of inflammasomes that function as pattern recognition receptors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of NLRC4 methylation as a biomarker for KD.In this study, pyrosequencing was utilized to analyze NLRC4 promoter methylation in blood samples from 44 children with initial complete KD and 51 matched healthy controls. Methylation at five CpG sites within the NLRC4 promoter region was evaluated.Compared to controls, NLRC4 methylation significantly decreased in KD patients (CpG1: p = 2.93E-06; CpG2: p = 2.35E-05; CpG3: p = 6.46E-06; CpG4: p = 2.47E-06; CpG5: p = 1.26E-05; average methylation: p = 5.42E-06). These changes were significantly reversed after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. ROC curve analysis demonstrated remarkable diagnostic capability of mean NLRC4 gene methylation for KD (areas under ROC curve = 0.844, sensitivity = 0.75, p = 9.61E-06, 95% confidence intervals were 0.762-0.926 for mean NLRC4 methylation). In addition, NLRC4 promoter methylation was shown to be significantly negatively correlated with the levels of central granulocyte percentage, age, mean haemoglobin quantity and mean erythrocyte volume. Besides, NLRC4 promoter methylation was positively correlated with lymphocyte percentage, lymphocyte absolute value.Our work revealed the role of peripheral NLRC4 hypomethylation in KD pathogenesis and IVIG treatment response, could potentially serve as a treatment monitoring biomarker, although its precise functions remain to be elucidated.© 2024.

Several studies have revealed the importance of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) in the signaling process relating to muscle adaptation during exercise. To date, improving knowledge of redox signaling in modulating exercise adaptation has been the subject of comprehensive work and scientific inquiry. The primary aim of this review is to elucidate the molecular and biochemical pathways aligned to RONS as activators of skeletal muscle adaptation and to further identify the interconnecting mechanisms controlling redox balance. We also discuss the RONS-mediated pathways during the muscle adaptive process, including mitochondrial biogenesis, muscle remodeling, vascular angiogenesis, neuron regeneration, and the role of exogenous antioxidants.© 2024 The Author(s).",1.0695240682780632e-33
38586026,The 24-Hour Time Course of Integrated Molecular Responses to Resistance Exercise in Human Skeletal Muscle Implicates MYC as a Hypertrophic Regulator That is Sufficient for Growth.,bioRxiv,"Molecular control of recovery after exercise in muscle is temporally dynamic. A time course of biopsies around resistance exercise (RE) combined with -omics is necessary to better comprehend the molecular contributions of skeletal muscle adaptation in humans. Vastus lateralis biopsies before and 30 minutes, 3-, 8-, and 24-hours after acute RE were collected. A time-point matched biopsy-only group was also included. RNA-sequencing defined the transcriptome while DNA methylomics and computational approaches complemented these data. The post-RE time course revealed: 1) DNA methylome responses at 30 minutes corresponded to upregulated genes at 3 hours, 2) a burst of translation- and transcription-initiation factor-coding transcripts occurred between 3 and 8 hours, 3) global gene expression peaked at 8 hours, 4) ribosome-related genes dominated the mRNA landscape between 8 and 24 hours, 5) methylation-regulatedMYCwas a highly influential transcription factor throughout the 24-hour recovery and played a primary role in ribosome-related mRNA levels between 8 and 24 hours. The influence of MYC in human muscle adaptation was strengthened by transcriptome information from acute MYC overexpression in mouse muscle. To test whether MYC was sufficient for hypertrophy, we generated a muscle fiber-specific doxycycline inducible model of pulsatile MYC induction. Periodic 48-hour pulses of MYC over 4 weeks resulted in higher muscle mass and fiber size in the soleus of adult female mice. Collectively, we present a temporally resolved resource for understanding molecular adaptations to RE in muscle and reveal MYC as a regulator of RE-induced mRNA levels and hypertrophy.",5.1605662365230836e-43
38542762,Glutathione Supplementation Prevents Neonatal Parenteral Nutrition-Induced Short- and Long-Term Epigenetic and Transcriptional Disruptions of Hepatic H(2)O(2) Metabolism in Guinea Pigs.,Nutrients,"The parenteral nutrition (PN) received by premature newborns is contaminated with peroxides that induce global DNA hypermethylation via oxidative stress. Exposure to peroxides could be an important factor in the induction of chronic diseases such as those observed in adults who were born preterm. As endogenous H2O2is a major regulator of glucose-lipid metabolism, our hypothesis was that early exposure to PN induces permanent epigenetic changes in H2O2metabolism. Three-day-old guinea pigs were fed orally (ON), PN or glutathione-enriched PN (PN+GSSG). GSSG promotes endogenous peroxide detoxification. After 4 days, half the animals were sacrificed, and the other half were fed ON until 16 weeks of age. The liver was harvested. DNA methylation and mRNA levels were determined for theSOD2,GPx1,GCLC,GSase,Nrf2andKeap1genes. PN inducedGPx1hypermethylation and decreasedGPx1,GCLCandGSasemRNA. These findings were not observed in PN+GSSG. PN+GSSG inducedNrf2hypomethylation and increasedNrf2andSOD2mRNA. These observations were independent of age. In conclusion, in neonatal guinea pigs, PN induces epigenetic changes, affecting the expression of H2O2metabolism genes. These changes persist for at least 15 weeks after PN. This disruption may signify a permanent reduction in the capacity to detoxify peroxides.",3.5798124399439554e-13
38722973,Exportin 4 DNA promoter methylation in liver fibrosis.,PLoS One,"A role for exportin 4 (XPO4) in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis was recently identified. We sought to determine changes in hepatic XPO4 promoter methylation levels during liver fibrosis. The quantitative real-time RT-PCR technique was used to quantify the mRNA level of XPO4. Additionally, pyrosequencing was utilized to assess the promoter methylation status of XPO4. The methylation rate of the XPO4 promoter was significantly increased with fibrosis in human and mouse models, while XPO4 mRNA expression negatively correlated with methylation of its promoter. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) levels (enzymes that drive DNA methylation) were upregulated in patients with liver fibrosis compared to healthy controls and in hepatic stellate cells upon transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) stimulation. The DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Aza or specific siRNAs for these DNMTs led to restoration of XPO4 expression. The process of DNA methylation plays a crucial role in the repression of XPO4 transcription in the context of liver fibrosis development.Copyright: © 2024 Pan et al.

Dietary data was collected using a food frequency questionnaire. Three diet quality indices (DQIs) were computed at baseline: DQI-international (DQI-I), DQI-revised (DQI-R), and Mediterranean-DQI (Med-DQI). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to determine the HR (95% CI) of the joint association between smoking and diet quality among heavy and light smokers, based on the number of cigarettes per day and pack-years, as well as between current and former smokers based on smoking habits.Over a follow-up period of almost eight years, 94 cases of CVDs (9.80%) and 40 cases of mortality (4.20%) were documented. The lower diet quality based on the Med-DQI was associated with a higher risk of mortality among current smokers (HR:3.45; 95%CI:1.12, 10.57). Light smokers with good diet quality, compared to heavy smokers with poor diet quality, had a lower risk of CVDs incident (HR:0.35; 95%CI: 0.15, 0.83) and all-cause mortality (HR:0.20; 95%CI:0.05, 0.77). Current smokers with good DQI had a lower risk of mortality compared to current smokers with poor DQI (HR:0.26; 95%CI:0.08, 0.80). However, this lower risk was more significant in former smokers with good DQI (HR:0.10; 95%CI:0.02, 0.45).Light and former smokers had a lower risk of developing CVDs and experiencing mortality. However, when coupled with a high-quality diet, this protective effect is even more pronounced.© 2024. The Author(s).",0.8170795062363305
38711068,The predictive accuracy of machine learning for the risk of death in HIV patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,BMC Infect Dis,"Early prediction of mortality in individuals with HIV (PWH) has perpetually posed a formidable challenge. With the widespread integration of machine learning into clinical practice, some researchers endeavor to formulate models predicting the mortality risk for PWH. Nevertheless, the diverse timeframes of mortality among PWH and the potential multitude of modeling variables have cast doubt on the efficacy of the current predictive model for HIV-related deaths. To address this, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis, aiming to comprehensively assess the utilization of machine learning in the early prediction of HIV-related deaths and furnish evidence-based support for the advancement of artificial intelligence in this domain.We systematically combed through the PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases on November 25, 2023. To evaluate the bias risk in the original studies included, we employed the Predictive Model Bias Risk Assessment Tool (PROBAST). During the meta-analysis, we conducted subgroup analysis based on survival and non-survival models. Additionally, we utilized meta-regression to explore the influence of death time on the predictive value of the model for HIV-related deaths.After our comprehensive review, we analyzed a total of 24 pieces of literature, encompassing data from 401,389 individuals diagnosed with HIV. Within this dataset, 23 articles specifically delved into deaths during long-term follow-ups outside hospital settings. The machine learning models applied for predicting these deaths comprised survival models (COX regression) and other non-survival models. The outcomes of the meta-analysis unveiled that within the training set, the c-index for predicting deaths among people with HIV (PWH) using predictive models stands at 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75-0.91). In the validation set, the c-index is slightly lower at 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.85). Notably, the meta-regression analysis demonstrated that neither follow-up time nor the occurrence of death events significantly impacted the performance of the machine learning models.The study suggests that machine learning is a viable approach for developing non-time-based predictions regarding HIV deaths. Nevertheless, the limited inclusion of original studies necessitates additional multicenter studies for thorough validation.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.3419574204043676e-22
38715110,Disruption of maternal vascular remodeling by a fetal endoretrovirus-derived gene in preeclampsia.,Genome Biol,"Preeclampsia, one of the most lethal pregnancy-related diseases, is associated with the disruption of uterine spiral artery remodeling during placentation. However, the early molecular events leading to preeclampsia remain unknown.By analyzing placentas from preeclampsia, non-preeclampsia, and twin pregnancies with selective intrauterine growth restriction, we show that the pathogenesis of preeclampsia is attributed to immature trophoblast and maldeveloped endothelial cells. Delayed epigenetic reprogramming during early extraembryonic tissue development leads to generation of excessive immature trophoblast cells. We find reduction of de novo DNA methylation in these trophoblast cells results in selective overexpression of maternally imprinted genes, including the endoretrovirus-derived gene PEG10 (paternally expressed gene 10). PEG10 forms virus-like particles, which are transferred from the trophoblast to the closely proximate endothelial cells. In normal pregnancy, only a low amount of PEG10 is transferred to maternal cells; however, in preeclampsia, excessive PEG10 disrupts maternal vascular development by inhibiting TGF-beta signaling.Our study reveals the intricate epigenetic mechanisms that regulate trans-generational genetic conflict and ultimately ensure proper maternal-fetal interface formation.© 2024.

38712036,RAG suppresses group 2 innate lymphoid cells.,bioRxiv,"Antigen specificity is the central trait distinguishing adaptive from innate immune function. Assembly of antigen-specific T cell and B cell receptors occurs through V(D)J recombination mediated by the Recombinase Activating Gene endonucleases RAG1 and RAG2 (collectively called RAG). In the absence of RAG, mature T and B cells do not develop and thus RAG is critically associated with adaptive immune function. In addition to adaptive T helper 2 (Th2) cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) contribute to type 2 immune responses by producing cytokines like Interleukin-5 (IL-5) and IL-13. Although it has been reported that RAG expression modulates the function of innate natural killer (NK) cells, whether other innate immune cells such as ILC2s are affected by RAG remains unclear. We find that in RAG-deficient mice, ILC2 populations expand and produce increased IL-5 and IL-13 at steady state and contribute to increased inflammation in atopic dermatitis (AD)-like disease. Further, we show that RAG modulates ILC2 function in a cell-intrinsic manner independent of the absence or presence of adaptive T and B lymphocytes. Lastly, employing multiomic single cell analyses of RAG1 lineage-traced cells, we identify key transcriptional and epigenomic ILC2 functional programs that are suppressed by a history of RAG expression. Collectively, our data reveal a novel role for RAG in modulating innate type 2 immunity through suppression of ILC2s.",2.3155279722523967e-46
38658765,"Single-cell analysis reveals context-dependent, cell-level selection of mtDNA.",Nature,"Heteroplasmy occurs when wild-type and mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules co-exist in single cells1. Heteroplasmy levels change dynamically in development, disease and ageing2,3, but it is unclear whether these shifts are caused by selection or drift, and whether they occur at the level of cells or intracellularly. Here we investigate heteroplasmy dynamics in dividing cells by combining precise mtDNA base editing (DdCBE)4with a new method, SCI-LITE (single-cell combinatorial indexing leveraged to interrogate targeted expression), which tracks single-cell heteroplasmy with ultra-high throughput. We engineered cells to have synonymous or nonsynonymous complex I mtDNA mutations and found that cell populations in standard culture conditions purge nonsynonymous mtDNA variants, whereas synonymous variants are maintained. This suggests that selection dominates over simple drift in shaping population heteroplasmy. We simultaneously tracked single-cell mtDNA heteroplasmy and ancestry, and found that, although the population heteroplasmy shifts, the heteroplasmy of individual cell lineages remains stable, arguing that selection acts at the level of cell fitness in dividing cells. Using these insights, we show that we can force cells to accumulate high levels of truncating complex I mtDNA heteroplasmy by placing them in environments where loss of biochemical complex I activity has been reported to benefit cell fitness. We conclude that in dividing cells, a given nonsynonymous mtDNA heteroplasmy can be harmful, neutral or even beneficial to cell fitness, but that the 'sign' of the effect is wholly dependent on the environment.© 2024.

38649703,hoxc12/c13 as key regulators for rebooting the developmental program in Xenopus limb regeneration.,Nat Commun,"During organ regeneration, after the initial responses to injury, gene expression patterns similar to those in normal development are reestablished during subsequent morphogenesis phases. This supports the idea that regeneration recapitulates development and predicts the existence of genes that reboot the developmental program after the initial responses. However, such rebooting mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we explore core rebooting factors that operate during Xenopus limb regeneration. Transcriptomic analysis of larval limb blastema reveals that hoxc12/c13 show the highest regeneration specificity in expression. Knocking out each of them through genome editing inhibits cell proliferation and expression of a group of genes that are essential for development, resulting in autopod regeneration failure, while limb development and initial blastema formation are not affected. Furthermore, the induction of hoxc12/c13 expression partially restores froglet regenerative capacity which is normally very limited compared to larval regeneration. Thus, we demonstrate the existence of genes that have a profound impact alone on rebooting of the developmental program in a regeneration-specific manner.© 2024.

This approach has proven successful in various biological data analysis applications, such as predicting cancer subtypes with high accuracy and identifying genes, enhancers, and stable cell types simultaneously from sparse single-cell epigenomics data. The advantage of using a topic model is that it not only serves as a clustering algorithm, but it can also explain clustering results by providing word probability distributions over topics. Our study proposes a novel topic modeling approach for clustering single cells and detecting topics (gene signatures) in single-cell datasets that measure multiple omics simultaneously. We applied this approach to examine the transcriptional heterogeneity of luminal and triple-negative breast cancer cells using patient-derived xenograft models with acquired resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Through this approach, we identified protein-coding genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that group thousands of cells into biologically similar clusters, accurately distinguishing drug-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer types. In comparison to standard state-of-the-art clustering analyses, our approach offers an optimal partitioning of genes into topics and cells into clusters simultaneously, producing easily interpretable clustering outcomes. Additionally, we demonstrate that an integrative clustering approach, which combines the information from mRNAs and lncRNAs treated as disjoint omics layers, enhances the accuracy of cell classification.",3.6979716096235145e-43
38582890,scButterfly: a versatile single-cell cross-modality translation method via dual-aligned variational autoencoders.,Nat Commun,"Recent advancements for simultaneously profiling multi-omics modalities within individual cells have enabled the interrogation of cellular heterogeneity and molecular hierarchy. However, technical limitations lead to highly noisy multi-modal data and substantial costs. Although computational methods have been proposed to translate single-cell data across modalities, broad applications of the methods still remain impeded by formidable challenges. Here, we propose scButterfly, a versatile single-cell cross-modality translation method based on dual-aligned variational autoencoders and data augmentation schemes. With comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, we provide compelling evidence of scButterfly's superiority over baseline methods in preserving cellular heterogeneity while translating datasets of various contexts and in revealing cell type-specific biological insights. Besides, we demonstrate the extensive applications of scButterfly for integrative multi-omics analysis of single-modality data, data enhancement of poor-quality single-cell multi-omics, and automatic cell type annotation of scATAC-seq data. Moreover, scButterfly can be generalized to unpaired data training, perturbation-response analysis, and consecutive translation.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.2860261051310609e-29

Although various computational approaches have been proposed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) annotation, high-quality cell labels are still lacking in single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) data, because of extreme sparsity and inconsistent chromatin accessibility between datasets. Here, we present a novel automated cell annotation method that transfers cell type information from a well-labeled scRNA-seq reference to an unlabeled scATAC-seq target, via a parallel graph neural network, in a semi-supervised manner. Unlike existing methods that utilize only gene expression or gene activity features, HyGAnno leverages genome-wide accessibility peak features to facilitate the training process. In addition, HyGAnno reconstructs a reference-target cell graph to detect cells with low prediction reliability, according to their specific graph connectivity patterns. HyGAnno was assessed across various datasets, showcasing its strengths in precise cell annotation, generating interpretable cell embeddings, robustness to noisy reference data and adaptability to tumor tissues.© The Author(s) 2024.

38547401,Clustering single-cell multi-omics data via graph regularized multi-view ensemble learning.,Bioinformatics,"Single-cell clustering plays a crucial role in distinguishing between cell types, facilitating the analysis of cell heterogeneity mechanisms. While many existing clustering methods rely solely on gene expression data obtained from single-cell RNA sequencing techniques to identify cell clusters, the information contained in mono-omic data is often limited, leading to suboptimal clustering performance. The emergence of single-cell multi-omics sequencing technologies enables the integration of multiple omics data for identifying cell clusters, but how to integrate different omics data effectively remains challenging. In addition, designing a clustering method that performs well across various types of multi-omics data poses a persistent challenge due to the data's inherent characteristics.In this paper, we propose a graph-regularized multi-view ensemble clustering (GRMEC-SC) model for single-cell clustering. Our proposed approach can adaptively integrate multiple omics data and leverage insights from multiple base clustering results. We extensively evaluate our method on five multi-omics datasets through a series of rigorous experiments. The results of these experiments demonstrate that our GRMEC-SC model achieves competitive performance across diverse multi-omics datasets with varying characteristics.Implementation of GRMEC-SC, along with examples, can be found on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/polarisChen/GRMEC-SC.© The Author(s) 2024.

Here, we employed simultaneous high-throughput single-cell ATAC/RNA sequencing (SHARE-seq) and spatially resolved metabolomics to profile 54 human samples from distinct kidney anatomical regions. We generated transcriptomes of 446,267 cells and chromatin accessibility profiles of 401,875 cells and developed a package to analyze 408,218 spatially resolved metabolomes. We find that the same cell type, including thin limb, thick ascending limb loop of Henle and principal cells, display distinct transcriptomic, chromatin accessibility, and metabolomic signatures, depending on anatomic location. Surveying metabolism-associated gene profiles revealed non-overlapping metabolic signatures between nephron segments and dysregulated lipid metabolism in diseased proximal tubule (PT) cells. Integrating multimodal omics with clinical data identified PLEKHA1 as a disease marker, and its in vitro knockdown increased gene expression in PT differentiation, suggesting possible pathogenic roles.

However, due to the disruptive nature of single-cell measurements, it is impossible to capture the full temporal trajectory of a particular cell. Furthermore, single-cell profiles can be collected at mismatched time points across different conditions (e.g., sex, batch, disease) and data modalities (e.g., scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq), which makes modeling challenging. Here we propose a joint modeling framework, Sunbear, for integrating multi-condition and multi-modal single-cell profiles across time. Sunbear can be used to impute single-cell temporal profile changes, align multi-dataset and multi-modal profiles across time, and extrapolate single-cell profiles in a missing modality. We applied Sunbear to reveal sex-biased transcription during mouse embryonic development and predict dynamic relationships between epigenetic priming and transcription for cells in which multi-modal profiles are unavailable. Sunbear thus enables the projection of single-cell time-series snapshots to multi-modal and multi-condition views of cellular trajectories.",4.67462022892692e-25

Gene-environment interactions, mediated by epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation, take center stage in BPD pathogenesis. Recent discoveries link methylation variations across biological pathways with BPD. Also, the potential reversibility of histone modifications fuels new treatment avenues. The review also highlights the promise of utilizing mesenchymal stem cells and their exosomes as BPD therapies, given their ability to modulate non-coding RNA, opening novel research and intervention possibilities. IMPACT: The complexity and universality of epigenetic modifications in the occurrence and development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia were thoroughly discussed.

Recent advances in measuring gene expression in single cells are providing new insights into this complex process. However, the underlying epigenetic regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we profiled chromatin accessibility in mouse gonadal cells of both sexes from embryonic day 11.5 to 14.5 using single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin by sequencing (scATAC-seq). Our results showed that individual cell types can be inferred by the chromatin landscape, and that cells can be temporally ordered along developmental trajectories. Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and chromatin-accessibility maps identified multiple putative regulatory elements proximal to key gonadal genes Nr5a1, Sox9 and Wt1. We also uncover cell type-specific regulatory factors underlying cell type specification.

Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying sarcopenia has major implications for understanding human ageing2. Yet, progress has been slow, partly due to the difficulties of characterizing skeletal muscle niche heterogeneity (whereby myofibres are the most abundant) and obtaining well-characterized human samples3,4. Here we generate a single-cell/single-nucleus transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility map of human limb skeletal muscles encompassing over 387,000 cells/nuclei from individuals aged 15 to 99 years with distinct fitness and frailty levels. We describe how cell populations change during ageing, including the emergence of new populations in older people, and the cell-specific and multicellular network features (at the transcriptomic and epigenetic levels) associated with these changes. On the basis of cross-comparison with genetic data, we also identify key elements of chromatin architecture that mark susceptibility to sarcopenia.

In individuals of Central-South Asian descent (CSA), His90Asn mutation was associated with dermatologic outcomes (fold-enrichment = 28, p = 0.001). The same TTR mutation was linked to neoplasms in European-descent individuals (EUR, fold-enrichment = 3.09, p = 0.003). In EUR, Ala81Thr showed multiple associations with respiratory outcomes related (fold-enrichment = 3.61, p = 0.002), but the strongest association was with atrioventricular block (phecode 426.2, p = 2.81 × 10- 4). Additionally, the same mutation in East Asians (EAS) showed associations with endocrine-metabolic traits (fold-enrichment = 4.47, p = 0.003).

Here we adapt Tn5 transposition to introduce hairpin oligonucleotides and fragment (tagment) limiting quantities of DNA for generating PacBio-compatible circular molecules. We developed two methods that implement tagmentation and use 90-99% less input than current protocols: (1) single-molecule real-time sequencing by tagmentation (SMRT-Tag), which allows detection of genetic variation and CpG methylation; and (2) single-molecule adenine-methylated oligonucleosome sequencing assay by tagmentation (SAMOSA-Tag), which uses exogenous adenine methylation to add a third channel for probing chromatin accessibility. SMRT-Tag of 40 ng or more human DNA (approximately 7,000 cell equivalents) yielded data comparable to gold standard whole-genome and bisulfite sequencing. SAMOSA-Tag of 30,000-50,000 nuclei resolved single-fiber chromatin structure, CTCF binding and DNA methylation in patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts and uncovered metastasis-associated global epigenome disorganization.

38570684,The variation and evolution of complete human centromeres.,Nature,"Human centromeres have been traditionally very difficult to sequence and assemble owing to their repetitive nature and large size1. As a result, patterns of human centromeric variation and models for their evolution and function remain incomplete, despite centromeres being among the most rapidly mutating regions2,3. Here, using long-read sequencing, we completely sequenced and assembled all centromeres from a second human genome and compared it to the finished reference genome4,5. We find that the two sets of centromeres show at least a 4.1-fold increase in single-nucleotide variation when compared with their unique flanks and vary up to 3-fold in size. Moreover, we find that 45.8% of centromeric sequence cannot be reliably aligned using standard methods owing to the emergence of new α-satellite higher-order repeats (HORs). DNA methylation and CENP-A chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that 26% of the centromeres differ in their kinetochore position by >500 kb. To understand evolutionary change, we selected six chromosomes and sequenced and assembled 31 orthologous centromeres from the common chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque genomes. Comparative analyses reveal a nearly complete turnover of α-satellite HORs, with characteristic idiosyncratic changes in α-satellite HORs for each species. Phylogenetic reconstruction of human haplotypes supports limited to no recombination between the short (p) and long (q) arms across centromeres and reveals that novel α-satellite HORs share a monophyletic origin, providing a strategy to estimate the rate of saltatory amplification and mutation of human centromeric DNA.© 2024.

We show that Nanopore sequencing of the angelicin-modified DNA is possible and allows visualization and analysis of long single molecules with distinct chromatin structure. The angelicin modification can be detected from the Nanopore current signal data using a neural network model trained on unmodified and modified chromatin-free DNA. Applying Add-seq toSaccharomyces cerevisiaenuclei, we identified expected patterns of accessibility around annotated gene loci in yeast. We also identify individual clusters of single molecule reads displaying different chromatin structure at specific yeast loci, which demonstrates heterogeneity in the chromatin structure of the yeast population.

38548335,Ca(2+)/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II Enhances Retinal Ganglion Cell Survival But Suppresses Axon Regeneration after Optic Nerve Injury.,eNeuro,"Neuroprotection after injury or in neurodegenerative disease remains a major goal for basic and translational neuroscience. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the projection neurons of the eye, degenerate in optic neuropathies after axon injury, and there are no clinical therapies to prevent their loss or restore their connectivity to targets in the brain. Here we demonstrate a profound neuroprotective effect of the exogenous expression of various Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) isoforms in mice. A dramatic increase in RGC survival following the optic nerve trauma was elicited by the expression of constitutively active variants of multiple CaMKII isoforms in RGCs using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors across a 100-fold range of AAV dosing in vivo. Despite this neuroprotection, however, short-distance RGC axon sprouting was suppressed by CaMKII, and long-distance axon regeneration elicited by several pro-axon growth treatments was likewise inhibited even as CaMKII further enhanced RGC survival. Notably, in a dose-escalation study, AAV-expressed CaMKII was more potent for axon growth suppression than the promotion of survival. That diffuse overexpression of constitutively active CaMKII strongly promotes RGC survival after axon injury may be clinically valuable for neuroprotection per se. However, the associated strong suppression of the optic nerve axon regeneration demonstrates the need for understanding the intracellular domain- and target-specific CaMKII activities to the development of CaMKII signaling pathway-directed strategies for the treatment of optic neuropathies.Copyright © 2024 Xia et al.",1.6530193567588107e-62

We set here to validate and possibly expand the results by profiling the serum proteome of a subset of individuals included in the original study using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Following pre-processing, the LC-MS/MS data provided quantification of 398 proteins, with only 266 proteins shared by both platforms. At 1% FDR statistical significance threshold, the analysis of LC-MS/MS data detected 44 proteins associated with extreme old age, including 23 of the original analysis. To identify proteins for which associations between expression and extreme-old age were conserved across platforms, we performed inter-study conservation testing of the 266 proteins quantified by both platforms using a method that accounts for the correlation between the results. From these tests, a total of 80 proteins reached 5% FDR statistical significance, and 26 of these proteins had concordant pattern of gene expression in whole blood.

Nevertheless, the precise characterization of coagulation changes associated with early mortality remains elusive. We examined alterations in indicators linked to mortality outcomes at both the transcriptomic and clinical characteristic levels. At the transcriptomic level, we pinpointed 28 differentially expressed coagulation-related genes (DECRGs) following burn injuries and endeavored to validate their causal relationships through Mendelian randomization. DECRGs tied to survival exhibit a significant association with neutrophil function, wherein the expression of CYP4F2 and P2RX1 serves as robust predictors of fatal outcomes. In terms of clinical indicators, early levels of D-dimer and alterations in serum calcium show a strong correlation with mortality outcomes. Coagulation depletion and fibrinolytic activation, stemming from the hyperactivation of coagulation pathways post-severe burns, are strongly linked to patient mortality. Monitoring these early coagulation markers with predictive value can effectively identify individuals necessitating priority critical care.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.238772771959932e-10

However, the clinical application of EV has faced challenges due to their inadequate targeting ability. In addition, most of the circulating EV would be cleared by the liver, resulting in a short biological half-life after systemic administration. Inspired by the natural microvesicles (MV, as a subset of large size EV) are originated and shed from the plasma membrane, we developed the immunosuppressive MV-mimetic (MVM) from endotoxin tolerant dendritic cells (DC) by a straightforward and effective extrusion approach, in which DC surface proteins were inherited for providing the homing ability to the spleen, while αCD3 antibodies were conjugated to the MVM membranes for specific targeting of T cells. The engineered MVM carried a large number of bioactive cargos from the parental cells, which exhibited a remarkable ability to promote the induction of regulatory T cells (Treg) and polarization of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages. Mechanistically, the elevated Treg level by MVM was mediated due to the upregulation of miR-155-3p. Furthermore, it was observed that systemic and local immunosuppression was induced by MVM in models of sepsis and rheumatoid arthritis through the improvement of Treg and M2 macrophages.

These organoids can be generated from various sources, including pluripotent stem cells, specialized tissue cells, and tumor tissue cells. This versatility enables scientists to replicate a wide range of diseases affecting different organ systems, effectively creating disease replicas in a laboratory dish. This exciting capability has provided us with unprecedented insights into the progression of diseases and how we can develop improved treatments. In this paper, we will provide an overview of the progress made in utilizing organoids as preclinical models, aiding our understanding and providing a more effective approach to addressing various human diseases.© 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.",5.098349251312855e-40

However, the complexity provided by these models is often not leveraged fully due to the reductionist methods used to analyze them. Computational and mathematical models developed in the field of systems biology can address this issue. Yet, traditional systems biology has been mostly applied to simplerin vitromodels with little physiological relevance and limited cellular complexity. Therefore, integrating these two inherently interdisciplinary fields can result in new insights and move both disciplines forward. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of how systems biology has been integrated with 3Din vitrotissue models and discuss key application areas where the synergies between both fields have led to important advances with potential translational impact. We then outline key directions for future research and discuss a framework for further integration between fields.© 2024 Author(s).",4.021170697411668e-31

38631230,MeRIP sequencing reveals the regulation of N6-methyladenosine in muscle development between hypertrophic and leaner broilers.,Poult Sci,"Meat production performance is the most important economic trait in broilers, and skeletal muscle, as the largest organ in animals, is directly related to meat production during embryonic and postnatal growth and development. N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is a chemical modification occurs on RNA adenosine that has been reported to participate in a variety of biological processes in all species. However, there are still few reports on the regulatory role of muscle growth and development in poultry after birth. This study aims to reveal the distribution of m6A modification sites in chicken pectoralis major muscle after birth and find out the regulatory relationship between m6A and muscle development. As representatives of leaner (Xinghua chicken [XH]) and hypertrophic (White Recessive Rock chicken [WRR]) broilers, there are significant differences in body weight, muscle fiber diameter, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area between XH and WRR chickens. RNA sequencing detected a total of 397 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the pectoralis major muscle of XH and WRR chicken, and these DEGs were mainly enriched in catalytic activity and metabolic pathways. MeRIP sequencing results showed that among all 6,476 differentially modified m6A peaks, about 90% peaks (5,823) were differentially down regulated in XH chickens. The joint analysis of the mRNA and MeRIP sequencing data found 145 DEGs with differential m6A peak, ALKBH5 as a m6A demethylase, was also included. The highly expression of ALKBH5 in the muscle tissue of poultry and differential expression between XH and WRR chickens suggest that ALKBH5 may play a crucial role in regulating muscle development. Our results revealed that there were significant differences in growth rate, body weight, muscle fiber diameter, and fiber cross-section area between WRR and XH chicken, as well as significant differences in m6A methylation level and muscle metabolism level.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

We examined relationships between treatment response, early life trauma exposure, DNA polymorphisms, and methylation in the serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) and FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) genes. DNA samples and clinical outcomes were examined in 72 veterans with PTSD who received meditation-based therapy in two separate studies of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and Transcendental Meditation (TM). The PTSD Checklist was administered to assess symptoms at baseline and after 9 weeks of meditation intervention. We examined the SLC6A4 promoter (5HTTLPR_L/S insertion/deletion + rs25531_A/G) polymorphisms according to previously defined gene expression groups, and the FKBP5 variant rs1360780 previously associated with PTSD disease risk. Methylation for CpG sites of SLC6A4 (28 sites) and FKBP5 (45 sites) genes was quantified in DNA samples collected before and after treatment. The 5HTTLPR LALAhigh expression genotype was associated with greater symptom improvement in participants exposed to early life trauma (p = 0.015). Separately, pre to post-treatment change of DNA methylation in a group of nine FKBP5 CpG sites was associated with greater symptom improvement (OR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.1-7.1, p = 0.027). These findings build on a wealth of existing knowledge regarding epigenetic and genetic relationships with PTSD disease risk to highlight the potential importance of SLC6A4 and FKBP5 for treatment mechanisms and as biomarkers of symptom improvement.© 2024.

38576019,Systematic proteome-wide Mendelian randomization using the human plasma proteome to identify therapeutic targets for lung adenocarcinoma.,J Transl Med,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the predominant histological subtype of lung cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Identifying effective drug targets is crucial for advancing LUAD treatment strategies.This study employed proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization analyses. We collected data on 1394 plasma proteins from a protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) study involving 4907 individuals. Genetic associations with LUAD were derived from the Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL) study, including 11,245 cases and 54,619 controls. We integrated pQTL and LUAD genome-wide association studies (GWASs) data to identify candidate proteins. MR utilizes single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as genetic instruments to estimate the causal effect of exposure on outcome, while Bayesian colocalization analysis determines the probability of shared causal genetic variants between traits. Our study applied these methods to assess causality between plasma proteins and LUAD. Furthermore, we employed a two-step MR to quantify the proportion of risk factors mediated by proteins on LUAD. Finally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis elucidated potential links between proteins and current LUAD medications.We identified nine plasma proteins significantly associated with LUAD. Increased levels of ALAD, FLT1, ICAM5, and VWC2 exhibited protective effects, with odds ratios of 0.79 (95% CI 0.72-0.87), 0.39 (95% CI 0.28-0.55), 0.91 (95% CI 0.72-0.87), and 0.85 (95% CI 0.79-0.92), respectively. Conversely, MDGA2 (OR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.08-1.19), NTM (OR, 1.12; 95% CI 1.09-1.16), PMM2 (OR, 1.35; 95% CI 1.18-1.53), RNASET2 (OR, 1.15; 95% CI 1.08-1.21), and TFPI (OR, 4.58; 95% CI 3.02-6.94) increased LUAD risk. Notably, none of the nine proteins showed evidence of reverse causality. Bayesian colocalization indicated that RNASET2, TFPI, and VWC2 shared the same variant with LUAD. Furthermore, NTM and FLT1 demonstrated interactions with targets of current LUAD medications. Additionally, FLT1 and TFPI are currently under evaluation as therapeutic targets, while NTM, RNASET2, and VWC2 are potentially druggable. These findings shed light on LUAD pathogenesis, highlighting the tumor-promoting effects of RNASET2, TFPI, and NTM, along with the protective effects of VWC2 and FLT1, providing a significant biological foundation for future LUAD therapeutic targets.Our proteome-wide MR analysis highlighted RNASET2, TFPI, VWC2, NTM, and FLT1 as potential drug targets for further clinical investigation in LUAD. However, the specific mechanisms by which these proteins influence LUAD remain elusive. Targeting these proteins in drug development holds the potential for successful clinical trials, providing a pathway to prioritize and reduce costs in LUAD therapeutics.© 2024.

38702304,A human neural crest model reveals the developmental impact of neuroblastoma-associated chromosomal aberrations.,Nat Commun,"Early childhood tumours arise from transformed embryonic cells, which often carry large copy number alterations (CNA). However, it remains unclear how CNAs contribute to embryonic tumourigenesis due to a lack of suitable models. Here we employ female human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation and single-cell transcriptome and epigenome analysis to assess the effects of chromosome 17q/1q gains, which are prevalent in the embryonal tumour neuroblastoma (NB). We show that CNAs impair the specification of trunk neural crest (NC) cells and their sympathoadrenal derivatives, the putative cells-of-origin of NB. This effect is exacerbated upon overexpression of MYCN, whose amplification co-occurs with CNAs in NB. Moreover, CNAs potentiate the pro-tumourigenic effects of MYCN and mutant NC cells resemble NB cells in tumours. These changes correlate with a stepwise aberration of developmental transcription factor networks. Together, our results sketch a mechanistic framework for the CNA-driven initiation of embryonal tumours.© 2024. The Author(s).",6.08635769480005e-36
38686795,Germline cis variant determines epigenetic regulation of the anti-cancer drug metabolism gene dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD).,Elife,"Enhancers are critical for regulating tissue-specific gene expression, and genetic variants within enhancer regions have been suggested to contribute to various cancer-related processes, including therapeutic resistance. However, the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Using a well-defined drug-gene pair, we identified an enhancer region for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD,DPYDgene) expression that is relevant to the metabolism of the anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Using reporter systems, CRISPR genome-edited cell models, and human liver specimens, we demonstrated in vitro andvivothat genotype status for the common germline variant (rs4294451; 27% global minor allele frequency) located within this novel enhancer controlsDPYDtranscription and alters resistance to 5-FU. The variant genotype increases recruitment of the transcription factor CEBPB to the enhancer and alters the level of direct interactions between the enhancer andDPYDpromoter. Our data provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling sensitivity and resistance to 5-FU.© 2024, Zhang et al.",1.3781542912430549e-33
38562155,Impact of obesity on airway remodeling in asthma: pathophysiological insights and clinical implications.,Front Allergy,"The prevalence of obesity among asthma patients has surged in recent years, posing a significant risk factor for uncontrolled asthma. Beyond its impact on asthma severity and patients' quality of life, obesity is associated with reduced lung function, increased asthma exacerbations, hospitalizations, heightened airway hyperresponsiveness, and elevated asthma-related mortality. Obesity may lead to metabolic dysfunction and immune dysregulation, fostering chronic inflammation characterized by increased pro-inflammatory mediators and adipocytokines, elevated reactive oxygen species, and reduced antioxidant activity. This chronic inflammation holds the potential to induce airway remodeling in individuals with asthma and obesity. Airway remodeling encompasses structural and pathological changes, involving alterations in the airway's epithelial and subepithelial layers, hyperplasia and hypertrophy of airway smooth muscle, and changes in airway vascularity. In individuals with asthma and obesity, airway remodeling may underlie heightened airway hyperresponsiveness and increased asthma severity, ultimately contributing to the development of persistent airflow limitation, declining lung function, and a potential increase in asthma-related mortality. Despite efforts to address the impact of obesity on asthma outcomes, the intricate mechanisms linking obesity to asthma pathophysiology, particularly concerning airway remodeling, remain incompletely understood. This comprehensive review discusses current research investigating the influence of obesity on airway remodeling, to enhance our understanding of obesity's role in the context of asthma airway remodeling.© 2024 Listyoko, Okazaki, Harada, Inui and Yamasaki.",9.037707458013074e-31
38651031,Ageing as a two-phase process: theoretical framework.,Front Aging,"Human ageing, along with the ageing of conventional model organisms, is depicted as a continuous and progressive decline of biological capabilities accompanied by an exponentially increasing mortality risk. However, not all organisms experience ageing identically and our understanding of the phenomenon is coloured by human-centric views. Ageing is multifaceted and influences a diverse range of species in varying ways. Some undergo swift declines post-reproduction, while others exhibit insubstantial changes throughout their existence. This vast array renders defining universally applicable ""ageing attributes"" a daunting task. It is nonetheless essential to recognize that not all ageing features are organism-specific. These common attributes have paved the way for identifying ""hallmarks of ageing,"" processes that are intertwined with age, amplified during accelerated ageing, and manipulations of which can potentially modulate or even reverse the ageing process. Yet, a glaring observation is that individuals within a single population age at varying rates. To address this, demographers have coined the term 'frailty'. Concurrently, scientific advancements have ushered in the era of molecular clocks. These innovations enable a distinction between an individual's chronological age (time since birth) and biological age (physiological status and mortality risk). In 2011, the ""Smurf"" phenotype was unveiled inDrosophila, delineating an age-linked escalation in intestinal permeability that presages imminent mortality. It not only acts as a predictor of natural death but identifies individuals exhibiting traits normally described as age-related. Subsequent studies have revealed the phenotype in organisms like nematodes, zebrafish, and mice, invariably acting as a death predictor. Collectively, these findings have steered our conception of ageing towards a framework where ageing is not linear and continuous but marked by two distinct, necessary phases, discerniblein vivo, courtesy of the Smurf phenotype. This framework includes a mathematical enunciation of longevity trends based on three experimentally measurable parameters. It facilitates a fresh perspective on the evolution of ageing as a function. In this article, we aim to delineate and explore the foundational principles of this innovative framework, emphasising its potential to reshape our understanding of ageing, challenge its conventional definitions, and recalibrate our comprehension of its evolutionary trajectory.Copyright © 2024 Zane, MacMurray, Guillermain, Cansell, Todd and Rera.",1.4180854447877953e-36
38697989,Multimodal analysis of cfDNA methylomes for early detecting esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and precancerous lesions.,Nat Commun,"Detecting early-stage esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and precancerous lesions is critical for improving survival. Here, we conduct whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on 460 cfDNA samples from patients with non-metastatic ESCC or precancerous lesions and matched healthy controls. We develop an expanded multimodal analysis (EMMA) framework to simultaneously identify cfDNA methylation, copy number variants (CNVs), and fragmentation markers in cfDNA WGBS data. cfDNA methylation markers are the earliest and most sensitive, detectable in 70% of ESCCs and 50% of precancerous lesions, and associated with molecular subtypes and tumor microenvironments. CNVs and fragmentation features show high specificity but are linked to late-stage disease. EMMA significantly improves detection rates, increasing AUCs from 0.90 to 0.99, and detects 87% of ESCCs and 62% of precancerous lesions with >95% specificity in validation cohorts.

Vaccination and screening programs have notably reduced the incidence of CC worldwide by >80%; however, the mortality rate in low‑income countries remains high. The staging of CC is a determining factor in therapeutic strategies: The clinical management of early stages of CC includes surgery and/or radiotherapy, whereas radiotherapy and/or concurrent chemotherapy are the recommended therapeutic strategies for locally advanced CC. The histopathological characteristics of tumors can effectively serve as prognostic markers of radiotherapy response; however, the efficacy rate of radiotherapy may significantly differ among cancer patients. Failure of radiotherapy is commonly associated with a higher risk of recurrence, persistence and metastasis; therefore, radioresistance remains the most important and unresolved clinical problem. This condition highlights the importance of precision medicine in searching for possible predictive biomarkers to timely identify patients at risk of treatment response failure and provide tailored therapeutic strategies according to genetic and epigenetic characteristics. The present review aimed to summarize the evidence that supports the role of several proteins, methylation markers and non‑coding RNAs as potential predictive biomarkers for CC.",6.484435817513506e-41

Thus, establishing alternative laboratory models is crucial for investigating the diverse physiological adaptations observed in bats. Obtaining quality cells from tissues is a critical first step for successful primary cell derivation. However, it is often impractical to collect fresh tissue and process the samples immediately for cell culture due to the resources required for isolating and expanding cells. As a result, frozen tissue is typically the starting resource for bat primary cell derivation. Yet, cells in frozen tissue are usually damaged and represent low integrity and viability. As a result, isolating primary cells from frozen tissues poses a significant challenge.

Leveraging the cytosine base editing (CBE) system, here we developed a pipeline for clonal loss-of-function (LoF) allele mutagenesis in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) by introducing premature stop-codons (iSTOP) that lead to mRNA nonsense-mediated-decay (NMD) or protein truncation. We tested the pipeline for 23 NPD genes on 3 hiPSC lines and achieved highly reproducible, efficient iSTOP editing in 22 NPD genes. Using RNAseq, we confirmed their pluripotency, absence of chromosomal abnormalities, and NMD. Interestingly, for three schizophrenia risk genes (SETD1A, TRIO,CUL1), despite the high efficiency of base editing, we only obtained heterozygous LoF alleles, suggesting their essential roles for cell growth.

38533007,Epigenetic modification: A novel insight into diabetic wound healing.,Heliyon,"Wound healing is an intricate and fine regulatory process. In diabetic patients, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), biofilm formation, persistent inflammation, and angiogenesis regression contribute to delayed wound healing. Epigenetics, the fast-moving science in the 21st century, has been up to date and associated with diabetic wound repair. In this review, we go over the functions of epigenetics in diabetic wound repair in retrospect, covering transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. Among these, we found that histone modification is widely involved in inflammation and angiogenesis by affecting macrophages and endothelial cells. DNA methylation is involved in factors regulation in wound repair but also affects the differentiation phenotype of cells in hyperglycemia. In addition, noncodingRNA regulation and RNA modification in diabetic wound repair were also generalized. The future prospects for epigenetic applications are discussed in the end.

Deconvolution of the roles of genes implicated in disease and the effects of disease-associated variants remains a vital step in the understanding of neurodegeneration and the development of therapeutics. Disease modelling using patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has enabled the generation of key cell-types associated with disease whilst maintaining the genomic variants that predispose to neurodegeneration. The use of CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), alongside other CRISPR-perturbations, allows the modelling of the effects of these disease-associated variants or identifying genes which modify disease phenotypes.

In addition to demographics and cancer treatment exposures, which cannot be altered, cardiometabolic risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia) and frailty potentiate the risk of morbidity and mortality associated with chronic health conditions. Important opportunities exist to target these risk factors and improve late health outcomes for survivors.

Proteomics analysis was conducted on the serum samples from 10 CAD-DLL patients and from 10 controls with CAD-FL by mass spectrometry. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to elucidate the involved genes, including functional annotation and protein-protein interaction analysis.A total of 742 shared variant genes were found in CAD-DLL patients but not in controls. Of these, 46 genes were identified as high-frequency variant genes (≥ 4/20) distinctive genes. According to the consensus variant site, 148 shared variant sites were found in the CAD-DLL group. The lysosome and cellular senescence-related pathway may be the most significant pathway in diffuse long lesion.

The present study aimed to develop a computational method for accurately modeling the spatial proximal and distal regulatory interactions. Our method combined regression-based models to identify key regulators through gene expression prediction and a graph-embedding approach to detect coregulated genes. This approach enabled a detailed investigation of the gene regulatory mechanisms for germinal center B cells, accompanied by dramatic rearrangements of the genome structure. We found that while the promoter-proximal regulatory elements were the principal regulators of gene expression, the distal regulators fine-tuned transcription. Moreover, our approach unveiled the presence of modular regulators, such as cofactors and proximal/distal transcription factors, which were co-expressed with their target genes. Some of these modules exhibited abnormal expression patterns in lymphoma. These findings suggest that the dysregulation of interactions between transcriptional and architectural factors is associated with chromatin reorganization failure, which may increase the risk of malignancy. Therefore, our computational approach helps decipher the transcriptionalcis-regulatory code spatially interacting.© The Author(s) 2024.

Whereas this trait is highly heritable, few causal genes are known. We aimed to identify novel drivers of WHRadjBMIusing systems genetics. We used two independent cohorts of adipose tissue gene expression and constructed sex- and depot-specific Bayesian networks to model gene-gene interactions from 8,492 genes. Using key driver analysis, we identified genes that, in silico and putatively in vitro, regulate many others. 51-119 key drivers in each network were replicated in both cohorts. In other cell types, 23 of these genes are found in crucial adipocyte pathways: Wnt signaling or mitochondrial function. We overexpressed or down-regulated seven key driver genes in human subcutaneous pre-adipocytes. Key driver genesANAPC2andRSPO1inhibited adipogenesis, whereasPSME3increased adipogenesis.RSPO1increased Wnt signaling activity. In differentiated adipocytes, MIGA1 and UBR1 down-regulation led to mitochondrial dysfunction. These five genes regulate adipocyte function, and we hypothesize that they regulate fat distribution.© 2024 Reed et al.",1.5317546124587466e-23

However, current computational methods for guide RNA (gRNA) design do not effectively predict the power potential, molecular and cellular impact to optimize for efficient gRNAs, which are crucial for successful applications of these technologies. We present ""launch-dCas9"" (machine LeArning based UNified CompreHensive framework for CRISPR-dCas9) to predict gRNA impact from multiple perspectives, including cell fitness, wildtype abundance (gauging power potential), and gene expression in single cells. Our launchdCas9, built and evaluated using experiments involving >1 million gRNAs targeted across the human genome, demonstrates relatively high prediction accuracy (AUC up to 0.81) and generalizes across cell lines. Method-prioritized top gRNA(s) are 4.6-fold more likely to exert effects, compared to other gRNAs in the same cis-regulatory region. Furthermore, launchdCas9 identifies the most critical sequence-related features and functional annotations from >40 features considered.

Most of the evidence has accumulated from occupational or cohort studies in humans or laboratory research in animal models, with a range of chemicals being implicated. What has been missing is a systematic approach analogous to genome-wide association studies, which have identified dozens of genes involved in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Fortunately, it is now possible to study hundreds to thousands of chemical features under the exposome framework.

38673657,Trace Elements in Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia: The Current State of Knowledge.,J Clin Med,"Changes in trace element concentrations are being wildly considered when it comes to neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This study aims to present the role that trace elements play in the central nervous system. Moreover, we reviewed the mechanisms involved in their neurotoxicity. Low zinc concentrations, as well as high levels of copper, manganese, and iron, activate the signalling pathways of the inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress response. Neurodegeneration occurs due to the association between metals and proteins, which is then followed by aggregate formation, mitochondrial disorder, and, ultimately, cell death. In Alzheimer's disease, low Zn levels suppress the neurotoxicity induced by β-amyloid through the selective precipitation of aggregation intermediates. High concentrations of copper, iron and manganese cause the aggregation of intracellular α-synuclein, which results in synaptic dysfunction and axonal transport disruption. Parkinson's disease is caused by the accumulation of Fe in the midbrain dopaminergic nucleus, and the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis derives from Zn deficiency, leading to an imbalance between T cell functions. Aluminium disturbs the homeostasis of other metals through a rise in the production of oxygen reactive forms, which then leads to cellular death. Selenium, in association with iron, plays a distinct role in the process of ferroptosis. Outlining the influence that metals have on oxidoreduction processes is crucial to recognising the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases and may provide possible new methods for both their avoidance and therapy.",3.507741990697082e-44

The kinetochore has been interrogated by electron microscopy since the middle of the last century, but with methodologies that compromised fine structure. Using cryo-ET on human mitotic chromosomes, we reveal a distinctive architecture at the centromere: clustered 20-25 nm nucleosome-associated complexes within chromatin clearings that delineate them from surrounding chromatin. Centromere components CENP-C and CENP-N are each required for the integrity of the complexes, while CENP-C is also required to maintain the chromatin clearing. We further visualize the scaffold of the fibrous corona, a structure amplified at unattached kinetochores, revealing crescent-shaped parallel arrays of fibrils that extend >1 μm. Thus, we reveal how the organization of centromeric chromatin creates a clearing at the site of kinetochore formation as well as the nature of kinetochore amplification mediated by corona fibrils.",2.372603741083829e-23

We identified and validated their centromere sequences using CENH3 ChIP-seq and found that, similar to humans and higher plants, the centromeric CENH3 signals of green algae display a pattern of hypomethylation. Interestingly, the centromeres of both species largely comprised transposable elements, although they differed significantly in their composition. Species within the Chlorella genus display a more diverse centromere composition, with major constituents including members of the LTR/Copia, LINE/L1, and LINE/RTEX families. This is in contrast to green algae including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Coccomyxa subellipsoidea, and Chromochloris zofingiensis, in which centromere composition instead has a pronounced single-element composition. Moreover, we observed significant differences in the composition and structure of centromeres among chromosomes with strong collinearity within the Chlorella genus, suggesting that centromeric sequence evolves more rapidly than sequence in non-centromeric regions.This study not only provides high-quality genome data for comparative genomics of green algae but gives insight into the composition and evolutionary history of centromeres in early plants, laying an important foundation for further research on their evolution.© 2024.

38529488,Gapless assembly of complete human and plant chromosomes using only nanopore sequencing.,bioRxiv,"The combination of ultra-long Oxford Nanopore (ONT) sequencing reads with long, accurate PacBio HiFi reads has enabled the completion of a human genome and spurred similar efforts to complete the genomes of many other species. However, this approach for complete, ""telomere-to-telomere"" genome assembly relies on multiple sequencing platforms, limiting its accessibility. ONT ""Duplex"" sequencing reads, where both strands of the DNA are read to improve quality, promise high per-base accuracy. To evaluate this new data type, we generated ONT Duplex data for three widely-studied genomes: human HG002,Solanum lycopersicumHeinz 1706 (tomato), andZea maysB73 (maize). For the diploid, heterozygous HG002 genome, we also used ""Pore-C"" chromatin contact mapping to completely phase the haplotypes. We found the accuracy of Duplex data to be similar to HiFi sequencing, but with read lengths tens of kilobases longer, and the Pore-C data to be compatible with existing diploid assembly algorithms. This combination of read length and accuracy enables the construction of a high-quality initial assembly, which can then be further resolved using the ultra-long reads, and finally phased into chromosome-scale haplotypes with Pore-C. The resulting assemblies have a base accuracy exceeding 99.999% (Q50) and near-perfect continuity, with most chromosomes assembled as single contigs. We conclude that ONT sequencing is a viable alternative to HiFi sequencing forde novogenome assembly, and has the potential to provide a single-instrument solution for the reconstruction of complete genomes.",3.1580259148823576e-30

While budding yeast control chromosome inheritance through ~125-base pair DNA sequence-defined centromeres, mammals and many other eukaryotes use large, epigenetic centromeres. Harnessing centromere epigenetics permits human artificial chromosome (HAC) formation but is not sufficient to avoid rampant multimerization of the initial DNA molecule upon introduction to cells. We describe an approach that efficiently forms single-copy HACs. It employs a ~750-kilobase construct that is sufficiently large to house the distinct chromatin types present at the inner and outer centromere, obviating the need to multimerize. Delivery to mammalian cells is streamlined by employing yeast spheroplast fusion. These developments permit faithful chromosome engineering in the context of metazoan cells.",6.629343207573436e-17
38725697,A scenario of unhealthy life cycle: The role of circadian rhythms in health.,Aging Med (Milton),"Circadian rhythms are oscillations in physiology and behavior caused by the circadian regulator. Cryptochromes, Periods, and Bmal1 are circadian clock genes that have been linked to aging and cancer. Human pathologies alter circadian clock gene expression, and transgenic rats with clock gene defects progress to cancer and age prematurely. In the growth of age-linked pathologies and carcinogenesis, cell proliferation and genome integrity play critical roles. The relationship concerning the cell cycle regulation and circadian clock is discussed in this article. The circadian clock controls the behavior and countenance of many main cell cycle and cell cycle check-point proteins, and cell cycle-associated proteins, in turn, control the activity and expression of circadian clock proteins. The circadian clock can be reset by DNA disruption, providing a molecular mechanism for mutual control amid the cell cycle and the clock. This circadian clock-dependent regulation of cell proliferation, composed with other circadian clock-dependent physiological functions including metabolism control, genotoxic and oxidative stress response, and DNA repair, unlocks new avenues for studying the processes of aging and carcinogenesis.© 2024 The Authors.

38717338,Senataxin deficiency disrupts proteostasis through nucleolar ncRNA-driven protein aggregation.,J Cell Biol,"Senataxin is an evolutionarily conserved RNA-DNA helicase involved in DNA repair and transcription termination that is associated with human neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we investigated whether Senataxin loss affects protein homeostasis based on previous work showing R-loop-driven accumulation of DNA damage and protein aggregates in human cells. We find that Senataxin loss results in the accumulation of insoluble proteins, including many factors known to be prone to aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders. These aggregates are located primarily in the nucleolus and are promoted by upregulation of non-coding RNAs expressed from the intergenic spacer region of ribosomal DNA. We also map sites of R-loop accumulation in human cells lacking Senataxin and find higher RNA-DNA hybrids within the ribosomal DNA, peri-centromeric regions, and other intergenic sites but not at annotated protein-coding genes. These findings indicate that Senataxin loss affects the solubility of the proteome through the regulation of transcription-dependent lesions in the nucleus and the nucleolus.© 2024 Wen et al.",8.987048057689676e-28
38659770,Elevated DNA Damage without signs of aging in the short-sleeping Mexican Cavefish.,bioRxiv,"Dysregulation of sleep has widespread health consequences and represents an enormous health burden. Short-sleeping individuals are predisposed to the effects of neurodegeneration, suggesting a critical role for sleep in the maintenance of neuronal health. While the effects of sleep on cellular function are not completely understood, growing evidence has identified an association between sleep loss and DNA damage, raising the possibility that sleep facilitates efficient DNA repair. The Mexican tetra fish,Astyanax mexicanusprovides a model to investigate the evolutionary basis for changes in sleep and the consequences of sleep loss. Multiple cave-adapted populations of these fish have evolved to sleep for substantially less time compared to surface populations of the same species without identifiable impacts on healthspan or longevity. To investigate whether the evolved sleep loss is associated with DNA damage and cellular stress, we compared the DNA Damage Response (DDR) and oxidative stress levels betweenA. mexicanuspopulations. We measured markers of chronic sleep loss and discovered elevated levels of the DNA damage marker γH2AX in the brain, and increased oxidative stress in the gut of cavefish, consistent with chronic sleep deprivation. Notably, we found that acute UV-induced DNA damage elicited an increase in sleep in surface fish but not in cavefish. On a transcriptional level, only the surface fish activated the photoreactivation repair pathway following UV damage. These findings suggest a reduction of the DDR in cavefish compared to surface fish that coincides with elevated DNA damage in cavefish. To examine DDR pathways at a cellular level, we created an embryonic fibroblast cell line from the two populations ofA. mexicanus. We observed that both the DDR and DNA repair were diminished in the cavefish cells, corroborating thein vivofindings and suggesting that the acute response to DNA damage is lost in cavefish. To investigate the long-term impact of these changes, we compared the transcriptome in the brain and gut of aged surface fish and cavefish. Strikingly, many genes that are differentially expressed between young and old surface fish do not transcriptionally vary by age in cavefish. Taken together, these findings suggest that have developed resilience to sleep loss, despite possessing cellular hallmarks of chronic sleep deprivation.",2.034176632075045e-53
38649802,Bleomycin induces senescence and repression of DNA repair via downregulation of Rad51.,Mol Med,"Bleomycin, a potent antitumor agent, is limited in clinical use due to the potential for fatal pulmonary toxicity. The accelerated DNA damage and senescence in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) is considered a key factor in the development of lung pathology. Understanding the mechanisms for bleomycin-induced lung injury is crucial for mitigating its adverse effects.Human lung epithelial (A549) cells were exposed to bleomycin and subsequently assessed for cellular senescence, DNA damage, and double-strand break (DSB) repair. The impact of Rad51 overexpression on DSB repair and senescence in AECs was evaluated in vitro. Additionally, bleomycin was intratracheally administered in C57BL/6 mice to establish a pulmonary fibrosis model.Bleomycin exposure induced dose- and time-dependent accumulation of senescence hallmarks and DNA lesions in AECs. These effects are probably due to the inhibition of Rad51 expression, consequently suppressing homologous recombination (HR) repair. Mechanistic studies revealed that bleomycin-mediated transcriptional inhibition of Rad51 might primarily result from E2F1 depletion. Furthermore, the genetic supplement of Rad51 substantially mitigated bleomycin-mediated effects on DSB repair and senescence in AECs. Notably, decreased Rad51 expression was also observed in the bleomycin-induced mouse pulmonary fibrosis model.Our works suggest that the inhibition of Rad51 plays a pivotal role in bleomycin-induced AECs senescence and lung injury, offering potential strategies to alleviate the pulmonary toxicity of bleomycin.© 2024.

38635632,Microglia-derived extracellular vesicles trigger age-related neurodegeneration upon DNA damage.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"DNA damage and neurodegenerative disorders are intimately linked but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that persistent DNA lesions in tissue-resident macrophages carrying an XPF-ERCC1 DNA repair defect trigger neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death in mice. We find that microglia accumulate dsDNAs and chromatin fragments in the cytosol, which are sensed thereby stimulating a viral-like immune response inEr1Cx/-and naturally aged murine brain. Cytosolic DNAs are packaged into extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are released from microglia and discharge their dsDNA cargo into IFN-responsive neurons triggering cell death. To remove cytosolic dsDNAs and prevent inflammation, we developed targeting EVs to deliver recombinant DNase I toEr1Cx/-brain microglia in vivo. We show that EV-mediated elimination of cytosolic dsDNAs is sufficient to prevent neuroinflammation, reduce neuronal apoptosis, and delay the onset of neurodegenerative symptoms inEr1Cx/-mice. Together, our findings unveil a causal mechanism leading to neuroinflammation and provide a rationalized therapeutic strategy against age-related neurodegeneration.",3.541955435583474e-43
38632351,Aging-induced MCPH1 translocation activates necroptosis and impairs hematopoietic stem cell function.,Nat Aging,"DNA damage contributes to the aging of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we identified a heterogeneous functional role of microcephalin (MCPH1) in the nucleus and cytoplasm of mouse HSCs. In the nucleus, MCPH1 maintains genomic stability, whereas in the cytoplasm, it prevents necroptosis by binding with p-RIPK3. Aging triggers MCPH1 translocation from cytosol to nucleus, reducing its cytoplasmic retention and leading to the activation of necroptosis and deterioration of HSC function. Mechanistically, we found that KAT7-mediated lysine acetylation within the NLS motif of MCPH1 in response to DNA damage facilitates its nuclear translocation. Targeted mutation of these lysines inhibits MCPH1 translocation and, consequently, compromises necroptosis. The dysfunction of necroptosis signaling, in turn, improves the function of aged HSCs. In summary, our findings demonstrate that DNA damage-induced redistribution of MCPH1 promotes HSC aging and could have broader implications for aging and aging-related diseases.© 2024.

38581089,Apoptotic vesicles are required to repair DNA damage and suppress premature cellular senescence.,J Extracell Vesicles,"It is well known that DNA damage can cause apoptosis. However, whether apoptosis and its metabolites contribute to DNA repair is largely unknown. In this study, we found that apoptosis-deficient Fasmutand Bim-/-mice show significantly elevated DNA damage and premature cellular senescence, along with a significantly reduced number of 16,000 g apoptotic vesicles (apoVs). Intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived 16,000 g apoVs rescued the DNA damage and premature senescence in Fasmutand Bim-/-mice. Moreover, a sublethal dose of radiation exposure caused more severe DNA damage, reduced survival rate, and loss of body weight in Fasmutmice than in wild-type mice, which can be recovered by the infusion of MSC-apoVs. Mechanistically, we showed that apoptosis can assemble multiple nuclear DNA repair enzymes, such as the full-length PARP1, into 16,000 g apoVs. These DNA repair components are directly transferred by 16,000 g apoVs to recipient cells, leading to the rescue of DNA damage and elimination of senescent cells. Finally, we showed that embryonic stem cell-derived 16,000 g apoVs have superior DNA repair capacity due to containing a high level of nuclear DNA repair enzymes to rescue lethal dose-irradiated mice. This study uncovers a previously unknown role of 16,000 g apoVs in safeguarding tissues from DNA damage and demonstrates a strategy for using stem cell-derived apoVs to ameliorate irradiation-induced DNA damage.© 2024 The Authors.

38571872,Harnessing Genetics to Extend Lifespan and Healthspan: Current Progress and Future Directions.,Cureus,"Aging is inevitable, but the lifespan (duration of life) and healthspan (healthy aging) vary greatly among individuals and across species. Unlocking the secrets behind these differences has captivated scientific curiosity for ages. This review presents relevant recent advances in genetics and cell biology that are shedding new light by untangling how subtle changes in conserved genes, pathways, and epigenetic factors influence organismal senescence and associated declines. Biogerontology is a complex and rapidly growing field aimed at elucidating genetic modifications that extend lifespan and healthspan. This review explores gerontogenes, genes influencing lifespan and healthspan across species. Though subtle differences exist, long-lived individuals such as centenarians demonstrate extended healthspans, and numerous studies confirm the heritability of longevity/healthspan genes. Importantly, genes and gerontogenes are directly and indirectly involved in DNA repair, insulin/IGF-1 and mTOR signaling pathways, long non-coding RNAs, sirtuins, and heat shock proteins. The complex interactions between genetics and epigenetics are teased apart. While more research into optimizing healthspan is needed, conserved gerontogenes offer synergistic potential to forestall aging and age-related diseases. Understanding complex longevity genetics brings closer the goal of extending not only lifespan but quality years of life. The primary aim of human Biogerontology is to enhance lifespan and healthspan, but the question remains: are current genetic modifications effectively promoting healthy aging? This article collates the advancements in gerontogenes that enhance lifespan and improve healthspan alongside their potential challenges.Copyright © 2024, Ankrah et al.",2.9411345075558318e-30

38538785,Formation of memory assemblies through the DNA-sensing TLR9 pathway.,Nature,"As hippocampal neurons respond to diverse types of information1, a subset assembles into microcircuits representing a memory2. Those neurons typically undergo energy-intensive molecular adaptations, occasionally resulting in transient DNA damage3-5. Here we found discrete clusters of excitatory hippocampal CA1 neurons with persistent double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks, nuclear envelope ruptures and perinuclear release of histone and dsDNA fragments hours after learning. Following these early events, some neurons acquired an inflammatory phenotype involving activation of TLR9 signalling and accumulation of centrosomal DNA damage repair complexes6. Neuron-specific knockdown of Tlr9 impaired memory while blunting contextual fear conditioning-induced changes of gene expression in specific clusters of excitatory CA1 neurons. Notably, TLR9 had an essential role in centrosome function, including DNA damage repair, ciliogenesis and build-up of perineuronal nets. We demonstrate a novel cascade of learning-induced molecular events in discrete neuronal clusters undergoing dsDNA damage and TLR9-mediated repair, resulting in their recruitment to memory circuits. With compromised TLR9 function, this fundamental memory mechanism becomes a gateway to genomic instability and cognitive impairments implicated in accelerated senescence, psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. Maintaining the integrity of TLR9 inflammatory signalling thus emerges as a promising preventive strategy for neurocognitive deficits.© 2024. The Author(s).",6.111620027683694e-33

Ercc1 is involved in multiple DNA repair pathways, and its mutations contribute to accelerated aging phenotypes in both humans and mice, due to the accumulation of DNA lesions that impair vital DNA functions. We previously found that systemic mutations and cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of Ercc1 in mice results in left ventricular (LV) dysfunction at older age.Here we report that combined functional micro-CT and FMT imaging allowed us to detect apoptosis in systemic Ercc1 mutant mice prior to the development of overt LV dysfunction, suggesting its potential as an early indicator and contributing factor of cardiac impairment. The detection of apoptosis in vivo was feasible as early as 12 weeks of age, even when global LV function appeared normal, underscoring the potential of apoptosis as an early predictor of LV dysfunction, which subsequently manifested at 24 weeks.This study highlights the utility of combined functional micro-CT and FMT imaging in assessing cardiac function and detecting apoptosis, providing valuable insights into the potential of apoptosis as an early biomarker for cardiac failure.© 2024.

Here, we comprehensively examined and validated 7,006 aptamers targeting 6,162 proteins in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) from 2,077 amyloid/tau positive cases and controls to identify sex-specific proteomic signatures of AD. In discovery (N=1,766), we identified 330 male-specific and 121 female-specific proteomic alternations in CSF (FDR <0.05). These sex-specific proteins strongly predicted amyloid/tau positivity (AUC=0.98 in males; 0.99 in females), significantly higher than those with age, sex, and APOE-ε4 (AUC=0.85). The identified sex-specific proteins were well validated (r≥0.5) in the Stanford study (N=108) and Emory study (N=148). Biological follow-up of these proteins led to sex differences in cell-type specificity, pathways, interaction networks, and drug targets. Male-specific proteins, enriched in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, were involved in postsynaptic and axon-genesis. The male network exhibited direct connections among 152 proteins and highlighted PTEN, NOTCH1, FYN, and MAPK8 as hubs. Drug target suggested melatonin (used for sleep-wake cycle regulation), nabumetone (used for pain), daunorubicin, and verteporfin for treating AD males. In contrast, female-specific proteins, enriched in neurons, were involved in phosphoserine residue binding including cytokine activities. The female network exhibits strong connections among 51 proteins and highlighted JUN and 14-3-3 proteins (YWHAG and YWHAZ) as hubs. Drug target suggested biperiden (for muscle control of Parkinson's disease), nimodipine (for cerebral vasospasm), quinostatin and ethaverine for treating AD females.

However, reliable DNA methylation biomarkers, not to mention interactivity, have yet to be identified at the epigenetic level.

PCR is subject to potential bias in differential amplification of bisulfite-converted methylatedversusunmethylated sequences. Here, we combine bisulfite conversion with single-molecule kinetic fingerprinting to develop an amplification-free assay for DNA methylation at the branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1) promoter. Our assay selectively responds to methylated sequences with a limit of detection below 1 fM and a specificity of 99.9999%. Evaluating complex genomic DNA matrices, we reliably distinguish 2-5% DNA methylation at the BCAT1 promoter in whole blood DNA from completely unmethylated whole-genome amplified DNA. Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility and sensitivity of our amplification-free, single-molecule quantification approach to improve the early detection of methylated cancer DNA biomarkers.",6.04196375541138e-12
38732604,Prognostic Nutritional Index and Instant Nutritional Assessement Are Associated with Clinical Outcomes in a Geriatric Cohort of Acutely Inpatients.,Nutrients,"Among elderly inpatients, malnutrition is one of the most important predictive factors affecting length of stay (LOS), mortality, and risk of re-hospitalization.We conducted an observational, retrospective study on a cohort of 2206 acutely inpatients. Serum albumin and lymphocytes were evaluated. Instant Nutritional Assessment (INA) and the Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI) were calculated to predict in-hospital mortality, LOS, and risk of rehospitalization.An inverse relationship between LOS, serum albumin, and PNI were found. Deceased patients had lower albumin levels, lower PNI values, and third- and fourth-degree INA scores. An accurate predictor of mortality was PNI (AUC = 0.785) after ROC curve analysis; both lower PNI values (HR = 3.56) and third- and fourth-degree INA scores (HR = 3.12) could be independent risk factors for mortality during hospitalization after Cox regression analysis. Moreover, among 309 subjects with a lower PNI value or third- and fourth-class INA, hospitalization was re-hospitalization.PNI and INA are two simple and quick-to-calculate tools that can help in classifying the condition of hospitalized elderly patients also based on their nutritional status, or in assessing their mortality risk. A poor nutritional status at the time of discharge may represent an important risk factor for rehospitalization in the following thirty days. This study confirms the importance of evaluating nutritional status at the time of hospitalization, especially in older patients. This study also confirms the importance for adequate training of doctors and nurses regarding the importance of maintaining a good nutritional status as an integral part of the therapeutic process of hospitalization in acute departments.",4.131917877158314e-29
38622740,Treating sex and gender differences as a continuous variable can improve precision cancer treatments.,Biol Sex Differ,"The significant sex and gender differences that exist in cancer mechanisms, incidence, and survival, have yet to impact clinical practice. One barrier to translation is that cancer phenotypes cannot be segregated into distinct male versus female categories. Instead, within this convenient but contrived dichotomy, male and female cancer phenotypes are highly overlapping and vary between female- and male- skewed extremes. Thus, sex and gender-specific treatments are unrealistic, and our translational goal should be adaptation of treatment to the variable effects of sex and gender on targetable pathways.To overcome this obstacle, we profiled the similarities in 8370 transcriptomes of 26 different adult and 4 different pediatric cancer types. We calculated the posterior probabilities of predicting patient sex and gender based on the observed sexes of similar samples in this map of transcriptome similarity.Transcriptomic index (TI) values were derived from posterior probabilities and allowed us to identify poles with local enrichments for male or female transcriptomes. TI supported deconvolution of transcriptomes into measures of patient-specific activity in sex and gender-biased, targetable pathways. It identified sex and gender-skewed extremes in mechanistic phenotypes like cell cycle signaling and immunity, and precisely positioned each patient's whole transcriptome on an axis of continuously varying sex and gender phenotypes.Cancer type, patient sex and gender, and TI value provides a novel and patient- specific mechanistic identifier that can be used for realistic sex and gender-adaptations of precision cancer treatment planning.© 2024.

38602189,Peripheral Blood Cells From Older Adults Exhibit Sex-Associated Differences in Mitochondrial Function.,J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,"Blood-based mitochondrial bioenergetic profiling is a feasible, economical, and minimally invasive approach that can be used to examine mitochondrial function and energy metabolism in human subjects. In this study, we use 2 complementary respirometric techniques to evaluate mitochondrial bioenergetics in both intact and permeabilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and platelets to examine sex dimorphism in mitochondrial function among older adults. Employing equal numbers of PBMCs and platelets to assess mitochondrial bioenergetics, we observe significantly higher respiration rates in female compared to male participants. Mitochondrial bioenergetic differences remain significant after controlling for independent parameters including demographic parameters (age, years of education), and cognitive parameters (mPACC5, COGDX). Our study illustrates that circulating blood cells, immune cells in particular, have distinctly different mitochondrial bioenergetic profiles between females and males. These differences should be taken into account as blood-based bioenergetic profiling is now commonly used to understand the role of mitochondrial bioenergetics in human health and aging.© The Author(s) 2024.

38534362,Repurposing Drugs for Senotherapeutic Effect: Potential Senomorphic Effects of Female Synthetic Hormones.,Cells,"Repurposing previously approved drugs may fast track the route to the clinic for potential senotherapeutics and improves the inefficiency of the clinical drug development pipeline. We performed a repurposing screen of 240 clinically approved molecules in human primary dermal fibroblasts for their effects onCDKN2Aexpression. Molecules demonstrating effects onCDKN2Aexpression underwent secondary screening for senescence-associated beta galactosidase (SAB) activity, based on effect size, direction, and/or molecule identity. Selected molecules then underwent a more detailed assessment of senescence phenotypes including proliferation, apoptosis, DNA damage, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) expression, and regulators of alternative splicing. A selection of the molecules demonstrating effects on senescence were then used in a new bioinformatic structure-function screen to identify common structural motifs. In total, 90 molecules displayed alteredCDKN2Aexpression at one or other dose, of which 15 also displayed effects on SAB positivity in primary human dermal fibroblasts. Of these, 3 were associated with increased SAB activity, and 11 with reduced activity. The female synthetic sex hormones-diethylstilboestrol, ethynyl estradiol and levonorgestrel-were all associated with a reduction in aspects of the senescence phenotype in male cells, with no effects visible in female cells. Finally, we identified that the 30 compounds that decreasedCDKN2Aactivity the most had a common substructure linked to this function. Our results suggest that several drugs licensed for other indications may warrant exploration as future senotherapies, but that different donors and potentially different sexes may respond differently to senotherapeutic compounds. This underlines the importance of considering donor-related characteristics when designing drug screening platforms.",1.2635946808697885e-38
38521835,Outcome differences by sex in oncology clinical trials.,Nat Commun,"Identifying sex differences in outcomes and toxicity between males and females in oncology clinical trials is important and has also been mandated by National Institutes of Health policies. Here we analyze the Trialtrove database, finding that, strikingly, only 472/89,221 oncology clinical trials (0.5%) had curated post-treatment sex comparisons. Among 288 trials with comparisons of survival, outcome, or response, 16% report males having statistically significant better survival outcome or response, while 42% reported significantly better survival outcome or response for females. The strongest differences are in trials of EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer and rituximab in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (both favoring females). Among 44 trials with side effect comparisons, more trials report significantly lesser side effects in males (N = 22) than in females (N = 13). Thus, while statistical comparisons between sexes in oncology trials are rarely reported, important differences in outcome and toxicity exist. These considerable outcome and toxicity differences highlight the need for reporting sex differences more thoroughly going forward.© 2024.

38561782,DNA methylation-mediated ROS production contributes to seed abortion in litchi.,Mol Hortic,"Although there is increasing evidence suggesting that DNA methylation regulates seed development, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Therefore, we aimed to shed light on this by conducting whole-genome bisulfite sequencing using seeds from the large-seeded cultivar 'HZ' and the abortive-seeded cultivar 'NMC'. Our analysis revealed that the 'HZ' seeds exhibited a hypermethylation level compared to the 'NMC' seeds. Furthermore, we found that the genes associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic pathway. To investigate this further, we conducted nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and 2,7-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) staining, which demonstrated a significantly higher amount of ROS in the 'NMC' seeds compared to the 'HZ' seeds. Moreover, we identified that the gene LcGPX6, involved in ROS scavenging, exhibited hypermethylation levels and parallelly lower expression levels in 'NMC' seeds compared to 'HZ' seeds. Interestingly, the ectopic expression of LcGPX6 in Arabidopsis enhanced ROS scavenging and resulted in lower seed production. Together, we suggest that DNA methylation-mediated ROS production plays a significant role in seed development in litchi, during which hypermethylation levels of LcGPX6 might repress its expression, resulting in the accumulation of excessive ROS and ultimately leading to seed abortion.© 2024.

Africa has exceptionally high rates of other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and malaria, and was not impacted by COVID-19 to the extent of other continents Globally, COVID-19 has caused approximately 7 million deaths and 700 million infections thus far. COVID-19 disease severity and susceptibility vary among individuals and populations, which could be attributed to various factors, including the viral strain, host genetics, environment, lifespan, and co-existing conditions. Host genetics play a substantial part in COVID-19 disease severity among individuals. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) was previously been shown to be very important across host immune responses against viruses. HLA has been a widely studied gene region for various disease associations that have been identified. HLA proteins present peptides to the cytotoxic lymphocytes, which causes an immune response to kill infected cells. The HLA molecule serves as the central region for infectious disease association; therefore, we expect HLA disease association with COVID-19. Therefore, in this narrative review, we look at the HLA gene region, particularly, HLA class I, to understand its role in COVID-19 disease.",5.172367250543841e-45
38608190,Effect of tokenization on transformers for biological sequences.,Bioinformatics,"Deep-learning models are transforming biological research, including many bioinformatics and comparative genomics algorithms, such as sequence alignments, phylogenetic tree inference, and automatic classification of protein functions. Among these deep-learning algorithms, models for processing natural languages, developed in the natural language processing (NLP) community, were recently applied to biological sequences. However, biological sequences are different from natural languages, such as English, and French, in which segmentation of the text to separate words is relatively straightforward. Moreover, biological sequences are characterized by extremely long sentences, which hamper their processing by current machine-learning models, notably the transformer architecture. In NLP, one of the first processing steps is to transform the raw text to a list of tokens. Deep-learning applications to biological sequence data mostly segment proteins and DNA to single characters. In this work, we study the effect of alternative tokenization algorithms on eight different tasks in biology, from predicting the function of proteins and their stability, through nucleotide sequence alignment, to classifying proteins to specific families.We demonstrate that applying alternative tokenization algorithms can increase accuracy and at the same time, substantially reduce the input length compared to the trivial tokenizer in which each character is a token. Furthermore, applying these tokenization algorithms allows interpreting trained models, taking into account dependencies among positions. Finally, we trained these tokenizers on a large dataset of protein sequences containing more than 400 billion amino acids, which resulted in over a 3-fold decrease in the number of tokens. We then tested these tokenizers trained on large-scale data on the above specific tasks and showed that for some tasks it is highly beneficial to train database-specific tokenizers. Our study suggests that tokenizers are likely to be a critical component in future deep-network analysis of biological sequence data.Code, data, and trained tokenizers are available on https://github.com/technion-cs-nlp/BiologicalTokenizers.© The Author(s) 2024.

38557672,IBPGNET: lung adenocarcinoma recurrence prediction based on neural network interpretability.,Brief Bioinform,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histologic subtype of lung cancer. Early-stage patients have a 30-50% probability of metastatic recurrence after surgical treatment. Here, we propose a new computational framework, Interpretable Biological Pathway Graph Neural Networks (IBPGNET), based on pathway hierarchy relationships to predict LUAD recurrence and explore the internal regulatory mechanisms of LUAD. IBPGNET can integrate different omics data efficiently and provide global interpretability. In addition, our experimental results show that IBPGNET outperforms other classification methods in 5-fold cross-validation. IBPGNET identified PSMC1 and PSMD11 as genes associated with LUAD recurrence, and their expression levels were significantly higher in LUAD cells than in normal cells. The knockdown of PSMC1 and PSMD11 in LUAD cells increased their sensitivity to afatinib and decreased cell migration, invasion and proliferation. In addition, the cells showed significantly lower EGFR expression, indicating that PSMC1 and PSMD11 may mediate therapeutic sensitivity through EGFR expression.© The Author(s) 2024.

38649851,Multiplex proteomics identifies inflammation-related plasma biomarkers for aging and cardio-metabolic disorders.,Clin Proteomics,"Cardio-metabolic disorders (CMDs) are common in aging people and are pivotal risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of CVDs and aging, but the underlying inflammatory molecular phenotypes in CMDs and aging are still unknown.We utilized multiple proteomics to detect 368 inflammatory proteins in the plasma of 30 subjects, including healthy young individuals, healthy elderly individuals, and elderly individuals with CMDs, by Proximity Extension Assay technology (PEA, O-link). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and functional modules were constructed to explore hub proteins in differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). The correlation between proteins and clinical traits of CMDs was analyzed and diagnostic value for CMDs of proteins was evaluated by ROC curve analysis.Our results revealed that there were 161 DEPs (adjusted p < 0.05) in normal aging and EGF was the most differentially expressed hub protein in normal aging. Twenty-eight DEPs were found in elderly individuals with CMDs and MMP1 was the most differentially expressed hub protein in CMDs. After the intersection of DEPs in aging and CMDs, there were 10 overlapping proteins: SHMT1, MVK, EGLN1, SLC39A5, NCF2, CXCL6, IRAK4, REG4, PTPN6, and PRDX5. These proteins were significantly correlated with the level of HDL-C, TG, or FPG in plasma. They were verified to have good diagnostic value for CMDs in aging with an AUC > 0.7. Among these, EGLN1, NCF2, REG4, and SLC39A2 were prominently increased both in normal aging and aging with CMDs.Our results could reveal molecular markers for normal aging and CMDs, which need to be further expanded the sample size and to be further investigated to predict their significance for CVDs.© 2024.

38672194,Plasma Proteomics Elucidated a Protein Signature in COVID-19 Patients with Comorbidities and Early-Diagnosis Biomarkers.,Biomedicines,"Despite great scientific efforts, deep understanding of coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) immunopathology and clinical biomarkers remains a challenge. Pre-existing comorbidities increase the mortality rate and aggravate the exacerbated immune response against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which can result in more severe symptoms as well as long-COVID and post-COVID complications. In this study, we applied proteomics analysis of plasma samples from 28 patients with SARS-CoV-2, with and without pre-existing comorbidities, as well as their corresponding controls to determine the systemic protein changes caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a result, the protein signature shared amongst COVID-19 patients with comorbidities was revealed to be characterized by alterations in the coagulation and complement pathways, acute-phase response proteins, tissue damage and remodeling, as well as cholesterol metabolism. These altered proteins may play a relevant role in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Moreover, several novel potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected, such as increased levels of keratin K22E, extracellular matrix protein-1 (ECM1), and acute-phase response protein α-2-antiplasmin (A2AP). Importantly, elevated A2AP may contribute to persistent clotting complications associated with the long-COVID syndrome in patients with comorbidities. This study provides new insights into COVID-19 pathogenesis and proposes novel potential biomarkers for early diagnosis that could be facilitated for clinical application by further validation studies.",3.935137549461341e-48
38598083,Interleukin-6 drives endothelial glycocalyx damage in COVID-19 and bacterial sepsis.,Angiogenesis,"Damage of the endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) plays a central role in the development of vascular hyperpermeability and organ damage during systemic inflammation. However, the specific signalling pathways for eGC damage remain poorly defined. Aim of this study was to combine sublingual video-microscopy, plasma proteomics and live cell imaging to uncover further pathways of eGC damage in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or bacterial sepsis. This secondary analysis of the prospective multicenter MICROCODE study included 22 patients with COVID-19 and 43 patients with bacterial sepsis admitted to intermediate or intensive care units and 10 healthy controls. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was strongly associated with damaged eGC and correlated both with eGC dimensions (rs=0.36, p = 0.0015) and circulating eGC biomarkers. In vitro, IL-6 reduced eGC height and coverage, which was inhibited by blocking IL-6 signalling with the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab or the Janus kinase inhibitor tofacitinib. Exposure of endothelial cells to 5% serum from COVID-19 or sepsis patients resulted in a significant decrease in eGC height, which was attenuated by co-incubation with tocilizumab. In an external COVID-19 cohort of 219 patients from Massachusetts General Hospital, a previously identified proteomic eGC signature correlated with IL-6 (rs=-0.58, p < 0.0001) and predicted the combined endpoint of 28-day mortality and/or intubation (ROC-AUC: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.81-0.91], p < 0.001). The data suggest that IL-6 may significantly drive eGC damage in COVID-19 and bacterial sepsis.

Proteins are building blocks of life, but specific proteins causally related to COVID-19, healthspan and lifespan have not been systematically examined.We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to assess the effects of 1,361 plasma proteins on COVID-19, healthspan and lifespan, using large GWAS of severe COVID-19 (up to 13,769 cases and 1,072,442 controls), COVID-19 hospitalization (32,519 cases and 2,062,805 controls) and SARS-COV2 infection (122,616 cases and 2,475,240 controls), healthspan (n= 300,477) and parental lifespan (~0.8 million of European ancestry).We identified 35, 43, and 63 proteins for severe COVID, COVID-19 hospitalization, and SARS-COV2 infection, and 4, 32, and 19 proteins for healthspan, father's attained age, and mother's attained age. In addition to some proteins reported previously, such as SFTPD related to severe COVID-19, we identified novel proteins involved in inflammation and immunity (such as ICAM-2 and ICAM-5 which affect COVID-19 risk, CXCL9, HLA-DRA and LILRB4 for healthspan and lifespan), apoptosis (such as FGFR2 and ERBB4 which affect COVID-19 risk and FOXO3 which affect lifespan) and metabolism (such as PCSK9 which lowers lifespan). We found 2, 2 and 3 proteins shared between COVID-19 and healthspan/lifespan, such as CXADR and LEFTY2, shared between severe COVID-19 and healthspan/lifespan. Three proteins affecting COVID-19 and seven proteins affecting healthspan/lifespan are targeted by existing drugs.Our study provided novel insights into protein targets affecting COVID-19, healthspan and lifespan, with implications for developing new treatment and drug repurposing.",4.592375604039887e-36

Immunogenic tumors harbor spatially localized multicellular 'immunity hubs' defined by expression of the T cell-attracting chemokines CXCL10/CXCL11 and abundant T cells. Here, we examined immunity hubs in human pre-immunotherapy lung cancer specimens and found an association with beneficial response to PD-1 blockade. Critically, we discovered the stem-immunity hub, a subtype of immunity hub strongly associated with favorable PD-1-blockade outcome. This hub is distinct from mature tertiary lymphoid structures and is enriched for stem-like TCF7+PD-1+CD8+T cells, activated CCR7+LAMP3+dendritic cells and CCL19+fibroblasts as well as chemokines that organize these cells. Within the stem-immunity hub, we find preferential interactions between CXCL10+macrophages and TCF7-CD8+T cells as well as between mature regulatory dendritic cells and TCF7+CD4+and regulatory T cells.

To investigate the impact of viremic and aviremic HIV-2 infection on target and bystander cell pathology, we used data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry to determine plasma signatures of tissue and cell type engagement. Proteins derived from target and bystander cells in multiple tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract and brain, were detected at elevated levels in plasma of PLWH2, compared with HIV negative controls. Moreover, viremic HIV-2 infection appeared to induce enhanced release of proteins from a broader range of tissues compared to aviremic HIV-2 infection.

A total of 40 T1DM children was included in the first survey. Because no participant has DR, retina thinning was used as a surrogate indicator for DR. The lowest 25% participants with the thinnest macular retinal thickness were included into the case group, and the others were controls. The DNA methylation status was assessed by the Illumina methylation 850K array BeadChip assay, and compared between the case and control groups. Four DMS with a potential role in diabetes were identified. The second survey included 27 T1DM children, among which four had DR. The methylation patterns of the four DMS identified by 850K were compared between participants with and without DR by pyrosequencing.In the first survey, the 850K array revealed 751 sites significantly and differentially methylated in the case group comparing with the controls (|Δβ|>0.1 and Adj.P<0.05), and 328 of these were identified with a significance of Adj.P<0.01. Among these, 319 CpG sites were hypermethylated and 432 were hypomethylated in the case group relative to the controls. Pyrosequencing revealed that the transcription elongation regulator 1 like (TCERG1L, cg07684215) gene was hypermethylated in the four T1DM children with DR (P=0.018), which was consistent with the result from the first survey.

However, evidence from population-based studies on this topic is limited, leaving the causal association between these factors unknown. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the causal effects of 18 autoimmune diseases on the risk of facial skin aging, aim of providing strategies to mitigate early facial aging in patients with autoimmune diseases.We conducted univariate Mendelian randomization (UVMR) analyses to examine the causal relationship between 18 autoimmune diseases and facial aging using publicly available summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We also conducted multivariate Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analyses to adjust for confounding factors, including smoking, alcohol consumption, and body mass index (BMI).The main inverse variance weighted (IVW) method revealed that genetically proxied ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (OR 1.017; 95% CI: 1.003-1.031;P=0.018), sicca syndrome (SS) (OR 1.008; 95% CI: 1.005-1.011;P= 2.66×10-6), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (OR 1.006; 95% 1.001-1.011;P=0.014), multiple sclerosis (MS) (OR 1.004; 95% CI: 1.001-1.007;P=0.021), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) (OR 1.002; 95% CI: 1.000-1.004;P=0.023), and celiac disease (CeD) (OR 1.002; 95% CI: 1.001-1.004;P=0.009) were significantly associated with higher risk of facial aging. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the association persisted between AS, SLE, and CeD.These findings indicated that autoimmune diseases play a causal role in facial skin aging.

This bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study aimed to investigate the causal relationships between autoimmune diseases and POI.We obtained summary-level data for ten autoimmune diseases and POI from published large-scale genome-wide association studies and the FinnGen consortium of European ancestry. A series of filtering steps was performed to discern independent genetic variants. Causal estimates were mainly calculated by the inverse variance weighting method and verified through multiple sensitivity analyses.Of the ten autoimmune diseases, genetically predicted Addison's disease (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.47, P = 0.003) and systemic lupus erythematosus (OR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.24, P = 0.021) were associated with an increased risk of POI, and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. In addition, there were weak associations between liability to POI and elevated risks of type 1 diabetes (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.10, P = 0.046) and autoimmune thyroid disease (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05, P = 0.015).This study revealed that Addison's disease and systemic lupus erythematosus are potential risk factors for POI, underscoring the necessity to consider the impact of autoimmune factors in the diagnosis and treatment of POI.© 2024.

While dimensionality reduction tools have been developed to extract biological signals from the data, they often require manual determination of signal dimension, introducing user bias. Furthermore, a common data preprocessing method, log normalization, can unintentionally distort signals in the data. Here, we develop scLENS, a dimensionality reduction tool that circumvents the long-standing issues of signal distortion and manual input. Specifically, we identify the primary cause of signal distortion during log normalization and effectively address it by uniformizing cell vector lengths with L2 normalization. Furthermore, we utilize random matrix theory-based noise filtering and a signal robustness test to enable data-driven determination of the threshold for signal dimensions. Our method outperforms 11 widely used dimensionality reduction tools and performs particularly well for challenging scRNA-seq datasets with high sparsity and variability. To facilitate the use of scLENS, we provide a user-friendly package that automates accurate signal detection of scRNA-seq data without manual time-consuming tuning.© 2024.

In this scoping review, we summarize the current evidence regarding the clinical implications of single-cell sequencing for bladder cancer based on PRISMA guidelines. We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, Embase, and supplemented with manual searches through the Scopus, and Web of Science for published studies until February 2023. We included original studies that used at least one single-cell technology to study bladder cancer. Forty-one publications were included in the review. Twenty-nine studies showed that this technology can identify cell subtypes in the tumor microenvironment that may predict prognosis or response to immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. Two studies were able to diagnose BC by identifying neoplastic cells through single-cell sequencing urine samples. The remaining studies were mainly a preclinical exploration of tumor microenvironment at single cell level. Single-cell sequencing technology can discriminate heterogeneity in bladder tumor cells and determine the key molecular properties that can lead to the discovery of novel perspectives on cancer management. This nascent tool can advance the early diagnosis, prognosis judgment, and targeted therapy of bladder cancer.© 2024 Yadollahvandmiandoab et al.",1.1501316800491246e-42

Here we use a spatial context-dependent approach that matches spatial pattern detection to cell annotation. Using this approach in existing datasets from ulcerative colitis patient colonic biopsies, we identified architectural complexities and associated difficult-to-detect rare cell types in ulcerative colitis germinal-center B cell follicles.

38660222,Effect of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on cognitive impairment in WD patients based on inverse probability weighting of propensity scores.,Front Neurosci,"Hepatolenticular degeneration [Wilson disease (WD)] is an autosomal recessive metabolic disease characterized by copper metabolism disorder. Cognitive impairment is a key neuropsychiatric symptom of WD. At present, there is no effective treatment for WD-related cognitive impairment.In this study, high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was used to treat WD-related cognitive impairment, and inverse probability weighting of propensity scores was used to correct for confounding factors. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Boston Naming Test (BNT), Clock Drawing Test (CDT) and Trail Making Test (TMT) were used to evaluate overall cognition and specific cognitive domains.The MMSE, MoCA and CDT scores after treatment were significantly different from those before treatment (MMSE: before adjustment: OR = 1.404, 95% CI: 1.271-1.537; after adjustment: OR = 1.381, 95% CI: 1.265-1.497,p < 0.001; MoCA: before adjustment: OR = 1.306, 95% CI: 1.122-1.490; after adjustment: OR = 1.286, 95% CI: 1.104; AVLT: OR = 1.161, 95% CI: 1.074-1.248; after adjustment: OR = 1.145, 95% CI: 1.068-1.222,p < 0.05; CDT: OR = 1.524, 95% CI: 1.303-1.745; after adjustment: OR = 1.518, 95% CI: 1.294-1.742,p < 0.001). The BNT and TMT scores after adjustment were not significantly different from those before adjustment (BNT: before adjustment: OR = 1.048, 95% CI: 0.877-1.219; after adjustment: OR = 1.026, 95% CI: 0.863-1.189,p > 0.05; TMT: before adjustment: OR = 0.816, 95% CI: 1.122-1.490; after adjustment: OR = 0.791, 95% CI: 0.406-1.176,p > 0.05).High-frequency rTMS can effectively improve cognitive impairment, especially memory and visuospatial ability, in WD patients.

MUD has been modeled in rodents and investigators are attempting to identify its molecular bases. Preclinical experiments have shown that different schedules of methamphetamine self-administration can cause diverse transcriptional changes in the dorsal striatum of Sprague-Dawley rats. In the present review, we present data on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in the rat striatum following methamphetamine intake. These include genes involved in transcription regulation, potassium channel function, and neuroinflammation. We then use the striatal data to discuss the potential significance of the molecular changes induced by methamphetamine by reviewing concordant or discordant data from the literature. This review identified potential molecular targets for pharmacological interventions. Nevertheless, there is a need for more research on methamphetamine-induced transcriptional consequences in various brain regions. These data should provide a more detailed neuroanatomical map of methamphetamine-induced changes and should better inform therapeutic interventions against MUD.",1.9206487791018697e-26
38564143,The causal impact of gut microbiota on circulating adipokine concentrations: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,Hormones (Athens),"Evidence from previous experimental and observational research demonstrates that the gut microbiota is related to circulating adipokine concentrations. Nevertheless, the debate as to whether gut microbiome composition causally influences circulating adipokine concentrations remains unresolved. This study aimed to take an essential step in elucidating this issue.We used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to causally analyze genetic variation statistics for gut microbiota and four adipokines (including adiponectin, leptin, soluble leptin receptor [sOB-R], and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1]) from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets. A range of sensitivity analyses was also conducted to assess the stability and reliability of the results.The composite results of the MR and sensitivity analyses revealed 22 significant causal associations. In particular, there is a suggestive causality between the family Clostridiaceae1 (IVW: β = 0.063, P = 0.034), the genus Butyrivibrio (IVW: β = 0.029, P = 0.031), and the family Alcaligenaceae (IVW: β=-0.070, P = 0.014) and adiponectin. Stronger causal effects with leptin were found for the genus Enterorhabdus (IVW: β=-0.073, P = 0.038) and the genus Lachnospiraceae (NK4A136 group) (IVW: β=-0.076, P = 0.01). Eight candidate bacterial groups were found to be associated with sOB-R, with the phylum Firmicutes (IVW: β = 0.235, P = 0.03) and the order Clostridiales (IVW: β = 0.267, P = 0.028) being of more interest. In addition, the genus Roseburia (IVW: β = 0.953, P = 0.022) and the order Lactobacillales (IVW: β=-0.806, P = 0.042) were suggestive of an association with PAI-1.This study reveals a causal relationship between the gut microbiota and circulating adipokines and may help to offer novel insights into the prevention of abnormal concentrations of circulating adipokines and obesity-related diseases.© 2024.

38491524,A genome-wide association study of neutrophil count in individuals associated to an African continental ancestry group facilitates studies of malaria pathogenesis.,Hum Genomics,"'Benign ethnic neutropenia' (BEN) is a heritable condition characterized by lower neutrophil counts, predominantly observed in individuals of African ancestry, and the genetic basis of BEN remains a subject of extensive research. In this study, we aimed to dissect the genetic architecture underlying neutrophil count variation through a linear-mixed model genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a population of African ancestry (N = 5976). Malaria caused by P. falciparum imposes a tremendous public health burden on people living in sub-Saharan Africa. Individuals living in malaria endemic regions often have a reduced circulating neutrophil count due to BEN, raising the possibility that reduced neutrophil counts modulate severity of malaria in susceptible populations. As a follow-up, we tested this hypothesis by conducting a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis of neutrophil counts on severe malaria (MalariaGEN, N = 17,056).We carried out a GWAS of neutrophil count in individuals associated to an African continental ancestry group within UK Biobank, identifying 73 loci (r2 = 0.1) and 10 index SNPs (GCTA-COJO loci) associated with neutrophil count, including previously unknown rare loci regulating neutrophil count in a non-European population. BOLT-LMM was reliable when conducted in a non-European population, and additional covariates added to the model did not largely alter the results of the top loci or index SNPs. The two-sample bi-directional MR analysis between neutrophil count and severe malaria showed the greatest evidence for an effect between neutrophil count and severe anaemia, although the confidence intervals crossed the null.Our GWAS of neutrophil count revealed unique loci present in individuals of African ancestry. We note that a small sample-size reduced our power to identify variants with low allele frequencies and/or low effect sizes in our GWAS. Our work highlights the need for conducting large-scale biobank studies in Africa and for further exploring the link between neutrophils and severe malaria.© 2024.

38496482,On the identification of differentially-active transcription factors from ATAC-seq data.,bioRxiv,"ATAC-seq has emerged as a rich epigenome profiling technique, and is commonly used to identify Transcription Factors (TFs) underlying given phenomena. A number of methods can be used to identify differentially-active TFs through the accessibility of their DNA-binding motif, however little is known on the best approaches for doing so. Here we benchmark several such methods using a combination of curated datasets with various forms of short-term perturbations on known TFs, as well as semi-simulations. We include both methods specifically designed for this type of data as well as some that can be repurposed for it. We also investigate variations to these methods, and identify three particularly promising approaches (chromVAR-limma with critical adjustments, monaLisa and a combination of GC smooth quantile normalization and multivariate modeling). We further investigate the specific use of nucleosome-free fragments, the combination of top methods, and the impact of technical variation. Finally, we illustrate the use of the top methods on a novel dataset to characterize the impact on DNA accessibility of TRAnscription Factor TArgeting Chimeras (TRAFTAC), which can deplete TFs - in our case NFkB - at the protein level.",1.178899407389307e-25

The challenges in multi-omics data analysis lie in the complexity, high dimensionality, and heterogeneity of the data, which demands sophisticated computational tools and visualization methods for proper interpretation and visualization of multi-omics data. In this paper, we propose a novel method, termed Orthogonal Multimodality Integration and Clustering (OMIC), for analyzing CITE-seq. Our approach enables researchers to integrate multiple sources of information while accounting for the dependence among them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using CITE-seq data sets for cell clustering. Our results show that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. We conclude that our proposed OMIC method provides a powerful tool for multimodal data analysis that greatly improves the feasibility and reliability of integrated data.© 2024.

38559253,Optimizing Design of Genomics Studies for Clonal Evolution Analysis.,bioRxiv,"Genomic biotechnologies have seen rapid development over the past two decades, allowing for both the inference and modification of genetic and epigenetic information at the single cell level. While these tools present enormous potential for basic research, diagnostics, and treatment, they also raise difficult issues of how to design research studies to deploy these tools most effectively. In designing a study at the population or individual level, a researcher might combine several different sequencing modalities and sampling protocols, each with different utility, costs, and other tradeoffs. The central problem this paper attempts to address is then how one might create an optimal study design for a genomic analysis, with particular focus on studies involving somatic variation, typically for applications in cancer genomics. We pose the study design problem as a stochastic constrained nonlinear optimization problem and introduce a simulation-centered optimization procedure that iteratively optimizes the objective function using surrogate modeling combined with pattern and gradient search. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our procedure on diverse test cases to derive resource and study design allocations optimized for various objectives for the study of somatic cell populations.",5.670320948385524e-22
38714690,The genomic landscape of Vk*MYC myeloma highlights shared pathways of transformation between mice and humans.,Nat Commun,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by frequent MYC translocations. Sporadic MYC activation in the germinal center of genetically engineered Vk*MYC mice is sufficient to induce plasma cell tumors in which a variety of secondary mutations are spontaneously acquired and selected over time. Analysis of 119 Vk*MYC myeloma reveals recurrent copy number alterations, structural variations, chromothripsis, driver mutations, apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC) mutational activity, and a progressive decrease in immunoglobulin transcription that inversely correlates with proliferation. Moreover, we identify frequent insertional mutagenesis by endogenous retro-elements as a murine specific mechanism to activate NF-kB and IL6 signaling pathways shared with human MM. Despite the increased genomic complexity associated with progression, advanced tumors remain dependent on MYC. In summary, here we credential the Vk*MYC mouse as a unique resource to explore MM genomic evolution and describe a fully annotated collection of diverse and immortalized murine MM tumors.© 2024.

38693266,3D genomic mapping reveals multifocality of human pancreatic precancers.,Nature,"Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) are the most common precursors of pancreatic cancer, but their small size and inaccessibility in humans make them challenging to study1. Critically, the number, dimensions and connectivity of human PanINs remain largely unknown, precluding important insights into early cancer development. Here, we provide a microanatomical survey of human PanINs by analysing 46 large samples of grossly normal human pancreas with a machine-learning pipeline for quantitative 3D histological reconstruction at single-cell resolution. To elucidate genetic relationships between and within PanINs, we developed a workflow in which 3D modelling guides multi-region microdissection and targeted and whole-exome sequencing. From these samples, we calculated a mean burden of 13 PanINs per cm3and extrapolated that the normal intact adult pancreas harbours hundreds of PanINs, almost all with oncogenic KRAS hotspot mutations. We found that most PanINs originate as independent clones with distinct somatic mutation profiles. Some spatially continuous PanINs were found to contain multiple KRAS mutations; computational and in situ analyses demonstrated that different KRAS mutations localize to distinct cell subpopulations within these neoplasms, indicating their polyclonal origins. The extensive multifocality and genetic heterogeneity of PanINs raises important questions about mechanisms that drive precancer initiation and confer differential progression risk in the human pancreas. This detailed 3D genomic mapping of molecular alterations in human PanINs provides an empirical foundation for early detection and rational interception of pancreatic cancer.© 2024.

38605218,Human embryonic genetic mosaicism and its effects on development and disease.,Nat Rev Genet,"Nearly every mammalian cell division is accompanied by a mutational event that becomes fixed in a daughter cell. When carried forward to additional cell progeny, a clone of variant cells can emerge. As a result, mammals are complex mosaics of clones that are genetically distinct from one another. Recent high-throughput sequencing studies have revealed that mosaicism is common, clone sizes often increase with age and specific variants can affect tissue function and disease development. Variants that are acquired during early embryogenesis are shared by multiple cell types and can affect numerous tissues. Within tissues, variant clones compete, which can result in their expansion or elimination. Embryonic mosaicism has clinical implications for genetic disease severity and transmission but is likely an under-recognized phenomenon. To better understand its implications for mosaic individuals, it is essential to leverage research tools that can elucidate the mechanisms by which expanded embryonic variants influence development and disease.© 2024.

38495778,Bayesian Multi-View Clustering given complex inter-view structure.,F1000Res,"Multi-view datasets are becoming increasingly prevalent. These datasets consist of different modalities that provide complementary characterizations of the same underlying system. They can include heterogeneous types of information with complex relationships, varying degrees of missingness, and assorted sample sizes, as is often the case in multi-omic biological studies. Clustering multi-view data allows us to leverage different modalities to infer underlying systematic structure, but most existing approaches are limited to contexts in which entities are the same across views or have clear one-to-one relationships across data types with a common sample size. Many methods also make strong assumptions about the similarities of clusterings across views. We propose a Bayesian multi-view clustering approach (BMVC) which can handle the realities of multi-view datasets that often have complex relationships and diverse structure. BMVC incorporates known and complex many-to-many relationships between entities via a probabilistic graphical model that enables the joint inference of clusterings specific to each view, but where each view informs the others. Additionally, BMVC estimates the strength of the relationships between each pair of views, thus moderating the degree to which it imposes dependence constraints. We benchmarked BMVC on simulated data to show that it accurately estimates varying degrees of inter-view dependence when inter-view relationships are not limited to one-to-one correspondence. Next, we demonstrated its ability to capture visually interpretable inter-view structure in a public health survey of individuals and households in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria. Finally, we showed that BMVC clusters integrate the complex relationships between multi-omic profiles of breast cancer patient data, improving the biological homogeneity of clusters and elucidating hypotheses for functional biological mechanisms. We found that BMVC leverages complex inter-view structure to produce higher quality clusters than those generated by standard approaches. We also showed that BMVC is a valuable tool for real-world discovery and hypothesis generation.Copyright: © 2024 Shapiro BD and Battle A.",3.4879302005483595e-33

However, prospective cohort studies regarding the association of PBDE exposure with long-term health outcomes, particularly mortality, are lacking.To examine the association of environmental exposure to PBDEs with risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality.This nationally representative cohort study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003 to 2004 and linked mortality information through December 31, 2019. Adults aged 20 years or older with available data on PBDE measurements and mortality were included. Statistical analysis was performed from February 2022 to April 2023.PBDE analytes in serum samples were measured using solid phase extraction and isotope dilution gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry.All-cause mortality, cancer mortality, and cardiovascular mortality.This study included 1100 participants (mean [SE] age, 42.9 [0.6] years; proportion [SE] female, 51.8% [1.6%]; proportion [SE] Hispanic, 12.9% [2.7%]; proportion [SE] non-Hispanic Black, 10.5% [1.6%]; proportion [SE] non-Hispanic White, 70.8% [3.7%]; proportion [SE] other race and ethnicity, 5.8% [1.1%]). During 16 162 person-years of follow-up (median [IQR] follow-up, 15.8 [15.2-16.3] years; maximum follow-up, 17 years), 199 deaths occurred. Participants with higher serum PBDE levels were at higher risk for death. After adjustment for age, sex, and race and ethnicity, lifestyle and socioeconomic factors, and body mass index, participants with the highest tertile of serum PBDE levels had an approximately 300% increased risk of cancer mortality (HR, 4.09 [95% CI, 1.71-9.79]) compared with those with the lowest tertile of serum PBDE levels. No significant association of PBDE exposure with all-cause mortality (HR, 1.43 [95% CI, 0.98-2.07]) or cardiovascular mortality (HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.41-2.08]) was observed.In this nationally representative cohort study, PBDE exposure was significantly associated with an increased risk of cancer mortality.

38591094,Epigenetic modifications of placenta in women with gestational diabetes mellitus and their offspring.,World J Diabetes,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a pregnancy-related complication characterized by abnormal glucose metabolism in pregnant women and has an important impact on fetal development. As a bridge between the mother and the fetus, the placenta has nutrient transport functions, endocrine functions,etc., and can regulate placental nutrient transport and fetal growth and development according to maternal metabolic status. Only by means of placental transmission can changes in maternal hyperglycemia affect the fetus. There are many reports on the placental pathophysiological changes associated with GDM, the impacts of GDM on the growth and development of offspring, and the prevalence of GDM in offspring after birth. Placental epigenetic changes in GDM are involved in the programming of fetal development and are involved in the pathogenesis of later chronic diseases. This paper summarizes the effects of changes in placental nutrient transport function and hormone secretion levels due to maternal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on the development of offspring as well as the participation of changes in placental epigenetic modifications due to maternal hyperglycemia in intrauterine fetal programming to promote a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of placental epigenetic modifications on the development of offspring from patients with GDM.©The Author(s) 2024.

38664566,ISWI catalyzes nucleosome sliding in condensed nucleosome arrays.,Nat Struct Mol Biol,"How chromatin enzymes work in condensed chromatin and how they maintain diffusional mobility inside remains unexplored. Here we investigated these challenges using the Drosophila ISWI remodeling ATPase, which slides nucleosomes along DNA. Folding of chromatin fibers did not affect sliding in vitro. Catalytic rates were also comparable in- and outside of chromatin condensates. ISWI cross-links and thereby stiffens condensates, except when ATP hydrolysis is possible. Active hydrolysis is also required for ISWI's mobility in condensates. Energy from ATP hydrolysis therefore fuels ISWI's diffusion through chromatin and prevents ISWI from cross-linking chromatin. Molecular dynamics simulations of a 'monkey-bar' model in which ISWI grabs onto neighboring nucleosomes, then withdraws from one before rebinding another in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner, qualitatively agree with our data. We speculate that monkey-bar mechanisms could be shared with other chromatin factors and that changes in chromatin dynamics caused by mutations in remodelers could contribute to pathologies.© 2024.

38622120,Optogenetic control of mRNA condensation reveals an intimate link between condensate material properties and functions.,Nat Commun,"Biomolecular condensates, often assembled through phase transition mechanisms, play key roles in organizing diverse cellular activities. The material properties of condensates, ranging from liquid droplets to solid-like glasses or gels, are key features impacting the way resident components associate with one another. However, it remains unclear whether and how different material properties would influence specific cellular functions of condensates. Here, we combine optogenetic control of phase separation with single-molecule mRNA imaging to study relations between phase behaviors and functional performance of condensates. Using light-activated condensation, we show that sequestering target mRNAs into condensates causes translation inhibition. Orthogonal mRNA imaging reveals highly transient nature of interactions between individual mRNAs and condensates. Tuning condensate composition and material property towards more solid-like states leads to stronger translational repression, concomitant with a decrease in molecular mobility. We further demonstrate that β-actin mRNA sequestration in neurons suppresses spine enlargement during chemically induced long-term potentiation. Our work highlights how the material properties of condensates can modulate functions, a mechanism that may play a role in fine-tuning the output of condensate-driven cellular activities.© 2024.

As spatial genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic technologies gain traction, spatial computational models are predicted to become ever more necessary for making sense of complex clinical and experimental data sets, for predicting clinical outcomes, and for optimizing treatment strategies. Here we present a non-technical step by step guide to developing such a model from first principles. Stressing the importance of tailoring the model structure to that of the biological system, we describe methods of increasing complexity, from the basic Eden growth model up to off-lattice simulations with diffusible factors. We examine choices that unavoidably arise in model design, such as implementation, parameterization, visualization and reproducibility. Each topic is illustrated with examples drawn from recent research studies and state of the art modelling platforms. We emphasize the benefits of simpler models that aim to match the complexity of the phenomena of interest, rather than that of the entire biological system.

The software tools used to analyze omics data have reshaped the landscape of modern biology and become an essential component of biomedical research. These tools are themselves quite complex and often require the installation of other supporting software, libraries and/or databases. A researcher may also be using multiple different tools that require different versions of the same supporting materials. The increasing dependence of biomedical scientists on these powerful tools creates a need for easier installation and greater usability. Packaging and containerization are different approaches to satisfy this need by delivering omics tools already wrapped in additional software that makes the tools easier to install and use. In this systematic review, we describe and compare the features of prominent packaging and containerization platforms. We outline the challenges, advantages and limitations of each approach and some of the most widely used platforms from the perspectives of users, software developers and system administrators. We also propose principles to make the distribution of omics software more sustainable and robust to increase the reproducibility of biomedical and life science research.© 2024.

Here, we compared the performances of 11 SV callers: Delly, Manta, GridSS, Wham, Sniffles, Lumpy, SvABA, Canvas, CNVnator, MELT, and INSurVeyor. These SV callers have been recently published and have been widely employed for processing massive whole-genome sequencing datasets. We evaluated the accuracy, sequence depth, running time, and memory usage of the SV callers.Notably, several callers exhibited better calling performance for deletions than for duplications, inversions, and insertions. Among the SV callers, Manta identified deletion SVs with better performance and efficient computing resources, and both Manta and MELT demonstrated relatively good precision regarding calling insertions. We confirmed that the copy number variation callers, Canvas and CNVnator, exhibited better performance in identifying long duplications as they employ the read-depth approach. Finally, we also verified the genotypes inferred from each SV caller using a phased long-read assembly dataset, and Manta showed the highest concordance in terms of the deletions and insertions.Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the accuracy and computational efficiency of SV callers, thereby facilitating integrative analysis of SV profiles in diverse large-scale genomic datasets.© 2024.

In this study, an automated magnetic bead-based DNA extraction method and the required EDTA blood storage conditions as well as DNA and sequencing quality were evaluated for their suitability for repeat expansion detection with nanopore sequencing.DNA was extracted from EDTA blood, and subsequently, its concentration, purity, and integrity were assessed. DNA was then subjected to nanopore sequencing, and quality metrics of the obtained sequencing data were evaluated.DNA extracted from fresh EDTA blood as well as from cooled or frozen EDTA blood revealed high DNA integrity whereas storage at room temperature over 7 days had detrimental effects. After nanopore sequencing, the read length N50 values of approximately 9 kb were obtained, and based on adaptive sampling of samples with a known repeat expansion, repeat expansions up to 10 kb could be detected.The automated magnetic bead-based DNA extraction was sufficient to detect short tandem repeat expansions, omitting the need for high-molecular-weight DNA extraction methods. Therefore, DNA should be extracted either from fresh blood or from blood stored in cooled or frozen conditions. Consequently, this study may help other laboratories to evaluate their DNA extraction method regarding the suitability for detecting repeat expansions with nanopore sequencing.© 2024 The Authors.

38745153,Investigating the causal relationship of gut microbiota with GERD and BE: a bidirectional mendelian randomization.,BMC Genomics,"Gut microbiota(GM) have been proven associated with lots of gastrointestinal diseases, but its causal relationship with Gastroesophageal reflux disease(GERD) and Barrett's esophagus(BE) hasn't been explored. We aimed to uncover the causal relation between GM and GERD/BE and potential mediators by utilizing Mendelian Randomization(MR) analysis.Summary statistics of GM(comprising 301 bacteria taxa and 205 metabolism pathways) were extracted from MiBioGen Consortium(N = 18,340) and Dutch Microbiome Project(N = 7,738), GERD and BE from a multitrait meta-analysis(NGERD=602,604, NBE=56,429). Bidirectional two-sample MR analysis and linkage disequilibrium score regression(LDSC) were used to explore the genetic correlation between GM and GERD/BE. Mediation MR analysis was performed for the risk factors of GERD/BE, including Body mass index(BMI), weight, type 2 diabetes, major depressive disorder(MDD), smoking initiation, alcohol consumption, and dietary intake(including carbohydrate, sugar, fat, protein intake), to detect the potential mediators between GM and GERD/BE.11 bacterial taxa and 13 metabolism pathways were found associated with GERD, and 18 taxa and 5 pathways exhibited causal relationship with BE. Mediation MR analysis suggested weight and BMI played a crucial role in these relationships. LDSC identified 1 taxon and 4 metabolism pathways related to GERD, and 1 taxon related to BE. Specie Faecalibacterium prausnitzii had a suggestive impact on both GERD(OR = 1.087, 95%CI = 1.01-1.17) and BE(OR = 1.388, 95%CI = 1.03-1.86) and LDSC had determined their correlation. Reverse MR indicated that BE impacted 10 taxa and 4 pathways.This study established a causal link between gut microbiota and GERD/BE, and identified the probable mediators. It offers new insights into the role of gut microbiota in the development and progression of GERD and BE in the host.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.8772769205759986e-29
38725045,The potential association between metabolic disorders and pulmonary tuberculosis: a Mendelian randomization study.,Eur J Med Res,"Metabolic disorders (MetDs) have been demonstrated to be closely linked to numerous diseases. However, the precise association between MetDs and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) remains poorly understood.Summary statistics for exposure and outcomes from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for exposures and outcomes were obtained from the BioBank Japan Project (BBJ) Gene-exposure dataset. The 14 clinical factors were categorized into three groups: metabolic laboratory markers, blood pressure, and the MetS diagnostic factors. The causal relationship between metabolic factors and PTB were analyzed using two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR). Additionally, the direct effects on the risk of PTB were investigated through multivariable MR. The primary method employed was the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) model. The sensitivity of this MR analysis was evaluated using MR-Egger regression and the MR-PRESSO global test.According to the two-sample MR, HDL-C, HbA1c, TP, and DM were positively correlated with the incidence of active TB. According to the multivariable MR, HDL-C (IVW: OR 2.798, 95% CI 1.484-5.274, P = 0.001), LDL (IVW: OR 4.027, 95% CI 1.140-14.219, P = 0.03) and TG (IVW: OR 2.548, 95% CI 1.269-5.115, P = 0.009) were positively correlated with the occurrence of PTB. TC (OR 0.131, 95% CI 0.028-0.607, P = 0.009) was negatively correlated with the occurrence of PTB. We selected BMI, DM, HDL-C, SBP, and TG as the diagnostic factors for metabolic syndrome. DM (IVW, OR 1.219, 95% CI 1.040-1.429 P = 0.014) and HDL-C (IVW, OR 1.380, 95% CI 1.035-1.841, P = 0.028) were directly correlated with the occurrence of PTB.This MR study demonstrated that metabolic disorders, mainly hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, are associated with the incidence of active pulmonary tuberculosis.© 2024.

This study aimed to examine the potential causal connection between T2D and glycaemic traits (fasting glucose [FG] and glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] levels) as exposures to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in multi-ethnic populations. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with exposure to T2D, FG, and HbA1c were selected as instrumental variables with significance (p< 5.0 × 10-8) from the genome-wide association study (GWAS)-based meta-analysis data available from the BioBank Japan and the UK Biobank (UKB). The GWAS for POAG was obtained from the meta-analyses of Genetic Epidemiology Research in Adult Health and Aging and the UKB. A two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) study was performed to assess the causal estimates using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, and MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier test (MR-PRESSO). Significant causal associations of T2D (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.00-1.10],p= 0.031 in IVW; OR = 1.06, 95% CI = [1.01-1.11],p= 0.017 in MR-PRESSO) and FG levels (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = [1.02-1.38],p= 0.026 in IVW; OR = 1.17, 95% CI = [1.01-1.35],p= 0.041 in MR-PRESSO) with POAG were observed, but not in HbA1c (allp> 0.05). The potential causal relationship between T2D or FG and POAG highlights its role in the prevention of POAG. Further investigation is necessary to authenticate these findings.",3.204228360433407e-21

The study was conducted on a sample of 1498 women (358 BC; 1140 controls) who, depending on the presence/absence of obesity, were divided into two groups: obese (119 BC; 253 controls) and non-obese (239 BC; 887 controls). Genotyping of nine SHBG-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)-rs17496332PRMT6, rs780093GCKR, rs10454142PPP1R21, rs3779195BAIAP2L1, rs440837ZBTB10, rs7910927JMJD1C, rs4149056SLCO1B1, rs8023580NR2F2, and rs12150660SHBG-was executed, and the BC-risk impact of these loci was analyzed by logistic regression separately in each group of obese/non-obese women. We found that the BC-risk effect correlated by GWAS with the SHBG-level polymorphism rs10454142PPP1R21depends on the presence/absence of obesity. The SHBG-lowering allele C rs10454142PPP1R21has a risk value for BC in obese women (allelic model: CvsT, OR = 1.52, 95%CI = 1.10-2.11, and pperm= 0.013; additive model: CCvsTCvsTT, OR = 1.71, 95%CI = 1.15-2.62, and pperm= 0.011; dominant model: CC + TCvsTT, OR = 1.95, 95%CI = 1.13-3.37, and pperm= 0.017) and is not associated with the disease in women without obesity.

We conducted a Mendelian Randomization (MR) study to explore causal relationships between loneliness and isolation and multiple CVDs.Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with loneliness and isolation were identified from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 455,364 individuals of European ancestry in the IEU GWAS database. Summary data for 15 CVDs were also obtained from the IEU GWAS database. We used three MR methods including inverse variance weighting, MR-Egger, and weighted median estimation to assess the causal effect of exposure on outcomes. Cochran'sQtest and MR-Egger intercept test were used to evaluate the heterogeneity and pleiotropy.MR analysis showed that loneliness and isolation were significantly associated with essential hypertension (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.12), atherosclerotic heart disease (OR = 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02-1.06), myocardial infarction (OR = 1.02; 95% CI: 1-1.04) and angina (OR = 1.04; 95% CI =1.02-1.06).

A series of functional annotation and tissue-specific analysis were performed to determine the influence of pleiotropic genes. The heritability enrichment analysis was used to detect crucial immune cells and tissues. Finally, bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) methods were utilized to investigate the casual associations.Our research highlighted shared genetic mechanisms between seven autoimmune disorders and B-ALL. A total of 73 pleiotropic loci were identified at the genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10-8), 16 of which had strong evidence of colocalization. We demonstrated that several loci have been previously reported (e.g., 17q21) and discovered some novel loci (e.g., 10p12, 5p13). Further gene-level identified 194 unique pleiotropic genes, for example IKZF1, GATA3, IKZF3, GSDMB, and ORMDL3. Pathway analysis determined the key role of cellular response to cytokine stimulus, B cell activation, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. SNP-level and gene-level tissue enrichment suggested that crucial role pleiotropic mechanisms involved in the spleen, whole blood, and EBV-transformed lymphocytes. Also, hyprcoloc and stratified LD score regression analyses revealed that B cells at different developmental stages may be involved in mechanisms shared between two different diseases.

38590845,Association between basal metabolic rate and cardio-metabolic risk factors: Evidence from a Mendelian Randomization study.,Heliyon,"Cardio-metabolic risk factors play a crucial role in the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is a fundamental physiological parameter that affects energy expenditure and might contribute to variations in these risk factors. However, the exact relationship between BMR and cardio-metabolic risk factors has remained unclear.We employed Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to explore the association between BMR (N: 534,045) and various cardio-metabolic risk factors, including body mass index (BMI, N: 681,275), fasting glucose (N: 200,622), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (N = 403,943), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (N = 431,167), total cholesterol (N: 344,278), and triglycerides (N: 441,016), C-reactive protein (N: 436,939), waist circumference (N: 232,101), systolic blood pressure (N: 810,865), diastolic blood pressure (N: 810,865), glycated haemoglobin (N: 389,889), and N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (N: 21,758). We leveraged genetic variants strongly associated with BMR as instrumental variables to investigate potential causal relationships, with the primary analysis using the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method.Our MR analysis revealed compelling evidence of a causal link between BMR and specific cardio-metabolic risk factors. Specifically, genetically determined higher BMR was associated with an increased BMI (β = 0.7538, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6418 to 0.8659, p < 0.001), lower levels of HDL cholesterol (β = -0.3293, 95% CI: 0.4474 to -0.2111, p < 0.001), higher levels of triglycerides (β = 0.1472, 95% CI: 0.0370 to 0.2574, p = 0.0088), waist circumference (β = 0.4416, 95% CI: 0.2949 to 0.5883, p < 0.001), and glycated haemoglobin (β = 0.1037, 95% CI: 0.0080 to 0.1995, p = 0.0377). However, we did not observe any significant association between BMR and fasting glucose, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, or N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (all p-values>0.05).This MR study provides valuable insights into the relationship between BMR and cardio-metabolic risk factors.

Effective biomarkers and therapeutic interventions are warranted in aggressive thyroid malignancies. The transcription factor 19 (TCF19) gene has been implicated in conferring a malignant phenotype in cancers. However, its contribution to thyroid neoplasms remains unclear.In this study, we performed genome-wide and phenome-wide association studies to identify a potential causal relationship between TCF19 and thyroid cancer. Our analyses revealed significant associations between TCF19 and various autoimmune diseases and human cancers, including cervical cancer and autoimmune thyroiditis, with a particularly robust signal for the deleterious missense variation rs2073724 that is associated with thyroid function, hypothyroidism, and autoimmunity. Furthermore, functional assays and transcriptional profiling in thyroid cancer cells demonstrated that TCF19 regulates important biological processes, especially inflammatory and immune responses. We demonstrated that TCF19 could promote the progression of thyroid cancerin vitroandin vivoand the C>T variant of rs2073724 disrupted TCF19 protein binding to target gene promoters and their expression, thus reversing the effect of TCF19 protein.Taken together, these findings implicate TCF19 as a promising therapeutic target in aggressive thyroid malignancies and designate rs2073724 as a causal biomarker warranting further investigation in thyroid cancer.",6.326353897016572e-33

However, results have been inconsistent and causality remains to be established. We utilized two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate potential causal associations between CHB and CVD, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and ischemic stroke.The analysis was conducted through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), considering chronic hepatitis B as the exposure and cardiovascular disease as the endpoint. The primary method for evaluating causality in this analysis was the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) technique. Additionally, we employed the weighted median, MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and simple mode methods for supplementary analyses. Finally, heterogeneity tests, sensitivity analyses, and multiple effects analyses were conducted.In a random-effects IVW analysis, we found that genetic susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B was associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis [OR = 1.048, 95% CI (1.022-1.075),P = 3.08E-04], as well as an increased risk of coronary heart disease [OR = 1.039, 95% CI (1.006-1.072),P = 0.020]. However, it was found to be inversely correlated with ischemic stroke risk [OR = 0.972, 95% CI (0.957-0.988),P = 4.13E-04]. There was no evidence that chronic hepatitis B was associated with hypertension [OR = 1.021, 95% CI (0.994-1.049),P = 0.121].Our research indicates that chronic hepatitis B has a correlation with an elevated risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, while it is associated with a decreased risk of experiencing an ischemic stroke.© 2024 Wu, Xiong, Ran, Liu, Wu, Wang and Lv.",2.6518850301936896e-20

It is essential to understand the function of plasma metabolites in the development of MI and unravel its complex pathogenesis.This study employed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal relationships between plasma metabolites and MI risk. We used genetic instruments as proxies for plasma metabolites and MI and conducted MR analyses in both directions to assess the impact of metabolites on MI risk and vice versa. In addition, the large-scale genome-wide association studies datasets was used to identify genetic variants associated with plasma metabolite (1400 metabolites) and MI (20,917 individuals with MI and 440,906 individuals without MI) susceptibility. Inverse variance weighted was the primary method for estimating causal effects.

Furthermore, we also observed that the mentioned relationships were unaffected by horizontal pleiotropy (P> 0.05). On the contrary, MI did not lead to significant alterations in the levels of the aforementioned 14 plasma metabolites (P> 0.05 for each comparison).Our bidirectional MR study identified 14 plasma metabolites associated with the occurrence of MI, among which 13 plasma metabolites have not been reported previously.

38520496,The causal effect of inflammatory proteins and immune cell populations on diabetic nephropathy: evidence from Mendelian randomization.,Int Urol Nephrol,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the diabetic microvascular complications with complex pathophysiology, and exploring the landscape of immune dysregulation in DN is valuable for pathogenesis and disease treatment. We crystallized possible inflammatory exposures into 91 circulating inflammatory proteins and 109 blood immune cells; and assessed the causal relationship between inflammation and DN using Mendelian randomization (MR).Based on publicly available genetic data, we explored causal associations between inflammation and DN risk by two-sample MR analysis. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for 91 circulating inflammatory proteins, 109 immune cells absolute counts, and DN were acquired from the GWAS Catalog. Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) was the main MR method, while MR-Egger and MR-pleiotropy residuals and outliers (MR-PRESSO) were utilized for sensitivity analysis. Cochrane's Q was used to test for heterogeneity. The leave-one-out method ensured the stability of the MR results.This study revealed that higher levels of TNF-related activation-induced cytokine and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14 were possibly associated with the increased risk of DN according to the IVW approach, with estimated odds ratios (OR) of 1.287 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.051 to 1.577, P = 0.015) and 1.249 (95% CI 1.018 to 1.532, P = 0.033). Five immune cell traits were identified that might be linked to increased DN risk, including the higher absolute counts of HLA DR+natural killer cell (OR = 1.248, 95% CI 1.055 to 1.476, P = 0.010), IgD+CD38+B cell (OR = 1.148, 95% CI 1.033 to 1.276, P = 0.010), CD25++CD8+T cell (OR = 1.159, 95% CI 1.032 to 1.302, P = 0.013), CD4-CD8-T cell (OR = 1.226, 95% CI 1.032 to 1.457, P = 0.020), and IgD-CD38-B cell (OR = 1.182, 95% CI 1.009 to 1.386, P = 0.039). In addition, elevated levels of interleukin-1 alpha (OR = 0.712, 95% CI 0.514 to 0.984, P = 0.040) and unswitched memory B cell (OR = 0.797, 95% CI 0.651 to 0.974, P = 0.027) may reduce the risk of developing DN.We identified inflammation-related exposures that may be associated with the risk of DN at the level of genetic prediction, which contributes to a better understanding of the etiologic of DN and facilitates the development of targeted therapies for DN.© 2024.

38493444,Integrative regulation of hLMR1 by dietary and genetic factors in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hyperlipidemia.,Hum Genet,"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes represent a large class of transcripts that are widely expressed across species. As most human lncRNAs are non-conserved, we recently employed a unique humanized liver mouse model to study lncRNAs expressed in human livers. We identified a human hepatocyte-specific lncRNA, hLMR1 (human lncRNA metabolic regulator 1), which is induced by feeding and promotes hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) found that several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the hLMR1 gene locus are associated with blood lipids and markers of liver damage. These results suggest that dietary and genetic factors may regulate hLMR1 to affect disease progression. In this study, we first screened for nutritional/hormonal factors and found that hLMR1 was robustly induced by insulin/glucose in cultured human hepatocytes, and this induction is dependent on the transcription factor SREBP1. We then tested if GWAS SNPs genetically linked to hLMR1 could regulate hLMR1 expression. We found that DNA sequences flanking rs9653945, a SNP from the last exon of the hLMR1 gene, functions as an enhancer that can be robustly activated by SREBP1c depending on the presence of rs9653945 major allele (G). We further performed CRISPR base editing in human HepG2 cells and found that rs9653945 major (G) to minor (A) allele modification resulted in blunted insulin/glucose-induced expression of hLMR1. Finally, we performed genotyping and gene expression analyses using a published human NAFLD RNA-seq dataset and found that individuals homozygous for rs9653945-G have a higher expression of hLMR1 and risk of NAFLD. Taken together, our data support a model that rs9653945-G predisposes individuals to insulin/glucose-induced hLMR1, contributing to the development of hyperlipidemia and NAFLD.© 2024.

38627848,"PheSeq, a Bayesian deep learning model to enhance and interpret the gene-disease association studies.",Genome Med,"Despite the abundance of genotype-phenotype association studies, the resulting association outcomes often lack robustness and interpretations. To address these challenges, we introduce PheSeq, a Bayesian deep learning model that enhances and interprets association studies through the integration and perception of phenotype descriptions. By implementing the PheSeq model in three case studies on Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, and lung cancer, we identify 1024 priority genes for Alzheimer's disease and 818 and 566 genes for breast cancer and lung cancer, respectively. Benefiting from data fusion, these findings represent moderate positive rates, high recall rates, and interpretation in gene-disease association studies.© 2024.

38508188,Epigenomic tomography for probing spatially defined chromatin state in the brain.,Cell Rep Methods,"Spatially resolved epigenomic profiling is critical for understanding biology in the mammalian brain. Single-cell spatial epigenomic assays were developed recently for this purpose, but they remain costly and labor intensive for examining brain tissues across substantial dimensions and surveying a collection of brain samples. Here, we demonstrate an approach, epigenomic tomography, that maps spatial epigenomes of mouse brain at the scale of centimeters. We individually profiled neuronal and glial fractions of mouse neocortex slices with 0.5 mm thickness. Tri-methylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) or acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) features across these slices were grouped into clusters based on their spatial variation patterns to form epigenomic brain maps. As a proof of principle, our approach reveals striking dynamics in the frontal cortex due to kainic-acid-induced seizure, linked with transmembrane ion transporters, exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, and secretion of neurotransmitters. Epigenomic tomography provides a powerful and cost-effective tool for characterizing brain disorders based on the spatial epigenome.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

A popular approach partitions data into manageable subsets via hierarchical clustering, but objective methods to determine the appropriate classification granularity are missing. We recently introduced a technique to systematically identify when to stop subdividing clusters based on the fundamental principle that cells must differ more between than within clusters. Here we present the corresponding protocol to classify cellular datasets by combining data-driven unsupervised hierarchical clustering with statistical testing. These general-purpose functions are applicable to any cellular dataset that can be organized as two-dimensional matrices of numerical values, including molecular, physiological, and anatomical datasets. We demonstrate the protocol using cellular data from the Janelia MouseLight project to characterize morphological aspects of neurons.",1.4682012338093946e-19
38550423,Evaluation of Cellular Changes and Immunohistochemistry Expression of p53 and p16 in the Oral Mucosa Among Saudi Smokers.,Cureus,"Smoking is a well-known risk factor for various health problems, including oral cancer. P16 and P53 proteins are involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation, and their expression levels can provide insights into cellular health.This study aims to evaluate the cellular changes and immunohistochemistry expression of p53 and p16 in the oral mucosa among Saudi smokers.In a cross-sectional study obtained by scraping the buccal mucosa, 1000 samples were collected from 2022 to 2023. All of the study's participants were Saudi citizens of both genders. Seven hundred cigarette smokers and 300 nonsmokers made up the controls, using two sampling techniques: initially purposive and then snowball sampling. The materials were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for P16 and P53 protein overexpression. The samples were scored based on the percentage of positively stained cells and staining intensity. The data were analyzed using SPSS, and categorical variables were identified as frequencies and percentages using the chi-squared test; a value of (P<0.05) was considered significant.Cigarette smokers demonstrate significantly higher rates of cytological inflammation, reverse cytological infection, atypia, and binucleated/multinucleated cells compared to nonsmokers, with an overall abnormal result rate of 46% versus 18.7%, respectively (P=0.024). The study found higher P53 and P16 expression among smokers (7.14% and 2.14%, respectively) compared to nonsmokers (0.1% and 0.33%) (P=0.038). No significant differences were observed in P53/P16 expression across age groups (P=0.72) or between male and female participants (P=0.25).These findings highlight the detrimental effects of smoking on cellular health and reinforce the importance of smoking cessation in reducing the risk of developing cytological abnormalities and associated diseases. These results highlight the association of smoking with increased biomarker expression, emphasizing its relevance in understanding oral health risks.Copyright © 2024, Elmahdi et al.",1.505137456114272e-25
38741163,Development of a machine learning-based model to predict prognosis of alpha-fetoprotein-positive hepatocellular carcinoma.,J Transl Med,"Patients with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have aggressive biological behavior and poor prognosis. Therefore, survival time is one of the greatest concerns for patients with AFP-positive HCC. This study aimed to demonstrate the utilization of six machine learning (ML)-based prognostic models to predict overall survival of patients with AFP-positive HCC.Data on patients with AFP-positive HCC were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Six ML algorithms (extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost], logistic regression [LR], support vector machine [SVM], random forest [RF], K-nearest neighbor [KNN], and decision tree [ID3]) were used to develop the prognostic models of patients with AFP-positive HCC at one year, three years, and five years. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), confusion matrix, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the model.A total of 2,038 patients with AFP-positive HCC were included for analysis. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 60.7%, 28.9%, and 14.3%, respectively. Seventeen features regarding demographics and clinicopathology were included in six ML algorithms to generate a prognostic model. The XGBoost model showed the best performance in predicting survival at 1-year (train set: AUC = 0.771; test set: AUC = 0.782), 3-year (train set: AUC = 0.763; test set: AUC = 0.749) and 5-year (train set: AUC = 0.807; test set: AUC = 0.740). Furthermore, for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival prediction, the accuracy in the training and test sets was 0.709 and 0.726, 0.721 and 0.726, and 0.778 and 0.784 for the XGBoost model, respectively. Calibration curves and DCA exhibited good predictive performance as well.The XGBoost model exhibited good predictive performance, which may provide physicians with an effective tool for early medical intervention and improve the survival of patients.© 2024.

38724944,Automated segmentation and volume prediction in pediatric Wilms' tumor CT using nnu-net.,BMC Pediatr,"Radiologic volumetric evaluation of Wilms' tumor (WT) is an important indicator to guide treatment decisions. However, due to the heterogeneity of the tumors, radiologists have main-guard differences in diagnosis that can lead to misdiagnosis and poor treatment. The aim of this study was to explore whether CT-based outlining of WT foci can be automated using deep learning.We included CT intravenous phase images of 105 patients with WT and double-blind outlining of lesions by two radiologists. Then, we trained an automatic segmentation model using nnUnet. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) were used to assess the performance. Next, we optimized the automatic segmentation results based on the ratio of the three-dimensional diameter of the lesion to improve the performance of volumetric assessment.The DSC and HD95was 0.83 ± 0.22 and 10.50 ± 8.98 mm. The absolute difference and percentage difference in tumor size was 72.27 ± 134.84 cm3and 21.08% ± 30.46%. After optimization according to our method, it decreased to 40.22 ± 96.06 cm3and 10.16% ± 9.70%.We introduce a novel method that enhances the accuracy of predicting WT volume by integrating AI automated outlining and 3D tumor diameters. This approach surpasses the accuracy of using AI outcomes alone and has the potential to enhance the clinical evaluation of pediatric patients with WT. By intertwining AI outcomes with clinical data, this method becomes more interpretive and offers promising applications beyond Wilms tumor, extending to other pediatric diseases.© 2024.

38539231,Deep learning in cancer genomics and histopathology.,Genome Med,"Histopathology and genomic profiling are cornerstones of precision oncology and are routinely obtained for patients with cancer. Traditionally, histopathology slides are manually reviewed by highly trained pathologists. Genomic data, on the other hand, is evaluated by engineered computational pipelines. In both applications, the advent of modern artificial intelligence methods, specifically machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have opened up a fundamentally new way of extracting actionable insights from raw data, which could augment and potentially replace some aspects of traditional evaluation workflows. In this review, we summarize current and emerging applications of DL in histopathology and genomics, including basic diagnostic as well as advanced prognostic tasks. Based on a growing body of evidence, we suggest that DL could be the groundwork for a new kind of workflow in oncology and cancer research. However, we also point out that DL models can have biases and other flaws that users in healthcare and research need to know about, and we propose ways to address them.© 2024.

This study developed a prognostic model using MTRGs to predict overall survival (OS) in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), aiming for personalized therapy. Analysing 14 MTRGs like ISCU and NDUFA11 through techniques such as univariate Cox regression, we found that a low mitochondrial (MT) score is associated with better survival, while a high MT score predicts poorer outcomes. The TME score, particularly influenced by CD8 T cells, also correlates with prognosis, with a high score indicating favourable outcomes. The interplay between MT and TME subtypes revealed that the best prognosis is seen in patients with a low MT and high TME score. Our findings highlight the role of MTRGs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cervical cancer, offering a novel approach to improving patient outcomes through a more nuanced understanding of mitochondrial function and immune interactions within the TME. This model presents a promising avenue for enhancing the precision of prognostic assessments in CESC.© 2024 The Authors.

This paper explores the dynamic landscape of personalized medicine as applied to HNSCC, encompassing both current developments and future prospects.The integration of personalized medicine strategies into HNSCC diagnosis is driven by the utilization of genetic data and biomarkers. Epigenetic biomarkers, which reflect modifications to DNA that can influence gene expression, have emerged as valuable indicators for early detection and risk assessment. Treatment approaches within the personalized medicine framework are equally promising. Immunotherapy, gene silencing, and editing techniques, including RNA interference and CRISPR/Cas9, offer innovative means to modulate gene expression and correct genetic aberrations driving HNSCC. The integration of stem cell research with personalized medicine presents opportunities for tailored regenerative approaches. The synergy between personalized medicine and technological advancements is exemplified by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications.

38658544,Emergence of enhancers at late DNA replicating regions.,Nat Commun,"Enhancers are fast-evolving genomic sequences that control spatiotemporal gene expression patterns. By examining enhancer turnover across mammalian species and in multiple tissue types, we uncover a relationship between the emergence of enhancers and genome organization as a function of germline DNA replication time. While enhancers are most abundant in euchromatic regions, enhancers emerge almost twice as often in late compared to early germline replicating regions, independent of transposable elements. Using a deep learning sequence model, we demonstrate that new enhancers are enriched for mutations that alter transcription factor (TF) binding. Recently evolved enhancers appear to be mostly neutrally evolving and enriched in eQTLs. They also show more tissue specificity than conserved enhancers, and the TFs that bind to these elements, as inferred by binding sequences, also show increased tissue-specific gene expression. We find a similar relationship with DNA replication time in cancer, suggesting that these observations may be time-invariant principles of genome evolution. Our work underscores that genome organization has a profound impact in shaping mammalian gene regulation.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.135550261292687e-23

However, concurrently detecting multiple types of modifications in a single DRS sample remains a challenge. Here, we develop TandemMod, a transferable deep learning framework capable of detecting multiple types of RNA modifications in single DRS data. To train high-performance TandemMod models, we generate in vitro epitranscriptome datasets from cDNA libraries, containing thousands of transcripts labeled with various types of RNA modifications. We validate the performance of TandemMod on both in vitro transcripts and in vivo human cell lines, confirming its high accuracy for profiling m6A and m5C modification sites. Furthermore, we perform transfer learning for identifying other modifications such as m7G, Ψ, and inosine, significantly reducing training data size and running time without compromising performance. Finally, we apply TandemMod to identify 3 types of RNA modifications in rice grown in different environments, demonstrating its applicability across species and conditions. In summary, we provide a resource with ground-truth labels that can serve as benchmark datasets for nanopore-based modification identification methods, and TandemMod for identifying diverse RNA modifications using a single DRS sample.© 2024.

While next-generation sequencing (NGS), which uses short reads, has transformed cancer research and diagnostics, it is limited by read length. Third-generation sequencing (TGS), led by the Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies platforms, employs long-read sequences, which have marked a paradigm shift in cancer research. Cancer genomes often harbour complex events, and TGS, with its ability to span large genomic regions, has facilitated their characterisation, providing a better understanding of how complex rearrangements affect cancer initiation and progression. TGS has also characterised the entire transcriptome of various cancers, revealing cancer-associated isoforms that could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Furthermore, TGS has advanced cancer research by improving genome assemblies, detecting complex variants, and providing a more complete picture of transcriptomes and epigenomes. This review focuses on TGS and its growing role in cancer research. We investigate its advantages and limitations, providing a rigorous scientific analysis of its use in detecting previously hidden aberrations missed by NGS.

Recent data show that the distinctness of global transcriptional responses to the two IFN types is not apparent when comparing their immediate effects. By analyzing nascent transcripts induced by IFN-I or IFNγ over a period of 48 h, we now show that the distinctiveness of the transcriptomes emerges over time and is based on differential employment of the ISGF3 complex as well as of the second-tier transcription factor IRF1. The distinct transcriptional properties of ISGF3 and IRF1 correspond with a largely diverse nuclear protein interactome. Mechanistically, we describe the specific input of ISGF3 and IRF1 into enhancer activation and the regulation of chromatin accessibility at interferon-stimulated genes (ISG). We further report differences between the IFN types in altering RNA polymerase II pausing at ISG 5' ends.

We identified regions of nascent expression of these lincRNA in 16 human cell lines using Bru-seq techniques, and found distinctly regulated patterns of PROMPT, eRNA, and RT transcription using the diverse biochemical approaches in the ENCODE4 deeply profiled cell lines collection. Transcription of these lincRNAs was influenced by sequence-specific features and the local or 3D chromatin landscape. However, these sequence and chromatin features do not describe the full spectrum of lincRNA expression variability we identify, highlighting the complexity of their regulation.

The DNA- and RNA-binding transcription factor CTCF together with the cohesin complex serve as major organizers of chromatin architecture. Cellular differentiation is driven by temporally and spatially coordinated gene expression that requires chromatin changes of individual loci of various complexities. Lens differentiation represents an advantageous system to probe transcriptional mechanisms underlying tissue-specific gene expression including high transcriptional outputs of individual crystallin genes until the mature lens fiber cells degrade their nuclei.Chromatin organization between mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, newborn (P0.5) lens epithelium and fiber cells were analyzed using Hi-C. Localization of CTCF in both lens chromatins was determined by ChIP-seq and compared with ES cells. Quantitative analyses show major differences between number and size of TADs and chromatin loop size between these three cell types. In depth analyses show similarities between lens samples exemplified by overlaps between compartments A and B. Lens epithelium-specific CTCF peaks are found in mostly methylated genomic regions while lens fiber-specific and shared peaks occur mostly within unmethylated DNA regions. Major differences in TADs and loops are illustrated at the ~ 500 kb Pax6 locus, encoding the critical lens regulatory transcription factor and within a larger ~ 15 Mb WAGR locus, containing Pax6 and other loci linked to human congenital diseases. Lens and ES cell Hi-C data (TADs and loops) together with ATAC-seq, CTCF, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and ENCODE cis-regulatory sites are shown in detail for the Pax6, Sox1 and Hif1a loci, multiple crystallin genes and other important loci required for lens morphogenesis. The majority of crystallin loci are marked by unexpectedly high CTCF-binding across their transcribed regions.Our study has generated the first data on 3-dimensional (3D) nuclear organization in lens epithelium and lens fibers and directly compared these data with ES cells.

Open chromatin regions (OCRs) enriched in neurons, compared to whole bodies, drove transgene expression preferentially in subsets of neurons. A second round of ATAC-seq from these specific neuron subsets revealed additional enriched OCR2s that further restricted transgene expression within the chosen neuron subset.

Despite advances in medical technologies, screening methods, and public awareness, gastric cancer remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early gastric cancer frequently does not present with characteristic symptoms, while advanced stage disease is characterized by a dismal prognosis. As such, early screening in gastric cancer is of great importance. In recent years, advances have been made globally in both clinical and basic research for the screening of early gastric cancer. The current predominant screening methods for early gastric cancer include imaging screening, endoscopic screening and serum biomarker screening. Imaging screening encompasses upper gastrointestinal barium meal, multidimensional spiral computed tomography (MDCT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonography. Endoscopic screening methods include white light endoscopy, chromoendoscopy, computed virtual chromoendoscopy, and other endoscopic techniques like endocytoscopy, confocal laser endomicroscopy, optical coherence tomography and so on. Biomarkers screening involves the assessment of conventional biomarkers such as CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 as well as more emerging biomarkers such as peptides (PG, G-17, GCAA, TAAs and others), DNA (cfDNA, DNA methylation, MSI), noncoding RNA (miRNA, lncRNA, circRNA, and tsRNA) and others.

In this study, we identified CXCL4 by a 4D data-independent acquisition-based quantitative proteomics assay of serum EVs-derived proteins in 40 individuals and subsequently analyzed serum EVs-derived CXCL4 levels by ELISA in 2 cohorts of 749 individuals. The results revealed that EVs-derived CXCL4 levels were dramatically elevated in CRC patients than in benign colorectal polyp patients or healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that EVs-derived CXCL4 exhibited superior diagnostic performance with area under the curve of 0.948 in the training cohort. Additionally, CXCL4 could effectively distinguish CRC in stage I/II from HC. Notably, CRC patients with high levels of EVs-derived CXCL4 have shorter 2-year progression-free survival than those with low levels.

The expanded production function is used in this investigation; this function considers not only labor but also financial resources. This study investigates whether or not a rise in energy demand is associated with a healthy economy. Human capital, in addition to material and labor resources, is taken into account by this operation. One of the first studies to adopt a multivariate method and add human capital was undertaken on the energy-growth nexus. Using the panel unit root and cointegration tests, this study confirms the existence of a long-run cointegrating connection between these variables. These studies recognize the presence of cross-sectional interdependence, according to specific reports. The significance of considering the interconnection of various countries is confirmed by comparing estimates from panel heterogeneous fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) models with those from unceasingly efficient and fully modified models. Nonetheless, the bootstrap panel Granger causality test findings demonstrate that economic growth is a causal factor in rising energy consumption in the region, indicating that the relationship is not constant across countries.© 2024 The Author.",1.3553722521753985e-23
38737656,Detecting colorectal cancer using genetic and epigenetic biomarkers: screening and diagnosis.,J Med Life,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most frequent types of cancer, with high incidence rates and mortality globally. The extended timeframe for developing CRC allows for the potential screening and early identification of the disease. Furthermore, studies have shown that survival rates for patients with cancer are increased when diagnoses are made at earlier stages. Recent research suggests that the development of CRC, including its precancerous lesion, is influenced not only by genetic factors but also by epigenetic variables. Studies suggest epigenetics plays a significant role in cancer development, particularly CRC. While this approach is still in its early stages and faces challenges due to the variability of CRC, it shows promise as a potential method for understanding and addressing the disease. This review examined the current evidence supporting genetic and epigenetic biomarkers for screening and diagnosis. In addition, we also discussed the feasibility of translating these methodologies into clinical settings. Several markers show promising potential, including the methylation of vimentin (VIM), syndecan-2 (SDC2), and septin 9 (SEPT9).

Previous research into the meningioma histological appearance, genetic markers, transcriptome and epigenetic landscape has revealed that benign meningiomas significantly differ in their glucose metabolism compared to aggressive lesions. However, a correlation between the systemic glucose metabolism and the metabolism of the tumor hasn't yet been found. We hypothesized that chronic levels of glycaemia (approximated with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)) are different in patients with aggressive and benign meningiomas. The study encompassed 71 patients with de novo intracranial meningiomas, operated on in three European hospitals, two in Croatia and one in Spain. Our results show that patients with WHO grade 2 meningiomas had significantly higher HbA1c values compared to patients with grade 1 lesions (P = 0.0290). We also found a significant number of patients (19/71; 26.7%) being hyperglycemic, harboring all the risks that such a condition entails. Finally, we found a significant correlation between our patients' age and their preoperative HbA1c levels (P = 0.0008, ρ(rho) = 0.388), suggesting that older meningioma patients are at a higher risk of having their glycaemia severely dysregulated. These findings are especially important considering the current routine and wide-spread use of corticosteroids as anti-edematous treatment. Further research in this area could lead to better understanding of meningiomas and have immediate clinical impact.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.319990453135815e-29
38714869,STR mutations on chromosome 15q cause thyrotropin resistance by activating a primate-specific enhancer of MIR7-2/MIR1179.,Nat Genet,"Thyrotropin (TSH) is the master regulator of thyroid gland growth and function. Resistance to TSH (RTSH) describes conditions with reduced sensitivity to TSH. Dominantly inherited RTSH has been linked to a locus on chromosome 15q, but its genetic basis has remained elusive. Here we show that non-coding mutations in a (TTTG)4short tandem repeat (STR) underlie dominantly inherited RTSH in all 82 affected participants from 12 unrelated families. The STR is contained in a primate-specific Alu retrotransposon with thyroid-specific cis-regulatory chromatin features. Fiber-seq and RNA-seq studies revealed that the mutant STR activates a thyroid-specific enhancer cluster, leading to haplotype-specific upregulation of the bicistronic MIR7-2/MIR1179 locus 35 kb downstream and overexpression of its microRNA products in the participants' thyrocytes. An imbalance in signaling pathways targeted by these micro-RNAs provides a working model for this cause of RTSH. This finding broadens our current knowledge of genetic defects altering pituitary-thyroid feedback regulation.© 2024.

38714868,Functional variants in a TTTG microsatellite on 15q26.1 cause familial nonautoimmune thyroid abnormalities.,Nat Genet,"Insufficient thyroid hormone production in newborns is referred to as congenital hypothyroidism. Multinodular goiter (MNG), characterized by an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple nodules, is usually seen in adults and is recognized as a separate disorder from congenital hypothyroidism. Here we performed a linkage analysis of a family with both nongoitrous congenital hypothyroidism and MNG and identified a signal at 15q26.1. Follow-up analyses with whole-genome sequencing and genetic screening in congenital hypothyroidism and MNG cohorts showed that changes in a noncoding TTTG microsatellite on 15q26.1 were frequently observed in congenital hypothyroidism (137 in 989) and MNG (3 in 33) compared with controls (3 in 38,722). Characterization of the noncoding variants with epigenomic data and in vitro experiments suggested that the microsatellite is located in a thyroid-specific transcriptional repressor, and its activity is disrupted by the variants. Collectively, we presented genetic evidence linking nongoitrous congenital hypothyroidism and MNG, providing unique insights into thyroid abnormalities.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.0993855769333668e-20

However, current single-cell methods suffer from limited throughput and high costs. Here, we present a novel technique called scifi-ATAC-seq, single-cell combinatorial fluidic indexing ATAC-sequencing, which combines a barcoded Tn5 pre-indexing step with droplet-based single-cell ATAC-seq using the 10X Genomics platform. With scifi-ATAC-seq, up to 200,000 nuclei across multiple samples can be indexed in a single emulsion reaction, representing an approximately 20-fold increase in throughput compared to the standard 10X Genomics workflow.© 2024.

38620018,Exploring perspectives and insights of experienced voyagers on human health and Polynesian oceanic voyaging: A qualitative study.,PLoS One,"The Worldwide Voyage (WWV) was a 3-year (2014-2017) open-ocean voyage to circumnavigate the world using Indigenous knowledge and navigational skills aboard Hōkūle'a, a traditionally designed Native Hawaiian (NH) voyaging canoe (wa'a kaulua). Each WWV segment included experienced crew and leadership who were recognized by their voyaging peers as highly experienced in Polynesian oceanic voyaging. This study explored the perceptions and insights of WWV-experienced ocean voyagers on the interconnection between human health and oceanic voyaging.A constructivist approach with a storytelling-based moderator guide was used to conduct focus groups and informant interviews of experienced crew and voyaging leadership. Participants were interviewed and recorded transcripts were analyzed using content analysis. Triangulation of analysis included secondary thematic review by two independent NH cultural practitioners and participant member checking. Purposive sampling was used to enroll 34 of 66 eligible highly experienced voyagers (leadership n = 6; crew n = 28) in 5 focus groups and 4 informant interviews.Six themes emerged: 1) Indigenous context (spiritual and natural environment); 2) Importance of relationships and community; 3) Description of life on the canoe; 4) Holistic health; 5) Mindfulness, stress reduction and emotional health; and 6) Opportunities for intervention. Themes 1-5 were inductive and intricately interrelated, and theme 6 was deductive in that it directly resulted from a moderator guide question. Theme 6 offers strategies to improve the impact of voyaging and health well beyond the physical voyage with recommendations for improved transition back to land and developing a wa'a community context, which reflects a traditional voyaging experience.Polynesian oceanic voyaging is strongly perceived as a positive and transformative holistic-health-promoting experience.Recommendations to promote generalizable health benefits of a voyaging lifestyle offers a promising and culturally grounded approach warranting future studies to understand mechanism and potential impact for improving health inequities.Copyright: © 2024 Mau et al.

Currently, no standard of care is available and there remains a dire need for new therapeutics. Most patients harbor the fusion oncogene DNAJB1-PRKACA (DP fusion), but clinical inhibitors are not yet developed and it is critical to identify downstream mediators of FLC pathogenesis. Here, we identify long noncoding RNA LINC00473 among the most highly upregulated genes in FLC tumors and determine that it is strongly suppressed by RNAi-mediated inhibition of the DP fusion in FLC tumor epithelial cells. We show by loss- and gain-of-function studies that LINC00473 suppresses apoptosis, increases the expression of FLC marker genes, and promotes FLC growth in cell-based and in vivo disease models. Mechanistically, LINC00473 plays an important role in promoting glycolysis and altering mitochondrial activity. Specifically, LINC00473 knockdown leads to increased spare respiratory capacity, which indicates mitochondrial fitness. Overall, we propose that LINC00473 could be a viable target for this devastating disease.Copyright: © 2024 Ma et al.

38627634,Inference of genomic landscapes using ordered Hidden Markov Models with emission densities (oHMMed).,BMC Bioinformatics,"Genomes are inherently inhomogeneous, with features such as base composition, recombination, gene density, and gene expression varying along chromosomes. Evolutionary, biological, and biomedical analyses aim to quantify this variation, account for it during inference procedures, and ultimately determine the causal processes behind it. Since sequential observations along chromosomes are not independent, it is unsurprising that autocorrelation patterns have been observed e.g., in human base composition. In this article, we develop a class of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) called oHMMed (ordered HMM with emission densities, the corresponding R package of the same name is available on CRAN): They identify the number of comparably homogeneous regions within autocorrelated observed sequences. These are modelled as discrete hidden states; the observed data points are realisations of continuous probability distributions with state-specific means that enable ordering of these distributions. The observed sequence is labelled according to the hidden states, permitting only neighbouring states that are also neighbours within the ordering of their associated distributions. The parameters that characterise these state-specific distributions are inferred.We apply our oHMMed algorithms to the proportion of G and C bases (modelled as a mixture of normal distributions) and the number of genes (modelled as a mixture of poisson-gamma distributions) in windows along the human, mouse, and fruit fly genomes. This results in a partitioning of the genomes into regions by statistically distinguishable averages of these features, and in a characterisation of their continuous patterns of variation. In regard to the genomic G and C proportion, this latter result distinguishes oHMMed from segmentation algorithms based in isochore or compositional domain theory. We further use oHMMed to conduct a detailed analysis of variation of chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and epigenetic markers H3K27ac and H3K27me3 (modelled as a mixture of poisson-gamma distributions) along the human chromosome 1 and their correlations.Our algorithms provide a biologically assumption free approach to characterising genomic landscapes shaped by continuous, autocorrelated patterns of variation. Despite this, the resulting genome segmentation enables extraction of compositionally distinct regions for further downstream analyses.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.8459872857056358e-33
38551497,Subpopulation commensalism promotes Rac1-dependent invasion of single cells via laminin-332.,J Cell Biol,"Phenotypic heterogeneity poses a significant hurdle for cancer treatment but is under-characterized in the context of tumor invasion. Amidst the range of phenotypic heterogeneity across solid tumor types, collectively invading cells and single cells have been extensively characterized as independent modes of invasion, but their intercellular interactions have rarely been explored. Here, we isolated collectively invading cells and single cells from the heterogeneous 4T1 cell line and observed extensive transcriptional and epigenetic diversity across these subpopulations. By integrating these datasets, we identified laminin-332 as a protein complex exclusively secreted by collectively invading cells. Live-cell imaging revealed that laminin-332 derived from collectively invading cells increased the velocity and directionality of single cells. Despite collectively invading and single cells having similar expression of the integrin α6β4 dimer, single cells demonstrated higher Rac1 activation upon laminin-332 binding to integrin α6β4. This mechanism suggests a novel commensal relationship between collectively invading and single cells, wherein collectively invading cells promote the invasive potential of single cells through a laminin-332/Rac1 axis.© 2024 Yoon et al.",1.3793417056723099e-39
38720247,A comparison of RNA-Seq data preprocessing pipelines for transcriptomic predictions across independent studies.,BMC Bioinformatics,"RNA sequencing combined with machine learning techniques has provided a modern approach to the molecular classification of cancer. Class predictors, reflecting the disease class, can be constructed for known tissue types using the gene expression measurements extracted from cancer patients. One challenge of current cancer predictors is that they often have suboptimal performance estimates when integrating molecular datasets generated from different labs. Often, the quality of the data is variable, procured differently, and contains unwanted noise hampering the ability of a predictive model to extract useful information. Data preprocessing methods can be applied in attempts to reduce these systematic variations and harmonize the datasets before they are used to build a machine learning model for resolving tissue of origins.We aimed to investigate the impact of data preprocessing steps-focusing on normalization, batch effect correction, and data scaling-through trial and comparison. Our goal was to improve the cross-study predictions of tissue of origin for common cancers on large-scale RNA-Seq datasets derived from thousands of patients and over a dozen tumor types. The results showed that the choice of data preprocessing operations affected the performance of the associated classifier models constructed for tissue of origin predictions in cancer.By using TCGA as a training set and applying data preprocessing methods, we demonstrated that batch effect correction improved performance measured by weighted F1-score in resolving tissue of origin against an independent GTEx test dataset. On the other hand, the use of data preprocessing operations worsened classification performance when the independent test dataset was aggregated from separate studies in ICGC and GEO. Therefore, based on our findings with these publicly available large-scale RNA-Seq datasets, the application of data preprocessing techniques to a machine learning pipeline is not always appropriate.© 2024.

38702419,Persistent T cell unresponsiveness associated with chronic visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-coinfected patients.,Commun Biol,"A large proportion of HIV-coinfected visceral leishmaniasis (VL-HIV) patients exhibit chronic disease with frequent VL recurrence. However, knowledge on immunological determinants underlying the disease course is scarce. We longitudinally profiled the circulatory cellular immunity of an Ethiopian HIV cohort that included VL developers. We show that chronic VL-HIV patients exhibit high and persistent levels of TIGIT and PD-1 on CD8+/CD8-T cells, in addition to a lower frequency of IFN-γ+ TIGIT-CD8+/CD8-T cells, suggestive of impaired T cell functionality. At single T cell transcriptome and clonal resolution, the patients show CD4+ T cell anergy, characterised by a lack of T cell activation and lymphoproliferative response. These findings suggest that PD-1 and TIGIT play a pivotal role in VL-HIV chronicity, and may be further explored for patient risk stratification. Our findings provide a strong rationale for adjunctive immunotherapy for the treatment of chronic VL-HIV patients to break the recurrent disease cycle.© 2024. The Author(s).",8.563877391080063e-19

Measures of algorithm performance were receiver operating characteristic-area under the curves (ROC-AUCs) on cross-validation and on two test datasets comprised of held-out infants and held-out video frames from infants used in training.Infant pose was accurately predicted in cross-validation, held-out frames, and held-out infants (respective ROC-AUCs 0.94, 0.83, 0.89). Median movement increased with age and, after accounting for age, was lower with sedative medications and in infants with cerebral dysfunction (all P<5×10-3, 10,000 permutations). Sedation prediction had high performance on cross-validation, held-out frames, and held-out infants (ROC-AUCs 0.90, 0.91, 0.87), as did prediction of cerebral dysfunction (ROC-AUCs 0.91, 0.90, 0.76).We used pose AI to predict sedation and cerebral dysfunction in 4,705 hours of video from a large, diverse cohort of infants.

38659907,Overcoming Limitations to Deep Learning in Domesticated Animals with TrioTrain.,bioRxiv,"Variant calling across diverse species remains challenging as most bioinformatics tools default to assumptions based on human genomes. DeepVariant (DV) excels without joint genotyping while offering fewer implementation barriers. However, the growing appeal of a ""universal"" algorithm has magnified the unknown impacts when used with non-human genomes. Here, we use bovine genomes to assess the limits of human-genome-trained models in other species. We introduce the first multi-species DV model that achieves a lower Mendelian Inheritance Error (MIE) rate during single-sample genotyping. Our novel approach, TrioTrain, automates extending DV for species without Genome In A Bottle (GIAB) resources and uses region shuffling to mitigate barriers for SLURM-based clusters. To offset imperfect truth labels for animal genomes, we remove Mendelian discordant variants before training, where models are tuned to genotype the offspring correctly. With TrioTrain, we use cattle, yak, and bison trios to build 30 model iterations across five phases. We observe remarkable performance across phases when testing the GIAB human trios with a mean SNP F1 score >0.990. In HG002, our phase 4 bovine model identifies more variants at a lower MIE rate than DeepTrio. In bovine F1-hybrid genomes, our model substantially reduces inheritance errors with a mean MIE rate of 0.03 percent. Although constrained by imperfect labels, we find that multi-species, trio-based training produces a robust variant calling model. Our research demonstrates that exclusively training with human genomes restricts the application of deep-learning approaches for comparative genomics.",4.891267532263744e-26
38662262,Cascade testing for hereditary cancer in Singapore: how population genomics help guide clinical policy.,Fam Cancer,"Hereditary Cancer makes up around 5-10% of all cancers. It is important to diagnose hereditary cancer in a timely fashion, as not only do patients require long-term care from a young age, but their relatives also require management. The main approach to capture at-risk relatives is cascade testing. It involves genetic testing of relatives of the first detected carrier of a pathogenic variant in a family i.e. the proband. The current standard of care for cascade testing is a patient-mediated approach. Probands are then advised to inform and encourage family members to undergo genetic testing. In Singapore, cascade testing is inefficient, around 10-15%, lower than the 30% global average. Here, we describe the cascade testing process and its effort to increase testing in Singapore. Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE), was set up to coordinate Singapore's National Precision Medicine strategy and has awarded five clinical implementation pilots, with one of them seeking to identify strategies for how cascade testing for hereditary cancer can be increased in a safe and cost-efficient manner. Achieving this will be done through addressing barriers such as cost, manpower shortages, exploring a digital channel for contacting at-risk relatives, and getting a deeper insight into why genetic testing gets declined. If successful, it will likely result in care pathways that are a cost-effective public health intervention for identifying individuals at risk. Surveillance and management of those unaffected at-risk individuals, if caught early, will result in improved patient outcomes, and further reduce the healthcare burden for the economy.© 2024.

This study aims to assess the relationship between various plasma proteins and childhood asthma, thereby identifying potential therapeutic targets.Based on publicly available genome-wide association study summary statistics, we employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to elucidate the causal relationship between plasma proteins and asthma. Mediation analysis was then conducted to evaluate the indirect influence of plasma proteins on childhood asthma mediated through risk factors. Comprehensive analysis was also conducted to explore the association between plasma proteins and various phenotypes using the UK Biobank dataset.MR analysis uncovered a causal relationship between 10 plasma proteins and childhood asthma. Elevated levels of seven proteins (TLR4, UBP25, CBR1, Rac GTPase-activating protein 1 [RGAP1], IL-21, MICB, and PDE4D) and decreased levels of three proteins (GSTO1, LIRB4 and PIGF) were associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. Our findings further validated the connections between reported risk factors (body mass index, mood swings, hay fever or allergic rhinitis, and eczema or dermatitis) and childhood asthma. Mediation analysis revealed the influence of proteins on childhood asthma outcomes through risk factors. Furthermore, the MR analysis identified 73 plasma proteins that exhibited causal associations with at least one risk factor for childhood asthma. Among them, RGAP1 mediates a significant proportion (25.10%) of the risk of childhood asthma through eczema or dermatitis. Finally, a phenotype-wide association study based on these 10 proteins and 1403 diseases provided novel associations between these biomarkers and multiple phenotypes.Our study comprehensively investigated the causal relationship between plasma proteins and childhood asthma, providing novel insights into potential therapeutic targets.© 2024 The Authors.

Genetic variants linked to SGLT2 inhibition derived from the previous studies. The 4,907 circulating proteins were derived from the deCODE study.

Among 4,907 circulating proteins, we identified leucine rich repeat transmembrane protein 2 (LRRTM2), which was related to both SGLT2 inhibition and HF. Mediation analysis revealed that the impact of SGLT2 inhibition on HF operates indirectly through LRRTM2 [β = -0.20, 95% CI (-0.39, -0.06),P = 0.02] with a mediation proportion of 24.6%.

However, our knowledge regarding the species-wide genetic control of protein abundance, including its dependency on transcript levels, is very limited. Here, we have determined quantitative proteomes of a large population of 942 diverse naturalSaccharomyces cerevisiaeyeast isolates. We found that mRNA and protein abundances are weakly correlated at the population gene level. While the protein coexpression network recapitulates major biological functions, differential expression patterns reveal proteomic signatures related to specific populations. Comprehensive genetic association analyses highlight that genetic variants associated with variation in protein (pQTL) and transcript (eQTL) levels poorly overlap (3%). Our results demonstrate that transcriptome and proteome are governed by distinct genetic bases, likely explained by protein turnover.

This study aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets for coronary heart disease (CHD) and myocardial infarction (MI) by investigating the causal relationship between plasma proteins and these conditions.A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was performed to evaluate more than 1600 plasma proteins for their causal associations with CHD and MI. The MR findings were further confirmed through Bayesian colocalization, Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR), and Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) analyses. Further analyses, including enrichment analysis, single-cell analysis, MR analysis of cardiovascular risk factors, phenome-wide Mendelian Randomization (Phe-MR), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction were conducted to verify the roles of selected causal proteins.Thirteen proteins were causally associated with CHD, seven of which were also causal for MI. Among them, FES and PCSK9 were causal proteins for both diseases as determined by several analytical methods. PCSK9 was a risk factor of CHD (OR = 1.25, 95% CI: 1.13-1.38, P = 7.47E-06) and MI (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.21-1.54, P = 2.30E-07), whereas FES was protective against CHD (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.59-0.79, P = 6.40E-07) and MI (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.54-0.77, P = 5.38E-07). Further validation through enrichment and single-cell analysis confirmed the causal effects of these proteins.

We conduct additional analyses to identify adverse side-effects of altering risk proteins and map cancer risk proteins to drug targets.

We also identify potential adverse effects of protein-altering interventions to reduce cancer risk, such as hypertension. Additionally, we report 18 proteins associated with cancer risk that map to existing drugs and 15 that are not currently under clinical investigation. In sum, we identify protein-cancer links that improve our understanding of cancer aetiology. We also demonstrate that the wider consequence of any protein-altering intervention on well-being and morbidity is required to interpret any utility of proteins as potential future targets for therapeutic prevention.© 2024.

We performed a drug-targeted Mendelian randomization (MR) study to identify novel therapeutic targets of MG.Cis-expression quantitative loci (cis-eQTL), which proxy expression levels for 2176 druggable genes, were used for MR analysis. Causal relationships between genes and disease, identified by eQTL MR analysis, were verified by comprehensive sensitivity, colocalization, and protein quantitative loci (pQTL) MR analyses. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was also performed to extend targets, followed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to explore the serum level of drug targets in MG patients. A phenome-wide MR analysis was then performed to assess side effects with a clinical trial review assessing druggability.The eQTL MR analysis has identified eight potential targets for MG, one for early-onset MG and seven for late-onset MG. Further colocalization analyses indicated that CD226, CDC42BPB, PRSS36, and TNFSF12 possess evidence for colocalization with MG or late-onset MG. pQTL MR analyses identified the causal relations of TNFSF12 and CD226 with MG and late-onset MG.

38573314,Identification of potential drug targets for allergic diseases from a genetic perspective: A mendelian randomization study.,Clin Transl Allergy,"Allergic diseases typically refer to a heterogeneous group of conditions primarily caused by the activation of mast cells or eosinophils, including atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis (AR), and asthma. Asthma, AR, and AD collectively affect approximately one-fifth of the global population, imposing a significant economic burden on society. Despite the availability of drugs to treat allergic diseases, they have been shown to be insufficient in controlling relapses and halting disease progression. Therefore, new drug targets are needed to prevent the onset of allergic diseases.We employed a Mendelian randomization approach to identify potential drug targets for the treatment of allergic diseases. Leveraging 1798 genetic instruments for 1537 plasma proteins from the latest reported Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), we analyzed the GWAS summary statistics of Ferreira MA et al. (nCase = 180,129, nControl = 180,709) using the Mendelian randomization method. Furthermore, we validated our findings in the GWAS data from the FinnGen and UK Biobank cohorts. Subsequently, we conducted sensitivity tests through reverse causal analysis, Bayesian colocalization analysis, and phenotype scanning. Additionally, we performed protein-protein interaction analysis to determine the interaction between causal proteins. Finally, based on the potential protein targets, we conducted molecular docking to identify potential drugs for the treatment of allergic diseases.At Bonferroni significance (p < 3.25 × 10-5), the Mendelian randomization analysis revealed 11 significantly associated protein-allergic disease pairs. Among these, the increased levels of TNFAIP3, ERBB3, TLR1, and IL1RL2 proteins were associated with a reduced risk of allergic diseases, with corresponding odds ratios of 0.82 (0.76-0.88), 0.74 (0.66-0.82), 0.49 (0.45-0.55), and 0.81 (0.75-0.87), respectively. Conversely, increased levels of IL6R, IL1R1, ITPKA, IL1RL1, KYNU, LAYN, and LRP11 proteins were linked to an elevated risk of allergic diseases, with corresponding odds ratios of 1.04 (1.03-1.05), 1.25 (1.18-1.34), 1.48 (1.25-1.75), 1.14 (1.11-1.18), 1.09 (1.05-1.12), 1.96 (1.56-2.47), and 1.05 (1.03-1.07), respectively. Bayesian colocalization analysis suggested that LAYN (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.819) and TNFAIP3 (coloc.abf-PPH4 = 0.930) share the same variant associated with allergic diseases.Our study demonstrates a causal association between the expression levels of TNFAIP3 and LAYN and the risk of allergic diseases, suggesting them as potential drug targets for these conditions, warranting further clinical investigation.© 2024 The Authors.

38545784,Evaluation of Plasma Biomarkers for Causal Association With Peripheral Artery Disease.,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Hundreds of biomarkers for peripheral artery disease (PAD) have been reported in the literature; however, the observational nature of these studies limits causal inference due to the potential of reverse causality and residual confounding. We sought to evaluate the potential causal impact of putative PAD biomarkers identified in human observational studies through genetic causal inference methods.Putative circulating PAD biomarkers were identified from human observational studies through a comprehensive literature search based on terms related to PAD using PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase. Genetic instruments were generated from publicly available genome-wide association studies of circulating biomarkers. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was used to test the association of genetically determined biomarker levels with PAD using summary statistics from a genome-wide association study of 31 307 individuals with and 211 753 individuals without PAD in the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program and replicated in data from FinnGen comprised of 11 924 individuals with and 288 638 individuals without PAD.We identified 204 unique circulating biomarkers for PAD from the observational literature, of which 173 were genetically instrumented using genome-wide association study results. After accounting for multiple testing (false discovery rate, <0.05), 10 of 173 (5.8%) biomarkers had significant associations with PAD. These 10 biomarkers represented categories including plasma lipoprotein regulation, lipid homeostasis, and protein-lipid complex remodeling. Observational literature highlighted different pathways including inflammatory response, negative regulation of multicellular organismal processes, and regulation of response to external stimuli.Integrating human observational studies and genetic causal inference highlights several key pathways in PAD pathophysiology. This work demonstrates that a substantial portion of biomarkers identified in observational studies are not well supported by human genetic evidence and emphasizes the importance of triangulating evidence to understand PAD pathophysiology. Although the identified biomarkers offer insights into atherosclerotic development in the lower limb, their specificity to PAD compared with more widespread atherosclerosis requires further study.",5.425880116738793e-25
38539014,TREM1 disrupts myeloid bioenergetics and cognitive function in aging and Alzheimer disease mouse models.,Nat Neurosci,"Human genetics implicate defective myeloid responses in the development of late-onset Alzheimer disease. A decline in peripheral and brain myeloid metabolism, triggering maladaptive immune responses, is a feature of aging. The role of TREM1, a pro-inflammatory factor, in neurodegenerative diseases is unclear. Here we show that Trem1 deficiency prevents age-dependent changes in myeloid metabolism, inflammation and hippocampal memory function in mice. Trem1 deficiency rescues age-associated declines in ribose 5-phosphate. In vitro, Trem1-deficient microglia are resistant to amyloid-β42oligomer-induced bioenergetic changes, suggesting that amyloid-β42oligomer stimulation disrupts homeostatic microglial metabolism and immune function via TREM1. In the 5XFAD mouse model, Trem1 haploinsufficiency prevents spatial memory loss, preserves homeostatic microglial morphology, and reduces neuritic dystrophy and changes in the disease-associated microglial transcriptomic signature. In aging APPSwemice, Trem1 deficiency prevents hippocampal memory decline while restoring synaptic mitochondrial function and cerebral glucose uptake. In postmortem Alzheimer disease brain, TREM1 colocalizes with Iba1+cells around amyloid plaques and its expression is associated with Alzheimer disease clinical and neuropathological severity. Our results suggest that TREM1 promotes cognitive decline in aging and in the context of amyloid pathology.© 2024.

38538601,S100A8/A9 as a prognostic biomarker with causal effects for post-acute myocardial infarction heart failure.,Nat Commun,"Heart failure is the prevalent complication of acute myocardial infarction. We aim to identify a biomarker for heart failure post-acute myocardial infarction. This observational study includes 1062 and 1043 patients with acute myocardial infarction in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. The outcomes are in-hospital and long-term heart failure events. S100A8/A9 is screened out through proteomic analysis, and elevated circulating S100A8/A9 is independently associated with heart failure in discovery and validation cohorts. Furthermore, the predictive value of S100A8/A9 is superior to the traditional biomarkers, and the addition of S100A8/A9 improves the risk estimation using traditional risk factors. We finally report causal effect of S100A8/A9 on heart failure in three independent cohorts using Mendelian randomization approach. Here, we show that S100A8/A9 is a predictor and potentially causal medicator for heart failure post-acute myocardial infarction.© 2024. The Author(s).",7.435458655851896e-09
38511149,Genetic evidence for the causal effects of C-reactive protein on self-reported habitual sleep duration.,Brain Behav Immun Health,"Inflammatory responses to acute stimuli are proposed to regulate sleep, but the relationship between chronic inflammation and habitual sleep duration is elusive. Here, we study this relation using genetically predicted level of chronic inflammation, indexed by CRP and IL6 signaling, and self-reported sleep duration. By Mendelian randomization analysis, we show that elevated CRP level within <10 mg/L has a homeostatic effect that facilitates maintaining 7-8 h sleep duration per day - making short-sleepers sleep longer (p = 2.42 × 10-2) and long-sleepers sleep shorter (1.87 × 10-7); but it is not associated with the overall sleep duration (p = 0.17). This homeostatic effect replicated in an independent CRP dataset. We observed causal effects of the soluble interleukin 6 receptor and gp130 on overall sleep duration (p = 1.62 × 10-8, p = 2.61 × 10-58, respectively), but these effects disappeared when CRP effects were accounted for in the model. Using polygenic score analysis, we found that the homeostatic effect of CRP on sleep duration stems primarily from the genetic variants within theCRPgene region: when genetic variants outside of this region were used to predict CRP levels, the opposite direction of effect was observed. In conclusion, we show that elevated CRP level may causally facilitate maintaining an optimal sleep duration that is beneficial to health, thus updating our current knowledge of immune regulation on sleep.© 2024 The Authors.",2.7695522848736375e-14
38534348,"Implementing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in Clinical Practice: Advantages, Challenges, and Future Perspectives.",Cells,"The integration of whole genome sequencing (WGS) into all aspects of modern medicine represents the next step in the evolution of healthcare. Using this technology, scientists and physicians can observe the entire human genome comprehensively, generating a plethora of new sequencing data. Modern computational analysis entails advanced algorithms for variant detection, as well as complex models for classification. Data science and machine learning play a crucial role in the processing and interpretation of results, using enormous databases and statistics to discover new and support current genotype-phenotype correlations. In clinical practice, this technology has greatly enabled the development of personalized medicine, approaching each patient individually and in accordance with their genetic and biochemical profile. The most propulsive areas include rare disease genomics, oncogenomics, pharmacogenomics, neonatal screening, and infectious disease genomics. Another crucial application of WGS lies in the field of multi-omics, working towards the complete integration of human biomolecular data. Further technological development of sequencing technologies has led to the birth of third and fourth-generation sequencing, which include long-read sequencing, single-cell genomics, and nanopore sequencing. These technologies, alongside their continued implementation into medical research and practice, show great promise for the future of the field of medicine.",6.664238005811333e-37
38717010,Heritable epigenetic changes are constrained by the dynamics of regulatory architectures.,Elife,"Interacting molecules create regulatory architectures that can persist despite turnover of molecules. Although epigenetic changes occur within the context of such architectures, there is limited understanding of how they can influence the heritability of changes. Here, I develop criteria for the heritability of regulatory architectures and use quantitative simulations of interacting regulators parsed as entities, their sensors, and the sensed properties to analyze how architectures influence heritable epigenetic changes. Information contained in regulatory architectures grows rapidly with the number of interacting molecules and its transmission requires positive feedback loops. While these architectures can recover after many epigenetic perturbations, some resulting changes can become permanently heritable. Architectures that are otherwise unstable can become heritable through periodic interactions with external regulators, which suggests that mortal somatic lineages with cells that reproducibly interact with the immortal germ lineage could make a wider variety of architectures heritable. Differential inhibition of the positive feedback loops that transmit regulatory architectures across generations can explain the gene-specific differences in heritable RNA silencing observed in the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans. More broadly, these results provide a foundation for analyzing the inheritance of epigenetic changes within the context of the regulatory architectures implemented using diverse molecules in different living systems.© 2023, Jose.",9.162932746117923e-41
38706873,Chronic pain as an emergent property of a complex system and the potential roles of psychedelic therapies.,Front Pain Res (Lausanne),"Despite research advances and urgent calls by national and global health organizations, clinical outcomes for millions of people suffering with chronic pain remain poor. We suggest bringing the lens of complexity science to this problem, conceptualizing chronic pain as an emergent property of a complex biopsychosocial system. We frame pain-related physiology, neuroscience, developmental psychology, learning, and epigenetics as components and mini-systems that interact together and with changing socioenvironmental conditions, as an overarching complex system that gives rise to the emergent phenomenon of chronic pain. We postulate that the behavior of complex systems may help to explain persistence of chronic pain despite current treatments. From this perspective, chronic pain may benefit from therapies that can be both disruptive and adaptive at higher orders within the complex system. We explore psychedelic-assisted therapies and how these may overlap with and complement mindfulness-based approaches to this end. Both mindfulness and psychedelic therapies have been shown to have transdiagnostic value, due in part to disruptive effects on rigid cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns as well their ability to promote neuroplasticity. Psychedelic therapies may hold unique promise for the management of chronic pain.© 2024 Armstrong, Castellanos and Christie.",2.7863110742925274e-36
38699533,Current global status of male reproductive health.,Hum Reprod Open,"The widespread interest in male reproductive health (MRH), fueled by emerging evidence, such as the global decline in sperm counts, has intensified concerns about the status of MRH. Consequently, there is a pressing requirement for a strategic, systematic approach to identifying critical questions, collecting pertinent information, and utilizing these data to develop evidence-based strategies. The methods for addressing these questions and the pathways toward their answers will inevitably vary based on the variations in cultural, geopolitical, and health-related contexts. To address these issues, a conjoint ESHRE and Male Reproductive Health Initiative (MRHI) Campus workshop was convened.The three objectives were: first, to assess the current state of MRH around the world; second, to identify some of the key gaps in knowledge; and, third, to examine how MRH stakeholders can collaboratively generate intelligent and effective paths forward.Each expert reviewed and summarized the current literature that was subsequently used to provide a comprehensive overview of challenges related to MRH.This narrative report is an overview of the data, opinions, and arguments presented during the workshop. A number of outcomes are presented and can be summarized by the following overarching themes: MRH is a serious global issue and there is a plethora of gaps in our understanding; there is a need for widespread international collaborative networks to undertake multidisciplinary research into fundamental issues, such as lifestyle/environmental exposure studies, and high-quality clinical trials; and there is an urgent requirement for effective strategies to educate young people and the general public to safeguard and improve MRH across diverse population demographics and resources.This was a workshop where worldwide leading experts from a wide range of disciplines presented and discussed the evidence regarding challenges related to MRH. While each expert summarized the current literature and placed it in context, the data in a number of areas are limited and/or sparse. Equally, important areas for consideration may have been missed. Moreover, there are clear gaps in our knowledge base, which makes some conclusions necessarily speculative and warranting of further study.Poor MRH is a global issue that suffers from low awareness among the public, patients, and heathcare professionals. Addressing this will require a coordinated multidisciplinary approach. Addressing the significant number of knowledge gaps will require policy makers prioritizing MRH and its funding.The authors would like to extend their gratitude to ESHRE for providing financial support for the Budapest Campus Workshop, as well as to Microptic S.L.

38659883,Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance increases trait variation but is not adaptive.,bioRxiv,"Understanding processes that can produce adaptive phenotypic shifts in response to rapid environmental change is critical to reducing biodiversity loss. The ubiquity of environmentally induced epigenetic marks has led to speculation that epigenetic inheritance could potentially enhance population persistence in response to environmental change. Yet, the magnitude and fitness consequences of epigenetic marks carried beyond maternal inheritance are largely unknown. Here, we tested how transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) shapes the phenotypic response ofDaphniaclones to the environmental stressorMicrocystis. We split individuals from each of eight genotypes into exposure and control treatments (F0 generation) and tracked the fitness of their descendants to the F3 generation. We found transgenerational epigenetic exposure toMicrocystisled to reduced rates of survival and individual growth and no consistent effect on offspring production. Increase in trait variance in the F3 relative to F0 generations suggests potential for heritable bet hedging driven by TEI, which could impact population dynamics. Our findings are counter to the working hypothesis that TEI is a generally adaptive mechanism likely to prevent extinction for populations inhabiting rapidly changing environments.",1.5518338292146658e-19
38564096,Increased PLAGL1 Gene Methylation in Cord Blood is Positively Correlated with Brain Injury in Chorioamniotic Preterm Infants.,Biochem Genet,"The study aims to explore the epigenetic mechanisms of neurodevelopmental impairment accompanied in chorioamniotic preterm infants. Our study included 16 full-term infants and 69 preterm infants. The methylation status of the pleomorphic adenoma gene-like 1 (PLAGL1) gene in the cord blood was determined by pyrosequencing. Brain B-ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to diagnose brain injury. The activity of candidate fragments of PLAGL1 and the effect of methylation on PLAGL1 activity were evaluated by double luciferase reporter assay. The data showed that there were no differences in the methylation levels of each Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) site of PLAGL1 between full-term and preterm infants. Within preterm infants, the methylation levels of the CpG2, CpG3, CpG4, and CpG5 sites were increased in the chorioamnionitis group compared with the no chorioamnionitis group. The areas under curves (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of CpG2, CpG3, CpG4, and CpG5 were 0.656, 0.653, 0.670, and 0.712, respectively. Meanwhile, the methylation level of the CpG2 site was increased in preterm babies with brain injury compared with those without brain injury, and the AUC of CpG2 was 0.648, with a sensitivity of 75.9% and a specificity of 50.0%. A double luciferase reporter assay revealed that PLAGL1 fragments had enhancer-like activity and that the methylated form of PLAGL1 weakened this activity. Thus, PLAGL1 hypermethylation in chorioamniotic preterm infants is positively correlated with brain injury. Our results suggest a potential use for PLAGL1 methylation as a biomarker in the diagnosis of brain injury.© 2024.

38491313,Appropriate glycemic management protects the germline but not the uterine environment in hyperglycemia.,EMBO Rep,"Emerging evidence indicates that parental diseases can impact the health of subsequent generations through epigenetic inheritance. Recently, it was shown that maternal diabetes alters the metaphase II oocyte transcriptome, causing metabolic dysfunction in offspring. However, type 1 diabetes (T1D) mouse models frequently utilized in previous studies may be subject to several confounding factors due to severe hyperglycemia. This limits clinical translatability given improvements in glycemic control for T1D subjects. Here, we optimize a T1D mouse model to investigate the effects of appropriately managed maternal glycemic levels on oocytes and intrauterine development. We show that diabetic mice with appropriate glycemic control exhibit better long-term health, including maintenance of the oocyte transcriptome and chromatin accessibility. We further show that human oocytes undergoing in vitro maturation challenged with mildly increased levels of glucose, reflecting appropriate glycemic management, also retain their transcriptome. However, fetal growth and placental function are affected in mice despite appropriate glycemic control, suggesting the uterine environment rather than the germline as a pathological factor in developmental programming in appropriately managed diabetes.© 2024.

38605127,Evaluation of 100 Dutch cases with 16p11.2 deletion and duplication syndromes; from clinical manifestations towards personalized treatment options.,Eur J Hum Genet,"The 16p11.2 deletion syndrome is a clinically heterogeneous disorder, characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, hyperphagia, obesity, macrocephaly and psychiatric problems. Cases with 16p11.2 duplication syndrome have similar neurodevelopmental problems, but typically show a partial 'mirror phenotype' with underweight and microcephaly. Various copy number variants (CNVs) of the chromosomal 16p11.2 region have been described. Most is known about the 'typical' 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 (29.6-30.2 Mb; ~600 kb) deletions and duplications, but there are also several published cohorts with more distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs (28.8-29.0 Mb; ~220 kb), who exhibit clinical overlap. We assessed 100 cases with various pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs and compared their clinical characteristics to provide more clear genotype-phenotype correlations and raise awareness of the different 16p11.2 CNVs. Neurodevelopmental and weight issues were reported in the majority of cases. Cases with distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 deletion showed the most severe obesity phenotype (73.7% obesity, mean BMI SDS 3.2). In addition to the more well defined typical 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 and distal 16p11.2 BP2-BP3 CNVs, we describe the clinical features of five cases with other, overlapping, 16p11.2 CNVs in more detail. Interestingly, four cases had a second genetic diagnosis and 18 cases an additional gene variant of uncertain significance, that could potentially help explain the cases' phenotypes. In conclusion, we provide an overview of our Dutch cohort of cases with various pathogenic 16p11.2 CNVs and relevant second genetic findings, that can aid in adequately recognizing, diagnosing and counseling of individuals with 16p11.2 CNVs, and describe the personalized medicine for cases with these conditions.© 2024.

38534435,"The ""Bad Father"": Paternal Role in Biology of Pregnancy and in Birth Outcome.",Biology (Basel),"Pregnancy is generally studied as a biological interaction between a mother and a fetus; however, the father, with his characteristics, lifestyle, genetics, and living environment, is by no means unrelated to the outcome of pregnancy. The half of the fetal genetic heritage of paternal derivation can be decisive in cases of inherited chromosomal disorders, and can be the result of de novo genetic alterations. In addition to the strictly pathological aspects, paternal genetics may transmit thrombophilic traits that affect the implantation and vascular construction of the feto-placental unit, lead to placenta-mediated diseases such as pre-eclampsia and fetal growth retardation, and contribute to the multifactorial genesis of preterm delivery. Biological aspects of immunological tolerance to paternal antigens also appear to be crucial for these pathologies. Finally, this review describes the biological findings by which the environment, exposure to pathogens, lifestyle, and nutritional style of the father affect fetal pathophysiological and epigenetic definition.",5.6746973774834504e-21
38512839,Effects of paternal arachidonic acid supplementation on offspring behavior and hypothalamus inflammation markers in the mouse.,PLoS One,"Arachidonic acid (AA) is involved in inflammation and plays a role in growth and brain development in infants. We previously showed that exposure of mouse sires to AA for three consecutive generations induces a cumulative change in fatty acid (FA) involved in inflammation and an increase in body and liver weight in the offspring. Here, we tested the hypothesis that paternal AA exposure changes the progeny's behavioral response to a proinflammatory insult, and asked whether tissue-specific FA are associated with that response. Male BALB/c mice were supplemented daily with three doses of AA for 10 days and crossed to non-supplemented females (n = 3/dose). Two-month-old unsupplemented male and female offspring (n = 6/paternal AA dose) were exposed to Gram-negative bacteria-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or saline control two hours prior to open field test (OFT) behavioral analysis and subsequent sacrifice. We probed for significant effects of paternal AA exposure on: OFT behaviors; individual FA content of blood, hypothalamus and hypothalamus-free brain; hypothalamic expression profile of genes related to inflammation (Tnfa, Il1b, Cox1, Cox2) and FA synthesis (Scd1, Elovl6). All parameters were affected by paternal AA supplementation in a sex-specific manner. Paternal AA primed the progeny for behavior associated with increased anxiety, with a marked sex dimorphism: high AA doses acted as surrogate of LPS in males, realigning a number of OFT behaviors that in females were differential between saline and LPS groups. Progeny hypothalamic Scd1, a FA metabolism enzyme with documented pro-inflammatory activity, showed a similar pattern of differential expression between saline and LPS groups at high paternal AA dose in females, that was blunted in males. Progeny FA generally were not affected by LPS, but displayed non-linear associations with paternal AA doses. In conclusion, we document that paternal exposure to AA exerts long-term behavioral and biochemical effects in the progeny in a sex-specific manner.Copyright: © 2024 Vázquez-Sánchez et al.

While our understanding of the interaction between the gut microbiome and the host's physiology is still in its nascent stage, evidence suggests that the gut microbiota can indeed modulate host behavior. Understanding the specific mechanisms by which the gut microbiota community modulates the host's behavior remains the focus of present and future neuro-gastroenterology studies.

Therefore, this study aimed to analyze whether dietary factors involved in the methylation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α are implicated in differential protein expression in people with normal weight and obesity.The participants were classified into the non-obese (N = 100) and obese (N = 133) groups. DNA methylation levels of the TNF-alpha gene and proteomics were analyzed using the pyrosequencing method and LC-MS-MS, respectively.Comparison between geometric means of DNA methylation of TNF-α showed lower levels in subjects with obesity than in those without obesity (p< 0.05). There were associations between dietary factors and some metabolic syndrome components and TNF-α DNA methylation levels. Proteomic analysis showed important signaling pathways related to obesity, with 95 significantly downregulated proteins and 181 upregulated proteins in the non-obese group compared with the obese group.This study shows an association between the dietary factors involved in the methylation of TNF-α and differential protein expression related to obesity.

38496675,Endocrine islet β-cell subtypes with differential function are derived from biochemically distinct embryonic endocrine islet progenitors that are regulated by maternal nutrients.,Res Sq,"Endocrine islet b cells comprise heterogenous cell subsets. Yet when/how these subsets are produced and how stable they are remain unknown. Addressing these questions is important for preventing/curing diabetes, because lower numbers of b cells with better secretory function is a high risk of this disease. Using combinatorial cell lineage tracing, scRNA-seq, and DNA methylation analysis, we show here that embryonic islet progenitors with distinct gene expression and DNA methylation produce b-cell subtypes of different function and viability in adult mice. The subtype with better function is enriched for genes involved in vesicular production/trafficking, stress response, and Ca2+-secretion coupling, which further correspond to differential DNA methylation in putative enhancers of these genes. Maternal overnutrition, a major diabetes risk factor, reduces the proportion of endocrine progenitors of the b-cell subtype with better-function via deregulating DNA methyl transferase 3a. Intriguingly, the gene signature that defines mouse b-cell subtypes can reliably divide human cells into two sub-populations while the proportion of b cells with better-function is reduced in diabetic donors. The implication of these results is that modulating DNA methylation in islet progenitors using maternal food supplements can be explored to improve b-cell function in the prevention and therapy of diabetes.",1.759158606788143e-39
38659783,Stabilizing transglutaminase 2 in the open conformation results in reactive astrocytes being more neurosupportive.,bioRxiv,"Astrocytes play critical roles in supporting structural and metabolic homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS). Inflammatory conditions bring about a range of poorly understood, heterogeneous, reactive phenotypes in astrocytes. Finding ways to manipulate the phenotype of reactive astrocytes, and leveraging a pro-recovery phenotype, holds promise in treating CNS injury. Previous studies have shown that the protein transglutaminase 2 (TG2) plays a significant role in determining the phenotype of reactive astrocytes. Recently it has been demonstrated that ablation of TG2 from astrocytes improves injury outcomes bothin vitroandin vivo. Excitingly, in anin vivomouse model, pharmacological inhibition of TG2 with the irreversible inhibitor VA4 phenocopies the neurosupportive effects of TG2 deletion in astrocytes. The focus of this study was to provide insights into the mechanisms by which TG2 deletion or inhibition of TG2 with VA4 result in a more neurosupportive astrocytic phenotype. Using a neuron-astrocyte co-culture model of neurite outgrowth, we show that VA4 treatment improves the ability of astrocytes to support neurite outgrowth on an injury-relevant matrix, further validating the ability of VA4 to phenocopy astrocytic TG2 deletion. VA4 treatment of neurons alone had no effect on neurite outgrowth. VA4 covalently binds to active site residues of TG2 that are exposed in its open conformation and are critical for its enzymatic function, and prevents TG2 from taking on a closed conformation, which interferes with its protein scaffolding function. To begin to understand how pharmacologically altering TG2's conformation affects its ability to regulate reactive astrocyte phenotypes, we assayed the impact of VA4 on TG2's interaction with Zbtb7a, a transcription factor that we have previously identified as a TG2 interactor, and whose functional outputs are significantly regulated by TG2. The results of these studies demonstrated that VA4 significantly decreases the interaction of TG2 and Zbtb7a. Further, previous findings indicate that TG2 may act as an epigenetic regulator, through its nuclear protein-protein interactions, to modulate gene expression. Since both TG2 and Zbtb7a interact with members of the Sin3a chromatin repressor complex, we assayed the effect of TG2 deletion and VA4 treatment on histone acetylation and found significantly greater acetylation with TG2 deletion or inhibition with VA4. Overall, this work points toward a possible epigenetic mechanism by which genetic deletion or acute inhibition of TG2 leads to enhanced astrocytic support of neurons.",9.88610051599113e-90
38532526,Paternal aging impacts expression and epigenetic markers as early as the first embryonic tissue lineage differentiation.,Hum Genomics,"Advanced paternal age (APA) is associated with adverse outcomes to offspring health, including increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the methylome and transcriptome of the first two early embryonic tissue lineages, the inner cell mass (ICM) and the trophectoderm (TE), from human blastocysts in association with paternal age and disease risk. High quality human blastocysts were donated with patient consent from donor oocyte IVF cycles from either APA (≥ 50 years) or young fathers. Blastocysts were mechanically separated into ICM and TE lineage samples for both methylome and transcriptome analyses.Significant differential methylation and transcription was observed concurrently in ICM and TE lineages of APA-derived blastocysts compared to those from young fathers. The methylome revealed significant enrichment for neuronal signaling pathways, as well as an association with neurodevelopmental disorders and imprinted genes, largely overlapping within both the ICM and TE lineages. Significant enrichment of neurodevelopmental signaling pathways was also observed for differentially expressed genes, but only in the ICM. In stark contrast, no significant signaling pathways or gene ontology terms were identified in the trophectoderm. Despite normal semen parameters in aged fathers, these significant molecular alterations can adversely contribute to downstream impacts on offspring health, in particular neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia.An increased risk for neurodevelopmental disorders is well described in children conceived by aged fathers. Using blastocysts derived from donor oocyte IVF cycles to strategically control for maternal age, our data reveals evidence of methylation dysregulation in both tissue lineages, as well as transcription dysregulation in neurodevelopmental signaling pathways associated with APA fathers. This data also reveals that embryos derived from APA fathers do not appear to be compromised for initial implantation potential with no significant pathway signaling disruption in trophectoderm transcription. Collectively, our work provides insights into the complex molecular mechanisms that occur upon paternal aging during the first lineage differentiation in the preimplantation embryo. Early expression and epigenetic markers of APA-derived preimplantation embryos highlight the susceptibility of the future fetus to adverse health outcomes.© 2024.

38645988,Sinomenine Hydrochloride Protects IgA Nephropathy Through Regulating Cell Growth and Apoptosis of T and B Lymphocytes.,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Sinomenine hydrochloride (SH) is used to treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and may also be efficacious against Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). However, no trial has investigated the molecular mechanism of SH on IgAN. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect and mechanism of SH on IgAN.The pathological changes and IgA and C3 depositions in the kidney of an IgAN rat model were detected by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and direct immunofluorescence staining. After extracting T and B cells using immunomagnetic beads, we assessed their purity, cell cycle phase, and apoptosis stage through flow cytometry. Furthermore, we quantified cell cycle-related and apoptosis-associated proteins by Western blotting.SH reduced IgA and C3 depositions in stage 4 IgAN, thereby decreasing inflammatory cellular infiltration and mesangial injury in an IgAN model induced using heteroproteins. Furthermore, SH arrested the cell cycle of lymphocytes T and B from the spleen of IgAN rats. Regarding the mechanism, our results demonstrated that SH regulated the Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1 protein levels for arresting the cell cycle and it also regulated Bax and Bcl-2 protein levels, thus increasing Cleaved caspase-3 protein levels in Jurkat T and Ramos B cells.SH exerts a dual regulation on the cell cycle and apoptosis of T and B cells by controlling cell cycle-related and apoptosis-associated proteins; it also reduces inflammatory cellular infiltration and mesangial proliferation. These are the major mechanisms of SH in IgAN.© 2024 Li et al.",2.013611701870831e-55
38518389,PFAS alters placental arterial vasculature in term human placentae: A prospective pregnancy cohort study.,Placenta,"Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic chemicals used in industrial and consumer goods that are widely detected in human populations and are associated with adverse health outcomes, including perinatal health risks and child health. One mechanism of influence may be the impact of PFAS exposure on placental structure and function.The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between maternal prenatal exposure to PFAS and measures of placental vascularization, and to assess whether changes in vascularization play a role in mediating the impact of PFAS on birth outcomes.Using data from a prospective cohort study, we examined associations between second trimester PFAS (individually and as mixtures using Bayesian kernel machine regression) and placental arterial vasculature in term placentae (N = 158); secondarily we evaluated the degree to which alterations in placental arterial vasculature explained associations between PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. Placental arterial vasculature features were collected from arterial tracings of each placental image.In both linear regression and mixture models, natural log-transformed perfluorooctanoic acid concentrations were negatively associated with surface vasculature, indexed by the mean distance from arterial end point to perimeter (β = -0.23, 95% CI: -0.41, -0.041); additionally, maximum arterial tortuosity was negatively associated with placental weight (β = -0.19, 95% CI: -0.34, -0.051). There were no reliable differences in effect by fetal sex.The findings provide some of the first evidence of PFAS exposure shaping a key measure of placental vascular function, which may underlie the impact of PFAS on perinatal and child health risks.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

38600666,Improving drug response prediction via integrating gene relationships with deep learning.,Brief Bioinform,"Predicting the drug response of cancer cell lines is crucial for advancing personalized cancer treatment, yet remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity and individual diversity. In this study, we present a deep learning-based framework named Deep neural network Integrating Prior Knowledge (DIPK) (DIPK), which adopts self-supervised techniques to integrate multiple valuable information, including gene interaction relationships, gene expression profiles and molecular topologies, to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness. We demonstrated the superior performance of DIPK compared to existing methods on both known and novel cells and drugs, underscoring the importance of gene interaction relationships in drug response prediction. In addition, DIPK extends its applicability to single-cell RNA sequencing data, showcasing its capability for single-cell-level response prediction and cell identification. Further, we assess the applicability of DIPK on clinical data. DIPK accurately predicted a higher response to paclitaxel in the pathological complete response (pCR) group compared to the residual disease group, affirming the better response of the pCR group to the chemotherapy compound. We believe that the integration of DIPK into clinical decision-making processes has the potential to enhance individualized treatment strategies for cancer patients.© The Author(s) 2024.

The aim of the present study was to investigate if individuals with LADA have an altered gut microbiota relative to non-diabetic control subjects, individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D), and individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Bacterial community profiling was performed with primers targeting the variable region 4 of the 16S rRNA gene and sequenced. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were generated with DADA2 and annotated to the SILVA database. The gut virome was sequenced, using a viral particle enrichment and metagenomics approach, assembled, and quantified to describe the composition of the viral community. Comparison of the bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity measures revealed that the gut bacteriome of individuals with LADA resembled that of individuals with T2D. Yet, specific genera were found to differ in abundance in individuals with LADA compared with T1D and T2D, indicating that LADA has unique taxonomical features. The virome composition reflected the stability of the most dominant order Caudovirales and the families Siphoviridae, Podoviridae, and Inoviridae, and the dominant family Microviridae. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.6317280398142676e-25
38585974,Severus: accurate detection and characterization of somatic structural variation in tumor genomes using long reads.,medRxiv,"Most current studies rely on short-read sequencing to detect somatic structural variation (SV) in cancer genomes. Long-read sequencing offers the advantage of better mappability and long-range phasing, which results in substantial improvements in germline SV detection. However, current long-read SV detection methods do not generalize well to the analysis of somatic SVs in tumor genomes with complex rearrangements, heterogeneity, and aneuploidy. Here, we present Severus: a method for the accurate detection of different types of somatic SVs using a phased breakpoint graph approach. To benchmark various short- and long-read SV detection methods, we sequenced five tumor/normal cell line pairs with Illumina, Nanopore, and PacBio sequencing platforms; on this benchmark Severus showed the highest F1 scores (harmonic mean of the precision and recall) as compared to long-read and short-read methods. We then applied Severus to three clinical cases of pediatric cancer, demonstrating concordance with known genetic findings as well as revealing clinically relevant cryptic rearrangements missed by standard genomic panels.",1.9803874161297133e-30

We present two individuals with congenital myopathy and compound heterozygous variants (NM_001271208.2: c.2079C>A; p.(Cys693Ter) and c.21522+3A>G ) inNEB.Transcriptomic sequencing on patient muscle revealed that the extended splice variant c.21522+3A>G causes exon 144 skipping. Nebulin isoforms containing exon 144 are known to be mutually exclusive with isoforms containing exon 143, and these isoforms are differentially expressed during development and in adult skeletal muscles. Patients MRIs were compared to the known pattern of relative abundance of these two isoforms in muscle. We propose that the pattern of muscle involvement in these patients better fits the distribution of exon 144-containing isoforms in muscle than with previously published MRI findings inNEB-related disease due to other variants. To our knowledge this is the first report hypothesizing disease pathogenesis through the alteration of isoform distributions in muscle.",1.91869882255331e-26
38560387,Detection of selective sweep in European wild sheep breeds.,3 Biotech,"In wild animal populations, there is a differentiation between populations due to natural selection. The direction and pressure of natural selection in the wild sheep are different in the various geographic areas. Linkage disequilibrium studies showed that regions of the genome in whole wild sheep are under natural selection and that natural selection can affect immune or reproductive or metabolic traits. The study aimed to identify genomic regions under natural selection in wild sheep. For this purpose, the genetic information of 24 European wild sheep and 24 Sardinian wild sheep was used. The genotypes were determined using Illumina 50 K SNPChip arrays based on Oar_4.0 version of the sheep genome. After quality control steps, finally, 31,560 SNP markers were analyzed. The value of LD was calculated by calculating ther2statistic between all pairs of locations through PLINK software. To identify signs of selection based on linkage disequilibrium methods, an extended haplotype homozygosity test of XP-EHH crossing population and iHS intrapopulation was used. The results of iHS studies showed that in European and Sardinian wild sheep, the highest iHS coefficient under natural selection was observed on 3 and 2 chromosome numbers, respectively. Also, the results of XP-EHH studies showed that the largest XP-EHH coefficients under natural selection in European wild sheep compared to Sardinian and vice versa in Sardinian wild sheep compared to European wild sheep were observed on 3 and 16 chromosome numbers, respectively. In addition, the results of gene cycle studies showed that COPB1, SEC24D, ZDHHC17, BBS4, RFX3, SLC26A8, CAMK2D, GRIA1, GRM1, GRID2, PPP2R1A, CPEB4, PLEKHA5 and KIF13A, VPS39, VPS53, DTNBP1, DYNC1I1, FAM91A genes are under natural selection in Sardinian and European wild sheeps, respectively.

38509598,Ethnic variations in metabolic syndrome components and their associations with the gut microbiota: the HELIUS study.,Genome Med,"The occurrence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the gut microbiota composition are known to differ across ethnicities yet how these three factors are interwoven is unknown. Also, it is unknown what the relative contribution of the gut microbiota composition is to each MetS component and whether this differs between ethnicities. We therefore determined the occurrence of MetS and its components in the multi-ethnic HELIUS cohort and tested the overall and ethnic-specific associations with the gut microbiota composition.We included 16,209 treatment naïve participants of the HELIUS study, which were of Dutch, African Surinamese, South-Asian Surinamese, Ghanaian, Turkish, and Moroccan descent to analyze MetS and its components across ethnicities. In a subset (n = 3443), the gut microbiota composition (16S) was associated with MetS outcomes using linear and logistic regression models.A differential, often sex-dependent, prevalence of MetS components and their combinations were observed across ethnicities. Increased blood pressure was commonly seen especially in Ghanaians, while South-Asian Surinamese and Turkish had higher MetS rates in general and were characterized by worse lipid-related measures. Regarding the gut microbiota, when ethnic-independent associations were assumed, a higher α-diversity, higher abundance of several ASVs (mostly for waist and triglyceride-related outcomes) and a trophic network of ASVs of Ruminococcaceae, Christensenellaceae, and Methanobrevibacter (RCM) bacteria were associated with better MetS outcomes. Statistically significant ethnic-specific associations were however noticed for α-diversity and the RCM trophic network. Associations were significant in the Dutch but not always in all other ethnicities. In Ghanaians, a higher α-diversity and RCM network abundance showed an aberrant positive association with high blood pressure measures compared to the other ethnicities. Even though adjustment for socioeconomic status-, lifestyle-, and diet-related variables often attenuated the effect size and/or the statistical significance of the ethnic-specific associations, an overall similar pattern across outcomes and ethnicities remained.The occurrence of MetS characteristics among ethnicities is heterogeneous. Both ethnic-independent and ethnic-specific associations were identified between the gut microbiota and MetS outcomes. Across multiple ethnicities, a one-size-fits-all approach may thus be reconsidered in regard to both the definition and/or treatment of MetS and its relation to the gut microbiota.© 2024.

Still, studies quantifying EC heterogeneity across whole transcriptomes and epigenomes in both in vitro and in vivo models are lacking. Multiomic profiling concurrently measuring transcriptomes and accessible chromatin in the same single cells was performed on six distinct primary cultures of human aortic ECs (HAECs) exposed to activating environments characteristic of the atherosclerotic microenvironment in vitro. Meta-analysis of single-cell transcriptomes across 17 human ex vivo arterial specimens was performed and two computational approaches quantitatively evaluated the similarity in molecular profiles between heterogeneous in vitro and ex vivo cell profiles. HAEC cultures were reproducibly populated by four major clusters with distinct pathway enrichment profiles and modest heterogeneous responses: EC1-angiogenic, EC2-proliferative, EC3-activated/mesenchymal-like, and EC4-mesenchymal. Quantitative comparisons between in vitro and ex vivo transcriptomes confirmed EC1 and EC2 as most canonically EC-like, and EC4 as most mesenchymal with minimal effects elicited by siERG and IL1B. Lastly, accessible chromatin regions unique to EC2 and EC4 were most enriched for coronary artery disease (CAD)-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms from Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), suggesting that these cell phenotypes harbor CAD-modulating mechanisms. Primary EC cultures contain markedly heterogeneous cell subtypes defined by their molecular profiles. Surprisingly, the perturbations used here only modestly shifted cells between subpopulations, suggesting relatively stable molecular phenotypes in culture. Identifying consistently heterogeneous EC subpopulations between in vitro and ex vivo models should pave the way for improving in vitro systems while enabling the mechanisms governing heterogeneous cell state decisions.© 2023, Adelus et al.",1.3343156116969952e-66

38744975,"Analysis of somatic mutations in whole blood from 200,618 individuals identifies pervasive positive selection and novel drivers of clonal hematopoiesis.",Nat Genet,"Human aging is marked by the emergence of a tapestry of clonal expansions in dividing tissues, particularly evident in blood as clonal hematopoiesis (CH). CH, linked to cancer risk and aging-related phenotypes, often stems from somatic mutations in a set of established genes. However, the majority of clones lack known drivers. Here we infer gene-level positive selection in whole blood exomes from 200,618 individuals in UK Biobank. We identify 17 additional genes, ZBTB33, ZNF318, ZNF234, SPRED2, SH2B3, SRCAP, SIK3, SRSF1, CHEK2, CCDC115, CCL22, BAX, YLPM1, MYD88, MTA2, MAGEC3 and IGLL5, under positive selection at a population level, and validate this selection pattern in 10,837 whole genomes from single-cell-derived hematopoietic colonies. Clones with mutations in these genes grow in frequency and size with age, comparable to classical CH drivers. They correlate with heightened risk of infection, death and hematological malignancy, highlighting the significance of these additional genes in the aging process.© 2024.

38550770,Archived Cytogenetic Cell Pellets Used to Detect a BCR::ABL1 Driver Mutation Eight Years before Disease Presentation.,Case Rep Hematol,"Evidence suggests that the earliest genetic events in the evolution of a cancer can predate diagnosis by several years or decades. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the BCR::ABL1 fusion driver mutation can be present for an extended period before clinical disease manifests. The time between the BCR::ABL1 occurrence and symptom onset is referred to as the latency period. Though modeling studies predict this latency period is no more than ten years, it is still unclear how long it can be. We present a case of a patient referred for suspected CML. Both karyotype and FISH analysis identified thet(9;22)(q34;q11.2) translocation resulting in the Philadelphia chromosome formation in 98.5% of cells analyzed. The patient responded to imatinib and achieved a sustained complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission. Clinical history revealed that the same patient presented eight years previously with anemia. Various non-neoplastic conditions were excluded, and a bone marrow biopsy was performed to rule out MDS. Cytogenetic analysis at that time revealed del(20q) as the sole abnormality in all 20 cells analyzed. No treatment was given since the presence of isolated del(20q) is not considered evidence of MDS in the absence of diagnostic morphologic criteria. Retrospective FISH analysis of archived bone marrow pellets from this previous specimen revealed the presence of BCR::ABL1 in 1.8% of cells. A clonal population of cells harboring the BCR::ABL1 fusion was unambiguously detected in this patient's archived bone marrow pellet obtained eight years before the current CML diagnosis. This case demonstrates that Carnoy's fixed nuclear pellets stored in cytogenetic laboratories are suitable for detecting driver mutations years before disease presentation. Such archived material may be useful for the retrospective studies needed to better understand the initiation and subsequent development of hematological malignancies. By identifying individuals who are at increased risk, it may be possible to initiate preventive measures or begin treatment at an earlier stage before disease progression.Copyright © 2024 Ramakrishnan Sasi et al.",9.162953153629354e-42
38540996,Digital Anti-Aging Healthcare: An Overview of the Applications of Digital Technologies in Diet Management.,J Pers Med,"Diet management has long been an important practice in healthcare, enabling individuals to get an insight into their nutrient intake, prevent diseases, and stay healthy. Traditional methods based on self-reporting, food diaries, and periodic assessments have been used for a long time to control dietary habits. These methods have shown limitations in accuracy, compliance, and real-time analysis. The rapid advancement of digital technologies has revolutionized healthcare, including the diet control landscape, allowing for innovative solutions to control dietary patterns and generate accurate and personalized recommendations. This study examines the potential of digital technologies in diet management and their effectiveness in anti-aging healthcare. After underlining the importance of nutrition in the aging process, we explored the applications of mobile apps, web-based platforms, wearables devices, sensors, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other technologies in managing dietary patterns and improving health outcomes. The research further examines the effects of digital dietary control on anti-aging healthcare, including improved nutritional monitoring, personalized recommendations, and behavioral and sustainable changes in habits, leading to an expansion of longevity and health span. The challenges and limitations of digital diet monitoring are discussed, and some future directions are provided. Although many digital tools are used in diet control, their accuracy, effectiveness, and impact on health outcomes are not discussed much.

Here, we test the hypothesis that children who later develop clinical disease have different early immune responses, depending on the type of the first autoantibody to appear (GADA-first or IAA-first). We use mass cytometry for deep immune profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples longitudinally collected from children who later progressed to clinical disease (IAA-first, GADA-first, ≥2 autoantibodies first groups) and matched for age, sex, and HLA controls who did not, as part of the Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention study. We identify differences in immune cell composition of children who later develop disease depending on the type of autoantibodies that appear first. Notably, we observe an increase in CD161 expression in natural killer cells of children with ≥2 autoantibodies and validate this in an independent cohort. The results highlight the importance of endotype-specific analyses and are likely to contribute to our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms underlying type 1 diabetes development.© 2024.

There are disparities in the epidemiology of CRC across different populations, most probably due to differences in exposure to lifestyle and environmental factors related to CRC. Prevention is the most effective method for controlling CRC. Primary prevention includes determining and avoiding modifiable risk factors (e.g., alcohol consumption, smoking, and dietary factors) as well as increasing protective factors (e.g., physical activity, aspirin). Further studies, especially randomized, controlled trials, are needed to clarify the association between CRC incidence and exposure to different risk factors or protective factors. Detection and removal of precancerous colorectal lesions is also an effective strategy for controlling CRC. Multiple factors, both at the individual and community levels (e.g., patient preferences, availability of screening modalities, costs, benefits, and adverse events), should be taken into account in designing and implementing CRC screening programs. Health policymakers should consider the best decision in identifying the starting age and selection of the most effective screening strategies for the target population.

38542712,Healthy Lifestyle and Cancer Risk: Modifiable Risk Factors to Prevent Cancer.,Nutrients,"Cancer has become a serious problem worldwide, as it represents the main cause of death, and its incidence has increased over the years. A potential strategy to counter the growing spread of various forms of cancer is the adoption of prevention strategies, in particular, the use of healthy lifestyles, such as maintaining a healthy weight, following a healthy diet; being physically active; avoiding smoking, alcohol consumption, and sun exposure; and vitamin D supplementation. These modifiable risk factors are associated with this disease, contributing to its development, progression, and severity. This review evaluates the relationship between potentially modifiable risk factors and overall cancer development, specifically breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer, and highlights updated recommendations on cancer prevention. The results of numerous clinical and epidemiological studies clearly show the influence of lifestyles on the development and prevention of cancer. An incorrect diet, composed mainly of saturated fats and processed products, resulting in increased body weight, combined with physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, and smoking, has induced an increase in the incidence of all three types of cancer under study.

Yet the underlying mechanisms of how torpor affects aging, and whether hypothermic and hypometabolic states can be induced to slow aging and increase health span, remain unknown. We demonstrate that the activity of a spatially defined neuronal population in the avMLPA, which has previously been identified as a torpor-regulating brain region, is sufficient to induce a torpor like state (TLS) in mice. Prolonged induction of TLS slows epigenetic aging across multiple tissues and improves health span. We isolate the effects of decreased metabolic rate, long-term caloric restriction, and decreased core body temperature (Tb) on blood epigenetic aging and find that the pro-longevity effect of torpor-like states is mediated by decreased Tb. Taken together, our findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the pro-longevity effects of torpor and hibernation and support the growing body of evidence that Tbis an important mediator of aging processes.",5.665743703566691e-18
38632519,Machine learning approach for predicting cardiovascular disease in Bangladesh: evidence from a cross-sectional study in 2023.,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,"Cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. Lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as Bangladesh, are also affected by several types of CVDs, such as heart failure and stroke. The leading cause of death in Bangladesh has recently switched from severe infections and parasitic illnesses to CVDs.The study dataset comprised a random sample of 391 CVD patients' medical records collected between August 2022 and April 2023 using simple random sampling. Moreover, 260 data points were collected from individuals with no CVD problems for comparison purposes. Crosstabs and chi-square tests were used to determine the association between CVD and the explanatory variables. Logistic regression, Naïve Bayes classifier, Decision Tree, AdaBoost classifier, Random Forest, Bagging Tree, and Ensemble learning classifiers were used to predict CVD. The performance evaluations encompassed accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operator characteristic (AU-ROC) curve.Random Forest had the highest precision among the five techniques considered. The precision rates for the mentioned classifiers are as follows: Logistic Regression (93.67%), Naïve Bayes (94.87%), Decision Tree (96.1%), AdaBoost (94.94%), Random Forest (96.15%), and Bagging Tree (94.87%). The Random Forest classifier maintains the highest balance between correct and incorrect predictions. With 98.04% accuracy, the Random Forest classifier achieved the best precision (96.15%), robust recall (100%), and high F1 score (97.7%). In contrast, the Logistic Regression model achieved the lowest accuracy of 95.42%. Remarkably, the Random Forest classifier achieved the highest AUC value (0.989).This research mainly focused on identifying factors that are critical in impacting patients with CVD and predicting CVD risk. It is strongly advised that the Random Forest technique be implemented in a system for predicting cardiac diseases. This research may change clinical practice by providing doctors with a new instrument to determine a patient's CVD prognosis.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.5073969386397404e-21
38668066,"Active Surveillance in Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer, the Potential Role of Biomarkers: A Systematic Review.",Curr Oncol,"Bladder cancer (BC) is the tenth most common cause of cancer worldwide and is the thirteenth leading cause of cancer mortality. The non-muscle invasive (NMI) variant represents 75% of cases and has a mortality rate of less than 1%; however, it has a high recurrence rate. The gold standard of management is transurethral resection in the case of new lesions. However, this is associated with significant morbidity and costs, so the reduction of these procedures would contribute to reducing complications, morbidity, and the burden to the health system associated with therapy. In this clinical scenario, strategies such as active surveillance have emerged that propose to manage low-risk BC with follow-up; however, due to the low evidence available, this is a strategy that is underutilized by clinicians.

38504781,Association study of the polymorphisms rs2228611 of the DNMT1 gene and rs1569686 of the DNMT3B gene with bladder cancer development in a sample of the Algerian population.,Mol Biol Res Commun,"Bladder cancer (BC) is a multifactorial disease with a poorly understood main cause. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of the polymorphisms rs2228611 of the DNMT1 gene and rs1569686 of the DNMT3B gene on the susceptibility to develop Bladder Cancer in the Algerian population. A case-control study design was adopted, with DNA samples of 114 BC patients and 123 healthy controls. We found that the rs2228611 of the DNMT1 gene was strongly associated with an increased risk of BC development under genetic models: Codominant AGvs. GG (OR=2.54, 95% CI=1.21-5.51, adj p=0.015) and dominant AA+AGvs. GG (OR=2.24, 95% CI=1.12-4.60, adj p=0.023). However, no statistically significant association was observed between the rs1569686 of the DNMT3B gene and the predisposition to BC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first peer-reviewed study to evaluate the effect of the rs2228611 polymorphism on bladder cancer occurrence. Our results suggest that the rs2228611 might be a potential biomarker for BC development risk. Additional studies are needed to validate our findings.",1.6482280358220962e-17
38548720,SpiDe-Sr: blind super-resolution network for precise cell segmentation and clustering in spatial proteomics imaging.,Nat Commun,"Spatial proteomics elucidates cellular biochemical changes with unprecedented topological level. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is a high-dimensional single-cell resolution platform for targeted spatial proteomics. However, the precision of subsequent clinical analysis is constrained by imaging noise and resolution. Here, we propose SpiDe-Sr, a super-resolution network embedded with a denoising module for IMC spatial resolution enhancement. SpiDe-Sr effectively resists noise and improves resolution by 4 times. We demonstrate SpiDe-Sr respectively with cells, mouse and human tissues, resulting 18.95%/27.27%/21.16% increase in peak signal-to-noise ratio and 15.95%/31.63%/15.52% increase in cell extraction accuracy. We further apply SpiDe-Sr to study the tumor microenvironment of a 20-patient clinical breast cancer cohort with 269,556 single cells, and discover the invasion of Gram-negative bacteria is positively correlated with carcinogenesis markers and negatively correlated with immunological markers. Additionally, SpiDe-Sr is also compatible with fluorescence microscopy imaging, suggesting SpiDe-Sr an alternative tool for microscopy image super-resolution.© 2024.

38580886,Chemokines and Their Receptors: Predictors of Therapeutic Potential in Tumor Microenvironment on Esophageal Cancer.,Dig Dis Sci,"Esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) is an aggressive solid tumor. The 5-year survival rate for patients with ESCA is estimated to be less than 20%, mainly due to tumor invasion and metastasis. Therefore, it is urgent to improve early diagnostic tools and effective treatments for ESCA patients. Tumor microenvironment (TME) enhances the ability of tumor cells to proliferate, migrate, and escape from the immune system, thus promoting the occurrence and development of tumor. TME contains chemokines. Chemokines consist of four major families, which are mainly composed of CC and CXC families. The main purpose of this review is to understand the CC and CXC chemokines and their receptors in ESCA, to improve the understanding of tumorigenesis of ESCA and determine new biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of ESCA. We reviewed the literature on CC and CXC chemokines and their receptors in ESCA identified by PubMed database. This article introduces the general structures and functions of CC, CXC chemokines and their receptors in TME, as well as their roles in the progress of ESCA. Chemokines are involved in the development of ESCA, such as cancer cell invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and radioresistance, and are key determinants of disease progression, which have a great impact on patient prognosis and treatment response. In addition, a full understanding of their mechanism of action is essential to further verify that these chemokines and their receptors may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets of ESCA.© 2024.

We analyzed 32,000 UK Biobank participants treated with dihydropiridine CCBs (mean 5.9 years), including 23 pharmacogenetic variants, and calculated polygenic scores for systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body fat mass, and other patient characteristics. Outcomes included treatment discontinuation and heart failure. Pharmacogenetic variant rs10898815-A (NUMA1) increased discontinuation rates, highest in those with high polygenic scores for fat mass. The RYR3 variant rs877087 T-allele alone modestly increased heart failure risks versus non-carriers (HR:1.13, p = 0.02); in patients with high polygenic scores for fat mass, lean mass, and lipoprotein A, risks were substantially elevated (HR:1.55, p = 4 × 10-5). Incorporating polygenic scores for adiposity and lipoprotein A may improve risk estimates of key clinical outcomes in CCB treatment such as treatment discontinuation and heart failure, compared to pharmacogenetic variants alone.© 2024.

38674921,L-Carnitine in the Treatment of Psychiatric and Neurological Manifestations: A Systematic Review.,Nutrients,"L-carnitine (LC), a vital nutritional supplement, plays a crucial role in myocardial health and exhibits significant cardioprotective effects. LC, being the principal constituent of clinical-grade supplements, finds extensive application in the recovery and treatment of diverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders. However, controversies persist regarding the utilization of LC in nervous system diseases, with varying effects observed across numerous mental and neurological disorders. This article primarily aims to gather and analyze database information to comprehensively summarize the therapeutic potential of LC in patients suffering from nervous system diseases while providing valuable references for further research.A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Web Of Science, Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Library and Clinicaltrials.gov databases. The literature pertaining to the impact of LC supplementation on neurological or psychiatric disorders in patients was reviewed up until November 2023. No language or temporal restrictions were imposed on the search.A total of 1479 articles were retrieved, and after the removal of duplicates through both automated and manual exclusion processes, 962 articles remained. Subsequently, a meticulous re-screening led to the identification of 60 relevant articles. Among these, there were 12 publications focusing on hepatic encephalopathy (HE), while neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) and peripheral nervous system diseases (PNSDs) were represented by 9 and 6 articles, respectively. Additionally, stroke was addressed in five publications, whereas Raynaud's syndrome (RS) and cognitive disorder (CD) each had three dedicated studies. Furthermore, migraine, depression, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) each accounted for two publications. Lastly, one article was found for other symptoms under investigation.In summary, LC has demonstrated favorable therapeutic effects in the management of HE, Alzheimer's disease (AD), carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), CD, migraine, neurofibromatosis (NF), PNSDs, RS, and stroke. However, its efficacy appears to be relatively limited in conditions such as ALS, ataxia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), Down syndrome (DS), and sciatica.",2.9247505347917306e-57
38645132,Tissue informative cell-free DNA methylation sites in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,medRxiv,"Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is increasingly recognized as a promising biomarker candidate for disease monitoring. However, its utility in neurodegenerative diseases, like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), remains underexplored. Existing biomarker discovery approaches are tailored to a specific disease context or are too expensive to be clinically practical. Here, we address these challenges through a new approach combining advances in molecular and computational technologies. First, we develop statistical tools to select tissue-informative DNA methylation sites relevant to a disease process of interest. We then employ a capture protocol to select these sites and perform targeted methylation sequencing. Multi-modal information about the DNA methylation patterns are then utilized in machine learning algorithms trained to predict disease status and disease progression. We applied our method to two independent cohorts of ALS patients and controls (n=192). Overall, we found that the targeted sites accurately predicted ALS status and replicated between cohorts. Additionally, we identified epigenetic features associated with ALS phenotypes, including disease severity. These findings highlight the potential of cfDNA as a non-invasive biomarker for ALS.",5.714875922810425e-16

Many methods for data integration have been developed for the identification of key elements that explain or predict disease risk or other biological outcomes. The heterogeneous graph representation of multi-omics data provides an advantage for discerning patterns suitable for predictive/exploratory analysis, thus permitting the modeling of complex relationships. Graph-based approaches-including graph neural networks-potentially offer a reliable methodological toolset that can provide a tangible alternative to scientists and clinicians that seek ideas and implementation strategies in the integrated analysis of their omics sets for biomedical research. Graph-based workflows continue to push the limits of the technological envelope, and this perspective provides a focused literature review of research articles in which graph machine learning is utilized for integrated multi-omics data analyses, with several examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of graph-based approaches.© 2024.

38666952,Multi-Omics Integration for Liver Cancer Using Regression Analysis.,Curr Issues Mol Biol,"Genetic biomarkers have played a pivotal role in the classification, prognostication, and guidance of clinical cancer therapies. Large-scale and multi-dimensional analyses of entire cancer genomes, as exemplified by projects like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), have yielded an extensive repository of data that holds the potential to unveil the underlying biology of these malignancies. Mutations stand out as the principal catalysts of cellular transformation. Nonetheless, other global genomic processes, such as alterations in gene expression and chromosomal re-arrangements, also play crucial roles in conferring cellular immortality. The incorporation of multi-omics data specific to cancer has demonstrated the capacity to enhance our comprehension of the molecular mechanisms underpinning carcinogenesis. This report elucidates how the integration of comprehensive data on methylation, gene expression, and copy number variations can effectively facilitate the unsupervised clustering of cancer samples. We have identified regressors that can effectively classify tumor and normal samples with an optimal integration of RNA sequencing, DNA methylation, and copy number variation while also achieving significant p-values. Further, these regressors were trained using linear and logistic regression with k-means clustering. For comparison, we employed autoencoder- and stacking-based omics integration and computed silhouette scores to evaluate the clusters. The proof of concept is illustrated using liver cancer data. Our analysis serves to underscore the feasibility of unsupervised cancer classification by considering genetic markers beyond mutations, thereby emphasizing the clinical relevance of additional global cellular parameters that contribute to the transformative process in cells. This work is clinically relevant because changes in gene expression and genomic re-arrangements have been shown to be signatures of cellular transformation across cancers, as well as in liver cancers.",1.753555935706064e-45
38547246,Gut Microbiota and Blood Metabolites Related to Fiber Intake and Type 2 Diabetes.,Circ Res,"Consistent evidence suggests diabetes-protective effects of dietary fiber intake. However, the underlying mechanisms, particularly the role of gut microbiota and host circulating metabolites, are not fully understood. We aimed to investigate gut microbiota and circulating metabolites associated with dietary fiber intake and their relationships with type 2 diabetes (T2D).This study included up to 11 394 participants from the HCHS/SOL (Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos). Diet was assessed with two 24-hour dietary recalls at baseline. We examined associations of dietary fiber intake with gut microbiome measured by shotgun metagenomics (350 species/85 genera and 1958 enzymes; n=2992 at visit 2), serum metabolome measured by untargeted metabolomics (624 metabolites; n=6198 at baseline), and associations between fiber-related gut bacteria and metabolites (n=804 at visit 2). We examined prospective associations of serum microbial-associated metabolites (n=3579 at baseline) with incident T2D over 6 years.We identified multiple bacterial genera, species, and related enzymes associated with fiber intake. Several bacteria (eg,Butyrivibrio,Faecalibacterium) and enzymes involved in fiber degradation (eg, xylanase EC3.2.1.156) were positively associated with fiber intake, inversely associated with prevalent T2D, and favorably associated with T2D-related metabolic traits. We identified 159 metabolites associated with fiber intake, 47 of which were associated with incident T2D. We identified 18 of these 47 metabolites associated with the identified fiber-related bacteria, including several microbial metabolites (eg, indolepropionate and 3-phenylpropionate) inversely associated with the risk of T2D. BothButyrivibrioandFaecalibacteriumwere associated with these favorable metabolites. The associations of fiber-related bacteria, especiallyFaecalibacteriumandButyrivibrio, with T2D were attenuated after further adjustment for these microbial metabolites.Among United States Hispanics/Latinos, dietary fiber intake was associated with favorable profiles of gut microbiota and circulating metabolites for T2D. These findings advance our understanding of the role of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in the relationship between diet and T2D.",1.2615243673564205e-21
38540105,Supervised Parametric Learning in the Identification of Composite Biomarker Signatures of Type 1 Diabetes in Integrated Parallel Multi-Omics Datasets.,Biomedicines,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating autoimmune disease, and its rising prevalence in the United States and around the world presents a critical problem in public health. While some treatment options exist for patients already diagnosed, individuals considered at risk for developing T1D and who are still in the early stages of their disease pathogenesis without symptoms have no options for any preventive intervention. This is because of the uncertainty in determining their risk level and in predicting with high confidence who will progress, or not, to clinical diagnosis. Biomarkers that assess one's risk with high certainty could address this problem and will inform decisions on early intervention, especially in children where the burden of justifying treatment is high. Single omics approaches (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) have been applied to identify T1D biomarkers based on specific disturbances in association with the disease. However, reliable early biomarkers of T1D have remained elusive to date. To overcome this, we previously showed that parallel multi-omics provides a more comprehensive picture of the disease-associated disturbances and facilitates the identification of candidate T1D biomarkers.This paper evaluated the use of machine learning (ML) using data augmentation and supervised ML methods for the purpose of improving the identification of salient patterns in the data and the ultimate extraction of novel biomarker candidates in integrated parallel multi-omics datasets from a limited number of samples. We also examined different stages of data integration (early, intermediate, and late) to assess at which stage supervised parametric models can learn under conditions of high dimensionality and variation in feature counts across different omics. In the late integration scheme, we employed a multi-view ensemble comprising individual parametric models trained over single omics to address the computational challenges posed by the high dimensionality and variation in feature counts across the different yet integrated multi-omics datasets.the multi-view ensemble improves the prediction of case vs. control and finds the most success in flagging a larger consistent set of associated features when compared with chance models, which may eventually be used downstream in identifying a novel composite biomarker signature of T1D risk.the current work demonstrates the utility of supervised ML in exploring integrated parallel multi-omics data in the ongoing quest for early T1D biomarkers, reinforcing the hope for identifying novel composite biomarker signatures of T1D risk via ML and ultimately informing early treatment decisions in the face of the escalating global incidence of this debilitating disease.",3.1878028274370995e-50
38491511,Cancer-associated fibroblast-secreted FGF7 as an ovarian cancer progression promoter.,J Transl Med,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is distinguished by its aggressive nature and the limited efficacy of current treatment strategies. Recent studies have emphasized the significant role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in OC development and progression.Employing sophisticated machine learning techniques on bulk transcriptomic datasets, we identified fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7), derived from CAFs, as a potential oncogenic factor. We investigated the relationship between FGF7 expression and various clinical parameters. A series of in vitro experiments were undertaken to evaluate the effect of CAFs-derived FGF7 on OC cell activities, such as proliferation, migration, and invasion. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was also conducted to elucidate the interaction between FGF7 and its receptor. Detailed mechanistic investigations sought to clarify the pathways through which FGF7 fosters OC progression.Our findings indicate that higher FGF7 levels correlate with advanced tumor stages, increased vascular invasion, and poorer prognosis. CAFs-derived FGF7 significantly enhanced OC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Single-cell analysis and in vitro studies revealed that CAFs-derived FGF7 inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) via FGFR2 interaction. Activation of the FGF7/HIF-1α pathway resulted in the upregulation of mesenchymal markers and downregulation of epithelial markers. Importantly, in vivo treatment with neutralizing antibodies targeting CAFs-derived FGF7 substantially reduced tumor growth.Neutralizing FGF7 in the medium or inhibiting HIF-1α signaling reversed the effects of FGF7-mediated EMT, emphasizing the dependence of FGF7-mediated EMT on HIF-1α activation. These findings suggest that targeting the FGF7/HIF-1α/EMT axis may offer new therapeutic opportunities to intervene in OC progression.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.5598501676069986e-76
38701218,Drosophila TET acts with PRC1 to activate gene expression independently of its catalytic activity.,Sci Adv,"Enzymes of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family play a key role in the regulation of gene expression by oxidizing 5-methylcytosine (5mC), a prominent epigenetic mark in many species. Yet, TET proteins also have less characterized noncanonical modes of action, notably inDrosophila, whose genome is devoid of 5mC. Here, we show thatDrosophilaTET activates the expression of genes required for larval central nervous system (CNS) development mainly in a catalytic-independent manner. Genome-wide profiling shows that TET is recruited to enhancer and promoter regions bound by Polycomb group complex (PcG) proteins. We found that TET interacts and colocalizes on chromatin preferentially with Polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) rather than PRC2. Furthermore, PRC1 but not PRC2 is required for the activation of TET target genes. Last, our results suggest that TET and PRC1 binding to activated genes is interdependent. These data highlight the importance of TET noncatalytic function and the role of PRC1 for gene activation in theDrosophilalarval CNS.",3.831787689990703e-37

38649755,"Cortical gene expression architecture links healthy neurodevelopment to the imaging, transcriptomics and genetics of autism and schizophrenia.",Nat Neurosci,"Human brain organization involves the coordinated expression of thousands of genes. For example, the first principal component (C1) of cortical transcription identifies a hierarchy from sensorimotor to association regions. In this study, optimized processing of the Allen Human Brain Atlas revealed two new components of cortical gene expression architecture, C2 and C3, which are distinctively enriched for neuronal, metabolic and immune processes, specific cell types and cytoarchitectonics, and genetic variants associated with intelligence. Using additional datasets (PsychENCODE, Allen Cell Atlas and BrainSpan), we found that C1-C3 represent generalizable transcriptional programs that are coordinated within cells and differentially phased during fetal and postnatal development. Autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia were specifically associated with C1/C2 and C3, respectively, across neuroimaging, differential expression and genome-wide association studies. Evidence converged especially in support of C3 as a normative transcriptional program for adolescent brain development, which can lead to atypical supragranular cortical connectivity in people at high genetic risk for schizophrenia.© 2024.

Most individual conditions have a low prevalence which has resulted in a lack of research and expertise in this field, especially regarding genetic newborn screening (gNBS). There is increasing recognition of the importance of incorporating patients' needs and general public perspectives into the shared decision-making process regarding gNBS. This study is part of the Innovative Medicine Initiative project Screen4Care which aims at shortening the diagnostic journey for RDs by accelerating diagnosis for patients living with RDs through gNBS and the use of digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Our objective will be to assess expecting parent's perspectives, attitudes and preferences regarding gNBS for RDs in Italy and Germany.A mixed method approach will assess perspectives, attitudes and preferences of (1) expecting parents seeking genetic consultation and (2) 'healthy' expecting parents from the general population in two countries (Germany and Italy).

38636509,Genomic Answers for Kids: Toward more equitable access to genomic testing for rare diseases in rural populations.,Am J Hum Genet,"Next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the speed of rare disease (RD) diagnoses. While clinical exome and genome sequencing represent an effective tool for many RD diagnoses, there is room to further improve the diagnostic odyssey of many RD patients. One recognizable intervention lies in increasing equitable access to genomic testing. Rural communities represent a significant portion of underserved and underrepresented individuals facing additional barriers to diagnosis and treatment. Primary care providers (PCPs) at local clinics, though sometimes suspicious of a potential benefit of genetic testing for their patients, have significant constraints in pursuing it themselves and rely on referrals to specialists. Yet, these referrals are typically followed by long waitlists and significant delays in clinical assessment, insurance clearance, testing, and initiation of diagnosis-informed care management. Not only is this process time intensive, but it also often requires multiple visits to urban medical centers for which distance may be a significant barrier to rural families. Therefore, providing early, ""direct-to-provider"" (DTP) local access to unrestrictive genomic testing is likely to help speed up diagnostic times and access to care for RD patients in rural communities. In a pilot study with a PCP clinic in rural Kansas, we observed a minimum 5.5 months shortening of time to diagnosis through the DTP exome sequencing program as compared to rural patients receiving genetic testing through the ""traditional"" PCP-referral-to-specialist scheme. We share our experience to encourage future partnerships beyond our center. Our efforts represent just one step in fostering greater diversity and equity in genomic studies.Copyright © 2024 American Society of Human Genetics. Published by Elsevier Inc.

38562723,Closing the gap: Solving complex medically relevant genes at scale.,medRxiv,"Comprehending the mechanism behind human diseases with an established heritable component represents the forefront of personalized medicine. Nevertheless, numerous medically important genes are inaccurately represented in short-read sequencing data analysis due to their complexity and repetitiveness or the so-called 'dark regions' of the human genome. The advent of PacBio as a long-read platform has provided new insights, yet HiFi whole-genome sequencing (WGS) cost remains frequently prohibitive. We introduce a targeted sequencing and analysis framework, Twist Alliance Dark Genes Panel (TADGP), designed to offer phased variants across 389 medically important yet complex autosomal genes. We highlight TADGP accuracy across eleven control samples and compare it to WGS. This demonstrates that TADGP achieves variant calling accuracy comparable to HiFi-WGS data, but at a fraction of the cost. Thus, enabling scalability and broad applicability for studying rare diseases or complementing previously sequenced samples to gain insights into these complex genes. TADGP revealed several candidate variants across all cases and provided insight intoLPAdiversity when tested on samples from rare disease and cardiovascular disease cohorts. In both cohorts, we identified novel variants affecting individual disease-associated genes (e.g.,IKZF1, KCNE1). Nevertheless, the annotation of the variants across these 389 medically important genes remains challenging due to their underrepresentation in ClinVar and gnomAD. Consequently, we also offer an annotation resource to enhance the evaluation and prioritization of these variants. Overall, we can demonstrate that TADGP offers a cost-efficient and scalable approach to routinely assess the dark regions of the human genome with clinical relevance.",7.128296749629028e-28
38528647,Clinical Strategies in Gene Screening Counseling for the Healthy General Population.,Korean J Fam Med,"The burgeoning interest in precision medicine has propelled an increase in the use of genome tests for screening purposes within the healthy population. Gene screening tests aim to pre-emptively identify those individuals who may be genetically predisposed to certain diseases. However, as genetic screening becomes more commonplace, it is essential to acknowledge the unique challenges it poses. A prevalent issue in this regard is the occurrence of falsepositive results, which can lead to unnecessary additional tests or treatments, and psychological distress. Additionally, the interpretation of genomic variants is based on current research evidence, and can accordingly change as new research findings emerge, potentially altering the clinical significance of these variants. Conversely, a further prominent concern regards false assurances in genetic testing, as genetic tests can yield false-negative results, potentially posing a significant clinical risk. Moreover, the results obtained for the same disease can vary among different genetic testing services, due to differences in the types of variants assessed, the scope of tests, analytical methods, and the algorithms used for predicting diseases. Consequently, whereas genetic testing holds significant promise for the future of medicine, it poses unique challenges. If conducted without a full understanding of its implications, genetic testing may fail to achieve its purpose potentially hindering effective health management. Therefore, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the implications of genetic testing within the general population, sufficient discussion and careful consideration should be given to counseling based on gene test results.",1.2143131651935618e-30

It required 1.22 ± 3.22 years and 3.58 ± 4.24 hospital visits for a definitive diagnosis. One-third of the patients still needed to travel for over 2 h to access DMTs. The total treatment expenditure was estimated to be CNY 59,827.00 (USD 8315.95) a year. Drug expenses alone accounted for 52.22% of the average annual household income. The most common challenges perceived were the inability to afford treatment and a lack of effective options. No significant difference was found in treatment satisfaction among DMTs, except that rituximab scored lowest in convenience compared to other DMTs. Patients' age and travel time required to obtain medications were negatively associated with global treatment satisfaction.In China, patients with NMOSD face challenges in obtaining proper treatment due to diagnostic difficulties, distant medication access, and high costs. Policies should prioritize improving disease education and alleviating financial burdens for the patients.© The Author(s), 2024.",5.5307462437272435e-34
38730491,Single-cell analysis defines highly specific leukemia-induced neutrophils and links MMP8 expression to recruitment of tumor associated neutrophils during FGFR1 driven leukemogenesis.,Exp Hematol Oncol,"Leukemias driven by activated, chimeric FGFR1 kinases typically progress to AML which have poor prognosis. Mouse models of this syndrome allow detailed analysis of cellular and molecular changes occurring during leukemogenesis. We have used these models to determine the effects of leukemia development on the immune cell composition in the leukemia microenvironment during leukemia development and progression.Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) was used to characterize leukemia associated neutrophils and define gene expression changes in these cells during leukemia progression.scRNA-Seq revealed six distinct subgroups of neutrophils based on their specific differential gene expression. In response to leukemia development, there is a dramatic increase in only two of the neutrophil subgroups. These two subgroups show specific gene expression signatures consistent with neutrophil precursors which give rise to immature polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs). Analysis of gene expression in these precursor cells identified pathways that were specifically upregulated, the most pronounced of which involved matrix metalloproteinases Mmp8 and Mmp9, during leukemia progression. Pharmacological inhibition of MMPs using Ilomastat preferentially restricted in vitro migration of neutrophils from leukemic mice and led to a significantly improved survival in vivo, accompanied by impaired PMN-MDSC recruitment. As a result, levels of T-cells were proportionally increased. In clinically annotated TCGA databases, MMP8 was shown to act as an independent indicator for poor prognosis and correlated with higher neutrophil infiltration and poor pan-cancer prognosis.We have defined specific leukemia responsive neutrophil subgroups based on their unique gene expression profile, which appear to be the precursors of neutrophils specifically associated with leukemia progression. An important event during development of these neutrophils is upregulation MMP genes which facilitated mobilization of these precursors from the BM in response to cancer progression, suggesting a possible therapeutic approach to suppress the development of immune tolerance.© 2024.

38565598,Exome-wide analysis implicates rare protein-altering variants in human handedness.,Nat Commun,"Handedness is a manifestation of brain hemispheric specialization. Left-handedness occurs at increased rates in neurodevelopmental disorders. Genome-wide association studies have identified common genetic effects on handedness or brain asymmetry, which mostly involve variants outside protein-coding regions and may affect gene expression. Implicated genes include several that encode tubulins (microtubule components) or microtubule-associated proteins. Here we examine whether left-handedness is also influenced by rare coding variants (frequencies ≤ 1%), using exome data from 38,043 left-handed and 313,271 right-handed individuals from the UK Biobank. The beta-tubulin gene TUBB4B shows exome-wide significant association, with a rate of rare coding variants 2.7 times higher in left-handers than right-handers. The TUBB4B variants are mostly heterozygous missense changes, but include two frameshifts found only in left-handers. Other TUBB4B variants have been linked to sensorineural and/or ciliopathic disorders, but not the variants found here. Among genes previously implicated in autism or schizophrenia by exome screening, DSCAM and FOXP1 show evidence for rare coding variant association with left-handedness. The exome-wide heritability of left-handedness due to rare coding variants was 0.91%. This study reveals a role for rare, protein-altering variants in left-handedness, providing further evidence for the involvement of microtubules and disorder-relevant genes.© 2024.

38492159,Environmental Interventions for Preventing Atopic Diseases.,Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,"In this review, we detail the exposome (consisting of environmental factors such as diet, microbial colonization, allergens, pollutants, and stressors), mechanistic and clinical research supporting its influence on atopic disease, and potentiation from climate change. We highlight contemporary environmental interventions and available evidence substantiating their roles in atopic disease prevention, from observational cohorts to randomized controlled trials, when available.Early introduction to allergenic foods is an effective primary prevention strategy to reduce food allergy. Diverse dietary intake also appears to be a promising strategy for allergic disease prevention, but additional study is necessary. Air pollution and tobacco smoke are highly associated with allergic disease, among other medical comorbidities, paving the way for campaigns and legislation to reduce these exposures. There is no clear evidence that oral vitamin D supplementation, prebiotic or probiotic supplementation, daily emollient application, and antiviral prophylaxis are effective in preventing atopic disease, but these interventions require further study. While some environmental interventions have a well-defined role in the prevention of atopic disease, additional study of many remaining interventions is necessary to enhance our understanding of their role in disease prevention. Alignment of research findings from randomized controlled trials with public policy is essential to develop meaningful public health outcomes and prevent allergic disease on the population level.© 2024.

38575639,Clinical performance and utility of a noninvasive urine-based methylation biomarker: TWIST1/Vimentin to detect urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.,Sci Rep,"Traditional clinical modalities for diagnosing bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC) remain limited due to their invasive nature, significant costs, discomfort associated with cystoscopy, and low sensitivity to urine cytology. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify highly sensitive, specific, and noninvasive biomarkers for the early detection of this neoplasm. Hypermethylated TWIST1/Vimentin promoter may be a noninvasive biomarker using urine sample. We assessed the TWIST1/Vimentin promoter methylation status in urine samples using the Methylated Human TWIST1 and Vimentin Gene Detection Kit (Jiangsu MicroDiag Biomedicine Co., Ltd., China). The samples were collected from five groups: group 1 consisted of patients with BUC, group 2 contained other patients with urologic tumors, group 3 consisted of patients with benign diseases (e.g., urinary tract infections, lithiasis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia), Group 4 included UTUC (upper tract urothelial carcinoma) patients and group5 comprised healthy individuals. The study encompassed 77 BUC patients, and we evaluated the degree of methylation of the TWIST1/Vimentin gene in their urine samples. Notably, TWIST1/Vimentin positivity was significantly elevated in comparison to groups 2, 3 and 5 (all p < 0.001) at a rate of 77.9%, but no significant difference was observed when compared to group 4. In the relationship between TWIST1/Vimentin methylation and clinicopathological features of BC patients from our center, we found there was no significant association between TWIST1/Vimentin status and proteinuria and/or hematuria, and hypermethylation of TWIST1 / VIM genes was found in both high and low tumor grade and in both non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (stages Tis, Ta, or T1) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (stage T2 or above). In the multivariable analysis for cancer detection, a positive TWIST1/Vimentin methylation were significantly linked to a heightened risk of BC. Moreover, TWIST1/Vimentin promoter methylation demonstrated an ability to detect BUC in urine samples with a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 83%. Our findings reveal that hypermethylation of the TWIST1/Vimentin promoter occurs in bladder urothelial carcinoma, and its high sensitivity and specificity suggest its potential as a screening and therapeutic biomarker for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.© 2024.

38542681,Reduction in Placental Metal and Metalloid in Preeclampsia: A Case-Control Study.,Nutrients,"Preeclampsia is a primary placental disorder, with impaired placental vascularization leading to uteroplacental hypoperfusion. We aimed to investigate differences in metal and metalloid content between the placentas of women with preeclampsia and healthy controls. This was a case-control study in 63 women with preeclampsia and 113 healthy women. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to measure the placental metals and metalloids content. Compared with healthy control subjects, preeclampsia was associated with a significantly lower concentration of essential elements (magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, and selenium) in the placental tissue. After multivariable adjustment, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in selenium concentration was associated with a reduced risk of preeclampsia with an OR of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.33-0.77). The joint effects of multiple selected metals and metalloids were associated with a reduced risk of preeclampsia. The lower placental magnesium, chromium, iron, zinc, and selenium concentrations of preeclampsia cases indicate a potential link to its pathogenesis. It also provides an intriguing avenue for future research in revealing the underlying mechanisms and potential intervention strategies for preeclampsia.",1.1795562095784571e-05
38670157,Prior knowledge-guided multilevel graph neural network for tumor risk prediction and interpretation via multi-omics data integration.,Brief Bioinform,"The interrelation and complementary nature of multi-omics data can provide valuable insights into the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying diseases. However, challenges such as limited sample size, high data dimensionality and differences in omics modalities pose significant obstacles to fully harnessing the potential of these data. The prior knowledge such as gene regulatory network and pathway information harbors useful gene-gene interaction and gene functional module information. To effectively integrate multi-omics data and make full use of the prior knowledge, here, we propose a Multilevel-graph neural network (GNN): a hierarchically designed deep learning algorithm that sequentially leverages multi-omics data, gene regulatory networks and pathway information to extract features and enhance accuracy in predicting survival risk. Our method achieved better accuracy compared with existing methods. Furthermore, key factors nonlinearly associated with the tumor pathogenesis are prioritized by employing two interpretation algorithms (i.e. GNN-Explainer and IGscore) for neural networks, at gene and pathway level, respectively. The top genes and pathways exhibit strong associations with disease in survival analyses, many of which such as SEC61G and CYP27B1 are previously reported in the literature.© The Author(s) 2024.

38605908,Multimodal Omics Approaches to Aging and Age-Related Diseases.,Phenomics,"Aging is associated with a progressive decline in physiological capacities and an increased risk of aging-associated disorders. An increasing body of experimental evidence shows that aging is a complex biological process coordinately regulated by multiple factors at different molecular layers. Thus, it is difficult to delineate the overall systematic aging changes based on single-layer data. Instead, multimodal omics approaches, in which data are acquired and analyzed using complementary omics technologies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, are needed for gaining insights into the precise molecular regulatory mechanisms that trigger aging. In recent years, multimodal omics sequencing technologies that can reveal complex regulatory networks and specific phenotypic changes have been developed and widely applied to decode aging and age-related diseases. This review summarizes the classification and progress of multimodal omics approaches, as well as the rapidly growing number of articles reporting on their application in the field of aging research, and outlines new developments in the clinical treatment of age-related diseases based on omics technologies.© International Human Phenome Institutes (Shanghai) 2024.

As methods are developed, a common problem for investigators has been identifying the best method they should apply to their specific use-case. To address this challenge, we present CHAI (consensus Clustering tHrough similArIty matrix integratIon for single cell type identification), a wisdom of crowds approach for scRNAseq clustering. CHAI presents two competing methods which aggregate the clustering results from seven state of the art clustering methods: CHAI-AvgSim and CHAI-SNF. Both methods demonstrate improved performance on a diverse selection of benchmarking datasets, besides also outperforming a previous consensus clustering method. We demonstrate CHAI's practical use case by identifying a leader tumor cell cluster enriched with CDH3. CHAI provides a platform for multiomic integration, and we demonstrate CHAI-SNF to have improved performance when including spatial transcriptomics data. CHAI is intuitive and easily customizable; it provides a way for users to add their own clustering methods to the pipeline, or down-select just the ones they want to use for the clustering aggregation.

38575988,GBA1 as a risk gene for osteoporosis in the specific populations and its role in the development of Gaucher disease.,Orphanet J Rare Dis,"Osteoporosis and its primary complication, fragility fractures, contribute to substantial global morbidity and mortality. Gaucher disease (GD) is caused by glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) deficiency, leading to skeletal complications. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the GBA1 gene on osteoporosis progression in GD patients and the specific populations.We selected 8115 patients with osteoporosis (T-score ≤ - 2.5) and 55,942 healthy individuals (T-score > - 1) from a clinical database (N = 95,223). Monocytes from GD patients were evaluated in relation to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inflammasome activation, and osteoclastogenesis. An in vitro model of GD patient's cells treated with adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-GBA1 to assess GBA1 enzyme activity, chitotriosidase activity, ER stress, and osteoclast differentiation. Longitudinal dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data tracking bone density in patients with Gaucher disease (GD) undergoing enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) over an extended period.The GBA1 gene variant rs11264345 was significantly associated [P < 0.002, Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.06] with an increased risk of bone disease. Upregulation of Calnexin, NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) and Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC) was positively associated with osteoclastogenesis in patients with GD. In vitro AAV9-GBA1 treatment of GD patient cells led to enhanced GBA1 enzyme activity, reduced chitotriosidase activity, diminished ER stress, and decreased osteoclast differentiation. Long-term bone density data suggests that initiating ERT earlier in GD leads to greater improvements in bone density.Elevated ER stress and inflammasome activation are indicative of osteoporosis development, suggesting the need for clinical monitoring of patients with GD. Furthermore, disease-associated variant in the GBA1 gene may constitute a risk factor predisposing specific populations to osteoporosis.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.8651650501197027e-49
38602904,Hox gene-specific cellular targeting using split intein Trojan exons.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"The Trojan exon method, which makes use of intronically inserted T2A-Gal4 cassettes, has been widely used inDrosophilato create thousands of gene-specific Gal4 driver lines. These dual-purpose lines provide genetic access to specific cell types based on their expression of a native gene while simultaneously mutating one allele of the gene to enable loss-of-function analysis in homozygous animals. While this dual use is often an advantage, the truncation mutations produced by Trojan exons are sometimes deleterious in heterozygotes, perhaps by creating translation products with dominant negative effects. Such mutagenic effects can cause developmental lethality as has been observed with genes encoding essential transcription factors. Given the importance of transcription factors in specifying cell type, alternative techniques for generating specific Gal4 lines that target them are required. Here, we introduce a modified Trojan exon method that retains the targeting fidelity and plug-and-play modularity of the original method but mitigates its mutagenic effects by exploiting the self-splicing capabilities of split inteins. ""Split Intein Trojan exons"" (siTrojans) ensure that the two truncation products generated from the interrupted allele of the native gene are trans-spliced to create a full-length native protein. We demonstrate the efficacy of siTrojans by generating a comprehensive toolkit of Gal4 and Split Gal4 lines for the segmentally expressed Hox transcription factors and illustrate their use in neural circuit mapping by targeting neurons according to their position along the anterior-posterior axis. Both the method and the Hox gene-specific toolkit introduced here should be broadly useful.",8.528383097086071e-41

A mechanistic understanding of circuit function is predicated on linking the genetic and physiological properties of individual neurons. However, it remains highly challenging to map the functional properties of transcriptionally heterogeneous neuronal subtypes in mammalian cortical circuitsin vivo. Here, we introduce a high-throughput two-photon nuclear phototagging (2P-NucTag) approach optimized for on-demand and indelible labeling of single neurons via a photoactivatable red fluorescent protein followingin vivofunctional characterization in behaving mice. We demonstrate the utility of this function-forward pipeline by selectively labeling and transcriptionally profiling previously inaccessible 'place' and 'silent' cells in the mouse hippocampus. Our results reveal unexpected differences in gene expression between these hippocampal pyramidal neurons with distinct spatial coding properties. Thus, 2P-NucTag opens a new way to uncover the molecular principles that govern the functional organization of neural circuits.",2.0986327328326464e-28
38585909,Lineage-tracing reveals an expanded population of NPY neurons in the inferior colliculus.,bioRxiv,"Growing evidence suggests that neuropeptide signaling shapes auditory computations. We previously showed that neuropeptide Y (NPY) is expressed in the inferior colliculus (IC) by a population of GABAergic stellate neurons and that NPY regulates the strength of local excitatory circuits in the IC. NPY neurons were initially characterized using the NPY-hrGFP reporter mouse, in which hrGFP expression indicates NPY expression at the time of assay, i.e., an expression-tracking approach. However, studies in other brain regions have shown that NPY expression can vary based on a range of factors, suggesting that the NPY-hrGFP mouse might miss NPY neurons not expressing NPY proximal to the experiment date. Here, we hypothesized that neurons with the ability to express NPY represent a larger population of IC GABAergic neurons than previously reported. To test this hypothesis, we used a lineage-tracing approach to irreversibly tag neurons that expressed NPY at any point prior to the experiment date. We then compared the physiological and anatomical features of neurons labeled with this lineage-tracing approach to our prior data set, revealing a larger population of NPY neurons than previously found. In addition, we used optogenetics to test the local connectivity of NPY neurons and found that NPY neurons routinely provide inhibitory synaptic input to other neurons in the ipsilateral IC. Together, our data expand the definition of NPY neurons in the IC, suggest that NPY expression might be dynamically regulated in the IC, and provide functional evidence that NPY neurons form local inhibitory circuits in the IC.",2.0416844854664998e-44

Recent findings have demonstrated how mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) defects increase the energetic cost of living, and that excessive integrated stress response (ISR) signaling may prevent cellular identity transitions during development. In this perspective, we discuss general bioenergetic principles of life transitions and the costly molecular processes involved in reprograming the cellular hardware/software as cells shift identity. The energetic cost of cellular differentiation has not been directly quantified, representing a gap in knowledge. We propose that the ISR is an energetic checkpoint evolved to i) prevent OxPhos-deficient cells from engaging in excessively costly transitions, and ii) allow ISR-positive cells to recruit systemic energetic resources by signaling via the brain.",4.5201095316213855e-23
38641663,"SUMO protease FUG1, histone reader AL3 and chromodomain protein LHP1 are integral to repeat expansion-induced gene silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana.",Nat Plants,"Epigenetic gene silencing induced by expanded repeats can cause diverse phenotypes ranging from severe growth defects in plants to genetic diseases such as Friedreich's ataxia in humans. The molecular mechanisms underlying repeat expansion-induced epigenetic silencing remain largely unknown. Using a plant model with a temperature-sensitive phenotype, we have previously shown that expanded repeats can induce small RNAs, which in turn can lead to epigenetic silencing through the RNA-dependent DNA methylation pathway. Here, using a genetic suppressor screen and yeast two-hybrid assays, we identified novel components required for epigenetic silencing caused by expanded repeats. We show that FOURTH ULP GENE CLASS 1 (FUG1)-an uncharacterized SUMO protease with no known role in gene silencing-is required for epigenetic silencing caused by expanded repeats. In addition, we demonstrate that FUG1 physically interacts with ALFIN-LIKE 3 (AL3)-a histone reader that is known to bind to active histone mark H3K4me2/3. Loss of function of AL3 abolishes epigenetic silencing caused by expanded repeats. AL3 physically interacts with the chromodomain protein LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN 1 (LHP1)-known to be associated with the spread of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3to cause repeat expansion-induced epigenetic silencing. Loss of any of these components suppresses repeat expansion-associated phenotypes coupled with an increase in IIL1 expression with the reversal of gene silencing and associated change in epigenetic marks. Our findings suggest that the FUG1-AL3-LHP1 module is essential to confer repeat expansion-associated epigenetic silencing and highlight the importance of post-translational modifiers and histone readers in epigenetic silencing.© 2024.

There is emerging evidence of different pathophysiological mechanisms driving the wide array of symptoms in LC. Understanding the relationships between mechanisms and symptoms helps in guiding clinical management and identifying potential treatment targets.This was a mixed-methods systematic review with two stages: Stage one (Review 1) included only existing systematic reviews (meta-review) and Stage two (Review 2) was a review of all primary studies. The search strategy involved Medline, Embase, Emcare, and CINAHL databases to identify studies that described symptoms and pathophysiological mechanisms with statistical analysis and/or discussion of plausible causal relationships between mechanisms and symptoms. Only studies that included a control arm for comparison were included. Studies were assessed for quality using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tools.19 systematic reviews were included in Review 1 and 46 primary studies in Review 2. Overall, the quality of reporting across the studies included in this second review was moderate to poor. The pathophysiological mechanisms with strong evidence were immune system dysregulation, cerebral hypoperfusion, and impaired gas transfer in the lungs. Other mechanisms with moderate to weak evidence were endothelial damage and hypercoagulation, mast cell activation, and auto-immunity to vascular receptors.LC is a complex condition affecting multiple organs with diverse clinical presentations (or traits) underpinned by multiple pathophysiological mechanisms.

However, the function of cuproptosis in the immune characteristics of sepsis remains unclear.We obtained two sepsis datasets (GSE9960 and GSE134347) from the GEO database and classified the raw data with R packages. Cuproptosis-related genes were manually curated, and differentially expressed cuproptosis-related genes (DECuGs) were identified. Afterwards, we applied enrichment analysis and identified key DECuGs by performing machine learning techniques. Then, the immune cell infiltrations and correlation between DECuGs and immunocyte features were created by the CIBERSORT algorithm. Subsequently, unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was performed based on key DECuGs. We then constructed a ceRNA network based on key DECuGs by using multi-step computational strategies and predicted potential drugs in the DrugBank database. Finally, the role of these key genes in immune cells was validated at the single-cell RNA level between septic patients and healthy controls.Overall, 16 DECuGs were obtained, and most of them had lower expression levels in sepsis samples. Afterwards, we obtained six key DECuGs by performing machine learning. Then, the LIPT1-T-cell CD4 memory resting was the most positively correlated DECuG-immunocyte pair. Subsequently, two different subclusters were identified by six DECuGs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that there were different immune characteristics between the two subclusters. Moreover, we identified the key lncRNA OIP5-AS1 within the ceRNA network and obtained 4 drugs that may represent novel drugs for sepsis. Finally, these key DECuGs were statistically significantly dysregulated in another validation set and showed a major distribution in monocytes, T cells, B cells, NK cells and platelets at the single-cell RNA level.These findings suggest that cuproptosis might promote the progression of sepsis by affecting the immune system and metabolic dysfunction, which provides a new direction for understanding potential pathogenic processes and therapeutic targets in sepsis.© 2024 The Authors.",5.413115964599272e-60

Through genetic fine-mapping analyses, we identified a new independent childhood ALL risk signal near IKZF1 in self-reported Hispanic/Latino individuals, but not in non-Hispanic White individuals, with an effect size of ∼1.44 (95% confidence interval = 1.33-1.55) and a risk allele frequency of ∼18% in Hispanic/Latino populations and <0.5% in European populations. This risk allele was positively associated with Indigenous American ancestry, showed evidence of selection in human history, and was associated with reduced IKZF1 expression. We identified a putative causal variant in a downstream enhancer that is most active in pro-B cells and interacts with the IKZF1 promoter. This variant disrupts IKZF1 autoregulation at this enhancer and results in reduced enhancer activity in B cell progenitors. Our study reveals a genetic basis for the increased ALL risk in Hispanic/Latino children.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",1.077748490125791e-07

Improvements in data quality and costs have heightened interest in using long-read sequencing (LRS) to streamline clinical genomic testing, but the absence of control datasets for variant filtering and prioritization has made tertiary analysis of LRS data challenging. To address this, the 1000 Genomes Project ONT Sequencing Consortium aims to generate LRS data from at least 800 of the 1000 Genomes Project samples. Our goal is to use LRS to identify a broader spectrum of variation so we may improve our understanding of normal patterns of human variation. Here, we present data from analysis of the first 100 samples, representing all 5 superpopulations and 19 subpopulations. These samples, sequenced to an average depth of coverage of 37x and sequence read N50 of 54 kbp, have high concordance with previous studies for identifying single nucleotide and indel variants outside of homopolymer regions. Using multiple structural variant (SV) callers, we identify an average of 24,543 high-confidence SVs per genome, including shared and private SVs likely to disrupt gene function as well as pathogenic expansions within disease-associated repeats that were not detected using short reads. Evaluation of methylation signatures revealed expected patterns at known imprinted loci, samples with skewed X-inactivation patterns, and novel differentially methylated regions.

38598563,DeepDynaForecast: Phylogenetic-informed graph deep learning for epidemic transmission dynamic prediction.,PLoS Comput Biol,"In the midst of an outbreak or sustained epidemic, reliable prediction of transmission risks and patterns of spread is critical to inform public health programs. Projections of transmission growth or decline among specific risk groups can aid in optimizing interventions, particularly when resources are limited. Phylogenetic trees have been widely used in the detection of transmission chains and high-risk populations. Moreover, tree topology and the incorporation of population parameters (phylodynamics) can be useful in reconstructing the evolutionary dynamics of an epidemic across space and time among individuals. We now demonstrate the utility of phylodynamic trees for transmission modeling and forecasting, developing a phylogeny-based deep learning system, referred to as DeepDynaForecast. Our approach leverages a primal-dual graph learning structure with shortcut multi-layer aggregation, which is suited for the early identification and prediction of transmission dynamics in emerging high-risk groups. We demonstrate the accuracy of DeepDynaForecast using simulated outbreak data and the utility of the learned model using empirical, large-scale data from the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic in Florida between 2012 and 2020.

38698344,Patient-derived castration-resistant prostate cancer model revealed CTBP2 upregulation mediated by OCT1 and androgen receptor.,BMC Cancer,"Prostate cancer is dependent on androgen receptor (AR) signaling, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has proven effective in targeting prostate cancer. However, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) eventually emerges. AR signaling inhibitors (ARSI) have been also used, but resistance to these agents develops due to genetic AR alterations and epigenetic dysregulation.In this study, we investigated the role of OCT1, a member of the OCT family, in an AR-positive CRPC patient-derived xenograft established from a patient with resistance to ARSI and chemotherapy. We conducted a genome-wide analysis chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing and bioinformatic analyses using public database.Genome-wide analysis of OCT1 target genes in PDX 201.1 A revealed distinct OCT1 binding sites compared to treatment-naïve cells. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that OCT1-regulated genes were associated with cell migration and immune system regulation. In particular, C-terminal Binding Protein 2 (CTBP2), an OCT1/AR target gene, was correlated with poor prognosis and immunosuppressive effects in the tumor microenvironment. Metascape revealed that CTBP2 knockdown affects genes related to the immune response to bacteria. Furthermore, TISIDB analysis suggested the relationship between CTBP2 expression and immune cell infiltration in prostate cancer, suggesting that it may contribute to immune evasion in CRPC.Our findings shed light on the genome-wide network of OCT1 and AR in AR-positive CRPC and highlight the potential role of CTBP2 in immune response and tumor progression. Targeting CTBP2 may represent a promising therapeutic approach for aggressive AR-positive CRPC. Further validation will be required to explore novel therapeutic strategies for CRPC management.© 2024.

38547422,Toward Informed Selection and Interpretation of Clinical Genomic Tests in Prostate Cancer.,JCO Precis Oncol,"Clinical genomic testing of patient germline, tumor tissue, or plasma cell-free DNA can enable a personalized approach to cancer management and treatment. In prostate cancer (PCa), broad genotyping tests are now widely used to identify germline and/or somatic alterations inBRCA2and other DNA damage repair genes. Alterations in these genes can confer cancer sensitivity to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, are linked with poor prognosis, and can have potential hereditary cancer implications for family members. However, there is huge variability in genomic tests and reporting standards, meaning that for successful implementation of testing in clinical practice, end users must carefully select the most appropriate test for a given patient and critically interpret the results. In this white paper, we outline key pre- and post-test considerations for choosing a genomic test and evaluating reported variants, specifically for patients with advanced PCa. Test choice must be based on clinical context and disease state, availability and suitability of tumor tissue, and the genes and regions that are covered by the test. We describe strategies to recognize false positives or negatives in test results, including frameworks to assess low tumor fraction, subclonal alterations, clonal hematopoiesis, and pathogenic versus nonpathogenic variants. We assume that improved understanding among health care professionals and researchers of the nuances associated with genomic testing will ultimately lead to optimal patient care and clinical decision making.",1.1330473630308666e-38
38744843,GRouNdGAN: GRN-guided simulation of single-cell RNA-seq data using causal generative adversarial networks.,Nat Commun,"We introduce GRouNdGAN, a gene regulatory network (GRN)-guided reference-based causal implicit generative model for simulating single-cell RNA-seq data, in silico perturbation experiments, and benchmarking GRN inference methods. Through the imposition of a user-defined GRN in its architecture, GRouNdGAN simulates steady-state and transient-state single-cell datasets where genes are causally expressed under the control of their regulating transcription factors (TFs). Training on six experimental reference datasets, we show that our model captures non-linear TF-gene dependencies and preserves gene identities, cell trajectories, pseudo-time ordering, and technical and biological noise, with no user manipulation and only implicit parameterization. GRouNdGAN can synthesize cells under new conditions to perform in silico TF knockout experiments. Benchmarking various GRN inference algorithms reveals that GRouNdGAN effectively bridges the existing gap between simulated and biological data benchmarks of GRN inference algorithms, providing gold standard ground truth GRNs and realistic cells corresponding to the biological system of interest.© 2024.

Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) currently indicated for asthma or allergic rhinitis, may provide an additional therapeutic approach.The study aimed to evaluate the effects of montelukast on the relapses of people with MS (pwMS).In this retrospective case-control study, two independent longitudinal claims datasets were used to emulate randomized clinical trials (RCTs). We identified pwMS aged 18-65 years, on MS disease-modifying therapies concomitantly, in de-identified claims from Optum's Clinformatics®Data Mart (CDM) and IQVIA PharMetrics®Plus for Academics. Cases included 483 pwMS on montelukast and with medication adherence in CDM and 208 in PharMetrics Plus for Academics. We randomly sampled controls from 35,330 pwMS without montelukast prescriptions in CDM and 10,128 in PharMetrics Plus for Academics. Relapses were measured over a 2-year period through inpatient hospitalization and corticosteroid claims. A doubly robust causal inference model estimated the effects of montelukast, adjusting for confounders and censored patients.pwMS treated with montelukast demonstrated a statistically significant 23.6% reduction in relapses compared to non-users in 67.3% of emulated RCTs.Real-world evidence suggested that montelukast reduces MS relapses, warranting future clinical trials and further research on LTRAs' potential mechanism in MS.",0.24688155831667688
38605640,Self-supervised learning on millions of primary RNA sequences from 72 vertebrates improves sequence-based RNA splicing prediction.,Brief Bioinform,"Language models pretrained by self-supervised learning (SSL) have been widely utilized to study protein sequences, while few models were developed for genomic sequences and were limited to single species. Due to the lack of genomes from different species, these models cannot effectively leverage evolutionary information. In this study, we have developed SpliceBERT, a language model pretrained on primary ribonucleic acids (RNA) sequences from 72 vertebrates by masked language modeling, and applied it to sequence-based modeling of RNA splicing. Pretraining SpliceBERT on diverse species enables effective identification of evolutionarily conserved elements. Meanwhile, the learned hidden states and attention weights can characterize the biological properties of splice sites. As a result, SpliceBERT was shown effective on several downstream tasks: zero-shot prediction of variant effects on splicing, prediction of branchpoints in humans, and cross-species prediction of splice sites. Our study highlighted the importance of pretraining genomic language models on a diverse range of species and suggested that SSL is a promising approach to enhance our understanding of the regulatory logic underlying genomic sequences.© The Author(s) 2024.

38617211,A Regularized Cox Hierarchical Model for Incorporating Annotation Information in Predictive Omic Studies.,bioRxiv,"Associated with high-dimensional omics data there are often ""meta-features"" such as biological pathways and functional annotations, summary statistics from similar studies that can be informative for predicting an outcome of interest. We introduce a regularized hierarchical framework for integrating meta-features, with the goal of improving prediction and feature selection performance with time-to-event outcomes.A hierarchical framework is deployed to incorporate meta-features. Regularization is applied to the omic features as well as the meta-features so that high-dimensional data can be handled at both levels. The proposed hierarchical Cox model can be efficiently fitted by a combination of iterative reweighted least squares and cyclic coordinate descent.In a simulation study we show that when the external meta-features are informative, the regularized hierarchical model can substantially improve prediction performance over standard regularized Cox regression. We illustrate the proposed model with applications to breast cancer and melanoma survival based on gene expression profiles, which show the improvement in prediction performance by applying meta-features, as well as the discovery of important omic feature sets with sparse regularization at meta-feature level.The proposed hierarchical regularized regression model enables integration of external meta-feature information directly into the modeling process for time-to-event outcomes, improves prediction performance when the external meta-feature data is informative. Importantly, when the external meta-features are uninformative, the prediction performance based on the regularized hierarchical model is on par with standard regularized Cox regression, indicating robustness of the framework. In addition to developing predictive signatures, the model can also be deployed in discovery applications where the main goal is to identify important features associated with the outcome rather than developing a predictive model.",3.735120407163523e-18
38527459,"Comprehensive Assessment of Ischemic Stroke in Nonhuman Primates: Neuroimaging, Behavioral, and Serum Proteomic Analysis.",ACS Chem Neurosci,"Ischemic strokes, prevalence and impactful, underscore the necessity of advanced research models closely resembling human physiology. Our study utilizes nonhuman primates (NHPs) to provide a detailed exploration of ischemic stroke, integrating neuroimaging data, behavioral outcomes, and serum proteomics to elucidate the complex interplay of factors involved in stroke pathophysiology. We observed a consistent pattern in infarct volume, peaking at 1-month postmiddle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and then stabilized. This pattern was strongly correlated to notable changes in motor function and working memory performance. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we detected significant alterations in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) values, signaling microstructural changes in the brain. These alterations closely correlated with the neurological and cognitive deficits that we observed, highlighting the sensitivity of DTI metrics in stroke assessment. Behaviorally, the monkeys exhibited a reliance on their unaffected limb for compensatory movements, a common response to stroke impairment. This adaptation, along with consistent DTI findings, suggests a significant impact of stroke on motor function and spatial perception. Proteomic analysis through MS/MS functional enrichment identified two distinct groups of proteins with significant changes post-MCAO. Notably, MMP9, THBS1, MB, PFN1, and YWHAZ were identified as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke. Our results underscore the complex nature of stroke and advocate for an integrated approach, combining neuroimaging, behavioral studies, and proteomics, for advancing our understanding and treatment of this condition.",4.413328592456087e-29
38506069,Mendelian randomization analysis reveals a causal effect of Streptococcus salivarius on diabetic retinopathy through regulating host fasting glucose.,J Cell Mol Med,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of leading causes of vision loss in adults with increasing prevalence worldwide. Increasing evidence has emphasized the importance of gut microbiome in the aetiology and development of DR. However, the causal relationship between gut microbes and DR remains largely unknown. To investigate the causal associations of DR with gut microbes and DR risk factors, we employed two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses to estimate the causal effects of 207 gut microbes on DR outcomes. Inputs for MR included Genome-wide Association Study (GWAS) summary statistics of 207 taxa of gut microbes (the Dutch Microbiome Project) and 21 risk factors for DR. The GWAS summary statistics data of DR was from the FinnGen Research Project. Data analysis was performed in May 2023. We identified eight bacterial taxa that exhibited significant causal associations with DR (FDR < 0.05). Among them, genus Collinsella and species Collinsella aerofaciens were associated with increased risk of DR, while the species Bacteroides faecis, Burkholderiales bacterium_1_1_47, Ruminococcus torques, Streptococcus salivarius, genus Burkholderiales_noname and family Burkholderiales_noname showed protective effects against DR. Notably, we found that the causal effect of species Streptococcus salivarius on DR was mediated through the level of host fasting glucose, a well-established risk factor for DR. Our results reveal that specific gut microbes may be causally linked to DR via mediating host metabolic risk factors, highlighting potential novel therapeutic or preventive targets for DR.© 2024 The Authors.

38540157,Long Intergenic Non-Coding RNAs of Human Chromosome 18: Focus on Cancers.,Biomedicines,"Malignant neoplasms are characterized by high molecular heterogeneity due to multilevel deregulation of gene expression and cellular functions. It is known that non-coding RNAs, including long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), can play significant roles in cancer biology. The current review focuses on a systematical analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, interactomic, and literature data on 65 lincRNAs of human chromosome 18 in the context of pan-cancer studies. The entire group of lincRNAs can be conditionally divided into 4 subgroups depending on experimental evidence on direct or indirect involvement in cancers and the biological associations with cancers, which we found during the data-mining process: the most studied (5 lincRNAs), moderately or poorly studied (11 lincRNAs), and understudied (31 lincRNAs). For the remaining 18 lincRNAs, data for analysis were fragmentary or missing. Among the key findings were the following: Of the lincRNAs of human chromosome 18, 40% have tissue-specific expression patterns, 22% of lincRNAs are known to have gene fusions, 40% of lincRNAs are prone to gene amplifications and/or deletions in cancers at a frequency greater than 3%, and 23% of lincRNAs are differentially expressed across cancer types, whereas 7% have subtype-specific expression patterns. LincRNAs' interactomes consist of 'master' microRNAs and 47 proteins (including cancer-associated proteins and microRNAs) that can interact with 3 or more lincRNAs. Functional enrichment analysis of a set of highly co-expressed genes retrieved for 17 lincRNAs in different cancer types indicated the potential associations of these lincRNAs with cellular signaling pathways. Six lincRNAs encoded small open-reading frame (smORF) proteins with emerging roles in cancers, and microRNAs as well as proteins with known functions in molecular carcinogenesis can bind to coding regions of smORFs. We identified seven transcriptomic signatures with potential prognostic value, consisting of two to seven different lincRNAs only. Taken together, the literature, biomedical, and molecular biology data analyzed indicated that only five of all lincRNAs of human chromosome 18 are cancer-associated, while eleven other lincRNAs have the tendency to be associated with cancers.",1.2673547241874586e-54
38637528,LKRSDH-dependent histone modifications of insulin-like peptide sites contribute to age-related circadian rhythm changes.,Nat Commun,"To understand aging impact on the circadian rhythm, we screened for factors influencing circadian changes during aging. Our findings reveal that LKRSDH mutation significantly reduces rhythmicity in aged flies. RNA-seq identifies a significant increase in insulin-like peptides (dilps) in LKRSDH mutants due to the combined effects of H3R17me2 and H3K27me3 on transcription. Genetic evidence suggests that LKRSDH regulates age-related circadian rhythm changes through art4 and dilps. ChIP-seq analyzes whole genome changes in H3R17me2 and H3K27me3 histone modifications in young and old flies with LKRSDH mutation and controls. The results reveal a correlation between H3R17me2 and H3K27me3, underscoring the role of LKRSDH in regulating gene expression and modification levels during aging. Overall, our study demonstrates that LKRSDH-dependent histone modifications at dilps sites contribute to age-related circadian rhythm changes. This data offers insights and a foundational reference for aging research by unveiling the relationship between LKRSDH and H3R17me2/H3K27me3 histone modifications in aging.© 2024.

38605409,The 37TrillionCells initiative for improving global healthcare via cell-based interception and precision medicine: focus on neurodegenerative diseases.,Mol Brain,"One of the main burdens in the treatment of diseases is imputable to the delay between the appearance of molecular dysfunctions in the first affected disease cells and their presence in sufficient number for detection in specific tissues or organs. This delay obviously plays in favor of disease progression to an extent that makes efficient treatments difficult, as they arrive too late. The development of a novel medical strategy, termed cell-based interception and precision medicine, seeks to identify dysfunctional cells early, when tissue damages are not apparent and symptoms not yet present, and develop therapies to treat diseases early. Central to this strategy is the use of single-cell technologies that allow detection of molecular changes in cells at the time of phenotypical bifurcation from health to disease. In this article we describe a general procedure to support such an approach applied to neurodegenerative disorders. This procedure combines four components directed towards highly complementary objectives: 1) a high-performance single-cell proteomics (SCP) method (Detect), 2) the development of disease experimental cell models and predictive computational models of cell trajectories (Understand), 3) the discovery of specific targets and personalized therapies (Cure), and 4) the creation of a community of collaborating laboratories to accelerate the development of this novel medical paradigm (Collaborate). A global initiative named 37TrillionCells (37TC) was launched to advance the development of cell-based interception and precision medicine.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.405917936425789e-36
38505010,Developing technologies and areas of interest in lung cancer screening adjuncts.,J Thorac Dis,"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality. Screening guidelines have been implemented in the past decade to aid in earlier detection of at-risk groups. Nevertheless, computed tomography (CT) scans, the principal screening modality in use today, are still low yield, with 3.6% of lung cancer confirmed amongst 39.1% of lesions detected over a 3-year period. They also carry relatively high false positive rates, between 9% and 27%, which can bear unnecessary financial and emotional costs to patients. As such, research efforts have been dedicated to the development of lung cancer screening adjuncts to improve detection reliability. We herein review several emerging technologies in this specific arena and their efficacy. These include plasma markers (microDNA, DNA methylation, and tumor-associated antibodies), breath/sputum biomarkers [volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC)], proteomics, metabolomics, and machine learning, such as radiomics technology. We find that, across the board, they offer promising results in terms of non-invasive diagnostics, genetic sequencing for higher-risk individuals, and accessibility for a diverse cohort of patients. While these screening adjuncts are unlikely to completely replace the current standard of care at the moment, continued research into these technologies is crucial to improve and personalize the identification, treatment, and outcome of lung cancer patients in the near future.2024 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

38719804,MeCP2 binds to methylated DNA independently of phase separation and heterochromatin organisation.,Nat Commun,"Correlative evidence has suggested that the methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 contributes to the formation of heterochromatin condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation. This interpretation has been reinforced by the observation that heterochromatin, DNA methylation and MeCP2 co-localise within prominent foci in mouse cells. The findings presented here revise this view. MeCP2 localisation is independent of heterochromatin as MeCP2 foci persist even when heterochromatin organisation is disrupted. Additionally, MeCP2 foci fail to show hallmarks of phase separation in live cells. Importantly, we find that mouse cellular models are highly atypical as MeCP2 distribution is diffuse in most mammalian species, including humans. Notably, MeCP2 foci are absent in Mus spretus which is a mouse subspecies lacking methylated satellite DNA repeats. We conclude that MeCP2 has no intrinsic tendency to form condensates and its localisation is independent of heterochromatin. Instead, the distribution of MeCP2 in the nucleus is primarily determined by global DNA methylation patterns.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.121791948722848e-27

Herein, we conducted a genome survey sequencing inN. brevirostrisand determined genome size, explored repetitive elements, assembled and annotated the 45S rRNA DNA operon, and assembled and described in detail the mitochondrial genome. Lastly, the phylogenetic position ofN. brevirostrisin the family Carcharhinidae was examined using translated protein coding genes. The estimated haploid genome size ranged between 2.29 and 2.58 Gbp using a k-mer analysis, which is slightly below the genome size estimated for other sharks belonging to the family Carcharhinidae. Using a k-mer analysis, approx. 64-71 % of the genome ofN. brevirostriswas composed of repetitive elements. A relatively large proportion of the 'repeatome' could not be annotated. Taking into account only annotated repetitive elements, Class I - Long Interspersed Nuclear Element (LINE) were the most abundant repetitive elements followed by Class I - Penelope and Satellite DNA. The nuclear ribosomal operon was fully assembled. The AT-rich complete mitochondrial genome was 16,703 bp long and encoded 13 protein coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNA genes.Negaprion brevirostrisis closely related to the generaCarcharhinus,GlyphisandLamiopsisin the family Carcharinidae.

However, computational methods for analyzing spatially continuous variations in tissue microenvironment are still lacking. Here we present ONTraC as a strategy that constructs niche trajectories using a graph neural network-based modeling framework. Our benchmark analysis shows that ONTraC performs more favorably than existing methods for reconstructing spatial trajectories. Applications of ONTraC to public spatial transcriptomics datasets successfully recapitulated the underlying anatomical structure, and further enabled detection of tissue microenvironment-dependent changes in gene regulatory networks and cell-cell interaction activities during embryonic development.

38710690,Disentangling genetic effects on transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation through integrating exon and intron expression QTLs.,Nat Commun,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies typically consider exon expression of genes and discard intronic RNA sequencing reads despite their information on RNA metabolism. Here, we quantify genetic effects on exon and intron levels of genes and their ratio in lymphoblastoid cell lines, revealing thousands of cis-QTLs of each type. While genetic effects are often shared between cis-QTL types, 7814 (47%) are not detected as top cis-QTLs at exon levels. We show that exon levels preferentially capture genetic effects on transcriptional regulation, while exon-intron-ratios better detect those on co- and post-transcriptional processes. Considering all cis-QTL types substantially increases (by 71%) the number of colocalizing variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It further allows dissecting the potential gene regulatory processes underlying GWAS associations, suggesting comparable contributions by transcriptional (50%) and co- and post-transcriptional regulation (46%) to complex traits. Overall, integrating intronic RNA sequencing reads in eQTL studies expands our understanding of genetic effects on gene regulatory processes.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.6645216388197366e-24

We sought to fine-map all known CRC risk loci using GWAS data from 100,204 cases and 154,587 controls of East Asian and European ancestry. Our stepwise conditional analyses revealed 238 independent association signals of CRC risk, each with a set of credible causal variants (CCVs), of which 28 signals had a single CCV. Our cis-eQTL/mQTL and colocalization analyses using colorectal tissue-specific transcriptome and methylome data separately from 1299 and 321 individuals, along with functional genomic investigation, uncovered 136 putative CRC susceptibility genes, including 56 genes not previously reported. Analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data from colorectal tissues revealed 17 putative CRC susceptibility genes with distinct expression patterns in specific cell types. Analyses of whole exome sequencing data provided additional support for several target genes identified in this study as CRC susceptibility genes.

38510151,N6-methyladenosine-associated genetic variants in NECTIN2 and HPCAL1 are risk factors for abdominal aortic aneurysm.,iScience,"Although N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification has been implicated in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), the relationship between m6A-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (m6A-SNPs) and AAA remains unknown. This study used integrative multi-omics analysis and clinical validation approaches to systematically identify potential m6A-SNPs connected with AAA risk. We found that rs6859 and rs10198139 could modulate the expression of local genes, NECTIN2 and HPCAL1, respectively, which exhibited upregulation in AAA tissues, and their risk variants were significantly correlated with an increased susceptibility to AAA. Incorporating rs6859 and rs10198139 improved the efficiency of AAA risk prediction compared to the model considering only conventional risk factors. Additionally, these two SNPs were predicted to be located within the regulatory sequences, and rs6859 showed a substantial impact on m6A modification levels. Our findings suggest that m6A-SNPs rs6859 and rs10198139 confer an elevated risk of AAA, possibly by promoting local gene expression through an m6A-mediated manner.© 2024 The Author(s).",3.048374562162255e-44
38656237,Dependence of nucleosome mechanical stability on DNA mismatches.,Elife,"The organization of nucleosomes into chromatin and their accessibility are shaped by local DNA mechanics. Conversely, nucleosome positions shape genetic variations, which may originate from mismatches during replication and chemical modification of DNA. To investigate how DNA mismatches affect the mechanical stability and the exposure of nucleosomal DNA, we used an optical trap combined with single-molecule FRET and a single-molecule FRET cyclization assay. We found that a single base-pair C-C mismatch enhances DNA bendability and nucleosome mechanical stability for the 601-nucleosome positioning sequence. An increase in force required for DNA unwrapping from the histone core is observed for single base-pair C-C mismatches placed at three tested positions: at the inner turn, at the outer turn, or at the junction of the inner and outer turn of the nucleosome. The results support a model where nucleosomal DNA accessibility is reduced by mismatches, potentially explaining the preferred accumulation of single-nucleotide substitutions in the nucleosome core and serving as the source of genetic variation during evolution and cancer progression. Mechanical stability of an intact nucleosome, that is mismatch-free, is also dependent on the species as we find that yeast nucleosomes are mechanically less stable and more symmetrical in the outer turn unwrapping compared toXenopusnucleosomes.© 2024, Ngo et al.",1.1800683029195365e-26
38611002,Blood-Based DNA Methylation Analysis by Multiplexed OBBPA-ddPCR to Verify Indications for Prostate Biopsies in Suspected Prostate Cancer Patients.,Cancers (Basel),"Current prostate carcinoma (PCa) biomarkers, including total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), have unsatisfactory diagnostic sensitivity and specificity resulting in overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Previously, we described an optimised bias-based preamplification-digital droplet PCR (OBBPA-ddPCR) technique, which detects tumour DNA in blood-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of cancer patients. The current study investigated the performance of newly developed OBBPA-ddPCR-based biomarkers. Blood plasma samples from healthy individuals (n= 90, controls) and PCa (n= 39) and benign prostatic hyperplasia patients (BPH,n= 40) were analysed. PCa and BPH patients had tPSA values within a diagnostic grey area of 2-15 ng/mL, for whom further diagnostic validation is most crucial. Methylation levels of biomarkersRASSF1A,MIR129-2,NRIP3, andSOX8were found significantly increased in PCa patients compared to controls. By combining classical PCa risk factors (percentage of free PSA compared to tPSA (QfPSA) and patient's age) with cfDNA-based biomarkers, we developed PCa risk scores with improved sensitivity and specificity compared to established tPSA and QfPSA single-marker analyses. The diagnostic specificity was increased to 70% with 100% sensitivity for clinically significant PCa patients. Thus, prostate biopsies could be avoided for 28 out of 40 BPH patients. In conclusion, the newly developed risk scores may help to confirm the clinical decision and prevent unnecessary prostate biopsy.",1.0236943314912389e-14

The AUCs and accuracies were used to compare predictive performances.Patients who developed ACEs presented with a significantly higher surface area and gray level run length matrix run length non-uniformity (GLRLM_RLNU), and lower neighborhood gray-tone difference matrix_coarseness and sphericity than those without ACEs (each, p < 0.05). In the training cohort, all seven ML algorithms had a good classification performance with AUC values of > 0.80 (range: 0.841-0.944). In the testing cohort, the RF algorithm had the highest AUC and accuracy (88.9% [8/9]) with a similar classification performance between training and testing cohorts (AUC: 0.945 vs 0.889). GLRLM_RLNU was the most important feature of the modeling process of this RF algorithm.ML analyses using18F-FDG-PET-based radiomic features may be useful for predicting ACEs in patients with CS.© 2024.

38672542,"Predictors of Survival, Treatment Modalities, and Clinical Outcomes of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma in Patients Older Than 70 Years Still an Unmet Medical Need in 2024 Based on Real-World Evidence.",Cancers (Basel),"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) especially affects the older population. Old (≥60 years) and very old age (≥80 years) DLBCL patients often present high-risk molecular alterations, lower tolerability to conventional immunochemotherapy, and poor clinical outcomes. In this scenario, attenuated therapeutic strategies, such as the R-MiniCHOP and R-MiniCHOP of the elderly regimens, have emerged for this particularly fragile population. However, the responses, clinical outcomes, and toxicities of these regimens currently remain poorly understood, mainly because these individuals are not usually included in controlled clinical trials.This retrospective, observational, and single-center real-world study included 185 DLBCL, NOS patients older than 70 years treated at the largest oncology center in Latin America from 2009 to 2020. We aimed to assess the outcomes, determine survival predictors, and compare responses and toxicities between three different primary therapeutic strategies, including the conventional R-CHOP regimen and the attenuated R-MiniCHOP and R-MiniCHOP of the elderly protocols.The median age at diagnosis was 75 years (70-97 years), and 58.9% were female. Comorbidities were prevalent, including 19.5% with immobility, 28.1% with malnutrition, and 24.8% with polypharmacy. Advanced clinical stage was observed in 72.4%, 48.6% had bulky disease ≥7 cm, 63.2% had B-symptoms, and 67.0% presented intermediate-high/high-risk IPI. With a median follow-up of 6.3 years, the estimated 5-year OS and PFS were 50.2% and 44.6%, respectively. The R-MiniCHOP of the elderly regimen had a lower ORR (p= 0.040); however, patients in this group had higher rates of unfavorable clinical and laboratory findings, including hypoalbuminemia (p= 0.001), IPI ≥ 3 (p= 0.013), and NCCN-IPI ≥ 3 (p= 0.002). Although associated with higher rates of severe neutropenia (p= 0.003), the R-CHOP regimen promoted increased OS (p= 0.003) and PFS (p= 0.005) in comparison to the attenuated protocols. Additionally, age ≥ 75 years, high levels of LDH, B-symptoms, advanced clinical stage (III/IV), neutrophilia, and low lymphocyte/monocyte ratio were identified as poor prognostic factors in this cohort.In this large and real-life Latin American cohort, we demonstrated that patients with DLBCL, NOS older than 70 years still do not have satisfactory clinical outcomes in 2024, with half of cases not reaching 5 years of life expectancy after diagnosis. Although the conventional R-CHOP offers response and survival advantages over attenuated regimens, its myelotoxicity is not negligible. Therefore, the outcomes reported and the prognostic factors here identified may assist clinicians in the appropriate selection of therapeutic strategies adapted to the risk for old and very old DLBCL patients.",2.317694346321518e-49
38653921,Investigation of Metabolic and Inflammatory Disorder in the Aging FGF21 Knockout Mouse.,Inflammation,"Aging is a physiological condition accomplished with persistent low-grade inflammation and metabolic disorders. FGF21 has been reported to act as a potent longevity determinant, involving inflammatory response and energy metabolism. In this study, we engineered aging FGF21 knockout mice of 36-40 weeks and observed that FGF21 deficiency manifests a spontaneous inflammatory response of lung and abnormal accumulation of lipids in liver. On one hand, inflamed state in lungs and increased circulating inflammatory cytokines were found in FGF21 knockout mice of 36-40 weeks. To evaluate the ability of FGF21 to suppress inflammation, a subsequent study found that FGF21 knockout aggravated LPS-induced pulmonary exudation and inflammatory infiltration in mice, while exogenous administration of FGF21 reversed these malignant phenotypes by enhancing microvascular endothelial junction. On the other hand, FGF21 knockout induces fatty liver in aging mice, characterized by excessive accumulation of triglycerides within hepatocytes. Further quantitative metabolomics and lipidomics analysis revealed perturbed metabolic profile in liver lacking FGF21, including disrupted glucose and lipids metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Taken together, this investigation reveals the protective role of FGF21 during aging by weakening the inflammatory response and balancing energy metabolism.© 2024.

38671522,Vpr driving DNA methylation variation of CD4 + T cells in HIV-1 infection.,Virol J,"Despite the existence of available therapeutic interventions for HIV-1, this virus remains a significant global threat, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality. Within HIV-1-infected cells, the accessory viral protein r (Vpr) exerts control over diverse biological processes, including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The regulation of gene expression through DNA methylation plays a crucial role in physiological processes, exerting its influence without altering the underlying DNA sequence. However, a thorough examination of the impact of Vpr on DNA methylation in human CD4 + T cells has not been conducted.In this study, we employed base-resolution whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), real-time quantitative RCR and western blot to explore the effect of Vpr on DNA methylation of host cells under HIV-1 infection.We observed that HIV-1 infection leads to elevated levels of global DNA methylation in primary CD4 + T cells. Specifically, Vpr induces significant modifications in DNA methylation patterns, particularly affecting regions within promoters and gene bodies. These alterations notably influence genes related to immune-related pathways and olfactory receptor activity. Moreover, Vpr demonstrates a distinct ability to diminish the levels of methylation in histone genes.These findings emphasize the significant involvement of Vpr in regulating transcription through the modulation of DNA methylation patterns. Together, the results of this investigation will considerably enhance our understanding of the influence of HIV-1 Vpr on the DNA methylation of host cells, offer potential avenues for the development of more effective treatments.© 2024.

38715052,Diabetes and aortic dissection: unraveling the role of 3-hydroxybutyrate through mendelian randomization.,Cardiovasc Diabetol,"In observational and experimental studies, diabetes has been reported as a protective factor for aortic dissection. 3-Hydroxybutyrate, a key constituent of ketone bodies, has been found to favor improvements in cardiovascular disease. However, whether the protective effect of diabetes on aortic dissection is mediated by 3-hydroxybutyrate is unclear. We aimed to investigate the causal effects of diabetes on the risk of aortic dissection and the mediating role of 3-hydroxybutyrate in them through two-step Mendelian randomization.We performed a two-step Mendelian randomization to investigate the causal connections between diabetes, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and aortic dissection and calculate the mediating effect of 3-hydroxybutyrate. Publicly accessible data for Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, dissection of aorta and 3-hydroxybutyrate were obtained from genome-wide association studies. The association between Type 1 diabetes and dissection of aorta, the association between Type 2 diabetes and dissection of aorta, and mediation effect of 3-hydroxybutyrate were carried out separately.The IVW method showed that Type 1 diabetes was negatively associated with the risk of aortic dissection (OR 0.912, 95% CI 0.836-0.995), The weighted median, simple mode and weighted mode method showed consistent results. The mediated proportion of 3-hydroxybutyrate on the relationship between Type 1 diabetes and dissection of aorta was 24.80% (95% CI 5.12-44.47%). The IVW method showed that Type 2 diabetes was negatively associated with the risk of aortic dissection (OR 0.763, 95% CI 0.607-0.960), The weighted median, simple mode and weighted mode method showed consistent results. 3-Hydroxybutyrate does not have causal mediation effect on the relationship between Type 2 diabetes and dissection of aorta.Mendelian randomization study revealed diabetes as a protective factor for dissection of aorta. The protective effect of type 1 diabetes on aortic dissection was partially mediated by 3-hydroxybutyrate, but type 2 diabetes was not 3-hydroxybutyrate mediated.© 2024.

38528957,A recognition of exosomes as regulators of epigenetic mechanisms in central nervous system diseases.,Front Mol Neurosci,"Exosomes, vesicular structures originating from cells, participate in the conveyance of proteins and nucleic acids. Presently, the centrality of epigenetic modifications in neurological disorders is widely acknowledged. Exosomes exert influence over various epigenetic phenomena, thereby modulating post-transcriptional regulatory processes contingent upon their constituent makeup. Consequently, the heightened attention directed toward exosomes as instigators of epigenetic alterations has burgeoned in recent years. Notably, exosomes serve as vehicles for delivering methyltransferases to recipient cells. More significantly, non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), represent pivotal contents within exosomes, wielding the capacity to influence the expression of diverse factors within the cerebral milieu. The transfer of these exosomal contents amidst brain cells, encompassing neuronal cells and microglia, assumes a critical role in the genesis and progression of neurological disorders, also, this role is not limited to neurological disorders, it may deal with any human disease, such as cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. This review will concentrate on elucidating the regulation of exosome-induced epigenetic events and its subsequent ramifications for neurological diseases. A more profound comprehension of the involvement of exosome-mediated epigenetic regulation in neurological disorders contributes to a heightened awareness of the etiology and advancement of cerebral afflictions.Copyright © 2024 Hu, Feng, Yang, Fan, Gao and Yang.",3.5162720886451195e-49
38515015,Chromatin accessibility and H3K9me3 landscapes reveal long-term epigenetic effects of fetal-neonatal iron deficiency in rat hippocampus.,BMC Genomics,"Iron deficiency (ID) during the fetal-neonatal period results in long-term neurodevelopmental impairments associated with pervasive hippocampal gene dysregulation. Prenatal choline supplementation partially normalizes these effects, suggesting an interaction between iron and choline in hippocampal transcriptome regulation. To understand the regulatory mechanisms, we investigated epigenetic marks of genes with altered chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) or poised to be repressed (H3K9me3 ChIP-seq) in iron-repleted adult rats having experienced fetal-neonatal ID exposure with or without prenatal choline supplementation.Fetal-neonatal ID was induced by limiting maternal iron intake from gestational day (G) 2 through postnatal day (P) 7. Half of the pregnant dams were given supplemental choline (5.0 g/kg) from G11-18. This resulted in 4 groups at P65 (Iron-sufficient [IS], Formerly Iron-deficient [FID], IS with choline [ISch], and FID with choline [FIDch]). Hippocampi were collected from P65 iron-repleted male offspring and analyzed for chromatin accessibility and H3K9me3 enrichment. 22% and 24% of differentially transcribed genes in FID- and FIDch-groups, respectively, exhibited significant differences in chromatin accessibility, whereas 1.7% and 13% exhibited significant differences in H3K9me3 enrichment. These changes mapped onto gene networks regulating synaptic plasticity, neuroinflammation, and reward circuits. Motif analysis of differentially modified genomic sites revealed significantly stronger choline effects than early-life ID and identified multiple epigenetically modified transcription factor binding sites.This study reveals genome-wide, stable epigenetic changes and epigenetically modifiable gene networks associated with specific chromatin marks in the hippocampus, and lays a foundation to further elucidate iron-dependent epigenetic mechanisms that underlie the long-term effects of fetal-neonatal ID, choline, and their interactions.© 2024.

38711042,"Maternal smoking, consumption of alcohol, and caffeinated beverages during pregnancy and the risk of childhood brain tumors: a meta-analysis of observational studies.",BMC Public Health,"We conducted this meta-analysis to investigate the potential association between maternal smoking, alcohol and caffeinated beverages consumption during pregnancy and the risk of childhood brain tumors (CBTs).A thorough search was carried out on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Internet to identify pertinent articles. Fixed or random effects model was applied to meta-analyze the data.The results suggested a borderline statistically significant increased risk of CBTs associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99-1.09). We found that passive smoking (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.20), rather than active smoking (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93-1.07), led to an increased risk of CBTs. The results suggested a higher risk in 0-1 year old children (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.94-1.56), followed by 0-4 years old children (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97-1.28) and 5-9 years old children (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.95-1.29). This meta-analysis found no significant association between maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and CBTs risk (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80-1.24). An increased risk of CBTs was found to be associated with maternal consumption of caffeinated beverages (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07-1.26) during pregnancy, especially coffee (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.38).Maternal passive smoking, consumption of caffeinated beverages during pregnancy should be considered as risk factors for CBTs, especially glioma.

38658966,Causal effect of gut microbiota and diabetic nephropathy: a Mendelian randomization study.,Diabetol Metab Syndr,"The interaction of dysbiosis of gut microbiota (GM) with diabetic nephropathy (DN) drew our attention and a better understanding of GM on DN might provide potential therapeutic approaches. However, the exact causal effect of GM on DN remains unknown.We applied two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis, including inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger methods, etc., to screen the significant bacterial taxa based on the GWAS data. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of MR results. To identify the most critical factor on DN, Mendelian randomization-Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) method was utilized. Then, whether the reverse causality existed was verified by reverse MR analysis. Finally, transcriptome MR analysis was performed to investigate the possible mechanism of GM on DN.At locus-wide significance levels, the results of IVW suggested that order Bacteroidales (odds ratio (OR) = 1.412, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.025-1.945, P = 0.035), genus Akkermansia (OR = 1.449, 95% CI: 1.120-1.875, P = 0.005), genus Coprococcus 1 (OR = 1.328, 95% CI: 1.066-1.793, P = 0.015), genus Marvinbryantia (OR = 1.353, 95% CI: 1.037-1.777, P = 0.030) and genus Parasutterella (OR = 1.276, 95% CI: 1.022-1.593, P = 0.032) were risk factors for DN. Reversely, genus Eubacterium ventriosum (OR = 0.756, 95% CI: 0.594-0.963, P = 0.023), genus Ruminococcus gauvreauii (OR = 0.663, 95% CI: 0.506-0.870, P = 0.003) and genus Erysipelotrichaceae (UCG003) (OR = 0.801, 95% CI: 0.644-0.997, P = 0.047) were negatively associated with the risk of DN. Among these taxa, genus Ruminococcus gauvreauii played a crucial role in DN. No significant heterogeneity or pleiotropy in the MR result was found. Mapped genes (FDR < 0.05) related to GM had causal effects on DN, while FCGR2B and VNN2 might be potential therapeutic targets.This work provided new evidence for the causal effect of GM on DN occurrence and potential biomarkers for DN. The significant bacterial taxa in our study provided new insights for the 'gut-kidney' axis, as well as unconventional prevention and treatment strategies for DN.© 2024.

38627726,Blood lipids mediate the effects of gut microbiome on endometriosis: a mendelian randomization study.,Lipids Health Dis,"There is evidence for an association between the gut microbiome and endometriosis. However, their causal relationship and the mediating role of lipid metabolism remain unclear.Using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relationships between gut microbiome and endometriosis. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was used as the primary model, with other MR models used for comparison. Sensitivity analysis based on different statistical assumptions was used to evaluate whether the results were robust. A two-step MR analysis was further conducted to explore the mediating effects of lipids, by integrating univariable MR and the multivariate MR method based on the Bayesian model averaging method (MR-BMA).We identified four possible intestinal bacteria genera associated with the risk of endometriosis through the IVW method, including Eubacterium ruminantium group (odds ratio [OR] = 0.881, 95% CI: 0.795-0.976, P = 0.015), Anaerotruncus (OR = 1.252, 95% CI: 1.028-1.525, P = 0.025), Olsenella (OR = 1.110, 95% CI: 1.007-1.223, P = 0.036), and Oscillospira (OR = 1.215, 95% CI: 1.014-1.456, P = 0.035). The further two-step MR analysis identified that the effect of Olsenella on endometriosis was mediated by triglycerides (proportion mediated: 3.3%; 95% CI = 1.5-5.1%).This MR study found evidence for specific gut microbiomes associated with the risk of endometriosis, which might partially be mediated by triglycerides.© 2024.

38622701,The impact of lipidome on breast cancer: a Mendelian randomization study.,Lipids Health Dis,"This study aims to investigate the association between specific lipidomes and the risk of breast cancer (BC) using the Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization (TSMR) approach and Bayesian Model Averaging Mendelian Randomization (BMA-MR) method.The study analyzed data from large-scale GWAS datasets of 179 lipidomes to assess the relationship between lipidomes and BC risk across different molecular subtypes. TSMR was employed to explore causal relationships, while the BMA-MR method was carried out to validate the results. The study assessed heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy through Cochran's Q, MR-Egger intercept tests, and MR-PRESSO. Moreover, a leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms on the MR study.By examining 179 lipidome traits as exposures and BC as the outcome, the study revealed significant causal effects of glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and glycerolipids on BC risk. Specifically, for estrogen receptor-positive BC (ER+BC), phosphatidylcholine (P < 0.05) and phosphatidylinositol (OR: 0.916-0.966, P < 0.05) within glycerophospholipids play significant roles, along with the importance of glycerolipids (diacylglycerol (OR = 0.923, P < 0.001) and triacylglycerol, OR: 0.894-0.960, P < 0.05)). However, the study did not observe a noteworthy impact of sphingolipids on ER+BC. In the case of estrogen receptor-negative BC (ER-BC), not only glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids (OR = 1.085, P = 0.008), and glycerolipids (OR = 0.909, P = 0.002) exerted an influence, but the protective effect of sterols (OR: 1.034-1.056, P < 0.05) was also discovered. The prominence of glycerolipids was minimal in ER-BC. Phosphatidylethanolamine (OR: 1.091-1.119, P < 0.05) was an important causal effect in ER-BC.The findings reveal that phosphatidylinositol and triglycerides levels decreased the risk of BC, indicating a potential protective role of these lipid molecules. Moreover, the study elucidates BC's intricate lipid metabolic pathways, highlighting diverse lipidome structural variations that may have varying effects in different molecular subtypes.© 2024.

Obesity due to excessive calories and other or unspecified obesity from the FinnGen database. We used genomic significance (p< 5 × 10-8) to obtain independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables. Similarly, genome-wide association study data for the disease BPV were selected from the FinnGen database.Rwas then used to test the data for multiplicity and heterogeneity, as well as to detect the effect of individual SNPs on the results. Random effects inverse variance weighting was used as the main statistical analysis.First, by analyzing, we found an outlier in obesity due to excessive calories (rs12956821). Outliers were then removed, and the statistical results were analyzed without heterogeneity (p> 0.05) and horizontal pleiotropy (p> 0.05), as well as individual SNPs having no effect on the results.

However, the precise mechanisms involved remain to be fully delineated. Evidence points to their potential anti-inflammatory pathway in mitigating the risk of HF.A two-sample, two-step Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach was employed to assess the correlation between SGLT-2 inhibition and HF, along with the mediating effects of inflammatory biomarkers in this relationship. MR is an analytical methodology that leverages single nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables to infer potential causal inferences between exposures and outcomes within observational data frameworks. Genetic variants correlated with the expression of the SLC5A2 gene and glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) were selected using datasets from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project and the eQTLGen consortium. The Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for 92 inflammatory biomarkers were obtained from two datasets, which included 14,824 and 575,531 individuals of European ancestry, respectively. GWAS data for HF was derived from a meta-analysis that combined 26 cohorts, including 47,309 HF cases and 930,014 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for HF were calculated per 1 unit change of HbA1c.Genetically predicted SGLT-2 inhibition was associated with a reduced risk of HF (OR 0.42 [95% CI 0.30-0.59], P < 0.0001). Of the 92 inflammatory biomarkers studied, two inflammatory biomarkers (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 [CXCL10] and leukemia inhibitory factor) were associated with both SGLT-2 inhibition and HF. Multivariable MR analysis revealed that CXCL10 was the primary inflammatory cytokine related to HF (MIP = 0.861, MACE = 0.224, FDR-adjusted P = 0.0844). The effect of SGLT-2 inhibition on HF was mediated by CXCL10 by 17.85% of the total effect (95% CI [3.03%-32.68%], P = 0.0183).This study provides genetic evidence supporting the anti-inflammatory effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors and their beneficial impact in reducing the risk of HF.

38589550,Identification of Circulating Inflammatory Proteins Associated with Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis by Multiplex Analysis.,Cardiovasc Toxicol,"Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is characterized by increasing inflammation and progressive calcification in the aortic valve leaflets and is a major cause of death in the aging population. This study aimed to identify the inflammatory proteins involved in CAVS and provide potential therapeutic targets. We investigated the observational and causal associations of 92 inflammatory proteins, which were measured using affinity-based proteomic assays. Firstly, the case-control cohort identified differential proteins associated with the occurrence and progression of CAVS. Subsequently, we delved into exploring the causal impacts of these associated proteins through Mendelian randomization. This involved utilizing genetic instruments derived from cis-protein quantitative loci identified in genome-wide association studies, encompassing a cohort of over 400,000 individuals. Finally, we investigated the gene transcription and protein expression levels of inflammatory proteins by single-cell and immunohistochemistry analysis. Multivariate logistic regression and spearman's correlation analysis showed that five proteins showed a significant positive correlation with disease severity. Mendelian randomization showed that elevated levels of two proteins, namely, matrix metallopeptidase-1 (MMP1) and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), were associated with an increased risk of CAVS. Immunohistochemistry and single-cell transcriptomes showed that expression levels of MMP1 and SIRT2 at the tissue and cell levels were significantly higher in calcified valves than in non-calcified control valves. These findings indicate that MMP1 and SIRT2 are causally related to CAVS and open up the possibility for identifying novel therapeutic targets.© 2024.

38552318,MotGen: a closed-loop bacterial motility control framework using generative adversarial networks.,Bioinformatics,"Many organisms' survival and behavior hinge on their responses to environmental signals. While research on bacteria-directed therapeutic agents has increased, systematic exploration of real-time modulation of bacterial motility remains limited. Current studies often focus on permanent motility changes through genetic alterations, restricting the ability to modulate bacterial motility dynamically on a large scale. To address this gap, we propose a novel real-time control framework for systematically modulating bacterial motility dynamics.We introduce MotGen, a deep learning approach leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks to analyze swimming performance statistics of motile bacteria based on live cell imaging data. By tracking objects and optimizing cell trajectory mapping under environmentally altered conditions, we trained MotGen on a comprehensive statistical dataset derived from real image data. Our experimental results demonstrate MotGen's ability to capture motility dynamics from real bacterial populations with low mean absolute error in both simulated and real datasets. MotGen allows us to approach optimal swimming conditions for desired motility statistics in real-time. MotGen's potential extends to practical biomedical applications, including immune response prediction, by providing imputation of bacterial motility patterns based on external environmental conditions. Our short-term, in-situ interventions for controlling motility behavior offer a promising foundation for the development of bacteria-based biomedical applications.MotGen is presented as a combination of Matlab image analysis code and a machine learning workflow in Python.

Oversampling is a common method used to balance classes, allowing for better generalization of the training data. More naive approaches can introduce other biases into the data, being especially sensitive to inaccuracies in the training data, a problem considering the characteristically noisy data obtained in healthcare. This is especially a problem with high-dimensional data. A generative adversarial network-based method is proposed for creating synthetic samples from small, high-dimensional data, to improve upon other more naive generative approaches. The method was compared with 'synthetic minority over-sampling technique' (SMOTE) and 'random oversampling' (RO).

Animal studies have shown that these cells play essential roles in both normal and disease states. In a large number of pain models, SGCs were activated and contributed to the pain behavior. Much less is known about SGCs in humans, but there is emerging recognition that SGCs in humans are altered in a variety of clinical states. The available data show that human SGCs share some essential features with SGCs in rodents, but many differences do exist. SGCs in DRG from patients suffering from common painful diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia, may contribute to the pain phenotype. It was found that immunoglobulins G (IgG) from fibromyalgia patients can induce pain-like behavior in mice. Moreover, these IgGs bind preferentially to SGCs and activate them, which can sensitize the sensory neurons, causing nociception. In other human diseases, the evidence is not as direct as in fibromyalgia, but it has been found that an antibody from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis binds to mouse SGCs, which leads to the release of pronociceptive factors from them. Herpes zoster is another painful disease, and it appears that the zoster virus resides in SGCs, which acquire an abnormal morphology and may participate in the infection and pain generation. More work needs to be undertaken on SGCs in humans, and this review points to several promising avenues for better understanding disease mechanisms and developing effective pain therapies.",3.3786903776208125e-41

Ruxolitinib, a JAK-STAT inhibitor, exhibits effectiveness in autoimmune diseases, arthritis, and managing inflammatory cytokine storms. Although studies have shown the neuroprotective potential of ruxolitinib in neurological trauma, the exact mechanism by which it enhances functional recovery after spinal cord injury, particularly its effect on astrocytes, remains unclear. To address this gap, we established a mouse model of T10 spinal cord contusion and found that ruxolitinib effectively improved hindlimb motor function and reduced the area of spinal cord injury. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that ruxolitinib alleviated inflammation and immune response after spinal cord injury, restored EAAT2 expression, reduced glutamate levels, and alleviated excitatory toxicity. Furthermore, ruxolitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in the injured spinal cord and decreased the phosphorylation level of nuclear factor kappa-B and the expression of inflammatory factors interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Additionally, in glutamate-induced excitotoxicity astrocytes, ruxolitinib restored EAAT2 expression and increased glutamate uptake by inhibiting the activation of STAT3, thereby reducing glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, calcium influx, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis, and increasing the complexity of dendritic branching. Collectively, these results indicate that ruxolitinib restores glutamate homeostasis by rescuing the expression of EAAT2 in astrocytes, reduces neurotoxicity, and effectively alleviates inflammatory and immune responses after spinal cord injury, thereby promoting functional recovery after spinal cord injury.Copyright © 2024 Copyright: © 2024 Neural Regeneration Research.",5.211949367556982e-65

38521710,Astrocytes in selective vulnerability to neurodegenerative disease.,Trends Neurosci,"Selective vulnerability of specific brain regions and cell populations is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders. Mechanisms of selective vulnerability involve neuronal heterogeneity, functional specializations, and differential sensitivities to stressors and pathogenic factors. In this review we discuss the growing body of literature suggesting that, like neurons, astrocytes are heterogeneous and specialized, respond to and integrate diverse inputs, and induce selective effects on brain function. In disease, astrocytes undergo specific, context-dependent changes that promote different pathogenic trajectories and functional outcomes. We propose that astrocytes contribute to selective vulnerability through maladaptive transitions to context-divergent phenotypes that impair specific brain regions and functions. Further studies on the multifaceted roles of astrocytes in disease may provide new therapeutic approaches to enhance resilience against neurodegenerative disorders.Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

38615017,Study of association of leptin with leukocyte telomere length in a Chinese rural population.,Lipids Health Dis,"Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between adipocyte factors, insulin resistance, and other indicators with telomere length. However, these studies did not consider the influence of changes in different indicators on telomere length over time. Therefore, the aim of this study is to elucidate the impact of changes in adipocyte factors, HOMA-IR, and other indicators on the dynamic variation of telomere length.The data were from a cohort study conducted in Ningxia, China. A total of 1624 subjects were analyzed. Adipokines and relative leukocyte telomere length (RLTL) were measured, and changes in Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), Homeostatic Model Assessment for β-Cell Function (HOMA-β), and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) were calculated. Generalized linear models evaluated associations between changes in adipokines and RLTL changes. Furthermore, univariate analyses examined the effects of changes in adipokines and insulin resistance indicators on ΔRLTL.The research findings indicate that females generally have shorter telomeres compared to males. In comparison to the low-level group of Δleptin (LEP), the high-level group of ΔLEP shows a negative correlation with ΔRLTL (B=-1.32, 95% CI (-2.38, -0.27)). Even after multivariable adjustments, this relationship persists (B=-1.31, 95% CI (-2.24, -0.23)). Further analysis reveals that after adjusting for ΔHOMA-IR, ΔHOMA-β, and ΔQUICKI, the high-level group of ΔLEP still exhibits a significant negative correlation with ΔRLTL (B=-1.37, 95% CI (-2.43, -0.31)). However, the interaction effects between ΔHOMA-IR, ΔHOMA-β, ΔQUICKI, and ΔLEP do not affect ΔRLTL.Elevated levels of leptin were significantly correlated with shortened telomere length. This suggests that increased leptin levels may impact overall individual health by affecting telomere length, underscoring the importance of measures to reduce leptin levels to mitigate the onset and progression of related diseases.© 2024.

38535029,Targeted Sequencing of Human Satellite 2 Repeat Sequences in Plasma cfDNA Reveals Potential Breast Cancer Biomarkers.,Diagnostics (Basel),"Liquid biopsies are revolutionizing the detection and management of malignant diseases. While repetitive DNA sequences, such as LINE-1 and ALU are established in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) research, their clinical applications remain limited. In this study, we explore human satellite 2 (HSATII), a prevalent repeat DNA sequence in plasma that exhibits increased levels in cancer patients, thereby positioning it as a potential pan-cancer biomarker. We employed targeted sequencing and copy number variation (CNV) analysis using two primer pairs to assess the differential abundance of HSATII sequences in the plasma of breast cancer patients compared to healthy individuals. PCR amplicons of HSATII from 10 patients and 10 control subjects were sequenced, generating 151 bp paired-end reads. By constructing a pooled reference dataset, HSATII copy ratios were estimated in the patients. Our analysis revealed several significant CNVs in HSATII, with certain sequences displaying notable gains and losses across all breast cancer patients, suggesting their potential as biomarkers. However, we observed pronounced fragmentation of cfDNA in cancer, leading to the loss of longer PCR amplicons (>180 bp). While not all observed losses can be attributed to fragmentation artifacts, this phenomenon does introduce complexity in interpreting CNV data. Notably, this research marks the first instance of targeted HSATII sequencing in a liquid biopsy context. Our findings lay the groundwork for developing sequencing-based assays to detect differentially represented HSATII sequences, potentially advancing the field of minimally-invasive cancer screening.",3.3579619335175165e-22

These techniques are designed to overcome the constraints faced by traditional methods such as immunostaining and RNAin situhybridization, which are capable of analyzing only a few target genes simultaneously. However, the application of ST in histopathological analysis is also limited by several factors, including low resolution, a limited range of genes, scalability issues, high cost, and the need for sophisticated equipment and complex methodologies. Seq-Scope-a recently developed novel technology-repurposes the Illumina sequencing platform for high-resolution, high-content spatial transcriptome analysis, thereby overcoming these limitations. Here we provide a detailed step-by-step protocol to implement Seq-Scope with an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing flow cell that allows for the profiling of multiple tissue sections in an area of 7 mm × 7 mm or larger. In addition to detailing how to prepare a frozen tissue section for both histological imaging and sequencing library preparation, we provide comprehensive instructions and a streamlined computational pipeline to integrate histological and transcriptomic data for high-resolution spatial analysis.

However, reliable identification of cell types is a crucial bottleneck in single-cell analysis. Available databases contain dissimilar nomenclature and non-concurrent marker sets, leading to inconsistent annotations and poor interpretability. Furthermore, current tools focus mostly on physiological cell types, lacking extensive applicability in disease. We developed the Cell Marker Accordion, a user-friendly platform for the automatic annotation and biological interpretation of single-cell populations based on consistency weighted markers. We validated our approach on peripheral blood and bone marrow single-cell datasets, using surface markers and expert-based annotation as the ground truth. In all cases, we significantly improved the accuracy in identifying cell types with respect to any single source database. Moreover, the Cell Marker Accordion can identify disease-critical cells and pathological processes, extracting potential biomarkers in a wide variety of contexts in human and murine single-cell datasets. It characterizes leukemia stem cell subtypes, including therapy-resistant cells in acute myeloid leukemia patients; it identifies malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma samples; it dissects cell type alterations in splicing factor-mutant cells from myelodysplastic syndrome patients; it discovers activation of innate immunity pathways in bone marrow from mice treated with METTL3 inhibitors.

This cohort study aims to determine the association between plasma metal and health span in elder adults aged ≥ 90 years.The plasma concentrations of seven metals were measured at baseline in 300 elder adults. The end of the health span (EHS) was identified as the occurrence of one of eight major morbidities or mortality events. We used Cox regression to assess hazard ratios (HR). The combined effects of multiple metal mixtures were estimated using grouped-weighted quantile sum (GWQS), quantile g-computation (Q-gcomp), and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) methods.The estimated HR for EHS with an inter-quartile range (IQR) increment for selenium (Se) was 0.826 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.737-0.926); magnesium (Mg), 0.806 (95% CI: 0.691-0.941); iron (Fe), 0.756 (95% CI: 0.623-0.917), and copper (Cu), 0.856 (95% CI: 0.750-0.976). The P for trend of Se, Mg, and Fe were all < 0.05. In the mixture analyses, Q-gcomp showed a negative correlation with EHS (P = 0.904), with the sum of the negative coefficients being -0.211.Higher plasma Se, Mg, and Fe reduced the risk of premature end of health span, suggesting that essential metal elements played a role in health maintenance in elder adults.© 2024.

This systematic review identifies available predictive models that assess mPCa patients' response to treatment.We critically reviewed MEDLINE and CENTRAL in December 2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. Only quantitative studies in English were included with no time restrictions. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the PROBAST tool. Data were extracted following the Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews criteria.The search identified 616 citations, of which 15 studies were included in our review. Nine of the included studies were validated internally or externally. Only one study had a low risk of bias and a low risk concerning applicability. Many studies failed to detail model performance adequately, resulting in a high risk of bias. Where reported, the models indicated good or excellent performance.Most of the identified predictive models require additional evaluation and validation in properly designed studies before these can be implemented in clinical practice to assist with treatment decision-making for men with mPCa.In this review, we evaluate studies that predict which treatments will work best for which metastatic prostate cancer patients.

38581418,From tradition to innovation: conventional and deep learning frameworks in genome annotation.,Brief Bioinform,"Following the milestone success of the Human Genome Project, the 'Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)' initiative was launched in 2003 to unearth information about the numerous functional elements within the genome. This endeavor coincided with the emergence of numerous novel technologies, accompanied by the provision of vast amounts of whole-genome sequences, high-throughput data such as ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq. Extracting biologically meaningful information from this massive dataset has become a critical aspect of many recent studies, particularly in annotating and predicting the functions of unknown genes. The core idea behind genome annotation is to identify genes and various functional elements within the genome sequence and infer their biological functions. Traditional wet-lab experimental methods still rely on extensive efforts for functional verification. However, early bioinformatics algorithms and software primarily employed shallow learning techniques; thus, the ability to characterize data and features learning was limited. With the widespread adoption of RNA-Seq technology, scientists from the biological community began to harness the potential of machine learning and deep learning approaches for gene structure prediction and functional annotation. In this context, we reviewed both conventional methods and contemporary deep learning frameworks, and highlighted novel perspectives on the challenges arising during annotation underscoring the dynamic nature of this evolving scientific landscape.© The Author(s) 2024.

In the present study, in a prospective population-based cohort with ~18 years of e-health record follow-up, we investigated the incremental and combined value of genomic and gut metagenomic risk assessment compared with conventional risk factors for predicting incident coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), Alzheimer disease and prostate cancer. We found that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) improved prediction over conventional risk factors for all diseases. Gut microbiome scores improved predictive capacity over baseline age for CAD, T2D and prostate cancer. Integrated risk models of PRSs, gut microbiome scores and conventional risk factors achieved the highest predictive performance for all diseases studied compared with models based on conventional risk factors alone. The present study demonstrates that integrated PRSs and gut metagenomic risk models improve the predictive value over conventional risk factors for common chronic diseases.© 2024.

These methods enable researchers to determine the possible clinical impact of rare and novel variants. Historically these prediction methods used hand-crafted features based on structural, evolutionary, or physiochemical properties of the variant. In this study we propose a novel framework that leverages the power of pre-trained protein language models to predict variant pathogenicity. We show that our approach VariPred (Variant impact Predictor) outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by using an end-to-end model that only requires the protein sequence as input. Using one of the best-performing protein language models (ESM-1b), we establish a robust classifier that requires no calculation of structural features or multiple sequence alignments. We compare the performance of VariPred with other representative models including 3Cnet, Polyphen-2, REVEL, MetaLR, FATHMM and ESM variant. VariPred performs as well as, or in most cases better than these other predictors using six variant impact prediction benchmarks despite requiring only sequence data and no pre-processing of the data.© 2024.

While several machine-learning techniques exist to accomplish this objective, several peculiarities associated with biomedical data, especially when it comes to omics measurements, prevent their use or good performance achievements. Omics approaches aim to understand a complex biological system through systematic analysis of its content at the molecular level. On the other hand, omics data are heterogeneous, sparse and affected by the classical ""curse of dimensionality"" problem, i.e. having much fewer observation, samples (n) than omics features (p). Furthermore, a major problem with multi-omics data is the imbalance either at the class or feature level. The objective of this work is to study whether feature extraction and/or feature selection techniques can improve the performances of classification machine-learning algorithms on omics measurements.Among all omics, metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool in cancer research, facilitating a deeper understanding of the complex metabolic landscape associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Thus, we selected three publicly available metabolomics datasets, and we applied several feature extraction techniques both linear and non-linear, coupled or not with feature selection methods, and evaluated the performances regarding patient classification in the different configurations for the three datasets.We provide general workflow and guidelines on when to use those techniques depending on the characteristics of the data available. To further test the extension of our approach to other omics data, we have included a transcriptomics and a proteomics data.

The plethora of options in each step makes it challenging to identify optimal workflows that maximize the identification of differentially expressed proteins. To identify optimal workflows and their common properties, we conduct an extensive study involving 34,576 combinatoric experiments on 24 gold standard spike-in datasets. Applying frequent pattern mining techniques to top-ranked workflows, we uncover high-performing rules that demonstrate optimality has conserved properties. Via machine learning, we confirm optimal workflows are indeed predictable, with average cross-validation F1 scores and Matthew's correlation coefficients surpassing 0.84. We introduce an ensemble inference to integrate results from individual top-performing workflows for expanding differential proteome coverage and resolve inconsistencies. Ensemble inference provides gains in pAUC (up to 4.61%) and G-mean (up to 11.14%) and facilitates effective aggregation of information across varied quantification approaches such as topN, directLFQ, MaxLFQ intensities, and spectral counts.

Originally infesting our genomes as selfish elements and acting as a source of genome instability, several of these elements have been co-opted as part of a complex system of genome regulation. Many TEs have lost transposition ability and their transcriptional potential has been tampered as a result of interactions with the host throughout evolutionary time. It has been proposed that TEs have been ultimately repurposed to function as gene regulatory hubs scattered throughout our genomes. In the early embryo in particular, TEs find a perfect environment of naïve chromatin to escape transcriptional repression by the host. As a consequence, it is thought that hosts found ways to co-opt TE sequences to regulate large-scale changes in chromatin and transcription state of their genomes. In this review, we discuss several examples of TEs expressed during embryo development, their potential for co-option in genome regulation and the evolutionary pressures on TEs and on our genomes.© 2024.

Our results indicate that TIMM17A is significantly upregulated in LUAD tissues, correlating with clinical staging, lymph node metastasis, overall survival, and progression-free survival, thereby establishing it as a critical independent prognostic factor. The construction of a nomogram model further enhances our ability to predict patient outcomes. Knockdown of TIMM17A inhibited the growth of LUAD cells.

Consequently, overexpression of DNMT3A was introduced in mice and NSCLC cells to verify its regulation on FZD and its biological roles in NSCLC development.In NSCLC, FZD5 expression is elevated, and its knockdown reduced tumor incidence rate in the urethane-challenged mice. The FZD5 silencing also inhibited proliferation, migration, as well as invasion with regard to Calu-3 and NCI-H1299 cellsin vitro. The aberrant upregulation with regard to FZD5 in NSCLC was due to at least partly by reduced promoter methylation level. DNMT3A, which bound to FZD5 promoter to suppress its transcription, was poorly expressed in NSCLC. Artificial upregulation of DNMT3A suppressed urethane-induced lung carcinogenesis in mice and suppressed the malignant phenotype pertaining to NSCLC cellsin vitro.This research demonstrates that the lack of DNA methylation level-induced activation of FZD5 is correlated with NSCLC's onset and progression.© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",4.388285113298261e-50
38673047,Clinical Application of Different Liquid Biopsy Components in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,J Pers Med,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of primary liver cancer, usually occurring in the background of chronic liver disease. HCC lethality rate is in the third highest place in the world. Patients with HCC have concealed early symptoms and possess a high-level of heterogeneity. Once diagnosed, most of the tumors are in advanced stages and have a poor prognosis. The sensitivity and specificity of existing detection modalities and protocols are suboptimal. HCC calls for more sophisticated and individualized therapeutic regimens. Liquid biopsy is non-invasive, repeatable, unaffected by location, and can be monitored dynamically. It has emerged as a useable aid in achieving precision malignant tumor treatment. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating nucleic acids, exosomes and tumor-educated platelets are the commonest components of a liquid biopsy. It possesses the theoretical ability to conquer the high heterogeneity and the difficulty of early detection for HCC patients. In this review, we summarize the common enrichment techniques and the clinical applications in HCC for different liquid biopsy components. Tumor recurrence after HCC-related liver transplantation is more insidious and difficult to treat. The clinical use of liquid biopsy in HCC-related liver transplantation is also summarized in this review.",1.5118810473006326e-47
38638845,Identification and validation of PCDHGA12 and PRRX1 methylation for detecting lung cancer in bronchial washing sample.,Oncol Lett,"Bronchoscopy is a frequently used initial diagnostic procedure for patients with suspected lung cancer (LC). Cytological examinations of bronchial washing (BW) samples obtained during bronchoscopy often yield inconclusive results regarding LC diagnosis. The present study aimed to identify molecular biomarkers as a non-invasive method for LC diagnosis. Aberrant DNA methylation is used as a useful biomarker for LC. Therefore, microarray-based methylation profiling analyses on 13 patient-matched tumor tissues at stages I-III vs. non-tumor tissues were performed, and a group of highly differentially methylated genes was identified. A subsequent analysis using bisulfite-pyrosequencing with additional tissues and cell lines revealed six methylated genes [ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 20, forkhead box C2 (mesenchyme forkhead 1), NK2 transcription factor related, locus 5 (Drosophila), oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3, protocadherin γ subfamily A 12 (PCDHGA12) and paired related homeobox 1 (PRRX1)] associated with LC. Next, a highly sensitive and accurate detection method, linear target enrichment-quantitative methylation-specific PCR in a single closed tube, was applied for clinical validation using BW samples from patients with LC (n=68) and individuals with benign diseases (n=33).PCDHGA12andPRRX1methylation were identified as the best-performing biomarkers to detect LC. The two-marker combination showed a sensitivity of 82.4% and a specificity of 87.9%, with an area under the curve of 0.891. Notably, the sensitivity for small cell LC was 100%. The two-marker combination had a positive predictive value of 93.3% and a negative predictive value of 70.7%. The sensitivity was higher than that of cytology, which only had a sensitivity of 50%. The methylation status of the two-marker combination showed no association with sex, age or stage, but was associated with tumor location and histology. In conclusion, the present study showed that the regulatory regions ofPCDHGA12andPRRX1are highly methylated in LC and can be used to detect LC in BW specimens as a diagnostic adjunct to cytology in clinical practice.Copyright: © 2024 Oh et al.",4.401501086431594e-30
38531930,Correlation analysis of disulfidptosis-related gene signatures with clinical prognosis and immunotherapy response in sarcoma.,Sci Rep,"Disulfidptosis, a newly discovered type of programmed cell death, could be a mechanism of cell death controlled by SLC7A11. This could be closely associated with tumor development and advancement. Nevertheless, the biological mechanism behind disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) in sarcoma (SARC) is uncertain. This study identified three valuable genes (SLC7A11, RPN1, GYS1) associated with disulfidptosis in sarcoma (SARC) and developed a prognostic model. The multiple databases and RT-qPCR data confirmed the upregulated expression of prognostic DRGs in SARC. The TCGA internal and ICGC external validation cohorts were utilized to validate the predictive model capacity. Our analysis of DRG riskscores revealed that the low-risk group exhibited a more favorable prognosis than the high-risk group. Furthermore, we observed a significant association between DRG riskscores and different clinical features, immune cell infiltration, immune therapeutic sensitivity, drug sensitivity, and RNA modification regulators. In addition, two external independent immunetherapy datasets and clinical tissue samples were collected, validating the value of the DRGs risk model in predicting immunotherapy response. Finally, the SLC7A11/hsa-miR-29c-3p/LINC00511, and RPN1/hsa-miR-143-3p/LINC00511 regulatory axes were constructed. This study provided DRG riskscore signatures to predict prognosis and response to immunotherapy in SARC, guiding personalized treatment decisions.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.2688186092751408e-42

Here, we report a high-resolution, comparative single-cell molecular atlas of the human primary motor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and their transcriptional alterations in sporadic and familial ALS and FTLD. By integrating transcriptional and genetic information, we identify known and previously unidentified vulnerable populations in cortical layer 5 and show that ALS- and FTLD-implicated motor and spindle neurons possess a virtually indistinguishable molecular identity. We implicate potential disease mechanisms affecting these cell types as well as non-neuronal drivers of pathogenesis. Finally, we show that neuron loss in cortical layer 5 tracks more closely with transcriptional identity rather than cellular morphology and extends beyond previously reported vulnerable cell types.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

38740770,Multiscale modelling of chromatin 4D organization in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.,Nat Commun,"SARS-CoV-2 can re-structure chromatin organization and alter the epigenomic landscape of the host genome, but the mechanisms that produce such changes remain unclear. Here, we use polymer physics to investigate how the chromatin of the host genome is re-organized upon infection with SARS-CoV-2. We show that re-structuring of A/B compartments can be explained by a re-modulation of intra-compartment homo-typic affinities, which leads to the weakening of A-A interactions and the enhancement of A-B mixing. At the TAD level, re-arrangements are physically described by a reduction in the loop extrusion activity coupled with an alteration of chromatin phase-separation properties, resulting in more intermingling between different TADs and a spread in space of the TADs themselves. In addition, the architecture of loci relevant to the antiviral interferon response, such as DDX58 or IFIT, becomes more variable within the 3D single-molecule population of the infected model, suggesting that viral infection leads to a loss of chromatin structural specificity. Analysing the time trajectories of pairwise gene-enhancer and higher-order contacts reveals that this variability derives from increased fluctuations in the chromatin dynamics of infected cells. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 alters gene regulation by impacting the stability of the contact network in time.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.1294992391668113e-48
38509385,Increased enhancer-promoter interactions during developmental enhancer activation in mammals.,Nat Genet,"Remote enhancers are thought to interact with their target promoters via physical proximity, yet the importance of this proximity for enhancer function remains unclear. Here we investigate the three-dimensional (3D) conformation of enhancers during mammalian development by generating high-resolution tissue-resolved contact maps for nearly a thousand enhancers with characterized in vivo activities in ten murine embryonic tissues. Sixty-one percent of developmental enhancers bypass their neighboring genes, which are often marked by promoter CpG methylation. The majority of enhancers display tissue-specific 3D conformations, and both enhancer-promoter and enhancer-enhancer interactions are moderately but consistently increased upon enhancer activation in vivo. Less than 14% of enhancer-promoter interactions form stably across tissues; however, these invariant interactions form in the absence of the enhancer and are likely mediated by adjacent CTCF binding. Our results highlight the general importance of enhancer-promoter physical proximity for developmental gene activation in mammals.© 2024.

38702606,Unraveling the genetic architecture of blood unfolded p-53 among non-demented elderlies: novel candidate genes for early Alzheimer's disease.,BMC Genomics,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heritable neurodegenerative disease whose long asymptomatic phase makes the early diagnosis of it pivotal. Blood U-p53 has recently emerged as a superior predictive biomarker for AD in the early stages. We hypothesized that genetic variants associated with blood U-p53 could reveal novel loci and pathways involved in the early stages of AD.We performed a blood U-p53 Genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 484 healthy and mild cognitively impaired subjects from the ADNI cohort using 612,843 Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We performed a pathway analysis and prioritized candidate genes using an AD single-cell gene program. We fine-mapped the intergenic SNPs by leveraging a cell-type-specific enhancer-to-gene linking strategy using a brain single-cell multimodal dataset. We validated the candidate genes in an independent brain single-cell RNA-seq and the ADNI blood transcriptome datasets. The rs279686 between AASS and FEZF1 genes was the most significant SNP (p-value = 4.82 × 10-7). Suggestive pathways were related to the immune and nervous systems. Twenty-three candidate genes were prioritized at 27 suggestive loci. Fine-mapping of 5 intergenic loci yielded nine cell-specific candidate genes. Finally, 15 genes were validated in the independent single-cell RNA-seq dataset, and five were validated in the ADNI blood transcriptome dataset.We underlined the importance of performing a GWAS on an early-stage biomarker of AD and leveraging functional omics datasets for pinpointing causal genes in AD. Our study prioritized nine genes (SORCS1, KIF5C, TMEFF2, TMEM63C, HLA-E, ATAT1, TUBB, ARID1B, and RUNX1) strongly implicated in the early stages of AD.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.184179773963575e-19
38609714,Inferring gene regulatory networks from single-cell multiome data using atlas-scale external data.,Nat Biotechnol,"Existing methods for gene regulatory network (GRN) inference rely on gene expression data alone or on lower resolution bulk data. Despite the recent integration of chromatin accessibility and RNA sequencing data, learning complex mechanisms from limited independent data points still presents a daunting challenge. Here we present LINGER (Lifelong neural network for gene regulation), a machine-learning method to infer GRNs from single-cell paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility data. LINGER incorporates atlas-scale external bulk data across diverse cellular contexts and prior knowledge of transcription factor motifs as a manifold regularization. LINGER achieves a fourfold to sevenfold relative increase in accuracy over existing methods and reveals a complex regulatory landscape of genome-wide association studies, enabling enhanced interpretation of disease-associated variants and genes. Following the GRN inference from reference single-cell multiome data, LINGER enables the estimation of transcription factor activity solely from bulk or single-cell gene expression data, leveraging the abundance of available gene expression data to identify driver regulators from case-control studies.© 2024.

Here, we performed a systematic analysis to gain better insights into UC pathogenesis.We analyzed two UC-related datasets extracted from the gene expression omnibus database using several bioinformatics tools. The primary cell types and key subgroups of primary cells associated with UC and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between UC and control samples were identified. The molecular regulation of the key genes was also predicted. The gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analyses of marker genes of key cell subgroups and model genes were performed. The expression of key enriched genes was validated in 10 clinical samples using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).Monocytes were identified as the major cell type. Ten differentially expressed marker genes were obtained by intersecting the 3121 DEGs, 38 marker genes in major cell types, and 104 marker genes in key cell subgroups. Four essential genes, associated with immune response, were obtained using support vector machine recursive feature elimination and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analyses. The four essential genes were highly expressed in Cluster 0 during differentiation. Validation of the four key genes in colonic mucosal biopsy specimens from 10 normal and 10 UC patients revealed thatCREMwas highly expressed in both the lesion-free sites and lesion sites colonic mucosa of UC patients compared with normal adults.We identifiedCREMinvolved in UC pathogenesis, which is expected to provide a new therapeutic target for UC.© 2024 The Authors.",1.0920712730821575e-37
38627807,FiTMuSiC: leveraging structural and (co)evolutionary data for protein fitness prediction.,Hum Genomics,"Systematically predicting the effects of mutations on protein fitness is essential for the understanding of genetic diseases. Indeed, predictions complement experimental efforts in analyzing how variants lead to dysfunctional proteins that in turn can cause diseases. Here we present our new fitness predictor, FiTMuSiC, which leverages structural, evolutionary and coevolutionary information. We show that FiTMuSiC predicts fitness with high accuracy despite the simplicity of its underlying model: it was among the top predictors on the hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) target of the sixth round of the Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation challenge (CAGI6) and performs as well as much more complex deep learning models such as AlphaMissense. To further demonstrate FiTMuSiC's robustness, we compared its predictions with in vitro activity data on HMBS, variant fitness data on human glucokinase (GCK), and variant deleteriousness data on HMBS and GCK. These analyses further confirm FiTMuSiC's qualities and accuracy, which compare favorably with those of other predictors. Additionally, FiTMuSiC returns two scores that separately describe the functional and structural effects of the variant, thus providing mechanistic insight into why the variant leads to fitness loss or gain. We also provide an easy-to-use webserver at https://babylone.ulb.ac.be/FiTMuSiC , which is freely available for academic use and does not require any bioinformatics expertise, which simplifies the accessibility of our tool for the entire scientific community.© 2024.

38600227,Exploring the genetic etiology across the continuum of the general psychopathology factor: a Swedish population-based family and twin study.,Mol Psychiatry,"Psychiatric comorbidity can be accounted for by a latent general psychopathology factor (p factor), which quantifies the variance that is shared to varying degrees by every dimension of psychopathology. It is unclear whether the entire continuum of the p factor shares the same genetic origin. We investigated whether mild, moderate, and extreme elevations on the p factor shared the same genetic etiology by, first, examining the linearity of the association between p factors across siblings (N = 580,891 pairs). Second, we estimated the group heritability in a twin sample (N = 17,170 pairs), which involves testing whether the same genetic variants influence both extreme and normal variations in the p factor. In both samples, the p factor was based on 10 register-based psychiatric diagnoses. Results showed that the association between siblings' p factors appeared linear, even into the extreme range. Likewise, the twin group heritabilities ranged from 0.42 to 0.45 (95% CI: 0.33-0.57) depending on the thresholds defining the probands (2-3.33 SD beyond the mean; >2 SD beyond the mean; >4.33 SD beyond the mean; and >5.33 SD beyond the mean), and these estimates were highly similar to the estimated individual differences heritability (0.41, 95% CI: 0.39-0.43), indicating that scores above and below these thresholds shared a common genetic origin. Together, these results suggest that the entire continuum of the p factor shares the same genetic origin, with common genetic variants likely playing an important role. This implies, first, genetic risk factors for the aspect that is shared between all forms of psychopathology (i.e., genetic risk factors for the p factor) might be generalizable between population-based cohorts with a higher prevalence of milder cases, and clinical samples with a preponderance of more severe cases. Second, prioritizing low-cost genome-wide association studies capable of identifying common genetic variants, rather than expensive whole genome sequencing that can identify rare variants, may increase the efficiency when studying the genetic architecture of the p factor.© 2024.

38561338,Genetic associations of protein-coding variants in venous thromboembolism.,Nat Commun,"Previous genetic studies of venous thromboembolism (VTE) have been largely limited to common variants, leaving the genetic determinants relatively incomplete. We performed an exome-wide association study of VTE among 14,723 cases and 334,315 controls. Fourteen known and four novel genes (SRSF6, PHPT1, CGN, and MAP3K2) were identified through protein-coding variants, with broad replication in the FinnGen cohort. Most genes we discovered exhibited the potential to predict future VTE events in longitudinal analysis. Notably, we provide evidence for the additive contribution of rare coding variants to known genome-wide polygenic risk in shaping VTE risk. The identified genes were enriched in pathways affecting coagulation and platelet activation, along with liver-specific expression. The pleiotropic effects of these genes indicated the potential involvement of coagulation factors, blood cell traits, liver function, and immunometabolic processes in VTE pathogenesis. In conclusion, our study unveils the valuable contribution of protein-coding variants in VTE etiology and sheds new light on its risk stratification.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.071807330754838e-20
38559194,Escape from X inactivation is directly modulated by levels of Xist non-coding RNA.,bioRxiv,"In placental females, one copy of the two X chromosomes is largely silenced during a narrow developmental time window, in a process mediated by the non-coding RNA Xist1. Here, we demonstrate that Xist can initiate X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) well beyond early embryogenesis. By modifying its endogenous level, we show that Xist has the capacity to actively silence genes that escape XCI both in neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) andin vivo, in mouse embryos. We also show that Xist plays a direct role in eliminating TAD-like structures associated with clusters of escapee genes on the inactive X chromosome, and that this is dependent on Xist's XCI initiation partner, SPEN2. We further demonstrate that Xist's function in suppressing gene expression of escapees and topological domain formation is reversible for up to seven days post-induction, but that sustained Xist up-regulation leads to progressively irreversible silencing and CpG island DNA methylation of facultative escapees. Thus, the distinctive transcriptional and regulatory topologies of the silenced X chromosome is actively, directly - and reversibly - controlled by Xist RNA throughout life.",3.331058145788118e-26

38646491,Clinical significance of the CXCL8/CXCR1/R2 signalling axis in patients with invasive breast cancer.,Oncol Lett,"The C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8)-C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR)1/2 signalling axis is among numerous mechanisms which stimulate the immune system to defend against tumour growth and influence the tumour microenvironment to promote tumour growth. This pathway plays an important role in the development of a number of cancers including breast cancer (BC). The aim of the present study was to analyse the levels of the chemokine CXCL8 and its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, in the serum of female patients with invasive BC and to assess the expression of these parameters at the mRNA level, considering molecular subtypes and degrees of cancer malignancy. The study group consisted of 62 patients with histopathologically confirmed invasive BC. The control group consisted of 18 patients with histopathologically confirmed fibroadenoma, a benign breast tumour. The levels of CXCL8, CXCR1 and CXCR2 were determined by sandwich ELISA using the CLOUD-CLONE ELISA kit. CXCL8, CXCR1 and CXCR2 transcript levels were analysed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Results showed that serum CXCL8 levels in female patients with invasive BC were significantly higher compared with those in the control group (P<0.05). In addition, significantly elevated CXCR1 levels were observed in luminal B human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+carcinoma compared with those in the control group. Analysis of CXCL8 in the serum of female patients with BC showed a statistically significant difference between clinical stage G1 and G2 (P<0.05), G2 and G3 (P<0.01), and G1 and G3 (P<0.0001). On the other hand, the analysis of CXCR1 and CXCR2 levels in the serum of the patients revealed a statistically significant difference between G2 and G3 (P<0.05). The current study showed that abnormalities in the immune response involving the CXCL8-CXCR1/2 signalling axis in patients with invasive BC are involved in the development of these tumours. Moreover, the demonstrated severity of changes occurring at protein level may suggest the potential usefulness of their determination as potential diagnostic markers in the clinic.Copyright: © 2024 Stępień et al.",8.012631081055631e-44
38744897,Transcription stress at telomeres leads to cytosolic DNA release and paracrine senescence.,Nat Commun,"Transcription stress has been linked to DNA damage -driven aging, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Tcea1-/-cells, which harbor a TFIIS defect in transcription elongation, exhibit RNAPII stalling at oxidative DNA damage sites, impaired transcription, accumulation of R-loops, telomere uncapping, chromatin bridges, and genome instability, ultimately resulting in cellular senescence. We found that R-loops at telomeres causally contribute to the release of telomeric DNA fragments in the cytoplasm of Tcea1-/-cells and primary cells derived from naturally aged animals triggering a viral-like immune response. TFIIS-defective cells release extracellular vesicles laden with telomeric DNA fragments that target neighboring cells, which consequently undergo cellular senescence. Thus, transcription stress elicits paracrine signals leading to cellular senescence, promoting aging.© 2024. The Author(s).",4.953317202621051e-29
38600236,Transcription-coupled DNA-protein crosslink repair by CSB and CRL4(CSA)-mediated degradation.,Nat Cell Biol,"DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) arise from enzymatic intermediates, metabolism or chemicals like chemotherapeutics. DPCs are highly cytotoxic as they impede DNA-based processes such as replication, which is counteracted through proteolysis-mediated DPC removal by spartan (SPRTN) or the proteasome. However, whether DPCs affect transcription and how transcription-blocking DPCs are repaired remains largely unknown. Here we show that DPCs severely impede RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription and are preferentially repaired in active genes by transcription-coupled DPC (TC-DPC) repair. TC-DPC repair is initiated by recruiting the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) factors CSB and CSA to DPC-stalled RNA polymerase II. CSA and CSB are indispensable for TC-DPC repair; however, the downstream TC-NER factors UVSSA and XPA are not, a result indicative of a non-canonical TC-NER mechanism. TC-DPC repair functions independently of SPRTN but is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase CRL4CSAand the proteasome. Thus, DPCs in genes are preferentially repaired in a transcription-coupled manner to facilitate unperturbed transcription.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.3217831239278445e-20
38546716,Meta-Research: Understudied genes are lost in a leaky pipeline between genome-wide assays and reporting of results.,Elife,"Present-day publications on human genes primarily feature genes that already appeared in many publications prior to completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. These patterns persist despite the subsequent adoption of high-throughput technologies, which routinely identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease. Although several hypotheses for bias in the selection of genes as research targets have been proposed, their explanatory powers have not yet been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understudied genes remain abandoned by studies that cite these -omics experiments. Conversely, we find that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect which genes are being studied, we find that 33 are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. To promote the investigation of understudied genes, we condense our insights into a tool,find my understudied genes(FMUG), that allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits.

Beyond their delightful nutty flavor and crunchy texture, sesame seeds have also gained recognition for their remarkable health benefits. This article provides an in-depth exploration of the numerous ways in which sesame seeds contribute to overall well-being. Sesame seeds are a powerhouse of phytochemicals, including lignans derivatives, tocopherol isomers, phytosterols, and phytates, which have been associated with various health benefits, including the preservation of cardiovascular health and the prevention of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and brain dysfunction. These compounds have also been substantiated for their efficacy in cholesterol management. Their potential as a natural source of beneficial plant compounds is presented in detail. The article further explores the positive impact of sesame seeds on reducing the risk of chronic diseases thanks to their rich polyunsaturated fatty acids content. Nevertheless, it is crucial to remember the significance of maintaining a well-rounded diet to achieve the proper balance of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, a balance lacking in sesame seed oil. The significance of bioactive polypeptides derived from sesame seeds is also discussed, shedding light on their applications as nutritional supplements, nutraceuticals, and functional ingredients.

Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (HucMSC-Exos) hold promise for treating kidney diseases due to their anti-inflammatory properties. This study investigates their potential to lessen renal fibrosis by targeting macrophage-to-myofibroblast transformation (MMT), a key driver of fibrosis. We employed a mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and cultured cells exposed to transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) to mimic MMT. HucMSC-Exos were administered to UUO mice, and their effects on kidney function and fibrosis were assessed. Additionally, RNA sequencing and cellular analysis were performed to elucidate the mechanisms by which HucMSC-Exos inhibit MMT. HucMSC-Exos treatment significantly reduced kidney damage and fibrosis in UUO mice. They downregulated markers of fibrosis (Collagen I, vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin) and suppressed MMT (α-SMA + F4/80 + cells). Furthermore, ARNTL, a specific molecule, emerged as a potential target of HucMSC-Exos in hindering MMT and consequently preventing fibrosis. HucMSC-Exos effectively lessen renal fibrosis by suppressing MMT, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for managing kidney damage and fibrosis.© 2024.

38615014,Inhibition of ACSS2-mediated histone crotonylation alleviates kidney fibrosis via IL-1β-dependent macrophage activation and tubular cell senescence.,Nat Commun,"Histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr), as a posttranslational modification, is widespread as acetylation (Kac); however, its roles are largely unknown in kidney fibrosis. In this study, we report that histone Kcr of tubular epithelial cells is abnormally elevated in fibrotic kidneys. By screening these crotonylated/acetylated factors, a crotonyl-CoA-producing enzyme ACSS2 (acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2) is found to remarkably increase histone 3 lysine 9 crotonylation (H3K9cr) level without influencing H3K9ac in kidneys and tubular epithelial cells. The integrated analysis of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq of fibrotic kidneys reveal that the hub proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β, which is regulated by H3K9cr, play crucial roles in fibrogenesis. Furthermore, genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of ACSS2 both suppress H3K9cr-mediated IL-1β expression, which thereby alleviate IL-1β-dependent macrophage activation and tubular cell senescence to delay renal fibrosis. Collectively, our findings uncover that H3K9cr exerts a critical, previously unrecognized role in kidney fibrosis, where ACSS2 represents an attractive drug target to slow fibrotic kidney disease progression.© 2024.

38610646,Fibrosis in Chronic Kidney Disease: Pathophysiology and Therapeutic Targets.,J Clin Med,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a slowly progressive condition characterized by decreased kidney function, tubular injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation. CKD is a leading global health burden that is asymptomatic in early stages but can ultimately cause kidney failure. Its etiology is complex and involves dysregulated signaling pathways that lead to fibrosis. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β is a central mediator in promoting transdifferentiation of polarized renal tubular epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells, resulting in irreversible kidney injury. While current therapies are limited, the search for more effective diagnostic and treatment modalities is intensive. Although biopsy with histology is the most accurate method of diagnosis and staging, imaging techniques such as diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and shear wave elastography ultrasound are less invasive ways to stage fibrosis. Current therapies such as renin-angiotensin blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors aim to delay progression. Newer antifibrotic agents that suppress the downstream inflammatory mediators involved in the fibrotic process are in clinical trials, and potential therapeutic targets that interfere with TGF-β signaling are being explored. Small interfering RNAs and stem cell-based therapeutics are also being evaluated. Further research and clinical studies are necessary in order to avoid dialysis and kidney transplantation.",1.3583684232595057e-43
38584843,Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 protects against renal fibrosis by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway.,Open Med (Wars),"Renal fibrosis (RF) is an important pathogenesis for renal function deterioration in chronic kidney disease. Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (SFRP5) is an anti-fibrotic adipokine but its direct role on RF remains unknown. It was aimed to study the protective effect of SFRP5 against RF and interference with Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway for the first time. First, the therapeutic efficacy of SFRP5 was evaluated by adenovirus overexpression in rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)in vivo. Thirty-six rats were randomly divided into the sham, UUO, and SFRP5 (UUO + Ad-SFRP5) groups. Half rats in each group were selected at random for euthanasia at 7 days and the others until 14 days. Then, the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was established in HK-2 cellsin vitro. The cells were divided into four groups: the control group, the TGF-β1 group, the TGF-β1 + SFRP5 group, and the TGF-β1 + SFRP5 + anti-SFRP5 group. The makers of EMT and Wnt/β-catenin pathway proteins were investigated. In the UUO model, expression of SFRP5 showed compensatory upregulation, and adenoviral-mediated SFRP5 over-expression remarkably attenuated RF, as demonstrated by maintenance of E-cadherin and suppression of α-smooth muscle actin (SMA).In vitro, SFRP5 was shown to inhibit TGF-β1-mediated positive regulation of α-SMA, fibronectin, collagen I but negative regulation of E-cadherin. Furthermore, SFRP5 abrogated activation of Wnt/β-catenin, which was the essential pathway in EMT and RF pathogenesis. The changes after a neutralizing antibody to SFRP5 confirmed the specificity of SFRP5 for inhibition. These findings suggest that SFRP5 can directly ameliorate EMT and protect against RF by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway.© 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.",1.2522367792097607e-62
38575341,Myofibroblast-derived exosomes enhance macrophages to myofibroblasts transition and kidney fibrosis.,Ren Fail,"A critical event in the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis is the transition of macrophages into myofibroblasts (MMT). Exosomes play an important role in crosstalk among cells in the kidney and the development of renal fibrosis. However, the role of myofibroblast-derived exosomes in the process of MMT and renal fibrosis progression remains unknown. Here, we examined the role of myofibroblast-derived exosomes in MMT and kidney fibrogenesis.In vitro, transforming growth factor-β1 stimulated the differentiation of kidney fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and promoted exosome release from myofibroblasts. RAW264.7 cells were treated with exosomes derived from myofibroblasts. We found purified exosomes from myofibroblasts trigger the MMT. By contrast, inhibition of exosome production with GW4869 or exosome depletion from the conditioned media abolished the ability of myofibroblasts to induce MMT. Mice treatment with myofibroblast-derived exosomes (Myo-Exo) exhibited severe fibrotic lesion and more abundant MMT cells in kidneys with folic acid (FA) injury, which was negated by TANK-banding kinase-1 inhibitor. Furthermore, suppression of exosome production reduced collagen deposition, extracellular matrix protein accumulation, and MMT in FA nephropathy. Collectively, Myo-Exo enhances the MMT and kidney fibrosis. Blockade of exosomes mediated myofibroblasts-macrophages communication may provide a novel therapeutic target for kidney fibrosis.",3.232960913901424e-47
38561236,Kidney damage associated with COVID-19: from the acute to the chronic phase.,Ren Fail,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) infection is well established as a systemic disease including kidney damage. The entry point into the renal cell remains the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and the spectrum of renal lesions is broad, with a clear predominance of structural and functional tubular lesions. The most common form of glomerular injury is collapsing glomerulopathy (CG), which is strongly associated with apolipoprotein L1(APOL-1) risk variants. These acute lesions, which are secondary to the direct or indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2, can progress to chronicity and are specific to long COVID-19 in the absence of any other cause. Residual inflammation associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to acute kidney injury (AKI) as a transitional state with or without severe histological lesions, may be responsible for greater kidney function decline in mild-to-moderate COVID-19. This review discusses the evidence for renal histological markers of chronicity in COVID-19 patients and triggers of low-grade inflammation that may explain the decline in kidney function in the post-COVID-19 period.",1.698365398485193e-41

Due to limited treatment options, novel molecular pathways are urgently required to advance the treatment and diagnosis of CKD.The characteristics of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in CKD patients were analyzed using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and genes related to oxidative stress were retrieved from the Genecard database. Subsequently, a comprehensive approach was applied, including immune infiltration analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, to identify hub genes among differentially expressed immune-related oxidative stress genes (DEIOSGs). Validation of hub genes was performed using an external data set, and diagnostic potential capability was evaluated through receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. In animal experiments, the expression of hub genes in CKD was confirmed by inducing a CKD model through a 5/6 nephrectomy procedure. Finally, the relationship between these hub genes and clinical characteristics were assessed using the Nephroseq v5 database.29 DEIOSGs were identified by comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. PPI analysis screened the hub genes NCF2, S100A9, and SELL. ROC analysis demonstrated excellent diagnostic efficacy. Further validation from other databases and animal experiments confirmed a substantial upregulation in the expression of hub genes in CKD. Additionally, clinical correlation analysis established a clear link between hub gene expression and renal function deterioration.Our study confirms NCF2, S100A9, and SELL as diagnostic biomarkers associated with immune response and oxidative stress in CKD, suggesting their potential as novel targets for CKD diagnosis and treatment.© 2024 The Authors.

38666884,Multiomics Picture of Obesity in Young Adults.,Biology (Basel),"Obesity is a socially significant disease that is characterized by a disproportionate accumulation of fat. It is also associated with chronic inflammation, cancer, diabetes, and other comorbidities. Investigating biomarkers and pathological processes linked to obesity is especially vital for young individuals, given their increased potential for lifestyle modifications. By comparing the genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles of individuals categorized as underweight, normal, overweight, and obese, we aimed to determine which omics layer most accurately reflects the phenotypic changes in an organism that result from obesity. We profiled blood plasma samples by employing three omics methodologies. The untargeted GC×GC-MS metabolomics approach identified 313 metabolites. To augment the metabolomic dataset, we integrated a label-free HPLC-MS/MS proteomics method, leading to the identification of 708 proteins. The genomic layer encompassed the genotyping of 647,250 SNPs. Utilizing omics data, we trained sparse Partial Least Squares models to predict body mass index. Molecular features exhibiting frequently non-zero coefficients were selected as potential biomarkers, and we further explored enriched biological pathways. Proteomics was the most effective in single-omics analyses, with a median absolute error (MAE) of 5.44 ± 0.31 kg/m2, incorporating an average of 24 proteins per model. Metabolomics showed slightly lower performance (MAE = 6.06 ± 0.33 kg/m2), followed by genomics (MAE = 6.20 ± 0.34 kg/m2). As expected, multiomic models demonstrated better accuracy, particularly the combination of proteomics and metabolomics (MAE = 4.77 ± 0.33 kg/m2), while including genomics data did not enhance the results. This manuscript is the first multiomics study of obesity in a gender-balanced cohort of young adults profiled by genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic methods. The comprehensive approach provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of obesity, opening avenues for more targeted interventions.",1.4197876295393467e-27

38604248,Evidence of a pan-tissue decline in stemness during human aging.,Aging (Albany NY),"Despite their biological importance, the role of stem cells in human aging remains to be elucidated. In this work, we applied a machine learning methodology to GTEx transcriptome data and assigned stemness scores to 17,382 healthy samples from 30 human tissues aged between 20 and 79 years. We found that ~60% of the studied tissues exhibit a significant negative correlation between the subject's age and stemness score. The only significant exception was the uterus, where we observed an increased stemness with age. Moreover, we observed that stemness is positively correlated with cell proliferation and negatively correlated with cellular senescence. Finally, we also observed a trend that hematopoietic stem cells derived from older individuals might have higher stemness scores. In conclusion, we assigned stemness scores to human samples and show evidence of a pan-tissue loss of stemness during human aging, which adds weight to the idea that stem cell deterioration may contribute to human aging.",3.2032273980924167e-24

The present narrative review aims to clarify the current understanding of the impact of childhood maltreatment on biomarkers in patients with mood disorders and their first-degree relatives. Neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and hormones (eg the stress hormone cortisol), play a crucial role in regulating mood and emotion. Childhood maltreatment can alter and affect the levels and functioning of these neurotransmitters in the brain; further, childhood maltreatment can lead to structural and connectivity changes in the brain, hence contributing to the development of mood disorders and moderating illness presentation and modifying response to treatments. Childhood maltreatment information, therefore, appears mandatory in treatment planning and is a critical factor in therapeutic algorithms. Further research is needed to fully understand these pathways and develop new treatment modalities for individuals with mood disorders who have experienced childhood maltreatment and effective preventive interventions for individuals at risk of developing mood disorders.© 2024 Vinberg et al.",4.723358055107291e-32

We addressed TRIM66's role in reproduction by loss-of-function genetics in the mouse. Males homozygous forTrim66-nullmutations produced functional spermatozoa. Round spermatids lacking TRIM66 up-regulated a network of genes involved in histone acetylation and H3K4 methylation. Profiling of H3K4me3 patterns in the sperm produced by theTrim66-null mutant showed minor alterations below statistical significance.

Testicular development is tightly regulated by epigenetics. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is a prevalent internal modification on mRNA and plays an important role in development. The mRNA m6A methylation in boar testicular development still needs to be investigated.Using the MeRIP-seq technique, we identify and profile m6A modification in boar testes between piglets and adults. The results showed 7783 distinct m6A peaks in piglets and 6590 distinct m6A peaks in adults, with 2,471 peaks shared between the two groups. Enrichment of GO and KEGG analysis reveal dynamic m6A methylation in various biological processes and signalling pathways. Meanwhile, we conjointly analyzed differentially methylated and expressed genes in boar testes before and after sexual maturity, and reproductive related genes (TLE4, TSSK3, TSSK6, C11ORF94, PATZ1, PHLPP1 and PAQR7) were identified. Functional enrichment analysis showed that differential genes are associated with important biological functions, including regulation of growth and development, regulation of metabolic processes and protein catabolic processes.The results demonstrate that m6A methylation, differential expression and the related signalling pathways are crucial for boar testicular development. These results suggest a role for m6A modification in boar testicular development and provided a resource for future studies on m6A function in boar testicular development.© 2024.

Beyond the paternal haploid genome, spermatozoa also deliver coding and non-coding RNAs to the oocyte. While sperm-borne RNAs have demonstrated potential involvement in embryo development, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, 47 sperm samples from normozoospermic males undergoing fertility treatment using donor oocytes were sequenced and analyzed to evaluate associations between sperm RNA elements (exon-sized sequences) and blastocyst progression. A total of 366 RNA elements (REs) were significantly associated with blastocyst rate (padj < 0.05), some of which were linked to genes related to critical developmental processes, including mitotic spindle formation and both ectoderm and mesoderm specification. Of note, 27 RE-associated RNAs are predicted targets of our previously reported list of developmentally significant miRNAs. Inverse RE-miRNA expression patterns were consistent with miRNA-mediated down-regulation. This study provides a comprehensive set of REs which differ by the patient's ability to produce blastocysts.

This study aimed to provide insight into the pathways linking socioeconomic exposures-household income, last known occupational position, and life course socioeconomic trajectories-with brain microstructure and cognitive performance in middle to late adulthood. We assessed socioeconomic conditions alongside quantitative relaxometry and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging indicators of brain tissue microstructure and cognitive performance in a sample of community-dwelling men and women (N = 751, aged 50-91 years). We adjusted the applied regression analyses and structural equation models for the linear and nonlinear effects of age, sex, education, cardiovascular risk factors, and the presence of depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Individuals from lower-income households showed signs of advanced brain white matter (WM) aging with greater mean diffusivity (MD), lower neurite density, lower myelination, and lower iron content. The association between household income and MD was mediated by neurite density (B = 0.084,p = 0.003) and myelination (B = 0.019,p = 0.009); MD partially mediated the association between household income and cognitive performance (B = 0.017,p < 0.05). Household income moderated the relation between WM microstructure and cognitive performance, such that greater MD, lower myelination, or lower neurite density was only associated with poorer cognitive performance among individuals from lower-income households. Individuals from higher-income households showed preserved cognitive performance even with greater MD, lower myelination, or lower neurite density. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the associations between socioeconomic conditions, brain anatomy, and cognitive performance in middle to late adulthood.Copyright © 2024 the authors.",0.0076765340576600595
38586041,Marker selection strategies for circulating tumor DNA guided by phylogenetic inference.,bioRxiv,"Blood-based profiling of tumor DNA (""liquid biopsy"") has offered great prospects for non-invasive early cancer diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and clinical guidance, but require further advances in computational methods to become a robust quantitative assay of tumor clonal evolution. We propose new methods to better characterize tumor clonal dynamics from circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), through application to two specific questions: 1) How to apply longitudinal ctDNA data to refine phylogeny models of clonal evolution, and 2) how to quantify changes in clonal frequencies that may be indicative of treatment response or tumor progression. We pose these questions through a probabilistic framework for optimally identifying maximum likelihood markers and applying them to characterizing clonal evolution.We first estimate a distribution over plausible clonal lineage models, using bootstrap samples over pre-treatment tissue-based sequence data. We then refine these lineage models and the clonal frequencies they imply over successive longitudinal samples. We use the resulting framework for modeling and refining tree distributions to pose a set of optimization problems to select ctDNA markers to maximize measures of utility capturing ability to solve the two questions of reducing uncertain in phylogeny models or quantifying clonal frequencies given the models. We tested our methods on synthetic data and showed them to be effective at refining distributions of tree models and clonal frequencies so as to minimize measures of tree distance relative to the ground truth. Application of the tree refinement methods to real tumor data further demonstrated their effectiveness in refining a clonal lineage model and assessing its clonal frequencies. The work shows the power of computational methods to improve marker selection, clonal lineage reconstruction, and clonal dynamics profiling for more precise and quantitative assays of tumor progression.https://github.com/CMUSchwartzLab/Mase-phi.git.russells@andrew.cmu.edu.",1.0544120040432917e-45

This comprehensive review explores the intricate landscape of lung cancer research, delving into recent breakthroughs and their implications for diagnosis, therapy, and prevention. Genomic profiling and biomarker identification have ushered in the era of personalised medicine, enabling targeted therapies that minimise harm to healthy tissues while effectively combating cancer cells. The relationship between pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer is examined, shedding light on potential mechanisms linking these two conditions. Early detection methods, notably low-dose computed tomography scans, have significantly improved patient outcomes, emphasising the importance of timely interventions. There has been a growing interest in segmentectomy as a surgical intervention for early-stage lung cancer in recent years. Immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative approach, harnessing the body's immune system to recognise and eliminate cancer cells. Combining immunotherapy with traditional treatments, such as chemotherapy and targeted therapies, has shown enhanced efficacy, addressing the disease's heterogeneity and overcoming drug resistance. Precision medicine, guided by genomic profiling, has enabled the development of targeted therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors, offering personalised treatments tailored to individual patients. Challenges such as drug resistance and limited accessibility to advanced therapies persist, emphasising the need for collaborative efforts and innovative technologies like artificial intelligence.

38553459,The two sides of chromosomal instability: drivers and brakes in cancer.,Signal Transduct Target Ther,"Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer and is associated with tumor cell malignancy. CIN triggers a chain reaction in cells leading to chromosomal abnormalities, including deviations from the normal chromosome number or structural changes in chromosomes. CIN arises from errors in DNA replication and chromosome segregation during cell division, leading to the formation of cells with abnormal number and/or structure of chromosomes. Errors in DNA replication result from abnormal replication licensing as well as replication stress, such as double-strand breaks and stalled replication forks; meanwhile, errors in chromosome segregation stem from defects in chromosome segregation machinery, including centrosome amplification, erroneous microtubule-kinetochore attachments, spindle assembly checkpoint, or defective sister chromatids cohesion. In normal cells, CIN is deleterious and is associated with DNA damage, proteotoxic stress, metabolic alteration, cell cycle arrest, and senescence. Paradoxically, despite these negative consequences, CIN is one of the hallmarks of cancer found in over 90% of solid tumors and in blood cancers. Furthermore, CIN could endow tumors with enhanced adaptation capabilities due to increased intratumor heterogeneity, thereby facilitating adaptive resistance to therapies; however, excessive CIN could induce tumor cells death, leading to the ""just-right"" model for CIN in tumors. Elucidating the complex nature of CIN is crucial for understanding the dynamics of tumorigenesis and for developing effective anti-tumor treatments. This review provides an overview of causes and consequences of CIN, as well as the paradox of CIN, a phenomenon that continues to perplex researchers. Finally, this review explores the potential of CIN-based anti-tumor therapy.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.372690742211156e-62

Advances in DNA sequencing technologies and our understanding of the molecular biology of tumors have increased interest in exploiting ctDNA to facilitate detection of molecular residual disease (MRD). Analysis of ctDNA as a promising MRD biomarker of solid malignancies has a central role in precision medicine initiatives exemplified by our CIRCULATE-Japan project involving patients with resectable colorectal cancer. Notably, the project underscores the prognostic significance of the ctDNA status at 4 weeks post-surgery and its correlation to adjuvant therapy efficacy at interim analysis. This substantiates the hypothesis that MRD is a critical prognostic indicator of relapse in patients with colorectal cancer. Despite remarkable advancements, challenges endure, primarily attributable to the exceedingly low ctDNA concentration in peripheral blood, particularly in scenarios involving low tumor shedding and the intrinsic error rates of current sequencing technologies. These complications necessitate more sensitive and sophisticated assays to verify the clinical utility of MRD across all solid tumors.

38638872,Exploring juventology: unlocking the secrets of youthspan and longevity programs.,Front Aging,"In recent decades, the study of biological aging has evolved from simplistic theories like the free radical theory to more complex and nuanced perspectives. In particular, the identification of evolutionary conserved genes and signaling pathways that can modulate both lifespan but also healthspan has resulted in the expanding understanding of the link between nutrients, signal transduction proteins, and aging along with substantial support for the existence of multiple ""longevity programs,"" which are activated based on the availability of nutrients. Periodic fasting and other dietary restrictions can promote entry into a longevity program characterized by cellular protection and optimized function, and the activation of regenerative processes that lead to rejuvenation. This review discusses the idea of juventology, a novel field proposing the existence of longevity programs that can maintain organisms in a highly functional state for extended periods of time. Drawing upon research onSaccharomyces cerevisiaeand other model organisms, the review explores the distinctiveness of juventology from traditional aging-centered views. The focus on the ""age of youth"" challenges conventional thinking and opens new avenues for understanding and extending the period of peak functionality in organisms. Thus, a ""juventology""-based strategy can complement the traditional gerontology approach by focusing not on aging but on the longevity program affecting the life history period in which mortality is very low and organisms remain youthful, healthy, and fully functional.Copyright © 2024 Brandhorst and Longo.",1.7502171607235526e-36
38534746,Mitochondrial Dysfunction: A Key Player in Brain Aging and Diseases.,Curr Issues Mol Biol,"Mitochondria are thought to have become incorporated within the eukaryotic cell approximately 2 billion years ago and play a role in a variety of cellular processes, such as energy production, calcium buffering and homeostasis, steroid synthesis, cell growth, and apoptosis, as well as inflammation and ROS production. Considering that mitochondria are involved in a multitude of cellular processes, mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to play a role within several age-related diseases, including cancers, diabetes (type 2), and neurodegenerative diseases, although the underlying mechanisms are not entirely understood. The significant increase in lifespan and increased incidence of age-related diseases over recent decades has confirmed the necessity to understand the mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction impacts the process of aging and age-related diseases. In this review, we will offer a brief overview of mitochondria, along with structure and function of this important organelle. We will then discuss the cause and consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction in the aging process, with a particular focus on its role in inflammation, cognitive decline, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. We will offer insight into therapies and interventions currently used to preserve or restore mitochondrial functioning during aging and neurodegeneration.",1.2812473116621156e-45
38681777,SUMA: a lightweight machine learning model-powered shared nearest neighbour-based clustering application interface for scRNA-Seq data.,Turk J Biol,"Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-Seq) explores cellular diversity at the gene expression level. Due to the inherent sparsity and noise in scRNA-Seq data and the uncertainty on the types of sequenced cells, effective clustering and cell type annotation are essential. The graph-based clustering of scRNA-Seq data is a simple yet powerful approach that presents data as a ""shared nearest neighbour"" graph and clusters the cells using graph clustering algorithms. These algorithms are dependent on several user-defined parameters.Here we present SUMA, a lightweight tool that uses a random forest model to predict the optimum number of neighbours to obtain the optimum clustering results. Moreover, we integrated our method with other commonly used methods in an RShiny application. SUMA can be used in a local environment (https://github.com/hkarakurt8742/SUMA) or as a browser tool (https://hkarakurt.shinyapps.io/suma/).Publicly available scRNA-Seq datasets and 3 different graph-based clustering algorithms were used to develop SUMA, and a large range for number of neighbours and variant genes was taken into consideration. The quality of clustering was assessed using the adjusted Rand index (ARI) and true labels of each dataset. The data were split into training and test datasets, and the model was built and optimised using Scikit-learn (Python) and randomForest (R) libraries.The accuracy of our machine learning model was 0.96, while the AUC of the ROC curve was 0.98. The model indicated that the number of cells in scRNA-Seq data is the most important feature when deciding the number of neighbours.We developed and evaluated the SUMA model and implemented the method in the SUMAShiny app, which integrates SUMA with different clustering methods and enables nonbioinformatician users to cluster and visualise their scRNA data easily. The SUMAShiny app is available both for desktop and browser use.© TÜBİTAK.",9.811238067073884e-38
38673045,Precision Medicine-Are We There Yet? A Narrative Review of Precision Medicine's Applicability in Primary Care.,J Pers Med,"Precision medicine (PM), also termed stratified, individualised, targeted, or personalised medicine, embraces a rapidly expanding area of research, knowledge, and practice. It brings together two emerging health technologies to deliver better individualised care: the many ""-omics"" arising from increased capacity to understand the human genome and ""big data"" and data analytics, including artificial intelligence (AI). PM has the potential to transform an individual's health, moving from population-based disease prevention to more personalised management. There is however a tension between the two, with a real risk that this will exacerbate health inequalities and divert funds and attention from basic healthcare requirements leading to worse health outcomes for many. All areas of medicine should consider how this will affect their practice, with PM now strongly encouraged and supported by government initiatives and research funding. In this review, we discuss examples of PM in current practice and its emerging applications in primary care, such as clinical prediction tools that incorporate genomic markers and pharmacogenomic testing. We look towards potential future applications and consider some key questions for PM, including evidence of its real-world impact, its affordability, the risk of exacerbating health inequalities, and the computational and storage challenges of applying PM technologies at scale.",6.096583911570403e-32
38522814,The neurophysiological consequences of racism-related stressors in Black Americans.,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,"Racism-related stressors, from experiences of both implicit and explicit racial discrimination to systemic socioeconomic disadvantage, have a cumulative impact on Black Americans' health. The present narrative review synthesizes peripheral (neuroendocrine and inflammation markers), psychophysiological (heart-rate variability, skin conductance), and neuroimaging (structural and functional) findings that demonstrate unique associations with racism-related stress. Emerging evidence reveals how racism-related stressors contribute to differential physiological and neural responses and may have distinct impacts on regions involved with threat and social processing. Ultimately, the neurophysiological effects of racism-related stress may confer biological susceptibility to stress and trauma-related disorders. We note critical gaps in the literature on the neurophysiological impact of racism-related stress and outline additional research that is needed on the multifactorial interactions between racism and mental health. A clearer understanding of the interactions between racism-related stress, neurophysiology, and stress- and trauma-related disorders is critical for preventative efforts, biomarker discovery, and selection of effective clinical treatments for Black Americans.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

38617564,Unveiling the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome through transcriptome analysis.,iScience,"The aim of this study was to analyze signaling pathways associated with differentially expressed messenger RNAs in people with restless legs syndrome (RLS). Seventeen RLS patients and 18 controls were enrolled. Coding RNA expression profiling of 12,857 gene transcripts by next-generation sequencing was performed. Enrichment analysis by pathfindR tool was carried-out, with p-adjusted ≤0.001 and fold-change ≥2.5. Nine main different network groups were significantly dysregulated in RLS: infections, inflammation, immunology, neurodegeneration, cancer, neurotransmission and biological, blood and metabolic mechanisms. Genetic predisposition plays a key role in RLS and evidence indicates its inflammatory nature; the high involvement of mainly neurotropic viruses and the TORCH complex might trigger inflammatory/immune reactions in genetically predisposed subjects and activate a series of biological pathways-especially IL-17, receptor potential channels, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, NOD-like receptor, mitogen-activated protein kinase, p53, mitophagy, and ferroptosis-involved in neurotransmitter mechanisms, synaptic plasticity, axon guidance, neurodegeneration, carcinogenesis, and metabolism.© 2024 The Authors.",3.586966432907755e-28
38737752,GWAS advancements to investigate disease associations and biological mechanisms.,Clin Transl Discov,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been instrumental in elucidating the genetic architecture of various traits and diseases. Despite the success of GWAS, inherent limitations such as identifying rare and ultra-rare variants, the potential for spurious associations, and in pinpointing causative agents can undermine diagnostic capabilities. This review provides an overview of GWAS and highlights recent advances in genetics that employ a range of methodologies, including Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), Mendelian Randomization (MR), the Pangenome's high-quality T2T-CHM13 panel, and the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), as potential enablers of current and future GWAS research. State of the literature demonstrate the capabilities of these techniques in enhancing the statistical power of GWAS. WGS, with its comprehensive approach, captures the entire genome, surpassing the capabilities of the traditional GWAS technique focused on predefined Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) sites. The Pangenome's T2T-CHM13 panel, with its holistic approach, aids in the analysis of regions with high sequence identity, such as segmental duplications (SDs). Mendelian Randomization has advanced causative inference, improving clinical diagnostics and facilitating definitive conclusions. Furthermore, spatial biology techniques like HuBMAP, enable 3D molecular mapping of tissues at single-cell resolution, offering insights into pathology of complex traits. This study aims to elucidate and advocate for the increased application of these technologies, highlighting their potential to shape the future of GWAS research.",1.2161471997392935e-30

38715020,Mapping and functional characterization of structural variation in 1060 pig genomes.,Genome Biol,"Structural variations (SVs) have significant impacts on complex phenotypes by rearranging large amounts of DNA sequence.We present a comprehensive SV catalog based on the whole-genome sequence of 1060 pigs (Sus scrofa) representing 101 breeds, covering 9.6% of the pig genome. This catalog includes 42,487 deletions, 37,913 mobile element insertions, 3308 duplications, 1664 inversions, and 45,184 break ends. Estimates of breed ancestry and hybridization using genotyped SVs align well with those from single nucleotide polymorphisms. Geographically stratified deletions are observed, along with known duplications of the KIT gene, responsible for white coat color in European pigs. Additionally, we identify a recent SINE element insertion in MYO5A transcripts of European pigs, potentially influencing alternative splicing patterns and coat color alterations. Furthermore, a Yorkshire-specific copy number gain within ABCG2 is found, impacting chromatin interactions and gene expression across multiple tissues over a stretch of genomic region of ~200 kb. Preliminary investigations into SV's impact on gene expression and traits using the Pig Genotype-Tissue Expression (PigGTEx) data reveal SV associations with regulatory variants and gene-trait pairs. For instance, a 51-bp deletion is linked to the lead eQTL of the lipid metabolism regulating gene FADS3, whose expression in embryo may affect loin muscle area, as revealed by our transcriptome-wide association studies.This SV catalog serves as a valuable resource for studying diversity, evolutionary history, and functional shaping of the pig genome by processes like domestication, trait-based breeding, and adaptive evolution.© 2024.

38671154,Analysis and benchmarking of small and large genomic variants across tandem repeats.,Nat Biotechnol,"Tandem repeats (TRs) are highly polymorphic in the human genome, have thousands of associated molecular traits and are linked to over 60 disease phenotypes. However, they are often excluded from at-scale studies because of challenges with variant calling and representation, as well as a lack of a genome-wide standard. Here, to promote the development of TR methods, we created a catalog of TR regions and explored TR properties across 86 haplotype-resolved long-read human assemblies. We curated variants from the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) HG002 individual to create a TR dataset to benchmark existing and future TR analysis methods. We also present an improved variant comparison method that handles variants greater than 4 bp in length and varying allelic representation. The 8.1% of the genome covered by the TR catalog holds ~24.9% of variants per individual, including 124,728 small and 17,988 large variants for the GIAB HG002 'truth-set' TR benchmark.

38669259,A hepatitis B virus (HBV) sequence variation graph improves alignment and sample-specific consensus sequence construction.,PLoS One,"Nearly 300 million individuals live with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (CHB), for which no curative therapy is available. As viral diversity is associated with pathogenesis and immunological control of infection, improved methods to characterize this diversity could aid drug development efforts. Conventionally, viral sequencing data are mapped/aligned to a reference genome, and only the aligned sequences are retained for analysis. Thus, reference selection is critical, yet selecting the most representative reference a priori remains difficult. We investigate an alternative pangenome approach which can combine multiple reference sequences into a graph which can be used during alignment. Using simulated short-read sequencing data generated from publicly available HBV genomes and real sequencing data from an individual living with CHB, we demonstrate alignment to a phylogenetically representative 'genome graph' can improve alignment, avoid issues of reference ambiguity, and facilitate the construction of sample-specific consensus sequences more genetically similar to the individual's infection. Graph-based methods can, therefore, improve efforts to characterize the genetics of viral pathogens, including HBV, and have broader implications in host-pathogen research.Copyright: © 2024 Duchen et al.

The gene family and its expression have been challenging to investigate because it is embedded in high-identity and highly variable segmental duplications. We sequenced and assembled the gene family using long-read sequencing data from 34 humans and 11 nonhuman primate species. Our analysis shows that this particular gene family has independently duplicated in at least five primate lineages, and the duplicated loci are enriched at sites of large-scale chromosomal rearrangements on chromosome 17. We find that most humans vary along twoTBC1D3clusters where human haplotypes are highly variable in copy number, differing by as many as 20 copies, and structure (structural heterozygosity 90%). We also show evidence of positive selection, as well as a significant change in the predicted human TBC1D3 protein sequence. Lastly, we find that, despite multiple duplications, humanTBC1D3expression is limited to a subset of copies and, most notably, from a single paralog group:TBC1D3-CDKL. These observations may help explain why a gene potentially important in cortical development can be so variable in the human population.",2.588109342561913e-31
38650588,A novel framework for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping using probe capture-based targeted next-generation sequencing and computational analysis.,Comput Struct Biotechnol J,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes play pivotal roles in numerous immunological applications. Given the immense number of polymorphisms, achieving accurate high-throughput HLA typing remains challenging. This study aimed to harness the human pan-genome reference consortium (HPRC) resources as a potential benchmark for HLA reference materials. We meticulously annotated specific four field-resolution alleles for 11 HLA genes (HLA-A,-B,-C,-DPA1,-DPB1,-DQA1,-DQB1,-DRB1,-DRB3,-DRB4and-DRB5) from 44 high-quality HPRC personal genome assemblies. For sequencing, we crafted HLA-specific probes and conducted capture-based targeted sequencing of the genomic DNA of the HPRC cohort, ensuring focused and comprehensive coverage of the HLA region of interest. We used publicly available short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from identical samples to offer a comparative perspective. To decipher the vast amount of sequencing data, we employed seven distinct software tools: OptiType, HLA-VBseq, HISAT genotype, SpecHLA, T1K, QzType, and DRAGEN. Each tool offers unique capabilities and algorithms for HLA genotyping, allowing comprehensive analysis and validation of the results. We then compared these results with benchmarks derived from personal genome assemblies. Our findings present a comprehensive four-field-resolution HLA allele annotation for 44 HPRC samples. Significantly, our innovative targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach for HLA genes showed superior accuracy compared with conventional short-read WGS. An integrated analysis involving QzType, T1K, and DRAGEN was developed, achieving 100% accuracy for all 11 HLA genes. In conclusion, our study highlighted the combination of targeted short-read sequencing and astute computational analysis as a robust approach for HLA genotyping. Furthermore, the HPRC cohort has emerged as a valuable assembly-based reference in this realm.© 2024 The Authors.",1.8029591578700982e-25

Until recently, genomes were typically assembled into fragments of a few megabases at best, but now technological advances in long-read sequencing enable the near-complete assembly of each chromosome - also known as telomere-to-telomere assembly - for many organisms. Here, we review recent progress on assembly algorithms and protocols, with a focus on how to derive near-telomere-to-telomere assemblies.

Biastools analyzes and categorizes instances of reference bias. It works in various scenarios: when the donor's variants are known and reads are simulated; when donor variants are known and reads are real; and when variants are unknown and reads are real. Using biastools, we observe that more inclusive graph genomes result in fewer biased sites. We find that end-to-end alignment reduces bias at indels relative to local aligners. Finally, we use biastools to characterize how T2T references improve large-scale bias.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.293710627613129e-12

Such studies have limitations regarding whole genome-wide association analysis, making it crucial to have genome-to-phenome association information with the largest possible whole genome and matched phenome data to conduct further population-genome studies and develop health care services based on population genomics.Here, we present 4,157 whole genome sequences (Korea4K) coupled with 107 health check-up parameters as the largest genomic resource of the Korean Genome Project. It encompasses most of the variants with allele frequency >0.001 in Koreans, indicating that it sufficiently covered most of the common and rare genetic variants with commonly measured phenotypes for Koreans. Korea4K provides 45,537,252 variants, and half of them were not present in Korea1K (1,094 samples). We also identified 1,356 new genotype-phenotype associations that were not found by the Korea1K dataset. Phenomics analyses further revealed 24 significant genetic correlations, 14 pleiotropic associations, and 127 causal relationships based on Mendelian randomization among 37 traits. In addition, the Korea4K imputation reference panel, the largest Korean variants reference to date, showed a superior imputation performance to Korea1K across all allele frequency categories.Collectively, Korea4K provides not only the largest Korean genome data but also corresponding health check-up parameters and novel genome-phenome associations.

Eligible participants included genetic researchers who held US academic affiliations and conducted research using human genetic databases.Internet-administered survey to genetic research professionals.The survey assessed respondents' experience and interest in research with diverse ancestral data, perceptions of adequacy of diverse data across database stewards (ie, private, government, or consortia), and identified facilitators for encouraging use of diverse ancestral data. Descriptive statistics, χ2 tests, and z tests were used to describe respondents' perspectives and experiences.A total of 294 researchers (171 men [58.5%]; 121 women [41.2%]) were included in the study, resulting in a response rate of 20.4%. Across seniority level, 109 respondents (37.1%) were senior researchers, 85 (28.9%) were mid-level researchers, 71 (24.1%) were junior researchers, and 27 (9.2%) were trainees. Significantly more respondents worked with data from European ancestral populations (261 respondents [88.8%]) compared with any other ancestral population. Respondents who had not done research with Indigenous ancestral groups (210 respondents [71.4%]) were significantly more likely to report interest in doing so than not (121 respondents [41.2%] vs 89 respondents [30.3%]; P < .001). Respondents reported discrepancies in the adequacy of ancestral populations with significantly more reporting European samples as adequate across consortium (203 respondents [90.6%]), government (200 respondents [89.7%]), and private (42 respondents [80.8%]) databases, compared with any other ancestral population. There were no significant differences in reported adequacy of ancestral populations across database stewards. A majority of respondents without access to adequate diverse samples reported that increasing the ancestral diversity of existing databases (201 respondents [68.4%]) and increasing access to databases that are already diverse (166 respondents [56.5%]) would increase the likelihood of them using a more diverse sample.In this survey study of US genetic researchers, respondents reported existing databases only provide adequate ancestral samples for European populations, despite their interest in other ancestral populations.

Since then, that group of scientists has seen their discipline blossom. In an attempt to understand what unity of genetic systems means and how the notion was borne out by later research, we survey the progress and prospects of cereal genomics: sequence assemblies, population-scale sequencing, resistance gene cloning and domestication genetics. Gene order may not be as extraordinarily well conserved in the grasses as once thought. Still, several recurring themes have emerged. The same ancestral molecular pathways defining plant architecture have been co-opted in the evolution of different cereal crops. Such genetic convergence as much as cross-fertilization of ideas between cereal geneticists has led to a rich harvest of genes that, it is hoped, will lead to improved varieties.© 2024.

Here we present chromosome-level genome assemblies of 69 accessions from a global species range. We found that genomic colinearity is very conserved, even among geographically and genetically distant accessions. Along chromosome arms, megabase-scale rearrangements are rare and typically present only in a single accession. This indicates that the karyotype is quasi-fixed and that rearrangements in chromosome arms are counter-selected. Centromeric regions display higher structural dynamics, and divergences in core centromeres account for most of the genome size variations. Pan-genome analyses uncovered 32,986 distinct gene families, 60% being present in all accessions and 40% appearing to be dispensable, including 18% private to a single accession, indicating unexplored genic diversity.

Allele specific technologies, including recombinant MHC-I technologies, have been extensively used in T cell analyses for COVID-19 patients and are currently used in the development of immunotherapies for cancer. However, the immense diversity of MHC-I alleles presents challenges. The genetic diversity serves as the foundation of personalized medicine, yet it also poses a potential risk of exacerbating healthcare disparities based on MHC-I alleles. To assess potential biases, we analysed (pre)clinical publications focusing on COVID-19 studies and T cell receptor (TCR)-based clinical trials. Our findings reveal an underrepresentation of MHC-I alleles associated with Asian, Australian, and African descent. Ensuring diverse representation is vital for advancing personalized medicine and global healthcare equity, transcending genetic diversity.

38573185,Pangenome databases improve host removal and mycobacteria classification from clinical metagenomic data.,Gigascience,"Culture-free real-time sequencing of clinical metagenomic samples promises both rapid pathogen detection and antimicrobial resistance profiling. However, this approach introduces the risk of patient DNA leakage. To mitigate this risk, we need near-comprehensive removal of human DNA sequences at the point of sequencing, typically involving the use of resource-constrained devices. Existing benchmarks have largely focused on the use of standardized databases and largely ignored the computational requirements of depletion pipelines as well as the impact of human genome diversity.We benchmarked host removal pipelines on simulated and artificial real Illumina and Nanopore metagenomic samples. We found that construction of a custom kraken database containing diverse human genomes results in the best balance of accuracy and computational resource usage. In addition, we benchmarked pipelines using kraken and minimap2 for taxonomic classification of Mycobacterium reads using standard and custom databases. With a database representative of the Mycobacterium genus, both tools obtained improved specificity and sensitivity, compared to the standard databases for classification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Computational efficiency of these custom databases was superior to most standard approaches, allowing them to be executed on a laptop device.Customized pangenome databases provide the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to standard databases for the task of human read removal and M. tuberculosis read classification from metagenomic samples. Such databases allow for execution on a laptop, without sacrificing accuracy, an especially important consideration in low-resource settings. We make all customized databases and pipelines freely available.© The Author(s) 2024. Published by Oxford University Press GigaScience.",5.475033371682343e-34
38572163,Identification of germline population variants misclassified as cancer-associated somatic variants.,Front Med (Lausanne),"Databases used for clinical interpretation in oncology rely on genetic data derived primarily from patients of European ancestry, leading to biases in cancer genetics research and clinical practice. One practical issue that arises in this context is the potential misclassification of multi-ancestral population variants as tumor-associated because they are not represented in reference genomes against which tumor sequencing data is aligned.To systematically find misclassified variants, we compared somatic variants in census genes from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) V99 with multi-ancestral population variants from the Genome Aggregation Databases' Linkage Disequilibrium (GnomAD). By comparing genomic coordinates, reference, and alternate alleles, we could identify misclassified variants in genes associated with cancer.We found 192 of 208 genes in COSMIC's cancer-associated census genes (92.31%) to be associated with variant misclassifications. Among the 1,906,732 variants in COSMIC, 6,957 variants (0.36%) aligned with normal population variants in GnomAD, concerning for misclassification. The African / African American ancestral population included the greatest number of misclassified variants and also had the greatest number of unique misclassified variants.The direct, systematic comparison of variants from COSMIC for co-occurrence in GnomAD supports a more accurate interpretation of tumor sequencing data and reduces bias related to genomic ancestry.Copyright © 2024 Pollard, Wilkerson and Rajagopal.",1.6943077965735572e-29
38562829,"Structural and genetic diversity in the secreted mucins, MUC5AC and MUC5B.",bioRxiv,"The secreted mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B play critical defensive roles in airway pathogen entrapment and mucociliary clearance by encoding large glycoproteins with variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs). These polymorphic and degenerate protein coding VNTRs make the loci difficult to investigate with short reads. We characterize the structural diversity ofMUC5ACandMUC5Bby long-read sequencing and assembly of 206 human and 20 nonhuman primate (NHP) haplotypes. We find that humanMUC5Bis largely invariant (5761-5762aa); however, seven haplotypes have expanded VNTRs (6291-7019aa). In contrast, 30 allelic variants ofMUC5ACencode 16 distinct proteins (5249-6325aa) with cysteine-rich domain and VNTR copy number variation. We groupedMUC5ACalleles into three phylogenetic clades: H1 (46%, ~5654aa), H2 (33%, ~5742aa), and H3 (7%, ~6325aa). The two most common humanMUC5ACvariants are smaller than NHP gene models, suggesting a reduction in protein length during recent human evolution. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and Tajima's D analyses reveal that East Asians carry exceptionally largeMUC5ACLD blocks with an excess of rare variation (p<0.05). To validate this result, we used Locityper for genotypingMUC5AChaplogroups in 2,600 unrelated samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. We observed signatures of positive selection in H1 and H2 among East Asians and a depletion of the likely ancestral haplogroup (H3). In Africans and Europeans, H3 alleles show an excess of common variation and deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, consistent with heterozygote advantage and balancing selection. This study provides a generalizable strategy to characterize complex protein coding VNTRs for improved disease associations.",4.9432164794633067e-23

Here we ascertained protein-altering CNVs from UK Biobank whole-exome sequencing data (n = 468,570) using haplotype-informed methods capable of detecting subexonic CNVs and variation within segmental duplications. Incorporating CNVs into analyses of rare variants predicted to cause gene loss of function (LOF) identified 100 associations of predicted LOF variants with 41 quantitative traits. A low-frequency partial deletion of RGL3 exon 6 conferred one of the strongest protective effects of gene LOF on hypertension risk (odds ratio = 0.86 (0.82-0.90)). Protein-coding variation in rapidly evolving gene families within segmental duplications-previously invisible to most analysis methods-generated some of the human genome's largest contributions to variation in type 2 diabetes risk, chronotype and blood cell traits.

38606789,A working model for the formation of Robertsonian chromosomes.,J Cell Sci,"Robertsonian chromosomes form by fusion of two chromosomes that have centromeres located near their ends, known as acrocentric or telocentric chromosomes. This fusion creates a new metacentric chromosome and is a major mechanism of karyotype evolution and speciation. Robertsonian chromosomes are common in nature and were first described in grasshoppers by the zoologist W. R. B. Robertson more than 100 years ago. They have since been observed in many species, including catfish, sheep, butterflies, bats, bovids, rodents and humans, and are the most common chromosomal change in mammals. Robertsonian translocations are particularly rampant in the house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, where they exhibit meiotic drive and create reproductive isolation. Recent progress has been made in understanding how Robertsonian chromosomes form in the human genome, highlighting some of the fundamental principles of how and why these types of fusion events occur so frequently. Consequences of these fusions include infertility and Down's syndrome. In this Hypothesis, I postulate that the conditions that allow these fusions to form are threefold: (1) sequence homology on non-homologous chromosomes, often in the form of repetitive DNA; (2) recombination initiation during meiosis; and (3) physical proximity of the homologous sequences in three-dimensional space. This Hypothesis highlights the latest progress in understanding human Robertsonian translocations within the context of the broader literature on Robertsonian chromosomes.© 2024.

However, the scientific evidence is not yet sufficient. Here, we review the physiological functions of vitamin C and its relationship with various pathological conditions, including our previous findings, and discuss the prospects of its application in healthy longevity. In summary, vitamin C levels are associated with lifespan in several animal models. Furthermore, clinical studies have shown that the blood vitamin C levels are lower in middle-aged and older adults than in younger adults. Lower blood vitamin C levels have also been observed in various pathological conditions such as chronic kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the elderly. These observations suggest the implications of vitamin C in age-related pathological mechanisms owing to its physiological functions.© 2024. The Author(s).",2.869316879458975e-21

Here, we provide an integrated experimental and computational pipeline that improves estimation of variant effects in base editing screens. We use a reporter construct to measure guide RNA (gRNA) editing outcomes alongside their phenotypic consequences and introduce base editor screen analysis with activity normalization (BEAN), a Bayesian network that uses per-guide editing outcomes provided by the reporter and target site chromatin accessibility to estimate variant impacts. BEAN outperforms existing tools in variant effect quantification. We use BEAN to pinpoint common regulatory variants that alter low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake, implicating previously unreported genes. Additionally, through saturation base editing of LDLR, we accurately quantify missense variant pathogenicity that is consistent with measurements in UK Biobank patients and identify underlying structural mechanisms. This work provides a widely applicable approach to improve the power of base editing screens for disease-associated variant characterization.© 2024.

38589619,MEF2C regulates NK cell effector functions through control of lipid metabolism.,Nat Immunol,"Natural killer (NK) cells are a critical first line of defense against viral infection. Rare mutations in a small subset of transcription factors can result in decreased NK cell numbers and function in humans, with an associated increased susceptibility to viral infection. However, our understanding of the specific transcription factors governing mature human NK cell function is limited. Here we use a non-viral CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen targeting genes encoding 31 transcription factors differentially expressed during human NK cell development. We identify myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) as a master regulator of human NK cell functionality ex vivo. MEF2C-haploinsufficient patients and mice displayed defects in NK cell development and effector function, with an increased susceptibility to viral infection. Mechanistically, MEF2C was required for an interleukin (IL)-2- and IL-15-mediated increase in lipid content through regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathways. Supplementation with oleic acid restored MEF2C-deficient and MEF2C-haploinsufficient patient NK cell cytotoxic function. Therefore, MEF2C is a critical orchestrator of NK cell antiviral immunity by regulating SREBP-mediated lipid metabolism.© 2024.

38693267,Airway hillocks are injury-resistant reservoirs of unique plastic stem cells.,Nature,"Airway hillocks are stratified epithelial structures of unknown function1. Hillocks persist for months and have a unique population of basal stem cells that express genes associated with barrier function and cell adhesion. Hillock basal stem cells continually replenish overlying squamous barrier cells. They exhibit dramatically higher turnover than the abundant, largely quiescent classic pseudostratified airway epithelium. Hillocks resist a remarkably broad spectrum of injuries, including toxins, infection, acid and physical injury because hillock squamous cells shield underlying hillock basal stem cells from injury. Hillock basal stem cells are capable of massive clonal expansion that is sufficient to resurface denuded airway, and eventually regenerate normal airway epithelium with each of its six component cell types. Hillock basal stem cells preferentially stratify and keratinize in the setting of retinoic acid signalling inhibition, a known cause of squamous metaplasia2,3. Here we show that mouse hillock expansion is the cause of vitamin A deficiency-induced squamous metaplasia. Finally, we identify human hillocks whose basal stem cells generate functional squamous barrier structures in culture. The existence of hillocks reframes our understanding of airway epithelial regeneration. Furthermore, we show that hillocks are one origin of 'squamous metaplasia', which is long thought to be a precursor of lung cancer.© 2024.

38672772,Machine Learning Reveals Impacts of Smoking on Gene Profiles of Different Cell Types in Lung.,Life (Basel),"Smoking significantly elevates the risk of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. This risk is attributed to the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke that damage lung tissue and impair lung function. Current research on the impact of smoking on gene expression in specific lung cells is limited. This study addresses this gap by analyzing gene expression profiles at the single-cell level from 43,539 lung endothelial cells, 234,349 lung epithelial cells, 189,843 lung immune cells, and 16,031 lung stromal cells using advanced machine learning techniques. The data, categorized by different lung cell types, were classified into three smoking states: active smoker, former smoker, and never smoker. Each cell sample encompassed 28,024 feature genes. Employing an incremental feature selection method within a computational framework, several specific genes have been identified as potential markers of smoking status in different lung cell types. These includeB2M,EEF1A1, andTPT1in lung endothelial cells;FTLandMT-ATP8in lung epithelial cells;HLA-BandHLA-Cin lung immune cells; andHSP90B1andLCN2in lung stroma cells.

The large family of coronaviruses, however, also includes members that cause only mild symptoms, like human coronavirus-229E (HCoV-229E) or OC43 (HCoV-OC43). Unravelling how molecular (and cellular) pathophysiology differs between highly and low pathogenic coronaviruses is important for the development of therapeutic strategies.Here, we analysed the transcriptome of primary human bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC), differentiated at the air-liquid interface (ALI) after infection with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV and HCoV-229E using bulk RNA sequencing.ALI-PBEC were efficiently infected by all viruses, and SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E infection resulted in a largely similar transcriptional response. The response to SARS-CoV-2 infection differed markedly as it uniquely lacked the increase in expression of immediate early genes, includingFOS,FOSBandNR4A1that was observed with all other coronaviruses. This finding was further confirmed in publicly available experimental and clinical datasets. Interfering with NR4A1 signalling in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells resulted in a 100-fold reduction in extracellular RNA copies of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, suggesting an involvement in virus replication. Furthermore, a lack in induction of interferon-related gene expression characterised the main difference between the highly pathogenic coronaviruses and low pathogenic viruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.Our results demonstrate a previously unknown suppression of a host response gene set by SARS-CoV-2 and confirm a difference in interferon-related gene expression between highly pathogenic and low pathogenic coronaviruses.© 2024 The Authors.

We utilized mouse models of airway-specific epithelial injury to examine secondary tissue-wide alveolar, immune, and mesenchymal responses. Single-cell transcriptomics andin vivovalidation revealed transient, tissue-wide proliferation of alveolar type 2 (AT2) progenitor cells after club cell-specific ablation. The AT2 cell proliferative response was reliant on alveolar macrophages (AMs) via upregulation ofSpp1which encodes the secreted factor Osteopontin. A previously uncharacterized mesenchymal population we termed Mesenchymal Airway/Adventitial Niche Cell 2 (MANC2) also exhibited dynamic changes in abundance and a pro-fibrotic transcriptional signature after club cell ablation in an AM-dependent manner.

Although phenotypically similar, these subpopulations are functionally distinct, maintaining tissue integrity and serving as local progenitor reservoirs. In response to tissue injury, these cells undergo a dynamic fibroblast-myofibroblast transition, marked by extracellular matrix secretion and contraction of actomyosin-based stress fibres. Importantly, whereas transient activation into myofibroblasts aids in tissue repair, persistent activation triggers pathological fibrosis. In this Review, we discuss the roles of mechanical cues, such as tissue stiffness and strain, alongside cell signalling pathways and extracellular matrix ligands in modulating myofibroblast activation and survival. We also highlight the role of epigenetic modifications and myofibroblast memory in physiological and pathological processes. Finally, we discuss potential strategies for therapeutically interfering with these factors and the associated signal transduction pathways to improve the outcome of dysregulated healing.© 2024.

However, dysregulated epithelial responses can contribute to disease states. Here, we demonstrated that epithelial cell-intrinsic production of interleukin-23 (IL-23) triggers an inflammatory loop in the prevalent oral disease periodontitis. Epithelial IL-23 expression localized to areas proximal to the disease-associated microbiome and was evident in experimental models and patients with common and genetic forms of disease. Mechanistically, flagellated microbial species of the periodontitis microbiome triggered epithelial IL-23 induction in a TLR5 receptor-dependent manner. Therefore, unlike other Th17-driven diseases, non-hematopoietic-cell-derived IL-23 served as an initiator of pathogenic inflammation in periodontitis. Beyond periodontitis, analysis of publicly available datasets revealed the expression of epithelial IL-23 in settings of infection, malignancy, and autoimmunity, suggesting a broader role for epithelial-intrinsic IL-23 in human disease. Collectively, this work highlights an important role for the barrier epithelium in the induction of IL-23-mediated inflammation.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

More importantly, the ADT can easily lead to resistance by involving the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway and high infiltration of M2 macrophages in tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, we developed a biomimetic nanotherapeutic platform by deriving cell membrane nanovesicles from cancer cells and probiotics to yield the hybrid cellular nanovesicles (hNVs), loading flutamide (Flu) into the resulting hNVs, and finally modifying the hNVs@Flu with Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). In this nanotherapeutic platform, the hNVs significantly improved the accumulation of hNVs@Flu-EGCG in tumor sites and reprogramed immunosuppressive M2 macrophages into antitumorigenic M1 macrophages, the Flu acted on androgen receptors and inhibited tumor proliferation, and the EGCG promoted apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, thus synergistically stimulating the antitumor immunity and reducing the side effects and resistance of ADT. In a prostate cancer mouse model, the hNVs@Flu-EGCG significantly extended the lifespan of mice with tumors and led to an 81.78% reduction in tumor growth compared with the untreated group. Overall, the hNVs@Flu-EGCG are safe, modifiable, and effective, thus offering a promising platform for effective therapeutics of prostate cancer.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.3762219500498852e-55

It exerts a significant influence on regulating internal cellular states such as gene expression and cell functionality. Currently, the mainstream methods for studying intercellular communication are focused on exploring the ligand-receptor-transcription factor and ligand-receptor-subunit scales. However, there is relatively limited research on the association between intercellular communication and highly variable genes (HVGs). As some HVGs are closely related to cell communication, accurately identifying these HVGs can enhance the accuracy of constructing cell communication networks. The rapid development of single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics technologies provides a data foundation for exploring the relationship between intercellular communication and HVGs. Therefore, we propose CPPLS-MLP, which can identify HVGs closely related to intercellular communication and further analyze the impact of Multiple Input Multiple Output cellular communication on the differential expression of these HVGs. By comparing with the commonly used method CCPLS for constructing intercellular communication networks, we validated the superior performance of our method in identifying cell-type-specific HVGs and effectively analyzing the influence of neighboring cell types on HVG expression regulation.

Understanding the genetic and molecular factors influencing ALS survival is crucial for disease management and therapeutics. In this study, we introduce a deep learning-powered genetic analysis framework to link rare noncoding genetic variants to ALS survival. Using data from human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MNs, this method prioritizes functional noncoding variants using deep learning, links cis-regulatory elements (CREs) to target genes using epigenomics data, and integrates these data through gene-level burden tests to identify survival-modifying variants, CREs, and genes. We apply this approach to analyze 6,715 ALS genomes, and pinpoint four novel rare noncoding variants associated with survival, including chr7:76,009,472:C>T linked toCCDC146. CRISPR-Cas9 editing of this variant increasesCCDC146expression in iPSC-derived MNs and exacerbates ALS-specific phenotypes, including TDP-43 mislocalization. SuppressingCCDC146with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), showing no toxicity, completely rescues ALS-associated survival defects in neurons derived from sporadic ALS patients and from carriers of the ALS-associated G4C2-repeat expansion withinC9ORF72.ASO targeting ofCCDC146may be a broadly effective therapeutic approach for ALS.

Fluorophore-conjugated sugar derivatives are widely used for monitoring glucose transporter (GLUT) activity at the single-cell level, but have limitations in in vivo applications. Here, we develop a click chemistry-based post-labeling method for flow cytometric measurement of glucose uptake with low background adsorption. This strategy relies on GLUT-mediated uptake of azide-tagged sugars, and subsequent intracellular labeling with a cell-permeable fluorescent reagent via a copper-free click reaction. Screening a library of azide-substituted monosaccharides, we discover 6-azido-6-deoxy-D-galactose (6AzGal) as a suitable substrate of GLUTs. 6AzGal displays glucose-like physicochemical properties and reproduces in vivo dynamics similar to18F-FDG. Combining this method with multi-parametric immunophenotyping, we demonstrate the ability to precisely resolve metabolically-activated cells with various GLUT activities in ex vivo and in vivo models.

Loss of TGFβ signaling impairs DNA repair competency, which is described by a transcriptomic score, βAlt. Cancers with high βAlt have more genomic damage and are more responsive to genotoxic therapy. The growing appreciation that cancer DNA repair deficits are important determinants of immune response prompted us to investigate βAlt's association with response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). We predicted that high βAlt tumors would be infiltrated with lymphocytes because of DNA damage burden and hence responsive to ICB.We analyzed public transcriptomic data from clinical trials and preclinical models using transcriptomic signatures of TGFβ targets, DNA repair genes, tumor educated immune cells and interferon. A high βAlt, immune poor mammary tumor derived transplant model resistant to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies was studied using multispectral flow cytometry to interrogate the immune system.Metastatic bladder patients in IMvigor 210 who responded to ICB had significantly increased βAlt scores and experienced significantly longer overall survival compared to those with low βAlt scores (hazard ratio 0.62,P=0.011). Unexpectedly, 75% of high βAlt cancers were immune poor as defined by low expression of tumor educated immune cell and interferon signatures. The association of high βAlt with immune poor cancer was also evident in TCGA and preclinical cancer models. We used a high βAlt, immune poor cancer to test therapeutic strategies to overcome its inherent anti-PD-L1 resistance. Combination treatment with radiation and TGFβ inhibition were necessary for lymphocytic infiltration and activated NK cells were required for ICB response. Bioinformatic analysis identified high βAlt, immune poor B16 and CT26 preclinical models and paired biopsies of cancer patients that also demonstrated NK cell activation upon response to ICB.Our studies confirm βAlt as a biomarker that predicts response to ICB in immune poor cancers., which has implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to increase the number of cancer patients who will benefit from immunotherapy.",1.592271832716887e-79

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enable the serial collection of living tumor cells. Pre-treatment and serial CTC gene expression changes and tumor histology were evaluated to identify predictors of response to Atezo/Bev. Peripheral blood from 22 patients with HCC treated with Atezo/Bev and 24 patients treated with lenvatinib was serially collected. The RNA expression in CTCs was analyzed using qRT-PCR. Higher PD-L1 expression in pre-treatment CTCs was associated with response and improved prognosis with Atezo/Bev treatment, but not with lenvatinib. There was no correlation between PD-L1 expression in CTCs and that in liver tumor biopsy specimens scored using imaging software. Furthermore, PD-L1 RNA expression in CTCs was dynamically altered by Atezo/Bev, decreasing during effective response and increasing upon progression. CTC-derived RNA collected during Atezo/Bev indicates that patients with higher PD-L1 expression in CTCs at baseline were 3.9 times more responsive to treatment. Therefore, PD-L1 RNA levels in CTCs are an accurate response predictor and may be a monitorable biomarker that changes dynamically to reflect the response during Atezo/Bev treatment.",1.8215181505454864e-48

Patients were excluded in the analysis if they had a history of malignant tumors, incomplete follow-up information.536 metastatic breast cancer patients who had been detected for CTC at least once by CellSearch or CellCollector were included in the analysis. CellCollectorin vivoCTC detection technology has a higher detection rate than the CellSearch system (69.2% vs 57.4%, P = 0.009). However, the proportion of CTC≥5 detected by CellSearch was higher than CellCollector (37.4% vs 16.3%, P < 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in overall survival of patients with CTC negative and CTC positive (mOS:49.8 months vs 26.9 months).

38617733,"Liquid biopsy for gastric cancer: Techniques, applications, and future directions.",World J Gastroenterol,"After the study of circulating tumor cells in blood through liquid biopsy (LB), this technique has evolved to encompass the analysis of multiple materials originating from the tumor, such as nucleic acids, extracellular vesicles, tumor-educated platelets, and other metabolites. Additionally, research has extended to include the examination of samples other than blood or plasma, such as saliva, gastric juice, urine, or stool. LB techniques are diverse, intricate, and variable. They must be highly sensitive, and pre-analytical, patient, and tumor-related factors significantly influence the detection threshold, diagnostic method selection, and potential results. Consequently, the implementation of LB in clinical practice still faces several challenges. The potential applications of LB range from early cancer detection to guiding targeted therapy or immunotherapy in both early and advanced cancer cases, monitoring treatment response, early identification of relapses, or assessing patient risk. On the other hand, gastric cancer (GC) is a disease often diagnosed at advanced stages. Despite recent advances in molecular understanding, the currently available treatment options have not substantially improved the prognosis for many of these patients. The application of LB in GC could be highly valuable as a non-invasive method for early diagnosis and for enhancing the management and outcomes of these patients. In this comprehensive review, from a pathologist's perspective, we provide an overview of the main options available in LB, delve into the fundamental principles of the most studied techniques, explore the potential utility of LB application in the context of GC, and address the obstacles that need to be overcome in the future to make this innovative technique a game-changer in cancer diagnosis and treatment within clinical practice.©The Author(s) 2024.

38596285,TROP2 is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer CTCs and is a potential marker for epithelial mesenchymal CTCs.,Mol Ther Oncol,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are the seeds of distant metastases of malignant tumors and are associated with malignancy and risk of metastasis. However, tumor cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during metastasis, leading to the emergence of different types of CTCs. Real-time dynamic molecular and functional typing of CTCs is necessary to precisely guide personalized treatment. Most CTC detection systems are based on epithelial markers that may fail to detect EMT CTCs. Therefore, it is clinically important to identify new markers of different CTC types. In this study, bioinformatics analysis and experimental assays showed that trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2), a target molecule for advanced palliative treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), was highly expressed in TNBC tissues and tumor cells. Furthermore, TROP2 can promote the migration and invasion of TNBC cells by upregulating EMT markers. The specificity and potential of TROP2 as an EMT-associated marker of TNBC CTCs were evaluated by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, spiking experiments, and a well-established CTC assay. The results indicated that TROP2 is a potential novel CTC marker associated with EMT, providing a basis for more efficacious markers that encompass CTC heterogeneity in patients with TNBC.© 2024 The Authors.",1.150544039203283e-58
38570556,Orthotopic model for the analysis of melanoma circulating tumor cells.,Sci Rep,"Metastatic melanoma, a highly lethal form of skin cancer, presents significant clinical challenges due to limited therapeutic options and high metastatic capacity. Recent studies have demonstrated that cancer dissemination can occur earlier, before the diagnosis of the primary tumor. The progress in understanding the kinetics of cancer dissemination is limited by the lack of animal models that accurately mimic disease progression. We have established a xenograft model of human melanoma that spontaneously metastasizes to lymph nodes and lungs. This model allows precise monitoring of melanoma progression and is suitable for the quantitative and qualitative analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). We have validated a flow cytometry-based protocol for CTCs enumeration and isolation. We could demonstrate that (i) CTCs were detectable in the bloodstream from the fourth week after tumor initiation, coinciding with the lymph node metastases appearance, (ii) excision of the primary tumor accelerated the formation of metastases in lymph nodes and lungs as early as one-week post-surgery, accompanied by the increased numbers of CTCs, and (iii) CTCs change their surface protein signature. In summary, we present a model of human melanoma that can be effectively utilized for future drug efficacy studies.© 2024. The Author(s).",3.437878423708117e-49

Innovative approaches such as StainedGlass have improved upon this classic visualization by rendering dot plots as a heatmap of sequence identity, enabling researchers to better visualize multi-megabase tandem repeat arrays within centromeres and other heterochromatic regions of the genome. However, computing the similarity estimates for heatmaps requires high computational overhead and can suffer from decreasing accuracy.In this work we introduce ModDotPlot, an interactive and alignment-free dot plot viewer. By approximating average nucleotide identity via ak-mer-based containment index, ModDotPlot produces accurate plots orders of magnitude faster than StainedGlass. We accomplish this through the use of a hierarchical modimizer scheme that can visualize the full 128 Mbp genome ofArabidopsis thalianain under 5 minutes on a laptop.

38704605,ESKEMAP: exact sketch-based read mapping.,Algorithms Mol Biol,"Given a sequencing read, the broad goal of read mapping is to find the location(s) in the reference genome that have a ""similar sequence"". Traditionally, ""similar sequence"" was defined as having a high alignment score and read mappers were viewed as heuristic solutions to this well-defined problem. For sketch-based mappers, however, there has not been a problem formulation to capture what problem an exact sketch-based mapping algorithm should solve. Moreover, there is no sketch-based method that can find all possible mapping positions for a read above a certain score threshold.In this paper, we formulate the problem of read mapping at the level of sequence sketches. We give an exact dynamic programming algorithm that finds all hits above a given similarity threshold. It runs inO(|t|+|p|+ℓ2)time andO(ℓlogℓ)space, where |t| is the number ofk-mers inside the sketch of the reference, |p| is the number ofk-mers inside the read's sketch andℓis the number of times thatk-mers from the pattern sketch occur in the sketch of the text. We evaluate our algorithm's performance in mapping long reads to the T2T assembly of human chromosome Y, where ampliconic regions make it desirable to find all good mapping positions. For an equivalent level of precision as minimap2, the recall of our algorithm is 0.88, compared to only 0.76 of minimap2.© 2024. The Author(s).",8.386011754910753e-14

38579261,Designing efficient randstrobes for sequence similarity analyses.,Bioinformatics,"Substrings of length k, commonly referred to as k-mers, play a vital role in sequence analysis. However, k-mers are limited to exact matches between sequences leading to alternative constructs. We recently introduced a class of new constructs, strobemers, that can match across substitutions and smaller insertions and deletions. Randstrobes, the most sensitive strobemer proposed in Sahlin (Effective sequence similarity detection with strobemers. Genome Res 2021a;31:2080-94. https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.275648.121), has been used in several bioinformatics applications such as read classification, short-read mapping, and read overlap detection. Recently, we showed that the more pseudo-random the behavior of the construction (measured in entropy), the more efficient the seeds for sequence similarity analysis. The level of pseudo-randomness depends on the construction operators, but no study has investigated the efficacy.In this study, we introduce novel construction methods, including a Binary Search Tree-based approach that improves time complexity over previous methods. To our knowledge, we are also the first to address biases in construction and design three metrics for measuring bias. Our evaluation shows that our methods have favorable speed and sampling uniformity compared to existing approaches. Lastly, guided by our results, we change the seed construction in strobealign, a short-read mapper, and find that the results change substantially. We suggest combining the two results to improve strobealign's accuracy for the shortest reads in our evaluated datasets. Our evaluation highlights sampling biases that can occur and provides guidance on which operators to use when implementing randstrobes.All methods and evaluation benchmarks are available in a public Github repository at https://github.com/Moein-Karami/RandStrobes.

38517696,pathMap: a path-based mapping tool for long noisy reads with high sensitivity.,Brief Bioinform,"With the rapid development of single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technologies, the output read length is continuously increasing. Mapping such reads onto a reference genome is one of the most fundamental tasks in sequence analysis. Mapping sensitivity is becoming a major concern since high sensitivity can detect more aligned regions on the reference and obtain more aligned bases, which are useful for downstream analysis. In this study, we present pathMap, a novel k-mer graph-based mapper that is specifically designed for mapping SMS reads with high sensitivity. By viewing the alignment chain as a path containing as many anchors as possible in the matched k-mer graph, pathMap treats chaining as a path selection problem in the directed graph. pathMap iteratively searches the longest path in the remaining nodes; more candidate chains with high quality can be effectively detected and aligned. Compared to other state-of-the-art mapping methods such as minimap2 and Winnowmap2, experiment results on simulated and real-life datasets demonstrate that pathMap obtains the number of mapped chains at least 11.50% more than its closest competitor and increases the mapping sensitivity by 17.28% and 13.84% of bases over the next-best mapper for Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore sequencing data, respectively. In addition, pathMap is more robust to sequence errors and more sensitive to species- and strain-specific identification of pathogens using MinION reads.© The Author(s) 2024.

Compared to people without disabilities, people with disabilities in Korea have a lower cancer incidence rate but a fivefold higher cancer mortality rate, implying delayed detection.We used an administrative database combining disability status and care utilization to analyze every case of cancer-related genetic testing paid for by the National Health Insurance Services of Korea between 2016 and 2019. We first compared percentages of individuals who had taken a registered genetic test by their disability statuses. We then compared the most frequently utilized tests between individuals with and without disabilities.Korean citizens, 175,000 in total, underwent at least one of the 192 registered cancer-related genetic tests between 2016 and 2019. People with disabilities utilized these genetic tests at higher rates than those without disabilities, regardless of sex or age. Among people aged ≥40 years, lung and colorectal cancer-related tests were most frequently utilized, regardless of disability status.Although the cancer-related genetic test uptake rate is higher among people with disabilities than among those without disabilities, it is still possible that information on these tests is not as readily available to people with disabilities. Therefore, it is imperative for the government to actively devise strategies to enhance national cancer screening rates among people with disabilities.© 2024 The Authors.

However, crucial subtypes of the β-adrenergic receptor (AR), as well as effects of its genetic variants on functions of BAT, remains unclear in humans. We conducted association analyses of genes encoding β-ARs and BAT activity in human adults.Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in β1-, β2-, and β3-AR genes (ADRB1, ADRB2, and ADRB3) were tested for the association with BAT activity under mild cold exposure (19 °C, 2 h) in 399 healthy Japanese adults. BAT activity was measured using fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography and computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). To validate the results, we assessed the effects of SNPs in the two independent populations comprising 277 healthy East Asian adults using near-infrared time-resolved spectroscopy (NIRTRS) or infrared thermography (IRT). Effects of SNPs on physiological responses to intensive cold exposure were tested in 42 healthy Japanese adult males using an artificial climate chamber.We found a significant association between a functional SNP (rs1042718) in ADRB2 and BAT activity assessed with FDG-PET/CT (p < 0.001). This SNP also showed an association with cold-induced thermogenesis in the population subset. Furthermore, the association was replicated in the two other independent populations; BAT activity was evaluated by NIRTRSor IRT (p < 0.05). This SNP did not show associations with oxygen consumption and cold-induced thermogenesis under intensive cold exposure, suggesting the irrelevance of shivering thermogenesis. The SNPs of ADRB1 and ADRB3 were not associated with these BAT-related traits.The present study supports the importance of β2-AR in the sympathetic regulation of BAT thermogenesis in humans.

38585839,Androgen loss weakens anti-tumor immunity and accelerates brain tumor growth.,Res Sq,"Many cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM), have a male-biased sex difference in incidence and outcome. The underlying reasons for this sex bias are unclear but likely involve differences in tumor cell state and immune response. This effect is further amplified by sex hormones, including androgens, which have been shown to inhibit anti-tumor T cell immunity. Here, we show that androgens drive anti-tumor immunity in brain tumors, in contrast to its effect in other tumor types. Upon castration, tumor growth was accelerated with attenuated T cell function in GBM and brain tumor models, but the opposite was observed when tumors were located outside the brain. Activity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) axis was increased in castrated mice, particularly in those with brain tumors. Blockade of glucocorticoid receptors reversed the accelerated tumor growth in castrated mice, indicating that the effect of castration was mediated by elevated glucocorticoid signaling. Furthermore, this mechanism was not GBM specific, but brain specific, as hyperactivation of the HPA axis was observed with intracranial implantation of non-GBM tumors in the brain. Together, our findings establish that brain tumors drive distinct endocrine-mediated mechanisms in the androgen-deprived setting and highlight the importance of organ-specific effects on anti-tumor immunity.",1.5149358346170224e-50

Although dysregulated in acute and chronic conditions, the tissue is often overlooked immunologically.To address this issue, we applied single-cell transcriptomic-V(D)J sequencing to FACS-isolated CD45+caecal patch/lamina propria leukocytes from a healthy (5-year-old) female rhesus macaqueex vivoand coupled these data to VDJ deep sequencing reads from haematopoietic tissues.We found caecal NK cells and ILC3s to co-exist with a spectrum of effector T cells partially derived fromSOX4+recent thymic emigrants. Tolerogenic Vγ8Vδ1-T cells, plastic CD4+T helper cells andGZMK+EOMES+andTMIGD2+tissue-resident memory CD8+T cells were present and differed metabolically. AnIL13+GATA3+Th2subset expressing eicosanoid pathway enzymes was accompanied byIL1RL1+GATA3+regulatory T cells and a minor proportion of IgE+plasma cells (PCs), illustrating tightly regulated type 2 immunity devoid of ILC2s. In terms of B lymphocyte lineages, caecal patch antigen-presenting memory B cells sat alongside germinal centre cells undergoing somatic hypermutation and differentiation intoIGF1+PCs. Prototypic gene expression signatures decreased across PC clusters, and notably, expanded IgA clonotypes could be traced in VDJ deep sequencing reads from additional compartments, including the bone marrow, supporting that these cells contribute a steady stream of systemic antibodies.The data advance our understanding of caecal immunological function, revealing processes involved in barrier maintenance and molecular networks relevant to disease.© 2024 The Authors.

38653236,Integrative spatial analysis reveals a multi-layered organization of glioblastoma.,Cell,"Glioma contains malignant cells in diverse states. Here, we combine spatial transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and computational approaches to define glioma cellular states and uncover their organization. We find three prominent modes of organization. First, gliomas are composed of small local environments, each typically enriched with one major cellular state. Second, specific pairs of states preferentially reside in proximity across multiple scales. This pairing of states is consistent across tumors. Third, these pairwise interactions collectively define a global architecture composed of five layers. Hypoxia appears to drive the layers, as it is associated with a long-range organization that includes all cancer cell states. Accordingly, tumor regions distant from any hypoxic/necrotic foci and tumors that lack hypoxia such as low-grade IDH-mutant glioma are less organized. In summary, we provide a conceptual framework for the organization of cellular states in glioma, highlighting hypoxia as a long-range tissue organizer.Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

38636457,Integrating multiplexed imaging and multiscale modeling identifies tumor phenotype conversion as a critical component of therapeutic T cell efficacy.,Cell Syst,"Cancer progression is a complex process involving interactions that unfold across molecular, cellular, and tissue scales. These multiscale interactions have been difficult to measure and to simulate. Here, we integrated CODEX multiplexed tissue imaging with multiscale modeling software to model key action points that influence the outcome of T cell therapies with cancer. The initial phenotype of therapeutic T cells influences the ability of T cells to convert tumor cells to an inflammatory, anti-proliferative phenotype. This T cell phenotype could be preserved by structural reprogramming to facilitate continual tumor phenotype conversion and killing. One takeaway is that controlling the rate of cancer phenotype conversion is critical for control of tumor growth. The results suggest new design criteria and patient selection metrics for T cell therapies, call for a rethinking of T cell therapeutic implementation, and provide a foundation for synergistically integrating multiplexed imaging data with multiscale modeling of the cancer-immune interface.

38585842,Functional Diversity of Memory CD8 T Cells is Spatiotemporally Imprinted.,bioRxiv,"Tissue-resident memory CD8 T cells (TRM) kill infected cells and recruit additional immune cells to limit pathogen invasion at barrier sites. Small intestinal (SI) TRMcells consist of distinct subpopulations with higher expression of effector molecules or greater memory potential. We hypothesized that occupancy of diverse anatomical niches imprints these distinct TRMtranscriptional programs. We leveraged human samples and a murine model of acute systemic viral infection to profile the location and transcriptome of pathogen-specific TRMcell differentiation at single-transcript resolution. We developed computational approaches to capture cellular locations along three anatomical axes of the small intestine and to visualize the spatiotemporal distribution of cell types and gene expression. TRMpopulations were spatially segregated: with more effector- and memory-like TRMpreferentially localized at the villus tip or crypt, respectively. Modeling ligand-receptor activity revealed patterns of key cellular interactions and cytokine signaling pathways that initiate and maintain TRMdifferentiation and functional diversity, including different TGFβ sources. Alterations in the cellular networks induced by loss of TGFβRII expression revealed a model consistent with TGFβ promoting progressive TRMmaturation towards the villus tip. Ultimately, we have developed a framework for the study of immune cell interactions with the spectrum of tissue cell types, revealing that T cell location and functional state are fundamentally intertwined.",3.045305800993248e-37
38512940,Accessible luminal interface of bovine rectal organoids generated from cryopreserved biopsy tissues.,PLoS One,"Developing precise species-specific in vitro models that closely resemble in vivo intestinal tissues is essential for advancing our understanding of gastrointestinal physiology and associated diseases. This is especially crucial in examining host-pathogen interactions, particularly in bovines, a known reservoir for microbes and pathogens posing substantial public health threats. This research investigated the viability of producing bovine rectal organoids from cryopreserved tissues. We compared two cryopreservation methods with a traditional technique using fresh tissues, evaluating their effectiveness through growth rates, long-term viability, and comprehensive structural, cellular, and genetic analyses. These assessments utilized phase-contrast imaging, immunofluorescence imaging, and RT-qPCR assays. Additionally, the study developed a sophisticated method for forming a functional epithelial barrier from organoid-derived bovine rectal monolayers, incorporating a wide range of epithelial cells. This methodology employed transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (Papp), confocal microscopy, and advanced imaging techniques like scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Our findings decisively show that bovine rectal organoids can be effectively generated from cryopreserved biopsy tissues. Moreover, we formulated a robust and optimized protocol for creating functional rectal monolayers from these organoids. This significant progress is particularly relevant given the susceptibility of the bovine rectum to various enteric pathogens of public health concern, marking a vital step forward in veterinary and biomedical research. The creation of accurate species specific in vitro models that faithfully mimic in vivo intestinal tissues is critical for enhancing our understanding of gut physiology and related pathologies. This is particularly relevant in studying the interactions between hosts and microbes or pathogens with significant public health risks where bovine can be the major reservoir.Copyright: © 2024 Kawasaki, Ambrosini.

Our ability to study these events on the systems level is significantly limited byin situapproaches capable of generating simultaneous insights from both host and microbial communities. Here, we introduce Microbiome Cartography (MicroCart), a framework for simultaneousin situprobing of host features and its microbiome across multiple spatial modalities. We demonstrate MicroCart by comprehensively investigating the alterations in both gut host and microbiome components in a murine model of colitis by coupling MicroCart with spatial proteomics, transcriptomics, and glycomics platforms. Our findings reveal a global but systematic transformation in tissue immune responses, encompassing tissue-level remodeling in response to host immune and epithelial cell state perturbations, and bacterial population shifts, localized inflammatory responses, and metabolic process alterations during colitis. MicroCart enables a deep investigation of the intricate interplay between the host tissue and its microbiome with spatial multiomics.",1.0122319887674074e-36
38684868,Targeted protein degradation: from mechanisms to clinic.,Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol,"Targeted protein degradation refers to the use of small molecules to induce the selective degradation of proteins. In its most common form, this degradation is achieved through ligand-mediated neo-interactions between ubiquitin E3 ligases - the principal waste disposal machines of a cell - and the protein targets of interest, resulting in ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Notable advances have been made in biological and mechanistic understanding of serendipitously discovered degraders. This improved understanding and novel chemistry has not only provided clinical proof of concept for targeted protein degradation but has also led to rapid growth of the field, with dozens of investigational drugs in active clinical trials. Two distinct classes of protein degradation therapeutics are being widely explored: bifunctional PROTACs and molecular glue degraders, both of which have their unique advantages and challenges. Here, we review the current landscape of targeted protein degradation approaches and how they have parallels in biological processes. We also outline the ongoing clinical exploration of novel degraders and provide some perspectives on the directions the field might take.© 2024. Springer Nature Limited.",7.388099049387823e-36

All of the preparedp-fluorocinnamide derivatives were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against the HepG2 liver cancerous cell line. The imidazolone derivative6, which bearsN-(N-pyrimidin-2-ylbenzenesulphamoyl) moiety, displayed antiproliferative activity against HepG2 liver cancerous cells with an IC50value of 4.23 μM as compared to staurosporin (STU) (IC50= 5.59 μM). In addition, compound6experienced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitory activity comparable to palatinib. The cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry indicated that compound6arrested the cellular cycle of HepG2 cells at the G1 phase. Additionally, as demonstrated by the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) technique, compound6increased both early and late apoptotic ratios compared to control untreated HepG2 cells. Moreover, imidazolone compound6induced apoptosis via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by decreasing the level of mitochondrial membrane polarization (MMP) compared to untreated HepG2 cells. Therefore, the newN-(N-pyrimidin-2-ylbenzenesulphamoyl)imidazolone derivative6could be considered a potential platform for further optimizing an antitumor agent against hepatocellular carcinoma.© 2024 The Authors.

38649912,Investigating potential biomarkers of acute pancreatitis in patients with a BMI>30 using Mendelian randomization and transcriptomic analysis.,Lipids Health Dis,"Acute pancreatitis (AP) has become a significant global health concern, and a high body mass index (BMI) has been identified as a key risk factor exacerbating this condition. Within this context, lipid metabolism assumes a critical role. The complex relationship between elevated BMI and AP, mediated by lipid metabolism, markedly increases the risk of complications and mortality. This study aimed to accurately define the correlation between BMI and AP, incorporating a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between individuals with high BMI and AP.Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was first applied to determine the causal relationship between BMI and the risk of AP. Subsequently, three microarray datasets were obtained from the GEO database. This was followed by an analysis of differentially expressed genes and the application of weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify key modular genes associated with AP and elevated BMI. Functional enrichment analysis was then performed to shed light on disease pathogenesis. To identify the most informative genes, machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), were employed. Subsequent analysis focused on the colocalization of the Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) data associated with the selected genes and Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data related to the disease. Preliminary verification of gene expression trends was conducted using external GEO datasets. Ultimately, the diagnostic potential of these genes was further confirmed through the development of an AP model in mice with a high BMI.A total of 21 intersecting genes related to BMI>30, AP, and lipid metabolism were identified from the datasets. These genes were primarily enriched in pathways related to cytosolic DNA sensing, cytokine‒cytokine receptor interactions, and various immune and inflammatory responses. Next, three machine learning techniques were utilized to identify HADH as the most prevalent diagnostic gene. Colocalization analysis revealed that HADH significantly influenced the risk factors associated with BMI and AP. Furthermore, the trend in HADH expression within the external validation dataset aligned with the trend in the experimental data, thus providing a preliminary validation of the experimental findings.The changes in its expression were further validated using external datasets and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).This study systematically identified HADH as a potential lipid metabolism-grounded biomarker for AP in patients with a BMI>30.© 2024.

38713383,A comparison between full-length 16S rRNA Oxford nanopore sequencing and Illumina V3-V4 16S rRNA sequencing in head and neck cancer tissues.,Arch Microbiol,"Describing the microbial community within the tumour has been a key aspect in understanding the pathophysiology of the tumour microenvironment. In head and neck cancer (HNC), most studies on tissue samples have only performed 16S rRNA short-read sequencing (SRS) on V3-V5 region. SRS is mostly limited to genus level identification. In this study, we compared full-length 16S rRNA long-read sequencing (FL-ONT) from Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) to V3-V4 Illumina SRS (V3V4-Illumina) in 26 HNC tumour tissues. Further validation was also performed using culture-based methods in 16 bacterial isolates obtained from 4 patients using MALDI-TOF MS. We observed similar alpha diversity indexes between FL-ONT and V3V4-Illumina. However, beta-diversity was significantly different between techniques (PERMANOVA - R2 = 0.131, p < 0.0001). At higher taxonomic levels (Phylum to Family), all metrics were more similar among sequencing techniques, while lower taxonomy displayed more discrepancies. At higher taxonomic levels, correlation in relative abundance from FL-ONT and V3V4-Illumina were higher, while this correlation decreased at lower levels. Finally, FL-ONT was able to identify more isolates at the species level that were identified using MALDI-TOF MS (75% vs. 18.8%). FL-ONT was able to identify lower taxonomic levels at a better resolution as compared to V3V4-Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing.© 2024. The Author(s).",7.870180320776344e-22
38668230,"Hybrid-Capture Target Enrichment in Human Pathogens: Identification, Evolution, Biosurveillance, and Genomic Epidemiology.",Pathogens,"High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has revolutionised the field of pathogen genomics, enabling the direct recovery of pathogen genomes from clinical and environmental samples. However, pathogen nucleic acids are often overwhelmed by those of the host, requiring deep metagenomic sequencing to recover sufficient sequences for downstream analyses (e.g., identification and genome characterisation). To circumvent this, hybrid-capture target enrichment (HC) is able to enrich pathogen nucleic acids across multiple scales of divergences and taxa, depending on the panel used. In this review, we outline the applications of HC in human pathogens-bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses-including identification, genomic epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance genotyping, and evolution. Importantly, we explored the applicability of HC to clinical metagenomics, which ultimately requires more work before it is a reliable and accurate tool for clinical diagnosis. Relatedly, the utility of HC was exemplified by COVID-19, which was used as a case study to illustrate the maturity of HC for recovering pathogen sequences. As we unravel the origins of COVID-19, zoonoses remain more relevant than ever. Therefore, the role of HC in biosurveillance studies is also highlighted in this review, which is critical in preparing us for the next pandemic. We also found that while HC is a popular tool to study viruses, it remains underutilised in parasites and fungi and, to a lesser extent, bacteria. Finally, weevaluated the future of HC with respect to bait design in the eukaryotic groups and the prospect of combining HC with long-read HTS.",1.0153255027702403e-44
38510147,Non-random spatial organization of telomeres varies during the cell cycle and requires LAP2 and BAF.,iScience,"Spatial genome organization within the nucleus influences major biological processes and is impacted by the configuration of linear chromosomes. Here, we applied 3D spatial statistics and modeling on high-resolution telomere and centromere 3D-structured illumination microscopy images in cancer cells. We found a multi-scale organization of telomeres that dynamically evolved from a mixed clustered-and-regular distribution in early G1 to a purely regular distribution as cells progressed through the cell cycle. In parallel, our analysis revealed two pools of peripheral and internal telomeres, the proportions of which were inverted during the cell cycle. We then conducted a targeted screen using MadID to identify the molecular pathways driving or maintaining telomere anchoring to the nuclear envelope observed in early G1. Lamina-associated polypeptide (LAP) proteins were found transiently localized to telomeres in anaphase, a stage where LAP2α initiates the reformation of the nuclear envelope, and impacted telomere redistribution in the next interphase together with their partner barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF).© 2024 The Authors.",5.473797206300528e-22
38735950,Peripheral GFAP and NfL as early biomarkers for dementia: longitudinal insights from the UK Biobank.,BMC Med,"Peripheral glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) are sensitive markers of neuroinflammation and neuronal damage. Previous studies with highly selected participants have shown that peripheral GFAP and NfL levels are elevated in the pre-clinical phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. However, the predictive value of GFAP and NfL for dementia requires more evidence from population-based cohorts.This was a prospective cohort study to evaluate UK Biobank participants enrolled from 2006 to 2010 using plasma GFAP and NfL measurements measured by Olink Target Platform and prospectively followed up for dementia diagnosis. Primary outcome was the risk of clinical diagnosed dementia. Secondary outcomes were cognition. Linear regression was used to assess the associations between peripheral GFAP and NfL with cognition. Cox proportional hazard models with cross-validations were used to estimate associations between elevated GFAP and NfL with risk of dementia. All models were adjusted for covariates.A subsample of 48,542 participants in the UK Biobank with peripheral GFAP and NfL measurements were evaluated. With an average follow-up of 13.18 ± 2.42 years, 1312 new all-cause dementia cases were identified. Peripheral GFAP and NfL increased up to 15 years before dementia diagnosis was made. After strictly adjusting for confounders, increment in NfL was found to be associated with decreased numeric memory and prolonged reaction time. A greater annualized rate of change in GFAP was significantly associated with faster global cognitive decline. Elevation of GFAP (hazard ratio (HR) ranges from 2.25 to 3.15) and NfL (HR ranges from 1.98 to 4.23) increased the risk for several types of dementia. GFAP and NfL significantly improved the predictive values for dementia using previous models (area under the curve (AUC) ranges from 0.80 to 0.89, C-index ranges from 0.86 to 0.91). The AD genetic risk score and number of APOE*E4 alleles strongly correlated with GFAP and NfL levels.These results suggest that peripheral GFAP and NfL are potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of dementia. In addition, anti-inflammatory therapies in the initial stages of dementia may have potential benefits.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.4432607927377281e-16
38726270,Causal relationship between circulating cytokines and follicular lymphoma: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,Am J Cancer Res,"Follicular lymphoma (FL), derived from germinal centre (GC) B cells, is a kind of systemic neoplasm. Even though FL is indolent, it remains an incurable haematology Neoplasm. Accumulating evidence has suggested that the circulating cytokine is associated with the development of FL, yet the causal relationship between FL and circulating cytokines remains undetermined. Therefore, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to confirm the causal link between FL and levels of circulating cytokines with the use of summary data on circulating cytokines and FL. All these data from genome-wide association study were derived from the Genome-wide pQTL mapping which contains 14,824 individuals. FL data were acquired exclusively from FinnGen, where 218,792 individuals (522 cases vs. 218,270 controls) were involved. Various statistical methods, including the inverse variance weighted method (IVW), weighted median (WME), simple model, weighted model (WM) and MR-Egger, were used to evaluate the potential causal connection between circulating cytokines and FL. Sensitivity analysis, which involves the examination of the heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and leave-one-out method, was also performed to ensure more trustworthy results. A bidirectional MR test was performed to evaluate the direction of causal association between circulating cytokines and FL. Combining all the steps of MR analysis, we revealed four causal cytokines: C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5), interleukin-15 receptor A (IL15RA), interleukin-20 (IL20), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). The risk of FL may be inversely linked to CXCL5 (OR=0.73, CI: 0.545-0.979, P=0.036), IL-15RA (OR=0.669, CI: 0.451-0.993, P=0.046), and IL-20 (OR=0.565, CI: 0.325-0.981, P=0.043) but positively linked to NT-3 (OR=1.872, CI: 1.063-3.297, P=0.03). In addition, in our study, no causal effect of FL on cytokines was demonstrated and no significant heterogeneity and pleiotropy were found. Our research revealed the causal relationship between cytokines and FL, along with both the anti-protective effect of CXCL5, IL-15RA, and IL-20 and the protective effect of neurotrophin-3 on FL. These findings aim to provide new clues regarding the pathogenesis of FL and to extend the potential of circulating cytokines to therapeutic interventions.AJCR Copyright © 2024.",3.184194748211595e-35
38703294,Immune cell signatures and inflammatory mediators: unraveling their genetic impact on chronic kidney disease through Mendelian randomization.,Clin Exp Med,"Prior research has established associations between immune cells, inflammatory proteins, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our Mendelian randomization study aims to elucidate the genetic causal relationships among these factors and CKD. We applied Mendelian randomization using genetic variants associated with CKD from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) and inflammatory markers from a comprehensive GWAS summary. The causal links between exposures (immune cell subtypes and inflammatory proteins) and CKD were primarily analyzed using the inverse variance-weighted, supplemented by sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-PRESSO. Our analysis identified both absolute and relative counts of CD28 + CD45RA + CD8 + T cell (OR = 1.01; 95% CI = 1.01-1.02; p < 0.001, FDR = 0.018) (OR = 1.01; 95% CI = 1.00-1.01; p < 0.001, FDR = 0.002), CD28 on CD39 + CD8 + T cell(OR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.96-0.99; p < 0.001, FDR = 0.006), CD16 on CD14-CD16 + monocyte (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01-1.03; p < 0.001, FDR = 0.004) and cytokines, such as IL-17A(OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06-1.16, p < 0.001, FDR = 0.001), and LIF-R(OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02-1.10, p = 0.005, FDR = 0.043) that are genetically predisposed to influence the risk of CKD. Moreover, the study discovered that CKD itself may causatively lead to alterations in certain proteins, including CST5(OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09-1.24, p < 0.001, FDR = 0.001). No evidence of reverse causality was found for any single biomarker and CKD. This comprehensive MR investigation supports a genetic causal nexus between certain immune cell subtypes, inflammatory proteins, and CKD.

Proteomics and metabolomics have become widely utilized in identifying causes and diagnostic indicators of PLC. Nevertheless, in studies aiming to identify proteins/metabolites that experienced significant changes before PLC, the potential impact of reverse causation and confounding variables still needs to be fully addressed.This study thoroughly investigated the causal relationship between 4719 blood proteins, 21 amino acids, and the risk of PLC using the Mendelian randomization (MR) method. In addition, through a comprehensive analysis of the TCGA-LIHC cohort and GEO databases, we evaluated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to serine metabolism in diagnosing and predicting the prognosis of patients with PLC.A total of 63 proteins have been identified as connected to the risk of PLC. Additionally, there has been confirmation of a positive cause-effect between PLC and the concentration of serine. The integration of findings from both MR analyses determined that the protein associated with PLC risk exhibited a significant correlation with serine metabolism. Upon careful analysis of the TCGA-LIHC cohort, it was found that eight DEGs are linked to serine metabolism. After thoroughly validating the GEO database, two DEGs, TDO2 and MICB, emerged as potential biomarkers for diagnosing PLC.Two proteins involved in serine metabolism, MICB and TDO2, are causally linked to the risk of PLC and could potentially be used as diagnostic indicators.",2.341464418131744e-34

It occurs when bleeding happens in the subarachnoid space, a small gap between the arachnoid and pia mater. This condition results from the rupture of diseased or damaged blood vessels at the brain's base or surface. This study combined various omics approaches with Mendelian randomization analysis, including MR-IVW, MR Egger, MR weight median, and MR weight mode, to generate preliminary results. It also employed reverse Mendelian randomization, treating SAH as the exposure. Finally, a meta-analysis was conducted to summarize these findings. The study found positive correlations between SAH and both GBPA-Pyridoxal 5 phosphate biosynthesis I (OR=1.48, 95% CI, 1.04-2.12) and GBPA-glucose biosynthesis I (OR=0.68, 95% CI, 0.52-0.90). Increased levels of urokinase-type plasma activator were also associated with SAH (OR=1.17, 95% CI, 1.04-1.32). Associations were observed with SAH for CD80 on CD62L+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD80 on plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD123 on CD62L+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and SSC-A on plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This study, through Mendelian randomization and meta-analysis, established links between SAH and four inflammatory cells, one inflammatory protein, and two gut microbiota-related pathways. These findings suggest potential treatment targets for SAH, highlighting the importance of modulating gut microbiota and utilizing anti-inflammatory drugs in its management.© 2024.

38689208,Cis-eQTLs in seven duck tissues identify novel candidate genes for growth and carcass traits.,BMC Genomics,"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies aim to understand the influence of genetic variants on gene expression. The colocalization of eQTL mapping and GWAS strategy could help identify essential candidate genes and causal DNA variants vital to complex traits in human and many farm animals. However, eQTL mapping has not been conducted in ducks. It is desirable to know whether eQTLs within GWAS signals contributed to duck economic traits.In this study, we conducted an eQTL analysis using publicly available RNA sequencing data from 820 samples, focusing on liver, muscle, blood, adipose, ovary, spleen, and lung tissues. We identified 113,374 cis-eQTLs for 12,266 genes, a substantial fraction 39.1% of which were discovered in at least two tissues. The cis-eQTLs of blood were less conserved across tissues, while cis-eQTLs from any tissue exhibit a strong sharing pattern to liver tissue. Colocalization between cis-eQTLs and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 50 traits uncovered new associations between gene expression and potential loci influencing growth and carcass traits. SRSF4, GSS, and IGF2BP1 in liver, NDUFC2 in muscle, ELF3 in adipose, and RUNDC1 in blood could serve as the candidate genes for duck growth and carcass traits.Our findings highlight substantial differences in genetic regulation of gene expression across duck primary tissues, shedding light on potential mechanisms through which candidate genes may impact growth and carcass traits. Furthermore, this availability of eQTL data offers a valuable resource for deciphering further genetic association signals that may arise from ongoing extensive endeavors aimed at enhancing duck production traits.© 2024.

38495690,Next-generation endoscopic probe for detection of esophageal dysplasia using combined OCT and angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry.,Biomed Opt Express,"Angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry (a/LCI) is an optical technique that enables depth-specific measurements of nuclear morphology, with applications to detecting epithelial cancers in various organs. Previous a/LCI setups have been limited by costly fiber-optic components and large footprints. Here, we present a novel a/LCI instrument incorporating a channel for optical coherence tomography (OCT) to provide real-time image guidance. We showcase the system's capabilities by acquiring imaging data fromin vivoBarrett's esophagus patients. The main innovation in this geometry lies in implementing a pathlength-matched single-mode fiber array, offering substantial cost savings while preserving signal fidelity. A further innovation is the introduction of a specialized side-viewing probe tailored for esophageal imaging, featuring miniature optics housed in a custom 3D-printed enclosure attached to the tip of the endoscope. The integration of OCT guidance enhances the precision of tissue targeting by providing real-time morphology imaging. This novel device represents a significant advancement in clinical translation of an enhanced screening approach for esophageal precancer, paving the way for more effective early-stage detection and intervention strategies.© 2024 Optica Publishing Group.",1.2386943554056768e-29
38725155,Data-driven selection of analysis decisions in single-cell RNA-seq trajectory inference.,Brief Bioinform,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments have become instrumental in developmental and differentiation studies, enabling the profiling of cells at a single or multiple time-points to uncover subtle variations in expression profiles reflecting underlying biological processes. Benchmarking studies have compared many of the computational methods used to reconstruct cellular dynamics; however, researchers still encounter challenges in their analysis due to uncertainty with respect to selecting the most appropriate methods and parameters. Even among universal data processing steps used by trajectory inference methods such as feature selection and dimension reduction, trajectory methods' performances are highly dataset-specific. To address these challenges, we developed Escort, a novel framework for evaluating a dataset's suitability for trajectory inference and quantifying trajectory properties influenced by analysis decisions. Escort evaluates the suitability of trajectory analysis and the combined effects of processing choices using trajectory-specific metrics. Escort navigates single-cell trajectory analysis through these data-driven assessments, reducing uncertainty and much of the decision burden inherent to trajectory inference analyses. Escort is implemented in an accessible R package and R/Shiny application, providing researchers with the necessary tools to make informed decisions during trajectory analysis and enabling new insights into dynamic biological processes at single-cell resolution.© The Author(s) 2024.

The authors argued that such embeddings are as arbitrary and as misleading as forcing the data into an elephant shape. Here we show that this conclusion was based on inadequate and limited metrics of embedding quality. More appropriate metrics quantifying neighborhood and class preservation reveal the elephant in the room: whilet-SNE and UMAP embeddings of single-cell data do not represent high-dimensional distances, they can nevertheless provide biologically relevant information.",8.927060995163637e-11
38523791,Topological structure of population activity in mouse visual cortex encodes densely sampled stimulus rotations.,iScience,"The primary visual cortex is one of the most well understood regions supporting the processing involved in sensory computation. Following the popularization of high-density neural recordings, it has been observed that the activity of large neural populations is often constrained to low dimensional manifolds. In this work, we quantify the structure of such neural manifolds in the visual cortex. We do this by analyzing publicly available two-photon optical recordings of mouse primary visual cortex in response to visual stimuli with a densely sampled rotation angle. Using a geodesic metric along with persistent homology, we discover that population activity in response to such stimuli generates a circular manifold, encoding the angle of rotation. Furthermore, we observe that this circular manifold is expressed differently in subpopulations of neurons with differing orientation and direction selectivity. Finally, we discuss some of the obstacles to reliably retrieving the truthful topology generated by a neural population.© 2024 The Author(s).",1.791354706595232e-28

38714658,"Spatially revealed roles for lncRNAs in Drosophila spermatogenesis, Y chromosome function and evolution.",Nat Commun,"Unlike coding genes, the number of lncRNA genes in organism genomes is relatively proportional to organism complexity. From plants to humans, the tissues with highest numbers and levels of lncRNA gene expression are the male reproductive organs. To learn why, we initiated a genome-wide analysis of Drosophila lncRNA spatial expression patterns in these tissues. The numbers of genes and levels of expression observed greatly exceed those previously reported, due largely to a preponderance of non-polyadenylated transcripts. In stark contrast to coding genes, the highest numbers of lncRNAs expressed are in post-meiotic spermatids. Correlations between expression levels, localization and previously performed genetic analyses indicate high levels of function and requirement. More focused analyses indicate that lncRNAs play major roles in evolution by controlling transposable element activities, Y chromosome gene expression and sperm construction. A new type of lncRNA-based particle found in seminal fluid may also contribute to reproductive outcomes.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.7887409975050506e-31
38626722,An effective strategy for assembling the sex-limited chromosome.,Gigascience,"Most currently available reference genomes lack the sequence map of sex-limited (such as Y and W) chromosomes, which results in incomplete assemblies that hinder further research on sex chromosomes. Recent advancements in long-read sequencing and population sequencing have provided the opportunity to assemble sex-limited chromosomes without the traditional complicated experimental efforts.We introduce the first computational method, Sorting long Reads of Y or other sex-limited chromosome (SRY), which achieves improved assembly results compared to flow sorting. Specifically, SRY outperforms in the heterochromatic region and demonstrates comparable performance in other regions. Furthermore, SRY enhances the capabilities of the hybrid assembly software, resulting in improved continuity and accuracy.Our method enables true complete genome assembly and facilitates downstream research of sex-limited chromosomes.© The Author(s) 2024.

38617276,Transcript Isoform Diversity of Y Chromosome Ampliconic Genes of Great Apes Uncovered Using Long Reads and Telomere-to-Telomere Reference Genome Assemblies.,bioRxiv,"Ychromosomes of great apes harborAmpliconicGenes (YAGs)-multi-copy gene families (BPY2,CDY,DAZ,HSFY,PRY,RBMY,TSPY,VCY, andXKRY) that encode proteins important for spermatogenesis. Previous work assembled YAG transcripts based on their targeted sequencing but not using reference genome assemblies, potentially resulting in an incomplete transcript repertoire. Here we used the recently produced gapless telomere-to-telomere (T2T) Y chromosome assemblies of great ape species (bonobo, chimpanzee, human, gorilla, Bornean orangutan, and Sumatran orangutan) and analyzed RNA data from whole-testis samples for the same species. We generated hybrid transcriptome assemblies by combining targeted long reads (Pacific Biosciences), untargeted long reads (Pacific Biosciences) and untargeted short reads (Illumina)and mapping them to the T2T reference genomes. Compared to the results from the reference-free approach, average transcript length was more than two times higher, and the total number of transcripts decreased three times, improving the quality of the assembled transcriptome. The reference-based transcriptome assemblies allowed us to differentiate transcripts originating from different Y chromosome gene copies and from their non-Y chromosome homologs. We identified two sources of transcriptome diversity-alternative splicing and gene duplication with subsequent diversification of gene copies. For each gene family, we detected transcribed pseudogenes along with protein-coding gene copies. We revealed previously unannotated gene copies of YAGs as compared to currently available NCBI annotations, as well as novel isoforms for annotated gene copies. This analysis paves the way for better understanding Y chromosome gene functions, which is important given their role in spermatogenesis.",1.634376915332094e-25
38549112,An in-depth evaluation of metagenomic classifiers for soil microbiomes.,Environ Microbiome,"Recent endeavours in metagenomics, exemplified by projects such as the human microbiome project and TARA Oceans, have illuminated the complexities of microbial biomes. A robust bioinformatic pipeline and meticulous evaluation of their methodology have contributed to the success of these projects. The soil environment, however, with its unique challenges, requires a specialized methodological exploration to maximize microbial insights. A notable limitation in soil microbiome studies is the dearth of soil-specific reference databases available to classifiers that emulate the complexity of soil communities. There is also a lack of in-vitro mock communities derived from soil strains that can be assessed for taxonomic classification accuracy.In this study, we generated a custom in-silico mock community containing microbial genomes commonly observed in the soil microbiome. Using this mock community, we simulated shotgun sequencing data to evaluate the performance of three leading metagenomic classifiers: Kraken2 (supplemented with Bracken, using a custom database derived from GTDB-TK genomes along with its own default database), Kaiju, and MetaPhlAn, utilizing their respective default databases for a robust analysis. Our results highlight the importance of optimizing taxonomic classification parameters, database selection, as well as analysing trimmed reads and contigs. Our study showed that classifiers tailored to the specific taxa present in our samples led to fewer errors compared to broader databases including microbial eukaryotes, protozoa, or human genomes, highlighting the effectiveness of targeted taxonomic classification. Notably, an optimal classifier performance was achieved when applying a relative abundance threshold of 0.001% or 0.005%. The Kraken2 supplemented with bracken, with a custom database demonstrated superior precision, sensitivity, F1 score, and overall sequence classification. Using a custom database, this classifier classified 99% of in-silico reads and 58% of real-world soil shotgun reads, with the latter identifying previously overlooked phyla using a custom database.This study underscores the potential advantages of in-silico methodological optimization in metagenomic analyses, especially when deciphering the complexities of soil microbiomes. We demonstrate that the choice of classifier and database significantly impacts microbial taxonomic profiling. Our findings suggest that employing Kraken2 with Bracken, coupled with a custom database of GTDB-TK genomes and fungal genomes at a relative abundance threshold of 0.001% provides optimal accuracy in soil shotgun metagenome analysis.© 2024.

38632401,Refining the impact of genetic evidence on clinical success.,Nature,"The cost of drug discovery and development is driven primarily by failure1, with only about 10% of clinical programmes eventually receiving approval2-4. We previously estimated that human genetic evidence doubles the success rate from clinical development to approval5. In this study we leverage the growth in genetic evidence over the past decade to better understand the characteristics that distinguish clinical success and failure. We estimate the probability of success for drug mechanisms with genetic support is 2.6 times greater than those without. This relative success varies among therapy areas and development phases, and improves with increasing confidence in the causal gene, but is largely unaffected by genetic effect size, minor allele frequency or year of discovery. These results indicate we are far from reaching peak genetic insights to aid the discovery of targets for more effective drugs.© 2024. The Author(s).",1.6719273203992217e-20

Synthetic siRNAs that trigger RNAi have the potential to specifically silence virtually any therapeutic target with unprecedented potency and durability. Bringing this innovative class of medicines to patients, however, has been riddled with substantial challenges, with delivery issues at the forefront. Several classes of siRNA drug are under clinical evaluation, but their utility in treating extrahepatic diseases remains limited, demanding continued innovation.

38500833,Integrated modeling of labile and glycated hemoglobin with glucose for enhanced diabetes detection and short-term monitoring.,iScience,"Metabolic biomarkers, particularly glycated hemoglobin and fasting plasma glucose, are pivotal in the diagnosis and control of diabetes mellitus. Despite their importance, they exhibit limitations in assessing short-term glucose variations. In this study, we propose labile hemoglobin as an additional biomarker, providing insightful perspectives into these fluctuations. By utilizing datasets from 40,652 retrospective general participants and conducting glucose tolerance tests on 60 prospective pediatric subjects, we explored the relationship between plasma glucose and labile hemoglobin. A mathematical model was developed to encapsulate short-term glucose kinetics in the pediatric group. Applying dimensionality reduction techniques, we successfully identified participant subclusters, facilitating the differentiation between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. Intriguingly, by integrating labile hemoglobin measurements with plasma glucose values, we were able to predict the likelihood of diabetes in pediatric subjects, underscoring the potential of labile hemoglobin as a significant glycemic biomarker for diabetes research.© 2024 The Authors.",9.608876915483797e-14
38689329,Application of exercise therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease-induced muscle atrophy: a scoping review.,BMC Sports Sci Med Rehabil,"The prevalence of muscle atrophy in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) presents a significant challenge to healthcare providers, necessitating innovative approaches to management and care. Against this backdrop, this study embarks on a comprehensive review of literature concerning the application of exercise interventions in the nursing care of these patients. Such interventions are critical in addressing the debilitating effects of the condition, which include progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, adversely affecting patient mobility, quality of life, and overall survival. This review aims to identify the specific exercise modalities, contents, outcome indicators, and application effects associated with this intervention, in the context of the complex interplay of metabolic, inflammatory, and hormonal factors contributing to muscle wasting in CKD patients. By examining the efficacy of various exercise interventions, this study seeks to elucidate optimal strategies for mitigating the impact of CKD-induced muscle atrophy, thereby informing clinical practices and improving patient outcomes.According to the method of a scoping review, nine databases (Cochrane, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, ProQuest, Ovid, CNKI, Wanfang Data, and VIP) were searched until September 28, 2023. The included literature was screened, summarized, and analyzed.A total of 20 pieces of literature were included. Some types include aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and aerobic combined resistance exercise. The exercise intensity primarily falls within the mild to moderate range, with a recommended frequency of 2 - 3 times a week, lasting 30 - 60 min each time. The types of outcomes encompassed in this study include body composition, functional testing, strength measurements, laboratory examinations, cardiopulmonary function assessments, and patient-reported outcomes. To varying degrees, exercise intervention positively impacts the subjects' physical activity ability, body composition, and skeletal muscle status. Currently, resistance training is the primary type of intervention used for preventing and treating CKD patients induced by muscle atrophy.Exercise intervention can improve muscle strength, physical function, and quality of life in patients with CKD muscle atrophy. Therefore, patients should be fully informed of the effect of exercise intervention in the treatment of chronic kidney disease-induced muscle atrophy in future, so as to promote the standardized implementation of exercise intervention.© 2024.

38672636,The Role of Curcumin in Cancer: A Focus on the PI3K/Akt Pathway.,Cancers (Basel),"Cancer is a life-threatening disease and one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Despite significant advancements in therapeutic options, most available anti-cancer agents have limited efficacy. In this context, natural compounds with diverse chemical structures have been investigated for their multimodal anti-cancer properties. Curcumin is a polyphenol isolated from the rhizomes ofCurcuma longaand has been widely studied for its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-cancer effects. Curcumin acts on the regulation of different aspects of cancer development, including initiation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and progression. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway is a key target in cancer therapy, since it is implicated in initiation, proliferation, and cancer cell survival. Curcumin has been found to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway in tumor cells, primarily via the regulation of different key mediators, including growth factors, protein kinases, and cytokines. This review presents the therapeutic potential of curcumin in different malignancies, such as glioblastoma, prostate and breast cancer, and head and neck cancers, through the targeting of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",5.2139641637890156e-55

38660647,Computed tomography-based radiomics diagnostic approach for differential diagnosis between early- and late-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,World J Gastrointest Oncol,"One of the primary reasons for the dismal survival rates in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is that most patients are usually diagnosed at late stages. There is an urgent unmet clinical need to identify and develop diagnostic methods that could precisely detect PDAC at its earliest stages.To evaluate the potential value of radiomics analysis in the differentiation of early-stage PDAC from late-stage PDAC.A total of 71 patients with pathologically proved PDAC based on surgical resection who underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) within 30 d prior to surgery were included in the study. Tumor staging was performed in accordance with the 8thedition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. Radiomics features were extracted from the region of interest (ROI) for each patient using Analysis Kit software. The most important and predictive radiomics features were selected using Mann-WhitneyUtest, univariate logistic regression analysis, and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) method. Random forest (RF) method was used to construct the radiomics model, and 10-times leave group out cross-validation (LGOCV) method was used to validate the robustness and reproducibility of the model.A total of 792 radiomics features (396 from late arterial phase and 396 from portal venous phase) were extracted from the ROI for each patient using Analysis Kit software. Nine most important and predictive features were selected using Mann-WhitneyUtest, univariate logistic regression analysis, and MRMR method. RF method was used to construct the radiomics model with the nine most predictive radiomics features, which showed a high discriminative ability with 97.7% accuracy, 97.6% sensitivity, 97.8% specificity, 98.4% positive predictive value, and 96.8% negative predictive value. The radiomics model was proved to be robust and reproducible using 10-times LGOCV method with an average area under the curve of 0.75 by the average performance of the 10 newly built models.The radiomics model based on CT could serve as a promising non-invasive method in differential diagnosis between early and late stage PDAC.©The Author(s) 2024.

However, its biological functions in bladder cancer remains to be proven. We analysed variations in YARS1 expression and survival in bladder cancer using multiple data sets, including TCGA-BLCA, GSE13507 and bladder cancer-specific tissue microarrays. Furthermore, we explored the biological functions of YARS1 using transcriptome data. Our findings revealed a noteworthy correlation between YARS1 and immune infiltration in bladder cancer, as determined using the XCELL algorithm and single-cell analysis. In addition, we employed the TIDE algorithm to evaluate the responsiveness of different cohorts to immune checkpoint therapy. We investigated the regulatory associations between YARS1 and various aspects of bladder cancer, including senescence, ferroptosis and stemness. Finally, we established a ceRNA network that is directly linked to the overall prognosis, YARS1 can serve as a prognostic biomarker for bladder cancer; its interaction with MYC has implications for bladder cancer cell senescence, ferroptosis and stemness. Moreover, the identified ceRNA network has potential as a therapeutic target in bladder cancer.© 2024 The Authors.

However, precursor quantification at homeostasis and under diseased conditions is constrained by the scarcity of available methods. To address this issue, we optimized a method for quantifying a wide range of hematopoietic precursors. Assuming the random induction of a stable label in precursors following a binomial distribution, the estimation depends on the inverse correlation between precursor numbers and the variance of precursor labeling among independent samples. Experimentally validated to cover the full dynamic range of hematopoietic precursors in mice (1 to 105), we utilized this approach to demonstrate that thousands of precursors, which emerge after modest expansion during fetal-to-adult transition, contribute to native and perturbed hematopoiesis. We further estimated the number of precursors in a mouse model of Fanconi Anemia, showcasing how repopulation deficits can be segregated into autologous (cell proliferation) and non-autologous causes (lack of precursor). Our results support an accessible and reliable approach for precursor quantification, emphasizing the contemporary perspective that native hematopoiesis is highly polyclonal.",1.6058425363319446e-30
