38723642,Placental DNA methylation signatures of prenatal air pollution exposure and potential effects on birth outcomes: an analysis of three prospective cohorts.,Lancet Planet Health,"Pregnancy air pollution exposure (PAPE) has been linked to a wide range of adverse birth and childhood outcomes, but there is a paucity of data on its influence on the placental epigenome, which can regulate the programming of physiological functions and affect child development. This study aimed to investigate the association between prenatal air pollutant exposure concentrations and changes in placental DNA methylation patterns, and to explore the potential windows of susceptibility and sex-specific alterations.This multi-site study used three prospective population-based mother-child cohorts: EDEN, PELAGIE, and SEPAGES, originating from four French geographical regions (Nancy, Poitiers, Brittany, and Grenoble). Pregnant women were included between 2003 and 2006 for EDEN and PELAGIE, and between 2014 and 2017 for SEPAGES. The main eligibility criteria were: being older than 18 years, having a singleton pregnancy, and living and planning to deliver in one of the maternity clinics in one of the study areas. A total of 1539 mother-child pairs were analysed, measuring placental DNA methylation using Illumina BeadChips. We used validated spatiotemporally resolved models to estimate PM2·5, PM10, and NO2exposure over each trimester of pregnancy at the maternal residential address. We conducted a pooled adjusted epigenome-wide association study to identify differentially methylated 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) sites and regions (assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip array, n=871), including sex-specific and sex-linked alterations, and independently validated our results (assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array, n=668).We identified four CpGs and 28 regions associated with PAPE in the total population, 469 CpGs and 87 regions in male infants, and 150 CpGs and 66 regions in female infants. We validated 35% of the CpGs available. More than 30% of the identified CpGs were related to one (or more) birth outcome and most significant alterations were enriched for neural development, immunity, and metabolism related genes. The 28 regions identified for both sexes overlapped with imprinted genes (four genes), and were associated with neurodevelopment (nine genes), immune system (seven genes), and metabolism (five genes). Most associations were observed for the third trimester for female infants (134 of 150 CpGs), and throughout pregnancy (281 of 469 CpGs) and the first trimester (237 of 469 CpGs) for male infants.These findings highlight the molecular pathways through which PAPE might affect child health in a widespread and sex-specific manner, identifying the genes involved in the major physiological functions of a developing child. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether these epigenetic changes persist and affect health later in life.French Agency for National Research, Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale, Fondation de France, and the Plan Cancer.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

38702190,"Epigenome-wide association study of lung cancer among never smokers in two prospective cohorts in Shanghai, China.",Thorax,"The aetiology of lung cancer among individuals who never smoked remains elusive, despite 15% of lung cancer cases in men and 53% in women worldwide being unrelated to smoking. Epigenetic alterations, particularly DNA methylation (DNAm) changes, have emerged as potential drivers. Yet, few prospective epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), primarily focusing on peripheral blood DNAm with limited representation of never smokers, have been conducted.We conducted a nested case-control study of 80 never-smoking incident lung cancer cases and 83 never-smoking controls within the Shanghai Women's Health Study and Shanghai Men's Health Study. DNAm was measured in prediagnostic oral rinse samples using Illumina MethylationEPIC array. Initially, we conducted an EWAS to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with lung cancer in the discovery sample of 101 subjects. The top 50 DMPs were further evaluated in a replication sample of 62 subjects, and results were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis.Our study identified three DMPs significantly associated with lung cancer at the epigenome-wide significance level of p<8.22×10-8. These DMPs were identified as cg09198866 (MYH9;TXN2), cg01411366 (SLC9A10) and cg12787323. Furthermore, examination of the top 1000 DMPs indicated significant enrichment in epithelial regulatory regions and their involvement in small GTPase-mediated signal transduction pathways. Additionally, GrimAge acceleration was identified as a risk factor for lung cancer (OR=1.19 per year; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.34).While replication in a larger sample size is necessary, our findings suggest that DNAm patterns in prediagnostic oral rinse samples could provide novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of lung cancer in never smokers.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

38685121,Genome- and epigenome-wide association studies identify susceptibility of CpG sites and regions for metabolic syndrome in a Korean population.,Clin Epigenetics,"While multiple studies have investigated the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its related traits (fasting glucose, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure, waist circumference) and DNA methylation, our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms in MetS remains limited. Therefore, we performed an epigenome-wide meta-analysis of blood DNA methylation to identify differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with MetS and its components using two independent cohorts comprising a total of 2,334 participants. We also investigated the specific genetic effects on DNA methylation, identified methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) through genome-wide association studies and further utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess how these meQTLs subsequently influence MetS status.We identified 40 DMPs and 27 DMRs that are significantly associated with MetS. In addition, we identified many novel DMPs and DMRs underlying inflammatory and steroid hormonal processes. The most significant associations were observed in 3 DMPs (cg19693031, cg26974062, cg02988288) and a DMR (chr1:145440444-145441553) at the TXNIP, which are involved in lipid metabolism. These CpG sites were identified as coregulators of DNA methylation in MetS, TG and FAG levels. We identified a total of 144 cis-meQTLs, out of which only 13 were found to be associated with DMPs for MetS. Among these, we confirmed the identified causal mediators of genetic effects at CpG sites cg01881899 at ABCG1 and cg00021659 at the TANK genes for MetS.This study observed whether specific CpGs and methylated regions act independently or are influenced by genetic effects for MetS and its components in the Korean population. These associations between the identified DNA methylation and MetS, along with its individual components, may serve as promising targets for the development of preventive interventions for MetS.© 2024.

38564759,Critical evaluation of the reliability of DNA methylation probes on the Illumina MethylationEPIC v1.0 BeadChip microarrays.,Epigenetics,"DNA metxhylation (DNAm) plays a crucial role in a number of complex diseases. However, the reliability of DNAm levels measured using Illumina arrays varies across different probes. Previous research primarily assessed probe reliability by comparing duplicate samples between the 450k-450k or 450k-EPIC platforms, with limited investigations on Illumina EPIC v1.0 arrays. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the EPIC v1.0 array probe reliability using 69 blood DNA samples, each measured twice, generated by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. We observed higher reliability in probes with average methylation beta values of 0.2 to 0.8, and lower reliability in type I probes or those within the promoter and CpG island regions. Importantly, we found that probe reliability has significant implications in the analyses of Epigenome-wide Association Studies (EWAS). Higher reliability is associated with more consistent effect sizes in different studies, the identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTLs), and significant correlations with downstream gene expression. Moreover, blood DNAm measurements obtained from probes with higher reliability are more likely to show concordance with brain DNAm measurements. Our findings, which provide crucial reliability information for probes on the EPIC v1.0 array, will serve as a valuable resource for future DNAm studies."
38562779,Association between Maternal Perinatal Stress and Depression on Infant DNA Methylation in the First Year of Life.,Res Sq,"Maternal stress and depression during pregnancy and the first year of the infant's life affect a large percentage of mothers. Maternal stress and depression have been associated with adverse fetal and childhood outcomes as well as differential child DNA methylation (DNAm). However, the biological mechanisms connecting maternal stress and depression to poor health outcomes in children are still largely unknown. Here we aim to determine whether prenatal stress and depression are associated with changes in cord blood mononuclear cell DNAm (CBMC-DNAm) in newborns (n = 119) and whether postnatal stress and depression are associated with changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNAm (PBMC-DNAm) in children of 12 months of age (n = 113) from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) cohort. Stress was measured using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Questionnaire (CESD). Both stress and depression were measured at 18 weeks and 36 weeks of pregnancy and six months and 12 months postpartum. We conducted epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) using robust linear regression followed by a sensitivity analysis in which we bias-adjusted for inflation and unmeasured confounding using the bacon and cate methods. To investigate the cumulative effect of maternal stress and depression, we created composite prenatal and postnatal adversity scores. We identified a significant association between prenatal stress and differential CBMC-DNAm at 8 CpG sites and between prenatal depression and differential CBMC-DNAm at 2 CpG sites. Additionally, we identified a significant association between postnatal stress and differential PBMC-DNAm at 8 CpG sites and between postnatal depression and differential PBMC-DNAm at 11 CpG sites. Using our composite scores, we further identified 2 CpG sites significantly associated with prenatal adversity and 7 CpG sites significantly associated with postnatal adversity. Several of the associated genes, includingPLAGL1, HYMAI, BRD2, andERC2have been implicated in adverse fetal outcomes and neuropsychiatric disorders. This suggested that differential DNAm may play a role in the relationship between maternal mental health and child health."
38490207,The association of cigarette smoking with DNA methylation and gene expression in human tissue samples.,Am J Hum Genet,"Cigarette smoking adversely affects many aspects of human health, and epigenetic responses to smoking may reflect mechanisms that mediate or defend against these effects. Prior studies of smoking and DNA methylation (DNAm), typically measured in leukocytes, have identified numerous smoking-associated regions (e.g., AHRR). To identify smoking-associated DNAm features in typically inaccessible tissues, we generated array-based DNAm data for 916 tissue samples from the GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) project representing 9 tissue types (lung, colon, ovary, prostate, blood, breast, testis, kidney, and muscle). We identified 6,350 smoking-associated CpGs in lung tissue (n = 212) and 2,735 in colon tissue (n = 210), most not reported previously. For all 7 other tissue types (sample sizes 38-153), no clear associations were observed (false discovery rate 0.05), but some tissues showed enrichment for smoking-associated CpGs reported previously. For 1,646 loci (in lung) and 22 (in colon), smoking was associated with both DNAm and local gene expression. For loci detected in both lung and colon (e.g., AHRR, CYP1B1, CYP1A1), top CpGs often differed between tissues, but similar clusters of hyper- or hypomethylated CpGs were observed, with hypomethylation at regulatory elements corresponding to increased expression. For lung tissue, 17 hallmark gene sets were enriched for smoking-associated CpGs, including xenobiotic- and cancer-related gene sets. At least four smoking-associated regions in lung were impacted by lung methylation quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that co-localize with genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals for lung function (FEV1/FVC), suggesting epigenetic alterations can mediate the effects of smoking on lung health. Our multi-tissue approach has identified smoking-associated regions in disease-relevant tissues, including effects that are shared across tissue types.Copyright © 2024 American Society of Human Genetics.

38577817,Trauma context exerts intergenerational effects on child mental health via DNA methylation.,Epigenetics,"Many people experience traumatic or negative events, but few develop mental health issues as a result. This study investigated whether newborn DNA methylation (DNAm) previously associated with maternal childhood physical abuse by her father affected the child's mental health and physical growth, as well as whether it mediated or moderated developmental outcomes.Study sample (N = 903) and data came from Bristol University's Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. DNAm was measured in cord blood at birth. DNAm data was preprocessed, normalized, and quality controlled before subsetting to 60 CpG sites of interest from previous research. Linear regression analysis examined newborn DNAm and child development outcome associations. Sobel test examined the mediating relationship between mother's history of childhood abuse by father, newborn targeted gene DNAm of significant CpG sites, and child's mental health and physical growth. Moderation analyses examined the interaction effects between the significant CpG sites and mothers' physical abuse by their fathers on child's mental health and physical growth.Full cohort analyses showed that newborn DNAm of several different CpG sites associates with separation anxiety, fear, and unhappy/tearful presentations in children aged 6-7 y. Sex-specific associations emerged with boys showing associations with anxiety and fear, and girls showing associations with fear and unhappiness. In boys only, cord blood DNAm mediates the effect of maternal childhood trauma on offspring mental health. No moderation effects emerged.Intergenerational effects of mother's relationship to her abuser present in newborn DNAm associate with 7-year-old child's mental health, show sex-specific effects, and newborn DNAm does mediate maternal childhood trauma effects on offspring mental health in early-life."
38528588,Epigenetic scores of blood-based proteins as biomarkers of general cognitive function and brain health.,Clin Epigenetics,"Epigenetic Scores (EpiScores) for blood protein levels have been associated with disease outcomes and measures of brain health, highlighting their potential usefulness as clinical biomarkers. They are typically derived via penalised regression, whereby a linear weighted sum of DNA methylation (DNAm) levels at CpG sites are predictive of protein levels. Here, we examine 84 previously published protein EpiScores as possible biomarkers of cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of general cognitive function and brain health, and incident dementia across three independent cohorts.Using 84 protein EpiScores as candidate biomarkers, associations with general cognitive function (both cross-sectionally and longitudinally) were tested in three independent cohorts: Generation Scotland (GS), and the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 and 1936 (LBC1921 and LBC1936, respectively). A meta-analysis of general cognitive functioning results in all three cohorts identified 18 EpiScore associations (absolute meta-analytic standardised estimates ranged from 0.03 to 0.14, median of 0.04, PFDR < 0.05). Several associations were also observed between EpiScores and global brain volumetric measures in the LBC1936. An EpiScore for the S100A9 protein (a known Alzheimer disease biomarker) was associated with general cognitive functioning (meta-analytic standardised beta: - 0.06, P = 1.3 × 10-9), and with time-to-dementia in GS (Hazard ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.44, P = 0.003), but not in LBC1936 (Hazard ratio 1.11, P = 0.32).EpiScores might make a contribution to the risk profile of poor general cognitive function and global brain health, and risk of dementia, however these scores require replication in further studies.© 2024.

38525738,Epigenetic Features in Newborns Associated with Preadolescence Lung Function and Asthma Acquisition during Adolescence.,Epigenomes,"The association between newborn DNA methylation (DNAm) and asthma acquisition (AA) during adolescence has been suggested. Lung function (LF) has been shown to be associated with asthma risk and its severity. However, the role of LF in the associations between DNAm and AA is unclear, and it is also unknown whether the association between DNAm and AA is consistent with that between DNAm and LF. We address this question through assessing newborn epigenetic features of preadolescence LF and of AA during adolescence, along with their biological pathways and processes. Our study's primary medical significance lies in advancing the understanding of asthma's early life origins. By investigating epigenetic markers in newborns and their association with lung function in preadolescence, we aim to uncover potential early biomarkers of asthma risk. This could facilitate earlier detection and intervention strategies. Additionally, exploring biological pathways linking early lung function to later asthma development can offer insights into the disease's pathogenesis, potentially leading to novel therapeutic targets.The study was based on the Isle of Wight Birth cohort (IOWBC). Female subjects with DNAm data at birth and with no asthma at age 10 years were included (n = 249). The R package ttScreening was applied to identify CpGs potentially associated with AA from 10 to 18 years and with LF at age 10 (FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC), respectively. Agreement in identified CpGs between AA and LF was examined, along with their biological pathways and processes via the R function gometh. We tested the findings in an independent cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), to examine overall replicability.In IOWBC, 292 CpGs were detected with DNAm associated with AA and 1517 unique CpGs for LF (514 for FEV1, 436 for FVC, 408 for FEV1/FVC), with one overlapping CpG, cg23642632 (NCKAP1) between AA and LF. Among the IOWBC-identified CpGs, we further tested in ALSPAC and observed the highest agreement between the two cohorts in FVC with respect to the direction of association and statistical significance. Epigenetic enrichment analyses indicated non-specific connections in the biological pathways and processes between AA and LF.The present study suggests that FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC (as objective measures of LF) and AA (incidence of asthma) are likely to have their own specific epigenetic features and biological pathways at birth. More replications are desirable to fully understand the complexity between DNAm, lung function, and asthma acquisition."
38503926,Sex effects on DNA methylation affect discovery in epigenome-wide association study of schizophrenia.,Mol Psychiatry,"Sex differences in the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of schizophrenia are well-known; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences remain unclear. Further, the potential advantages of sex-stratified meta-analyses of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of schizophrenia have not been investigated. Here, we performed sex-stratified EWAS meta-analyses to investigate whether sex stratification improves discovery, and to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in schizophrenia. Peripheral blood-derived DNA methylation data from 1519 cases of schizophrenia (male n = 989, female n = 530) and 1723 controls (male n = 997, female n = 726) from three publicly available datasets, and the TOP cohort were meta-analyzed to compare sex-specific, sex-stratified, and sex-adjusted EWAS. The predictive power of each model was assessed by polymethylation score (PMS). The number of schizophrenia-associated differentially methylated positions identified was higher for the sex-stratified model than for the sex-adjusted one. We identified 20 schizophrenia-associated DMRs in the sex-stratified analysis. PMS from sex-stratified analysis outperformed that from sex-adjusted analysis in predicting schizophrenia. Notably, PMSs from the sex-stratified and female-only analyses, but not those from sex-adjusted or the male-only analyses, significantly predicted schizophrenia in males. The findings suggest that sex-stratified EWAS meta-analyses improve the identification of schizophrenia-associated epigenetic changes and highlight an interaction between sex and schizophrenia status on DNA methylation. Sex-specific DNA methylation may have potential implications for precision psychiatry and the development of stratified treatments for schizophrenia.© 2024. The Author(s)."
38559770,Exposure to air pollution is associated with DNA methylation changes in sperm.,Environ Epigenet,"Exposure to air pollutants has been associated with adverse health outcomes in adults and children who were prenatally exposed. In addition to reducing exposure to air pollutants, it is important to identify their biologic targets in order to mitigate the health consequences of exposure. One molecular change associated with prenatal exposure to air pollutants is DNA methylation (DNAm), which has been associated with changes in placenta and cord blood tissues at birth. However, little is known about how air pollution exposure impacts the sperm epigenome, which could provide important insights into the mechanism of transmission to offspring. In the present study, we explored whether exposure to particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter, particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), or ozone (O3) was associated with DNAm in sperm contributed by participants in the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation prospective pregnancy cohort. Air pollution exposure measurements were calculated as the average exposure for each pollutant measured within 4 weeks prior to the date of sample collection. Using array-based genome-scale methylation analyses, we identified 80, 96, 35, and 67 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) significantly associated with particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter, particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter, NO2, and O3,respectively. While no DMRs were associated with exposure to all four pollutants, we found that genes overlapping exposure-related DMRs had a shared enrichment for gene ontology biological processes related to neurodevelopment. Together, these data provide compelling support for the hypothesis that paternal exposure to air pollution impacts DNAm in sperm, particularly in regions implicated in neurodevelopment.© The Author(s) 2024.

38692281,Blood-based epigenome-wide analyses of chronic low-grade inflammation across diverse population cohorts.,Cell Genom,"Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of age-related disease states. The effectiveness of inflammatory proteins including C-reactive protein (CRP) in assessing long-term inflammation is hindered by their phasic nature. DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures of CRP may act as more reliable markers of chronic inflammation. We show that inter-individual differences in DNAm capture 50% of the variance in circulating CRP (N = 17,936, Generation Scotland). We develop a series of DNAm predictors of CRP using state-of-the-art algorithms. An elastic-net-regression-based predictor outperformed competing methods and explained 18% of phenotypic variance in the Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936 (LBC1936) cohort, doubling that of existing DNAm predictors. DNAm predictors performed comparably in four additional test cohorts (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, Health for Life in Singapore, Southall and Brent Revisited, and LBC1921), including for individuals of diverse genetic ancestry and different age groups. The best-performing predictor surpassed assay-measured CRP and a genetic score in its associations with 26 health outcomes. Our findings forge new avenues for assessing chronic low-grade inflammation in diverse populations.Copyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
38741114,DNA methylation signatures of youth-onset type 2 diabetes and exposure to maternal diabetes.,Clin Epigenetics,"Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) is physiologically distinct from adult-onset, but it is not clear how the two diseases differ at a molecular level. In utero exposure to maternal type 2 diabetes (T2D) is known to be a specific risk factor for youth-onset T2D. DNA methylation (DNAm) changes associated with T2D but which differ between youth- and adult-onset might delineate the impacts of T2D development at different ages and could also determine the contribution of exposure to in utero diabetes.We performed an epigenome-wide analysis of DNAm on whole blood from 218 youth with T2D and 77 normoglycemic controls from the iCARE (improving renal Complications in Adolescents with type 2 diabetes through REsearch) cohort. Associations were tested using multiple linear regression models while adjusting for maternal diabetes, sex, age, BMI, smoking status, second-hand smoking exposure, cell-type proportions and genetic ancestry.We identified 3830 differentially methylated sites associated with youth T2D onset, of which 3794 were moderately (adjusted p-value < 0.05 and effect size estimate > 0.01) associated and 36 were strongly (adjusted p-value < 0.05 and effect size estimate > 0.05) associated. A total of 3725 of these sites were not previously reported in the EWAS Atlas as associated with T2D, adult obesity or youth obesity. Moreover, three CpGs associated with youth-onset T2D in the PFKFB3 gene were also associated with maternal T2D exposure (FDR < 0.05 and effect size > 0.01). This is the first study to link PFKFB3 and T2D in youth.Our findings support that T2D in youth has different impacts on DNAm than adult-onset, and suggests that changes in DNAm could provide an important link between in utero exposure to maternal diabetes and the onset of T2D.© 2024.

38574408,Enhanced resolution profiling in twins reveals differential methylation signatures of type 2 diabetes with links to its complications.,EBioMedicine,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Previous findings suggest DNA methylation as a potential mechanism in T2D pathogenesis and progression.We profiled DNA methylation in 248 blood samples from participants of European ancestry from 7 twin cohorts using a methylation sequencing platform targeting regulatory genomic regions encompassing 2,048,698 CpG sites.We find and replicate 3 previously unreported T2D differentially methylated CpG positions (T2D-DMPs) at FDR 5% in RGL3, NGB and OTX2, and 20 signals at FDR 25%, of which 14 replicated. Integrating genetic variation and T2D-discordant monozygotic twin analyses, we identify both genetic-based and genetic-independent T2D-DMPs. The signals annotate to genes with established GWAS and EWAS links to T2D and its complications, including blood pressure (RGL3) and eye disease (OTX2).The results help to improve our understanding of T2D disease pathogenesis and progression and may provide biomarkers for its complications.Funding acknowledgements for each cohort can be found in the Supplementary Note.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

38724732,Quantifying the stochastic component of epigenetic aging.,Nat Aging,"DNA methylation clocks can accurately estimate chronological age and, to some extent, also biological age, yet the process by which age-associated DNA methylation (DNAm) changes are acquired appears to be quasi-stochastic, raising a fundamental question: how much of an epigenetic clock's predictive accuracy could be explained by a stochastic process of DNAm change? Here, using DNAm data from sorted immune cells, we build realistic simulation models, subsequently demonstrating in over 22,770 sorted and whole-blood samples from 25 independent cohorts that approximately 66-75% of the accuracy underpinning Horvath's clock could be driven by a stochastic process. This fraction increases to 90% for the more accurate Zhang's clock, but is lower (63%) for the PhenoAge clock, suggesting that biological aging is reflected by nonstochastic processes. Confirming this, we demonstrate that Horvath's age acceleration in males and PhenoAge's age acceleration in severe coronavirus disease 2019 cases and smokers are not driven by an increased rate of stochastic change but by nonstochastic processes. These results significantly deepen our understanding and interpretation of epigenetic clocks.© 2024. The Author(s)."
38559237,What makes clocks tick? Characterizing developmental dynamics of adult epigenetic clock sites.,bioRxiv,"DNA methylation (DNAm) at specific sites can be used to calculate 'epigenetic clocks', which in adulthood are used as indicators of age(ing). However, little is known about how these clock sites 'behave' during development and what factors influence their variability in early life. This knowledge could be used to optimize healthy aging well before the onset of age-related conditions. Here, we leveraged results from two longitudinal population-based cohorts (N=5,019 samples from 2,348 individuals) to characterize trajectories of adult clock sites from birth to early adulthood. We find that clock sites (i) diverge widely in their developmental trajectories, often showing non-linear change over time; (ii) are substantially more likely than non-clock sites to vary between individuals already from birth, differences that are predictive of DNAm variation at later ages; and (iii) show enrichment for genetic and prenatal environmental exposures, supporting an early-origins perspective to epigenetic aging."
38588424,Pregnancy is linked to faster epigenetic aging in young women.,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,"A central prediction of evolutionary theory is that energy invested into reproduction comes at the expense of somatic maintenance and repair, accelerating biological aging. Supporting this prediction are findings that high fertility among women predicts shorter lifespan and poorer health later in life. However, biological aging is thought to begin before age-related health declines, limiting the applicability of morbidity and mortality for studying the aging process earlier in life. Here, we examine the relationship between reproductive history and biological aging in a sample of young (20 to 22yo) men and women from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, located in the Philippines (n = 1,735). We quantify biological aging using six measures, collectively known as epigenetic clocks, reflecting various facets of cellular aging, health, and mortality risk. In a subset of women, we test whether longitudinal changes in gravidity between young and early-middle adulthood (25 to 31yo) are associated with changes in epigenetic aging during that time. Cross-sectionally, gravidity was associated with all six measures of accelerated epigenetic aging in women (n = 825). Furthermore, longitudinal increases in gravidity were linked to accelerated epigenetic aging in two epigenetic clocks (n = 331). In contrast, the number of pregnancies a man reported fathering was not associated with epigenetic aging among same-aged cohort men (n = 910). These effects were robust to socioecological, environmental, and immunological factors, consistent with the hypothesis that pregnancy accelerates biological aging and that these effects can be detected in young women in a high-fertility context."
38721773,Neuroimaging and epigenetic analysis reveal novel epigenetic loci in major depressive disorder.,Psychol Med,"Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, contribute to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to identify novel MDD-associated epigenetic loci using DNA methylation profiles and explore the correlations between epigenetic loci and cortical thickness changes in patients with MDD.A total of 350 patients with MDD and 161 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). We analyzed methylation, copy number alteration (CNA), and gene network profiles in the MDD group. A total of 234 patients with MDD and 135 HCs were included in neuroimaging methylation analysis. Pearson's partial correlation analysis was used to estimate the correlation between cortical thickness of brain regions and DNA methylation levels of the loci.In total, 2018 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and 351 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified. DMP-related genes were enriched in two networks involved in the central nervous system. In neuroimaging analysis, patients with MDD showed cortical thinning in the prefrontal regions and cortical thickening in several occipital regions. Cortical thickness of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC, i.e. pars triangularis) was negatively correlated with eight DMPs associated with six genes (EML6,ZFP64,CLSTN3,KCNMA1,TAOK2, andNT5E).Through combining DNA methylation and neuroimaging analyses, negative correlations were identified between the cortical thickness of the left VLPFC and DNA methylation levels of eight DMPs. Our findings could improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD."
38571307,Methylation patterns associated with C-reactive protein in racially and ethnically diverse populations.,Epigenetics,"Systemic low-grade inflammation is a feature of chronic disease. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a common biomarker of inflammation and used as an indicator of disease risk; however, the role of inflammation in disease is not completely understood. Methylation is an epigenetic modification in the DNA which plays a pivotal role in gene expression. In this study we evaluated differential DNA methylation patterns associated with blood CRP level to elucidate biological pathways and genetic regulatory mechanisms to improve the understanding of chronic inflammation. The racially and ethnically diverse participants in this study were included as 50% White, 41% Black or African American, 7% Hispanic or Latino/a, and 2% Native Hawaiian, Asian American, American Indian, or Alaska Native (totaln = 13,433) individuals. We replicated 113 CpG sites from 87 unique loci, of which five were novel (CADM3,NALCN, NLRC5, ZNF792, and cg03282312), across a discovery set of 1,150 CpG sites associated with CRP level (p < 1.2E-7). The downstream pathways affected by DNA methylation included the identification ofIFI16andIRF7CpG-gene transcript pairs which contributed to the innate immune response gene enrichment pathway along withNLRC5,NOD2, andAIM2. Gene enrichment analysis also identified the nuclear factor-kappaB transcription pathway. Using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) we inferred methylation at three CpG sites as causal for CRP levels using both White and Black or African American MR instrument variables. Overall, we identified novel CpG sites and gene transcripts that could be valuable in understanding the specific cellular processes and pathogenic mechanisms involved in inflammation."

38724736,Aging clocks based on accumulating stochastic variation.,Nat Aging,"Aging clocks have provided one of the most important recent breakthroughs in the biology of aging, and may provide indicators for the effectiveness of interventions in the aging process and preventive treatments for age-related diseases. The reproducibility of accurate aging clocks has reinvigorated the debate on whether a programmed process underlies aging. Here we show that accumulating stochastic variation in purely simulated data is sufficient to build aging clocks, and that first-generation and second-generation aging clocks are compatible with the accumulation of stochastic variation in DNA methylation or transcriptomic data. We find that accumulating stochastic variation is sufficient to predict chronological and biological age, indicated by significant prediction differences in smoking, calorie restriction, heterochronic parabiosis and partial reprogramming. Although our simulations may not explicitly rule out a programmed aging process, our results suggest that stochastically accumulating changes in any set of data that have a ground state at age zero are sufficient for generating aging clocks.© 2024.

38645061,Cross-platform proteomics signatures of extreme old age.,bioRxiv,"In previous work we used a Somalogic platform targeting approximately 5000 proteins to generate a serum protein signature of centenarians that we validated in independent studies that used the same technology. We set here to validate and possibly expand the results by profiling the serum proteome of a subset of individuals included in the original study using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Following pre-processing, the LC-MS/MS data provided quantification of 398 proteins, with only 266 proteins shared by both platforms. At 1% FDR statistical significance threshold, the analysis of LC-MS/MS data detected 44 proteins associated with extreme old age, including 23 of the original analysis. To identify proteins for which associations between expression and extreme-old age were conserved across platforms, we performed inter-study conservation testing of the 266 proteins quantified by both platforms using a method that accounts for the correlation between the results. From these tests, a total of 80 proteins reached 5% FDR statistical significance, and 26 of these proteins had concordant pattern of gene expression in whole blood. This signature of 80 proteins points to blood coagulation, IGF signaling, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, and complement cascade as important pathways whose protein level changes provide evidence for age-related adjustments that distinguish centenarians from younger individuals."
38724733,Nature of epigenetic aging from a single-cell perspective.,Nat Aging,"Age-related changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) form the basis of the most robust predictors of age-epigenetic clocks-but a clear mechanistic understanding of exactly which aspects of aging are quantified by these clocks is lacking. Here, to clarify the nature of epigenetic aging, we juxtapose the dynamics of tissue and single-cell DNAm in mice. We compare these changes during early development with those observed during adult aging in mice, and corroborate our analyses with a single-cell RNA sequencing analysis within the same multiomics dataset. We show that epigenetic aging involves co-regulated changes as well as a major stochastic component, and this is consistent with transcriptional patterns. We further support the finding of stochastic epigenetic aging by direct tissue and single-cell DNAm analyses and modeling of aging DNAm trajectories with a stochastic process akin to radiocarbon decay. Finally, we describe a single-cell algorithm for the identification of co-regulated and stochastic CpG clusters showing consistent transcriptomic coordination patterns. Together, our analyses increase our understanding of the basis of epigenetic clocks and highlight potential opportunities for targeting aging and evaluating longevity interventions.© 2024.

38641644,Analysis of blood methylation quantitative trait loci in East Asians reveals ancestry-specific impacts on complex traits.,Nat Genet,"Methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) are essential for understanding the role of DNA methylation changes in genetic predisposition, yet they have not been fully characterized in East Asians (EAs). Here we identified mQTLs in whole blood from 3,523 Chinese individuals and replicated them in additional 1,858 Chinese individuals from two cohorts. Over 9% of mQTLs displayed specificity to EAs, facilitating the fine-mapping of EA-specific genetic associations, as shown for variants associated with height. Trans-mQTL hotspots revealed biological pathways contributing to EA-specific genetic associations, including an ERG-mediated 233 trans-mCpG network, implicated in hematopoietic cell differentiation, which likely reflects binding efficiency modulation of the ERG protein complex. More than 90% of mQTLs were shared between different blood cell lineages, with a smaller fraction of lineage-specific mQTLs displaying preferential hypomethylation in the respective lineages. Our study provides new insights into the mQTL landscape across genetic ancestries and their downstream effects on cellular processes and diseases/traits.© 2024.

38496585,Multi-omics Integration Identifies Genes Influencing Traits Associated with Cardiovascular Risks: The Long Life Family Study.,medRxiv,"The Long Life Family Study (LLFS) enrolled 4,953 participants in 539 pedigrees displaying exceptional longevity. To identify genetic mechanisms that affect cardiovascular risks in the LLFS population, we developed a multi-omics integration pipeline and applied it to 11 traits associated with cardiovascular risks. Using our pipeline, we aggregated gene-level statistics from rare-variant analysis, GWAS, and gene expression-trait association by Correlated Meta-Analysis (CMA). Across all traits, CMA identified 64 significant genes after Bonferroni correction (p ≤ 2.8×10-7), 29 of which replicated in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) cohort. Notably, 20 of the 29 replicated genes do not have a previously known trait-associated variant in the GWAS Catalog within 50 kb. Thirteen modules in Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks are significantly enriched in genes with low meta-analysis p-values for at least one trait, three of which are replicated in the FHS cohort. The functional annotation of genes in these modules showed a significant over-representation of trait-related biological processes including sterol transport, protein-lipid complex remodeling, and immune response regulation. Among major findings, our results suggest a role of triglyceride-associated and mast-cell functional genesFCER1A,MS4A2,GATA2,HDC, andHRH4in atherosclerosis risks. Our findings also suggest that lower expression ofATG2A, a gene we found to be associated with BMI, may be both a cause and consequence of obesity. Finally, our results suggest thatENPP3may play an intermediary role in triglyceride-induced inflammation.

38519330,Time is ticking faster for long genes in aging.,Trends Genet,"Recent studies of aging organisms have identified a systematic phenomenon, characterized by a negative correlation between gene length and their expression in various cell types, species, and diseases. We term this phenomenon gene-length-dependent transcription decline (GLTD) and suggest that it may represent a bottleneck in the transcription machinery and thereby significantly contribute to aging as an etiological factor. We review potential links between GLTD and key aging processes such as DNA damage and explore their potential in identifying disease modification targets. Notably, in Alzheimer's disease, GLTD spotlights extremely long synaptic genes at chromosomal fragile sites (CFSs) and their vulnerability to postmitotic DNA damage. We suggest that GLTD is an integral element of biological aging.Copyright © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved."

It is reflected in molecular changes across various tissues which can be leveraged for the development of biomarkers of aging using machine learning models, known as aging clocks. Despite advancements in the field, a significant challenge remains: the lack of robust, Python-based software tools for integrating and comparing these diverse models. This gap highlights the need for comprehensive solutions that can handle the complexity and variety of data in aging research.To address this gap, I introduce pyaging, a comprehensive open-source Python package designed to facilitate aging research. pyaging harmonizes dozens of aging clocks, covering a range of molecular data types such as DNA methylation, transcriptomics, histone mark ChIP-Seq, and ATAC-Seq. The package is not limited to traditional model types; it features a diverse array, from linear and principal component models to neural networks and automatic relevance determination models. Thanks to a PyTorch-based backend that enables GPU acceleration, pyaging is capable of rapid inference, even when dealing with large datasets and complex models. In addition, the package's support for multi-species analysis extends its utility across various organisms, including humans, various mammals, and Caenorhabditis elegans.pyaging is accessible on GitHub, at https://github.com/rsinghlab/pyaging, and the distribution is available on PyPi, at https://pypi.org/project/pyaging/.

38658803,Multimodal joint deconvolution and integrative signature selection in proteomics.,Commun Biol,"Deconvolution is an efficient approach for detecting cell-type-specific (cs) transcriptomic signals without cellular segmentation. However, this type of methods may require a reference profile from the same molecular source and tissue type. Here, we present a method to dissect bulk proteome by leveraging tissue-matched transcriptome and proteome without using a proteomics reference panel. Our method also selects the proteins contributing to the cellular heterogeneity shared between bulk transcriptome and proteome. The deconvoluted result enables downstream analyses such as cs-protein Quantitative Trait Loci (cspQTL) mapping. We benchmarked the performance of this multimodal deconvolution approach through CITE-seq pseudo bulk data, a simulation study, and the bulk multi-omics data from human brain normal tissues and breast cancer tumors, individually, showing robust and accurate cell abundance quantification across different datasets.

Advances in genome sequencing and machine learning have facilitated the development of blood-based multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests intended to complement single-cancer screening. MCED tests can interrogate circulating cell-free DNA to detect a shared cancer signal across multiple tumor types. We report real-world experience with an MCED test that detected cancer signals in three individuals subsequently diagnosed with cancers of the ovary, kidney, and head/neck that lack USPSTF-recommended screening. These cases illustrate the potential of MCED tests to detect early-stage cancers amenable to cure.© 2024. The Author(s)."
38546716,Meta-Research: Understudied genes are lost in a leaky pipeline between genome-wide assays and reporting of results.,Elife,"Present-day publications on human genes primarily feature genes that already appeared in many publications prior to completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. These patterns persist despite the subsequent adoption of high-throughput technologies, which routinely identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease. Although several hypotheses for bias in the selection of genes as research targets have been proposed, their explanatory powers have not yet been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understudied genes remain abandoned by studies that cite these -omics experiments. Conversely, we find that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect which genes are being studied, we find that 33 are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. To promote the investigation of understudied genes, we condense our insights into a tool,find my understudied genes(FMUG), that allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits. We demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging.

38549123,A novel generative adversarial networks modelling for the class imbalance problem in high dimensional omics data.,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,"Class imbalance remains a large problem in high-throughput omics analyses, causing bias towards the over-represented class when training machine learning-based classifiers. Oversampling is a common method used to balance classes, allowing for better generalization of the training data. More naive approaches can introduce other biases into the data, being especially sensitive to inaccuracies in the training data, a problem considering the characteristically noisy data obtained in healthcare. This is especially a problem with high-dimensional data. A generative adversarial network-based method is proposed for creating synthetic samples from small, high-dimensional data, to improve upon other more naive generative approaches. The method was compared with 'synthetic minority over-sampling technique' (SMOTE) and 'random oversampling' (RO). Generative methods were validated by training classifiers on the balanced data.© 2024. The Author(s)."
38741204,Early detection and prognosis evaluation for hepatocellular carcinoma by circulating tumour DNA methylation: A multicentre cohort study.,Clin Transl Med,"Early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can significantly improve patient survival. We aimed to develop a blood-based assay to aid in the diagnosis, detection and prognostic evaluation of HCC.A three-phase multicentre study was conducted to screen, optimise and validate HCC-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using next-generation sequencing and quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP).Genome-wide methylation profiling was conducted to identify DMRs distinguishing HCC tumours from peritumoural tissues and healthy plasmas. The twenty most effective DMRs were verified and incorporated into a multilocus qMSP assay (HepaAiQ). The HepaAiQ model was trained to separate 293 HCC patients (Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0/A, 224) from 266 controls including chronic hepatitis B (CHB) or liver cirrhosis (LC) (CHB/LC, 96), benign hepatic lesions (BHL, 23), and healthy controls (HC, 147). The model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.944 with a sensitivity of 86.0% in HCC and a specificity of 92.1% in controls. Blind validation of the HepaAiQ model in a cohort of 523 participants resulted in an AUC of 0.940 with a sensitivity of 84.4% in 205 HCC cases (BCLC stage 0/A, 167) and a specificity of 90.3% in 318 controls (CHB/LC, 100; BHL, 102; HC, 116). When evaluated in an independent test set, the HepaAiQ model exhibited a sensitivity of 70.8% in 65 HCC patients at BCLC stage 0/A and a specificity of 89.5% in 124 patients with CHB/LC. Moreover, HepaAiQ model was assessed in paired pre- and postoperative plasma samples from 103 HCC patients and correlated with 2-year patient outcomes. Patients with high postoperative HepaAiQ score showed a higher recurrence risk (Hazard ratio, 3.33, p < .001).HepaAiQ, a noninvasive qMSP assay, was developed to accurately measure HCC-specific DMRs and shows great potential for the diagnosis, detection and prognosis of HCC, benefiting at-risk populations.© 2024 The Author(s).

38650309,Leveraging DNA methylation to predict treatment response in major depressive disorder: A critical review.,Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating and prevalent mental disorder with a high disease burden. Despite a wide array of different treatment options, many patients do not respond to initial treatment attempts. Selection of the most appropriate treatment remains a significant clinical challenge in psychiatry, highlighting the need for the development of biomarkers with predictive utility. Recently, the epigenetic modification DNA methylation (DNAm) has emerged to be of great interest as a potential predictor of MDD treatment outcomes. Here, we review efforts to date that seek to identify DNAm signatures associated with treatment response in individuals with MDD. Searches were conducted in the databases PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science with the concepts and keywords MDD, DNAm, antidepressants, psychotherapy, cognitive behavior therapy, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and brain stimulation therapies. We identified 32 studies implicating DNAm patterns associated with MDD treatment outcomes. The majority of studies (N = 25) are focused on selected target genes exploring treatment outcomes in pharmacological treatments (N = 22) with a few studies assessing treatment response to electroconvulsive therapy (N = 3). Additionally, there are few genome-scale efforts (N = 7) to characterize DNAm patterns associated with treatment outcomes. There is a relative dearth of studies investigating DNAm patterns in relation to psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, or transcranial magnetic stimulation; importantly, most existing studies have limited sample sizes. Given the heterogeneity in both methods and results of studies to date, there is a need for additional studies before existing findings can inform clinical decisions.© 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
38622117,An ensemble penalized regression method for multi-ancestry polygenic risk prediction.,Nat Commun,"Great efforts are being made to develop advanced polygenic risk scores (PRS) to improve the prediction of complex traits and diseases. However, most existing PRS are primarily trained on European ancestry populations, limiting their transferability to non-European populations. In this article, we propose a novel method for generating multi-ancestry Polygenic Risk scOres based on enSemble of PEnalized Regression models (PROSPER). PROSPER integrates genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics from diverse populations to develop ancestry-specific PRS with improved predictive power for minority populations. The method uses a combination ofL1(lasso) andL2(ridge) penalty functions, a parsimonious specification of the penalty parameters across populations, and an ensemble step to combine PRS generated across different penalty parameters. We evaluate the performance of PROSPER and other existing methods on large-scale simulated and real datasets, including those from 23andMe Inc., the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, and All of Us. Results show that PROSPER can substantially improve multi-ancestry polygenic prediction compared to alternative methods across a wide variety of genetic architectures. In real data analyses, for example, PROSPER increased out-of-sample prediction R2for continuous traits by an average of 70% compared to a state-of-the-art Bayesian method (PRS-CSx) in the African ancestry population. Further, PROSPER is computationally highly scalable for the analysis of large SNP contents and many diverse populations.© 2024. The Author(s)."
38672772,Machine Learning Reveals Impacts of Smoking on Gene Profiles of Different Cell Types in Lung.,Life (Basel),"Smoking significantly elevates the risk of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. This risk is attributed to the harmful chemicals in tobacco smoke that damage lung tissue and impair lung function. Current research on the impact of smoking on gene expression in specific lung cells is limited. This study addresses this gap by analyzing gene expression profiles at the single-cell level from 43,539 lung endothelial cells, 234,349 lung epithelial cells, 189,843 lung immune cells, and 16,031 lung stromal cells using advanced machine learning techniques. The data, categorized by different lung cell types, were classified into three smoking states: active smoker, former smoker, and never smoker. Each cell sample encompassed 28,024 feature genes. Employing an incremental feature selection method within a computational framework, several specific genes have been identified as potential markers of smoking status in different lung cell types. These includeB2M,EEF1A1, andTPT1in lung endothelial cells;FTLandMT-ATP8in lung epithelial cells;HLA-BandHLA-Cin lung immune cells; andHSP90B1andLCN2in lung stroma cells. Additionally, this study developed quantitative rules for representing the gene expression patterns related to smoking. This research highlights the potential of machine learning in oncology, enhancing our molecular understanding of smoking's harm and laying the groundwork for future mechanism-based studies."
38670157,Prior knowledge-guided multilevel graph neural network for tumor risk prediction and interpretation via multi-omics data integration.,Brief Bioinform,"The interrelation and complementary nature of multi-omics data can provide valuable insights into the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying diseases. However, challenges such as limited sample size, high data dimensionality and differences in omics modalities pose significant obstacles to fully harnessing the potential of these data. The prior knowledge such as gene regulatory network and pathway information harbors useful gene-gene interaction and gene functional module information. To effectively integrate multi-omics data and make full use of the prior knowledge, here, we propose a Multilevel-graph neural network (GNN): a hierarchically designed deep learning algorithm that sequentially leverages multi-omics data, gene regulatory networks and pathway information to extract features and enhance accuracy in predicting survival risk. Our method achieved better accuracy compared with existing methods. Furthermore, key factors nonlinearly associated with the tumor pathogenesis are prioritized by employing two interpretation algorithms (i.e. GNN-Explainer and IGscore) for neural networks, at gene and pathway level, respectively. The top genes and pathways exhibit strong associations with disease in survival analyses, many of which such as SEC61G and CYP27B1 are previously reported in the literature.© The Author(s) 2024.

Here we use sheep as an animal model for low-to-high altitude translocation. We generate multi-omics data including whole-genome sequences, time-resolved bulk RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq and single-cell RNA-Seq from multiple tissues as well as phenotypic data from 20 bio-indicators. We characterize transcriptional changes of all genes in each tissue, and examine multi-tissue temporal dynamics and transcriptional interactions among genes. Particularly, we identify critical functional genes regulating the short response to hypoxia in each tissue (e.g., PARG in the cerebellum and HMOX1 in the colon). We further identify TAD-constrained cis-regulatory elements, which suppress the transcriptional activity of most genes under hypoxia. Phenotypic and transcriptional evidence indicate that antenatal hypoxia could improve hypoxia tolerance in offspring. Furthermore, we provide time-series expression data of candidate genes associated with human mountain sickness (e.g., BMPR2) and high-altitude adaptation (e.g., HIF1A).

In this review, we aim to synthesize the latest findings in this field to highlight: (1) the shifting understanding of the genomic localization of altered DNA methylation in response to acute and chronic aerobic and resistance exercise in skeletal muscle (e.g., promoter, gene bodies, enhancers, intergenic regions, un-annotated regions, and genome-wide methylation); (2) how these global/regional methylation changes relate to transcriptional activity following exercise; and (3) the factors (e.g., individual demographic or genetic features, dietary, training history, exercise parameters, local epigenetic characteristics, circulating hormones) demonstrated to alter both the pattern of DNA methylation after exercise, and the relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression. Finally, we discuss the changes in non-CpG methylation and 5-hydroxymethylation after exercise, as well as the importance of emerging single-cell analyses to future studies-areas of increasing focus in the field of epigenetics. We anticipate that this review will help generate a framework for clinicians and researchers to begin developing and testing exercise interventions designed to generate targeted changes in DNA methylation as part of a personalized exercise regimen.© 2024.

38622740,Treating sex and gender differences as a continuous variable can improve precision cancer treatments.,Biol Sex Differ,"The significant sex and gender differences that exist in cancer mechanisms, incidence, and survival, have yet to impact clinical practice. One barrier to translation is that cancer phenotypes cannot be segregated into distinct male versus female categories. Instead, within this convenient but contrived dichotomy, male and female cancer phenotypes are highly overlapping and vary between female- and male- skewed extremes. Thus, sex and gender-specific treatments are unrealistic, and our translational goal should be adaptation of treatment to the variable effects of sex and gender on targetable pathways.To overcome this obstacle, we profiled the similarities in 8370 transcriptomes of 26 different adult and 4 different pediatric cancer types. We calculated the posterior probabilities of predicting patient sex and gender based on the observed sexes of similar samples in this map of transcriptome similarity.Transcriptomic index (TI) values were derived from posterior probabilities and allowed us to identify poles with local enrichments for male or female transcriptomes. TI supported deconvolution of transcriptomes into measures of patient-specific activity in sex and gender-biased, targetable pathways. It identified sex and gender-skewed extremes in mechanistic phenotypes like cell cycle signaling and immunity, and precisely positioned each patient's whole transcriptome on an axis of continuously varying sex and gender phenotypes.Cancer type, patient sex and gender, and TI value provides a novel and patient- specific mechanistic identifier that can be used for realistic sex and gender-adaptations of precision cancer treatment planning.© 2024.

38712031,Circadian regulation of stereotypic chromatin conformations at enhancers.,bioRxiv,"Cooperation between the circadian transcription factor (TF) CLOCK:BMAL1 and other TFs atcis-regulatory elements (CREs) is critical to daily rhythms of transcription. Yet, the modalities of this cooperation are unclear. Here, we analyzed the co-binding of multiple TFs on single DNA molecules in mouse liver using single molecule footprinting (SMF). We found that SMF reads clustered in stereotypic chromatin states that reflect distinguishable organization of TFs and nucleosomes, and that were remarkably conserved between all samples. DNA protection at CLOCK:BMAL1 binding motif (E-box) varied between CREs, from E-boxes being solely bound by CLOCK:BMAL1 to situations where other TFs competed with CLOCK:BMAL1 for E-box binding. SMF also uncovered CLOCK:BMAL1 cooperative binding at E-boxes separated by 250 bp, which structurally altered the CLOCK:BMAL1-DNA interface. Importantly, we discovered multiple nucleosomes with E-boxes at entry/exit sites that were removed upon CLOCK:BMAL1 DNA binding, thereby promoting the formation of open chromatin states that facilitate DNA binding of other TFs and that were associated with rhythmic transcription. These results demonstrate the utility of SMF for studying how CLOCK:BMAL1 and other TFs regulate stereotypical chromatin states at CREs to promote transcription."
38576030,EpiDiP/NanoDiP: a versatile unsupervised machine learning edge computing platform for epigenomic tumour diagnostics.,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"DNA methylation analysis based on supervised machine learning algorithms with static reference data, allowing diagnostic tumour typing with unprecedented precision, has quickly become a new standard of care. Whereas genome-wide diagnostic methylation profiling is mostly performed on microarrays, an increasing number of institutions additionally employ nanopore sequencing as a faster alternative. In addition, methylation-specific parallel sequencing can generate methylation and genomic copy number data. Given these diverse approaches to methylation profiling, to date, there is no single tool that allows (1) classification and interpretation of microarray, nanopore and parallel sequencing data, (2) direct control of nanopore sequencers, and (3) the integration of microarray-based methylation reference data. Furthermore, no software capable of entirely running in routine diagnostic laboratory environments lacking high-performance computing and network infrastructure exists. To overcome these shortcomings, we present EpiDiP/NanoDiP as an open-source DNA methylation and copy number profiling suite, which has been benchmarked against an established supervised machine learning approach using in-house routine diagnostics data obtained between 2019 and 2021. Running locally on portable, cost- and energy-saving system-on-chip as well as gpGPU-augmented edge computing devices, NanoDiP works in offline mode, ensuring data privacy. It does not require the rigid training data annotation of supervised approaches. Furthermore, NanoDiP is the core of our public, free-of-charge EpiDiP web service which enables comparative methylation data analysis against an extensive reference data collection. We envision this versatile platform as a useful resource not only for neuropathologists and surgical pathologists but also for the tumour epigenetics research community. In daily diagnostic routine, analysis of native, unfixed biopsies by NanoDiP delivers molecular tumour classification in an intraoperative time frame.© 2024. The Author(s)."
38693266,3D genomic mapping reveals multifocality of human pancreatic precancers.,Nature,"Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanINs) are the most common precursors of pancreatic cancer, but their small size and inaccessibility in humans make them challenging to study1. Critically, the number, dimensions and connectivity of human PanINs remain largely unknown, precluding important insights into early cancer development. Here, we provide a microanatomical survey of human PanINs by analysing 46 large samples of grossly normal human pancreas with a machine-learning pipeline for quantitative 3D histological reconstruction at single-cell resolution. To elucidate genetic relationships between and within PanINs, we developed a workflow in which 3D modelling guides multi-region microdissection and targeted and whole-exome sequencing. From these samples, we calculated a mean burden of 13 PanINs per cm3and extrapolated that the normal intact adult pancreas harbours hundreds of PanINs, almost all with oncogenic KRAS hotspot mutations. We found that most PanINs originate as independent clones with distinct somatic mutation profiles. Some spatially continuous PanINs were found to contain multiple KRAS mutations; computational and in situ analyses demonstrated that different KRAS mutations localize to distinct cell subpopulations within these neoplasms, indicating their polyclonal origins. The extensive multifocality and genetic heterogeneity of PanINs raises important questions about mechanisms that drive precancer initiation and confer differential progression risk in the human pancreas. This detailed 3D genomic mapping of molecular alterations in human PanINs provides an empirical foundation for early detection and rational interception of pancreatic cancer.© 2024.

38538789,Single-cell multiplex chromatin and RNA interactions in ageing human brain.,Nature,"Dynamically organized chromatin complexes often involve multiplex chromatin interactions and sometimes chromatin-associated RNA1-3. Chromatin complex compositions change during cellular differentiation and ageing, and are expected to be highly heterogeneous among terminally differentiated single cells4-7. Here we introduce the multinucleic acid interaction mapping in single cells (MUSIC) technique for concurrent profiling of multiplex chromatin interactions, gene expression and RNA-chromatin associations within individual nuclei. When applied to 14 human frontal cortex samples from older donors, MUSIC delineated diverse cortical cell types and states. We observed that nuclei exhibiting fewer short-range chromatin interactions were correlated with both an 'older' transcriptomic signature and Alzheimer's disease pathology. Furthermore, the cell type exhibiting chromatin contacts between cis expression quantitative trait loci and a promoter tends to be that in which these cis expression quantitative trait loci specifically affect the expression of their target gene. In addition, female cortical cells exhibit highly heterogeneous interactions between XIST non-coding RNA and chromosome X, along with diverse spatial organizations of the X chromosomes. MUSIC presents a potent tool for exploration of chromatin architecture and transcription at cellular resolution in complex tissues.© 2024. The Author(s)."
38693260,Chromatin accessibility during human first-trimester neurodevelopment.,Nature,"The human brain develops through a tightly organized cascade of patterning events, induced by transcription factor expression and changes in chromatin accessibility. Although gene expression across the developing brain has been described at single-cell resolution1, similar atlases of chromatin accessibility have been primarily focused on the forebrain2-4. Here we describe chromatin accessibility and paired gene expression across the entire developing human brain during the first trimester (6-13 weeks after conception). We defined 135 clusters and used multiomic measurements to link candidate cis-regulatory elements to gene expression. The number of accessible regions increased both with age and along neuronal differentiation. Using a convolutional neural network, we identified putative functional transcription factor-binding sites in enhancers characterizing neuronal subtypes. We applied this model to cis-regulatory elements linked to ESRRB to elucidate its activation mechanism in the Purkinje cell lineage. Finally, by linking disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms to cis-regulatory elements, we validated putative pathogenic mechanisms in several diseases and identified midbrain-derived GABAergic neurons as being the most vulnerable to major depressive disorder-related mutations. Our findings provide a more detailed view of key gene regulatory mechanisms underlying the emergence of brain cell types during the first trimester and a comprehensive reference for future studies related to human neurodevelopment.© 2024.

38670415,Multi-omics data integration and drug screening of AML cancer using Generative Adversarial Network.,Methods,"In the era of precision medicine, accurate disease phenotype prediction for heterogeneous diseases, such as cancer, is emerging due to advanced technologies that link genotypes and phenotypes. However, it is difficult to integrate different types of biological data because they are so varied. In this study, we focused on predicting the traits of a blood cancer called Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) by combining different kinds of biological data. We used a recently developed method called Omics Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to better classify cancer outcomes. The primary advantages of a GAN include its ability to create synthetic data that is nearly indistinguishable from real data, its high flexibility, and its wide range of applications, including multi-omics data analysis. In addition, the GAN was effective at combining two types of biological data. We created synthetic datasets for gene activity and DNA methylation. Our method was more accurate in predicting disease traits than using the original data alone. The experimental results provided evidence that the creation of synthetic data through interacting multi-omics data analysis using GANs improves the overall prediction quality. Furthermore, we identified the top-ranked significant genes through statistical methods and pinpointed potential candidate drug agents through in-silico studies. The proposed drugs, also supported by other independent studies, might play a crucial role in the treatment of AML cancer.

38658765,"Single-cell analysis reveals context-dependent, cell-level selection of mtDNA.",Nature,"Heteroplasmy occurs when wild-type and mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecules co-exist in single cells1. Heteroplasmy levels change dynamically in development, disease and ageing2,3, but it is unclear whether these shifts are caused by selection or drift, and whether they occur at the level of cells or intracellularly. Here we investigate heteroplasmy dynamics in dividing cells by combining precise mtDNA base editing (DdCBE)4with a new method, SCI-LITE (single-cell combinatorial indexing leveraged to interrogate targeted expression), which tracks single-cell heteroplasmy with ultra-high throughput. We engineered cells to have synonymous or nonsynonymous complex I mtDNA mutations and found that cell populations in standard culture conditions purge nonsynonymous mtDNA variants, whereas synonymous variants are maintained. This suggests that selection dominates over simple drift in shaping population heteroplasmy. We simultaneously tracked single-cell mtDNA heteroplasmy and ancestry, and found that, although the population heteroplasmy shifts, the heteroplasmy of individual cell lineages remains stable, arguing that selection acts at the level of cell fitness in dividing cells. Using these insights, we show that we can force cells to accumulate high levels of truncating complex I mtDNA heteroplasmy by placing them in environments where loss of biochemical complex I activity has been reported to benefit cell fitness. We conclude that in dividing cells, a given nonsynonymous mtDNA heteroplasmy can be harmful, neutral or even beneficial to cell fitness, but that the 'sign' of the effect is wholly dependent on the environment.© 2024.

38585769,Proteome-wide association studies using summary proteomic data identified 23 risk genes of Alzheimer's disease.,medRxiv,"Characterizing the genetic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia is crucial for developing new therapeutics. Proteome-wide association study (PWAS) integrating proteomics data with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data was shown as a powerful tool for detecting risk genes. The identified PWAS risk genes can be interpretated as having genetic effects mediated through the genetically regulated protein abundances. Existing PWAS analyses of AD often rely on the availability of individual-level proteomics and genetics data of a reference cohort. Leveraging summary-level protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) reference data of multiple relevant tissues is expected to improve PWAS findings for studying AD. Here, we applied our recently developed OTTERS tool to conduct PWAS of AD dementia, by leveraging summary-level pQTL data of brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma tissues, and multiple statistical methods. For each target protein, imputation models of the protein abundance with genetic predictors were trained from summary-level pQTL data, estimating a set of pQTL weights for considered genetic predictors. PWAS p-values were obtained by integrating GWAS summary data of AD dementia with estimated pQTL weights. PWAS p-values from multiple statistical methods were combined by the aggregated Cauchy association test to yield one omnibus PWAS p-value for the target protein. We identified significant PWAS risk genes through omnibus PWAS p-values and analyzed their protein-protein interactions using STRING. Their potential causal effects were assessed by the probabilistic Mendelian randomization (PMR-Egger). As a result, we identified a total of 23 significant PWAS risk genes for AD dementia in brain, CSF, and plasma tissues, including 7 novel findings. We showed that 15 of these risk genes were interconnected within a protein-protein interaction network involving the well-known AD risk gene ofAPOEand 5 novel findings, and enriched in immune functions and lipids pathways including positive regulation of immune system process, positive regulation of macrophage proliferation, humoral immune response, and high-density lipoprotein particle clearance. Existing biological evidence was found to relate our novel findings with AD. We validated the mediated causal effects of 14 risk genes (60.8%). In conclusion, we identified both known and novel PWAS risk genes, providing novel insights into the genetic mechanisms in brain, CSF, and plasma tissues, and targeted therapeutics development of AD dementia. Our study also demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating public available summary-level pQTL data with GWAS summary data for mapping risk genes of complex human diseases."
38586026,The 24-Hour Time Course of Integrated Molecular Responses to Resistance Exercise in Human Skeletal Muscle Implicates MYC as a Hypertrophic Regulator That is Sufficient for Growth.,bioRxiv,"Molecular control of recovery after exercise in muscle is temporally dynamic. A time course of biopsies around resistance exercise (RE) combined with -omics is necessary to better comprehend the molecular contributions of skeletal muscle adaptation in humans. Vastus lateralis biopsies before and 30 minutes, 3-, 8-, and 24-hours after acute RE were collected. A time-point matched biopsy-only group was also included. RNA-sequencing defined the transcriptome while DNA methylomics and computational approaches complemented these data. The post-RE time course revealed: 1) DNA methylome responses at 30 minutes corresponded to upregulated genes at 3 hours, 2) a burst of translation- and transcription-initiation factor-coding transcripts occurred between 3 and 8 hours, 3) global gene expression peaked at 8 hours, 4) ribosome-related genes dominated the mRNA landscape between 8 and 24 hours, 5) methylation-regulatedMYCwas a highly influential transcription factor throughout the 24-hour recovery and played a primary role in ribosome-related mRNA levels between 8 and 24 hours. The influence of MYC in human muscle adaptation was strengthened by transcriptome information from acute MYC overexpression in mouse muscle. To test whether MYC was sufficient for hypertrophy, we generated a muscle fiber-specific doxycycline inducible model of pulsatile MYC induction. Periodic 48-hour pulses of MYC over 4 weeks resulted in higher muscle mass and fiber size in the soleus of adult female mice. Collectively, we present a temporally resolved resource for understanding molecular adaptations to RE in muscle and reveal MYC as a regulator of RE-induced mRNA levels and hypertrophy."
38608280,Proteome-wide association study and functional validation identify novel protein markers for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,Gigascience,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a lethal malignancy, largely due to the paucity of reliable biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic targeting. Existing blood protein biomarkers for PDAC often suffer from replicability issues, arising from inherent limitations such as unmeasured confounding factors in conventional epidemiologic study designs. To circumvent these limitations, we use genetic instruments to identify proteins with genetically predicted levels to be associated with PDAC risk. Leveraging genome and plasma proteome data from the INTERVAL study, we established and validated models to predict protein levels using genetic variants. By examining 8,275 PDAC cases and 6,723 controls, we identified 40 associated proteins, of which 16 are novel. Functionally validating these candidates by focusing on 2 selected novel protein-encoding genes, GOLM1 and B4GALT1, we demonstrated their pivotal roles in driving PDAC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, we also identified potential drug repurposing opportunities for treating PDAC.PDAC is a notoriously difficult-to-treat malignancy, and our limited understanding of causal protein markers hampers progress in developing effective early detection strategies and treatments. Our study identifies novel causal proteins using genetic instruments and subsequently functionally validates selected novel proteins. This dual approach enhances our understanding of PDAC etiology and potentially opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions.© The Author(s) 2024.

38720070,Mapping genotypes to chromatin accessibility profiles in single cells.,Nature,"In somatic tissue differentiation, chromatin accessibility changes govern priming and precursor commitment towards cellular fates1-3. Therefore, somatic mutations are likely to alter chromatin accessibility patterns, as they disrupt differentiation topologies leading to abnormal clonal outgrowth. However, defining the impact of somatic mutations on the epigenome in human samples is challenging due to admixed mutated and wild-type cells. Here, to chart how somatic mutations disrupt epigenetic landscapes in human clonal outgrowths, we developed genotyping of targeted loci with single-cell chromatin accessibility (GoT-ChA). This high-throughput platform links genotypes to chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution across thousands of cells within a single assay. We applied GoT-ChA to CD34+cells from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms with JAK2V617F-mutated haematopoiesis. Differential accessibility analysis between wild-type and JAK2V617F-mutant progenitors revealed both cell-intrinsic and cell-state-specific shifts within mutant haematopoietic precursors, including cell-intrinsic pro-inflammatory signatures in haematopoietic stem cells, and a distinct profibrotic inflammatory chromatin landscape in megakaryocytic progenitors. Integration of mitochondrial genome profiling and cell-surface protein expression measurement allowed expansion of genotyping onto DOGMA-seq through imputation, enabling single-cell capture of genotypes, chromatin accessibility, RNA expression and cell-surface protein expression. Collectively, we show that the JAK2V617Fmutation leads to epigenetic rewiring in a cell-intrinsic and cell type-specific manner, influencing inflammation states and differentiation trajectories. We envision that GoT-ChA will empower broad future investigations of the critical link between somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations across clonal populations in malignant and non-malignant contexts.© 2024.

38566104,Race-specific coregulatory and transcriptomic profiles associated with DNA methylation and androgen receptor in prostate cancer.,Genome Med,"Prostate cancer is a significant health concern, particularly among African American (AA) men who exhibit higher incidence and mortality compared to European American (EA) men. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these disparities is imperative for enhancing clinical management and achieving better outcomes.Employing a multi-omics approach, we analyzed prostate cancer in both AA and EA men. Using Illumina methylation arrays and RNA sequencing, we investigated DNA methylation and gene expression in tumor and non-tumor prostate tissues. Additionally, Boolean analysis was utilized to unravel complex networks contributing to racial disparities in prostate cancer.When comparing tumor and adjacent non-tumor prostate tissues, we found that DNA hypermethylated regions are enriched for PRC2/H3K27me3 pathways and EZH2/SUZ12 cofactors. Olfactory/ribosomal pathways and distinct cofactors, including CTCF and KMT2A, were enriched in DNA hypomethylated regions in prostate tumors from AA men. We identified race-specific inverse associations of DNA methylation with expression of several androgen receptor (AR) associated genes, including the GATA family of transcription factors and TRIM63. This suggests that race-specific dysregulation of the AR signaling pathway exists in prostate cancer. To investigate the effect of AR inhibition on race-specific gene expression changes, we generated in-silico patient-specific prostate cancer Boolean networks. Our simulations revealed prolonged AR inhibition causes significant dysregulation of TGF-β, IDH1, and cell cycle pathways specifically in AA prostate cancer. We further quantified global gene expression changes, which revealed differential expression of genes related to microtubules, immune function, and TMPRSS2-fusion pathways, specifically in prostate tumors of AA men. Enrichment of these pathways significantly correlated with an altered risk of disease progression in a race-specific manner.Our study reveals unique signaling networks underlying prostate cancer biology in AA and EA men, offering potential insights for clinical management strategies tailored to specific racial groups. Targeting AR and associated pathways could be particularly beneficial in addressing the disparities observed in prostate cancer outcomes in the context of AA and EA men. Further investigation into these identified pathways may lead to the development of personalized therapeutic approaches to improve outcomes for prostate cancer patients across different racial backgrounds.© 2024.

38540105,Supervised Parametric Learning in the Identification of Composite Biomarker Signatures of Type 1 Diabetes in Integrated Parallel Multi-Omics Datasets.,Biomedicines,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating autoimmune disease, and its rising prevalence in the United States and around the world presents a critical problem in public health. While some treatment options exist for patients already diagnosed, individuals considered at risk for developing T1D and who are still in the early stages of their disease pathogenesis without symptoms have no options for any preventive intervention. This is because of the uncertainty in determining their risk level and in predicting with high confidence who will progress, or not, to clinical diagnosis. Biomarkers that assess one's risk with high certainty could address this problem and will inform decisions on early intervention, especially in children where the burden of justifying treatment is high. Single omics approaches (e.g., genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) have been applied to identify T1D biomarkers based on specific disturbances in association with the disease. However, reliable early biomarkers of T1D have remained elusive to date. To overcome this, we previously showed that parallel multi-omics provides a more comprehensive picture of the disease-associated disturbances and facilitates the identification of candidate T1D biomarkers.This paper evaluated the use of machine learning (ML) using data augmentation and supervised ML methods for the purpose of improving the identification of salient patterns in the data and the ultimate extraction of novel biomarker candidates in integrated parallel multi-omics datasets from a limited number of samples. We also examined different stages of data integration (early, intermediate, and late) to assess at which stage supervised parametric models can learn under conditions of high dimensionality and variation in feature counts across different omics. In the late integration scheme, we employed a multi-view ensemble comprising individual parametric models trained over single omics to address the computational challenges posed by the high dimensionality and variation in feature counts across the different yet integrated multi-omics datasets.the multi-view ensemble improves the prediction of case vs. control and finds the most success in flagging a larger consistent set of associated features when compared with chance models, which may eventually be used downstream in identifying a novel composite biomarker signature of T1D risk.the current work demonstrates the utility of supervised ML in exploring integrated parallel multi-omics data in the ongoing quest for early T1D biomarkers, reinforcing the hope for identifying novel composite biomarker signatures of T1D risk via ML and ultimately informing early treatment decisions in the face of the escalating global incidence of this debilitating disease."
38600622,Epigenetic/circadian clocks and PCOS.,Hum Reprod,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 6-20% of reproductive-aged women. It is associated with increased risks of metabolic syndrome, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, mood disorders, endometrial cancer and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Although various susceptibility loci have been identified through genetic studies, they account for ∼10% of PCOS heritability. Therefore, the etiology of PCOS remains unclear. This review explores the role of epigenetic changes and modifications in circadian clock genes as potential contributors to PCOS pathogenesis. Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA changes, have been described in diseases related to PCOS, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity. Furthermore, several animal models have illustrated a link between prenatal exposure to androgens or anti-Müllerian hormone and PCOS-like phenotypes in subsequent generations, illustrating an epigenetic programming in PCOS. In humans, epigenetic changes have been reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), adipose tissue, granulosa cells (GC), and liver from women with PCOS. The genome of women with PCOS is globally hypomethylated compared to healthy controls. However, specific hypomethylated or hypermethylated genes have been reported in the different tissues of these women. They are mainly involved in hormonal regulation and inflammatory pathways, as well as lipid and glucose metabolism. Additionally, sleep disorders are present in women with PCOS and disruptions in clock genes' expression patterns have been observed in their PBMC or GCs. While epigenetic changes hold promise as diagnostic biomarkers, the current challenge lies in distinguishing whether these changes are causes or consequences of PCOS. Targeting epigenetic modifications potentially opens avenues for precision medicine in PCOS, including lifestyle interventions and drug therapies. However, data are still lacking in large cohorts of well-characterized PCOS phenotypes. In conclusion, understanding the interplay between genetics, epigenetics, and circadian rhythms may provide valuable insights for early diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in PCOS in the future.© The Author(s) 2024.

38509983,Identification of circadian rhythm-related gene classification patterns and immune infiltration analysis in heart failure based on machine learning.,Heliyon,"Circadian rhythms play a key role in the failing heart, but the exact molecular mechanisms linking changes in the expression of circadian rhythm-related genes to heart failure (HF) remain unclear.By intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal and HF samples in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with circadian rhythm-related genes (CRGs), differentially expressed circadian rhythm-related genes (DE-CRGs) were obtained. Machine learning algorithms were used to screen for feature genes, and diagnostic models were constructed based on these feature genes. Subsequently, consensus clustering algorithms and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms were used for clustering analysis of HF samples. On this basis, immune infiltration analysis was used to score the immune infiltration status between HF and normal samples as well as among different subclusters. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) evaluated the biological functional differences among subclusters.13 CRGs showed differential expression between HF patients and normal samples. Nine feature genes were obtained through cross-referencing results from four distinct machine learning algorithms. Multivariate LASSO regression and external dataset validation were performed to select five key genes with diagnostic value, including NAMPT, SERPINA3, MAPK10, NPPA, and SLC2A1. Moreover, consensus clustering analysis could divide HF patients into two distinct clusters, which exhibited different biological functions and immune characteristics. Additionally, two subgroups were distinguished using the NMF algorithm based on circadian rhythm associated differentially expressed genes. Studies on immune infiltration showed marked variances in levels of immune infiltration between these subgroups. Subgroup A had higher immune scores and more widespread immune infiltration. Finally, the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) method was utilized to discern the modules that had the closest association with the two observed subgroups, and hub genes were pinpointed via protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. GRIN2A, DLG1, ERBB4, LRRC7, and NRG1 were circadian rhythm-related hub genes closely associated with HF.This study provides valuable references for further elucidating the pathogenesis of HF and offers beneficial insights for targeting circadian rhythm mechanisms to regulate immune responses and energy metabolism in HF treatment. Five genes identified by us as diagnostic features could be potential targets for therapy for HF.© 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
38672654,"DNA Damage Responses in Tumors Are Not Proliferative Stimuli, but Rather They Are DNA Repair Actions Requiring Supportive Medical Care.",Cancers (Basel),"In tumors, somatic mutagenesis presumably drives the DNA damage response (DDR) via altered regulatory pathways, increasing genomic instability and proliferative activity. These considerations led to the standard therapeutic strategy against cancer: the disruption of mutation-activated DNA repair pathways of tumors.Justifying that cancer cells are not enemies to be killed, but rather that they are ill human cells which have the remnants of physiologic regulatory pathways.1. Genomic instability and cancer development may be originated from a flaw in estrogen signaling rather than excessive estrogen signaling; 2. Healthy cells with genomic instability exhibit somatic mutations, helping DNA restitution; 3. Somatic mutations in tumor cells aim for the restoration of DNA damage, rather than further genomic derangement; 4. In tumors, estrogen signaling drives the pathways of DNA stabilization, leading to apoptotic death; 5. In peritumoral cellular infiltration, the genomic damage of the tumor induces inflammatory cytokine secretion and increased estrogen synthesis. In the inflammatory cells, an increased growth factor receptor (GFR) signaling confers the unliganded activation of estrogen receptors (ERs); 6. In breast cancer cells responsive to genotoxic therapy, constitutive mutations help the upregulation of estrogen signaling and consequential apoptosis. In breast tumors non-responsive to genotoxic therapy, the possibilities for ER activation via either liganded or unliganded pathways are exhausted, leading to farther genomic instability and unrestrained proliferation.Understanding the real character and behavior of human tumors at the molecular level suggests that we should learn the genome repairing methods of tumors and follow them by supportive therapy, rather than provoking additional genomic damages."
38509377,Disease-associated astrocyte epigenetic memory promotes CNS pathology.,Nature,"Disease-associated astrocyte subsets contribute to the pathology of neurologic diseases, including multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis1-8(EAE), an experimental model for multiple sclerosis. However, little is known about the stability of these astrocyte subsets and their ability to integrate past stimulation events. Here we report the identification of an epigenetically controlled memory astrocyte subset that exhibits exacerbated pro-inflammatory responses upon rechallenge. Specifically, using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing, focused interrogation of cells by nucleic acid detection and sequencing, and cell-specific in vivo CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic perturbation studies we established that astrocyte memory is controlled by the metabolic enzyme ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), which produces acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) that is used by histone acetyltransferase p300 to control chromatin accessibility. The number of ACLY+p300+memory astrocytes is increased in acute and chronic EAE models, and their genetic inactivation ameliorated EAE. We also detected the pro-inflammatory memory phenotype in human astrocytes in vitro; single-cell RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry studies detected increased numbers of ACLY+p300+astrocytes in chronic multiple sclerosis lesions. In summary, these studies define an epigenetically controlled memory astrocyte subset that promotes CNS pathology in EAE and, potentially, multiple sclerosis. These findings may guide novel therapeutic approaches for multiple sclerosis and other neurologic diseases.© 2024. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
