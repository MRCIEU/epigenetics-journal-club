"33957080","Decoding dynamic epigenetic landscapes in human oocytes using single-cell multi-omics sequencing.","Cell Stem Cell","Developing female human germ cells undergo genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming, but de novo DNA methylation dynamics and their interplay with chromatin states and transcriptional activation in developing oocytes is poorly understood. Here, we developed a single-cell multi-omics sequencing method, scChaRM-seq, that enables simultaneous profiling of the DNA methylome, transcriptome, and chromatin accessibility in single human oocytes and ovarian somatic cells. We observed a global increase in DNA methylation during human oocyte growth that correlates with chromatin accessibility, whereas increases of DNA methylation at specific features were associated with active transcription. Integrated analyses of multi-omics data from humans and mice revealed species-specific gene expression, and promoter accessibility contributes to gene body methylation programs. Alu elements retained low DNA methylation levels and high accessibility in early growing oocytes and were located near developmental genes in humans and mice. Together, these findings show how scChaRM-seq can provide insight into DNA methylation pattern establishment.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"33956822","Comparative analysis reveals distinctive epigenetic features of the human cerebellum.","PLoS Genet","Identifying the molecular underpinnings of the neural specializations that underlie human cognitive and behavioral traits has long been of considerable interest. Much research on human-specific changes in gene expression and epigenetic marks has focused on the prefrontal cortex, a brain structure distinguished by its role in executive functions. The cerebellum shows expansion in great apes and is gaining increasing attention for its role in motor skills and cognitive processing, including language. However, relatively few molecular studies of the cerebellum in a comparative evolutionary context have been conducted. Here, we identify human-specific methylation in the lateral cerebellum relative to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in a comparative study with chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Specifically, we profiled genome-wide methylation levels in the three species for each of the two brain structures and identified human-specific differentially methylated genomic regions unique to each structure. We further identified which differentially methylated regions (DMRs) overlap likely regulatory elements and determined whether associated genes show corresponding species differences in gene expression. We found greater human-specific methylation in the cerebellum than the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with differentially methylated regions overlapping genes involved in several conditions or processes relevant to human neurobiology, including synaptic plasticity, lipid metabolism, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and neurodevelopment, including developmental disorders. Moreover, our results show some overlap with those of previous studies focused on the neocortex, indicating that such results may be common to multiple brain structures. These findings further our understanding of the cerebellum in human brain evolution."
"33956118","Substantial Heritable Variation in Recombination Rate on Multiple Scales in Honeybees and Bumblebees.","Genetics","Meiotic recombination shuffles genetic variation and promotes correct segregation of chromosomes. Rates of recombination vary on several scales, both within genomes and between individuals, and this variation is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Social insects have extremely high rates of recombination, although the evolutionary causes of this are not known. Here, we estimate rates of crossovers and gene conversions in 22 colonies of the honeybee, Apis mellifera, and 9 colonies of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, using direct sequencing of 299 haploid drone offspring. We confirm that both species have extremely elevated crossover rates, with higher rates measured in the highly eusocial honeybee than the primitively social bumblebee. There are also significant differences in recombination rate between subspecies of honeybee. There is substantial variation in genome-wide recombination rate between individuals of both A. mellifera and B. terrestris and the distribution of these rates overlap between species. A large proportion of interindividual variation in recombination rate is heritable, which indicates the presence of variation in trans-acting factors that influence recombination genome-wide. We infer that levels of crossover interference are significantly lower in honeybees compared to bumblebees, which may be one mechanism that contributes to higher recombination rates in honeybees. We also find a significant increase in recombination rate with distance from the centromere, mirrored by methylation differences. We detect a strong transmission bias due to GC-biased gene conversion associated with noncrossover gene conversions. Our results shed light on the mechanistic causes of extreme rates of recombination in social insects and the genetic architecture of recombination rate variation.© Genetics 2019."

Here, an H3K9-specific DIM5/KMT1 orthologue, which lacks a C-terminal post-SET domain and localizes mainly in nucleus, is reported to have both conserved and noncanonical roles in methylating the H3 core lysines inBeauveria bassiana, an insect-pathogenic fungus serving as a main source of wide-spectrum fungal insecticides. Disruption ofdim5led to abolishment of H3K9me3 and marked attenuation of H3K4me1/me2, H3K9me1/me2 and H3K36me2. Consequently, the Δdim5mutant lost the whole insect pathogenicity through normal cuticle infection, and was compromised severely in virulence through cuticle-bypassing infection (hemocoel injection) and also in a series of cellular events critical for the fungal virulence and lifecyclein vivoandin vitro, including reduced hyphal growth, blocked conidiation, impeded proliferationin vivo, altered carbohydrate epitopes, disturbed cell cycle, reduced biosynthesis and secretion of cuticle-degrading enzymes, and increased sensitivities to various stresses. Among 1,201 dysregulated genes (up/down ratio: 712:489) associated with those phenotypic changes, 92 (up/down ratio: 59:33) encode transcription factors and proteins or enzymes involved in posttranslational modifications, implying that the DIM5-methylated H3 core lysines could act as preferential marks of those transcription-active genes crucial for global gene regulation. These findings uncover a novel scenario of DIM5 and its indispensability for insect-pathogenic lifestyle and genome stability ofB. bassiana."

The plants of these Bravo teosinte accessions appear phenotypically normal themselves and the F1 plants appear similar to typical maize × teosinte F1s.

Once the sickly phenotype appears in a lineage, normal plants are never again recovered by continued backcrossing to the normal maize parent. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing reveals a small number of genomic sequences, some with homology to transposable elements, that have increased in copy number in the backcross populations. Transcriptome analysis of seedlings, which do not have striking phenotypic abnormalities, identified segments of 18 maize genes that exhibit increased expression in sickly plants. A de novo assembly of transcripts present in plants exhibiting the sickly phenotype identified a set of 59 upregulated novel transcripts.

"33945005","Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis and biochemical responses provide insights into the initial domestication of halophyte Puccinellia tenuiflora.","Plant Cell Rep","Puccinellia tenuiflora was domesticated for two years by growing it under non-saline conditions, providing epigenetic and biochemical insights into the initial domestication of extreme halophytes. Some halophytes have economic value as crop species. The domestication of halophytes may offer hope in solving the problem of soil salinization. We domesticated a wild halophyte, Puccinellia tenuiflora, for two years by growing it under non-saline conditions in a greenhouse and used re-sequencing, genome-wide DNA methylation, biochemical, and transcriptome analyses to uncover the mechanisms underlying alterations in the halophyte's tolerance to saline following domestication. Our results showed that non-saline domestication altered the methylation status for a number of genes and transposable elements, resulting in a much higher frequency of hypomethylation than hypermethylation. These modifications to DNA methylation were observed in many critical salinity-tolerance genes, particularly their promoter regions or transcriptional start sites. Twenty-nine potassium channel genes were hypomethylated and three were hypermethylated, suggesting that the DNA methylation status of potassium channel genes was influenced by domestication. The accelerated uptake of potassium is a major salinity tolerance characteristic of P. tenuiflora. We propose that modifications to the DNA methylation of potassium channel genes may be associated with the development of salinity tolerance in this species. By assessing whether non-saline domestication could change the salinity tolerance of P. tenuiflora, we demonstrated that non-saline domesticated plants are less tolerant to saline, which may be attributable to altered sucrose metabolism. DNA methylation and transposable elements may, therefore, be integrated into an environment-sensitive molecular engine that promotes the rapid domestication of P. tenuiflora to enable its use as a crop plant."

"33942597","Associations between Maternal Psychosocial Stress, DNA Methylation, and Newborn Birth Weight Identified by Investigating Methylation at Individual, Regional, and Genome Levels.","Hum Biol","Stress is known to affect health throughout life and into future generations, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that maternal psychosocial stress influences DNA methylation (DNAm), which in turn impacts newborn health outcomes. Specifically, we analyzed DNAm at individual, regional, and genome-wide levels to test for associations with maternal stress and newborn birth weight. Maternal venous blood and newborn cord blood (n= 24 and 22, respectively) were assayed for methylation at ∼450,000 CpG sites. Methylation was analyzed by examining CpG sites individually in an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), as regional groups using variably methylated region (VMR) analysis in maternal blood only, and through the epigenome-wide measures using genome-wide mean methylation (GMM), Horvath's epigenetic clock, and mitotic age. These methylation measures were tested for association with three measures of maternal stress (maternal war trauma, chronic stress, and experience of sexual violence) and one health outcome (newborn birth weight). We observed that maternal experiences of war trauma, chronic stress, and sexual assault were each associated with decreased newborn birth weight (p< 1.95 × 10-7in all cases). Testing individual CpG sites using EWAS, we observed no associations between DNAm and any measure of maternal stress or newborn birth weight in either maternal or cord blood, after Bonferroni multiple testing correction. However, the top-ranked CpG site in maternal blood that associated with maternal chronic stress and sexual violence before multiple testing correction is located near theSPON1gene. Testing at a regional level, we found increased methylation of a VMR in maternal blood nearSPON1that was associated with chronic stress and sexual violence after Bonferroni multiple testing correction (p= 1.95 × 10-7and 8.3 × 10-6, respectively). At the epigenomic level, cord blood GMM was associated with significantly higher levels of war trauma (p= 0.025) and was suggestively associated with sexual violence (p= 0.053). The other two epigenome-wide measures were not associated with maternal stress or newborn birth weight in either tissue type. Despite our small sample size, we identified associations even after conservative multiple testing correction. Specifically, we found associations between DNAm and the three measures of maternal stress across both tissues; specifically, a VMR in maternal blood and GMM in cord blood were both associated with different measures of maternal stress. The association of cord blood GMM, but not maternal blood GMM, with maternal stress may suggest different responses to stress in mother and newborn. It is noteworthy that we found associations only when CpG sites were analyzed in aggregate, either as VMRs or as a broad summary measure of GMM."

In this study, we investigated the potential utility of DNA methylation profiling to achieve molecular diagnosis in adult primary diffuse lower-grade glioma (dLGG) according to WHO 2016 classification system. We also evaluated whether methylation profiling could provide improved molecular characterization and identify prognostic differences beyond the classical histological WHO grade together with IDH mutation status and 1p/19q codeletion status. All patients diagnosed with dLGG in the period 2007-2016 from the Västra Götaland region in Sweden were assessed for inclusion in the study.A total of 166 dLGG cases were subjected for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis. Of these, 126 (76%) were assigned a defined diagnostic methylation class with a class prediction score ≥ 0.84 and subclass score ≥ 0.50. The assigned methylation classes were highly associated with their IDH mutation status and 1p/19q codeletion status. IDH-wildtype gliomas were further divided into subgroups with distinct molecular features.The stratification of the patients by methylation profiling was as effective as the integrated WHO 2016 molecular reclassification at predicting the clinical outcome of the patients. Our study shows that DNA methylation profiling is a reliable and robust approach for the classification of dLGG into molecular defined subgroups, providing accurate detection of molecular markers according to WHO 2016 classification."

Pb exposure influences the epigenome with documented effects on DNA methylation (DNAm). We assessed the impact of low levels of Pb exposure on DNAm among non-miner individuals from two locations in Peru: Lima, the capital, and Cerro de Pasco, a highland mining town, to study the effects of Pb exposure on physiological outcomes and DNAm.Pb levels were measured in whole blood (n = 305). Blood leukocyte DNAm was determined for 90 DNA samples using the Illumina MethylationEPIC chip. An epigenome-wide association study was performed to assess the relationship between Pb and DNAm.Individuals from Cerro de Pasco had higher Pb than individuals from Lima (p-value = 2.00E-16). Males had higher Pb than females (p-value = 2.36E-04). Pb was positively associated with hemoglobin (p-value = 8.60E-04). In Cerro de Pasco, blood Pb decreased with the distance from the mine (p-value = 0.04), and association with soil Pb was approaching significance (p-value = 0.08). We identified differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with genes SOX18, ZMIZ1, and KDM1A linked to neurological function. We also found 45 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), seven of which were associated with genes involved in metal ion binding and nine to neurological function and development.Our results demonstrate that even low levels of Pb can have a significant impact on the body including changes to DNAm. We report associations between Pb and hemoglobin, Pb and distance from mining, and between blood and soil Pb. We also report associations between loci- and region-specific DNAm and Pb.Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
"33940186","In silico development and clinical validation of novel 8 gene signature based on lipid metabolism related genes in colon adenocarcinoma.","Pharmacol Res","Changes in lipid metabolism pathways play a major role in colon carcinogenesis and development. Hence, we conducted a systematic analysis of lipid metabolism-related genes to explore new markers that predict the prognosis of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD).The non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm was applied to identify the molecular subtypes based on lipid metabolism-related genes. A weighted correlation network analysis (WCGNA) was used to identify co-expressed genes, and Lasso multivariate Cox analysis was performed to build a risk prognosis model. A timer database was used to analyze the immune infiltration of the gene signature and the GSCALite database was used for genome-wide analysis of the gene signature.TCGA-COAD samples were divided into 3 subtypes based on lipid metabolism-related genes. 2739 genes were identified by WGCNA analysis. Finally, an 8-gene signature (RTN2, FYN, HEYL, FAM69A, FBXL5, HMGN2, LGALS4, STOX1) was constructed that demonstrated good robustness in different datasets, as well as an independent risk factor for colon cancer patients' prognosis. In addition, our model's predictive efficacy overall was higher than that of the other published models, and the 8 genes' expression analysis indicated that RTN2, HEYL, and STOX1 were all expressed highly significantly in COAD, while FAM69A, FBXL5, LGALS4, FYN and HMGN2 were expressed significantly poorly in cancer tissues, which was confirmed in immunohistochemistry. The 8 genes were expressed significantly differently in COAD immune subtypes and correlated with clinical variables. Genome-wide analysis revealed that the STOX1 mutation frequency was the highest, and genome methylation influenced HEYL, FAM69A, and STOX1 gene expression significantly; further, the expression of HEYL and FBXL5 was correlated positively with Copy number variation (CNV) and was regulated significantly by CNV in most cancers. FBXL5 was correlated significantly with austocystin d and bafilomycin and played an important role in anti-tumor and immunotherapy. The HEYL, FYN, FAM69A, and RTN2 genes' expression was associated with the EMT pathway's activation, while LGALS4 and STOX1 were associated significantly with the EMT pathway's inhibition.This study constructed an 8-gene signature as a novel marker to predict colon cancer patients' survival.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of DNA methylation in the relationship between BMI and NSCLC.We carried out a genome-wide DNA methylation study of BMI in peripheral blood among 2266 Chinese participants by using Illumina Methylation arrays. For the BMI-related DNA methylation changes, their associations with NSCLC risk were further analyzed and their mediation effects on BMI-NSCLC association were also evaluated.The methylation levels of four CpGs (cg12593793, cg17061862, cg11024682, and cg06500161, annotated to LMNA, ZNF143, SREBF1, and ABCG1, respectively) were found to be significantly associated with BMI. Methylation levels of cg12593793, cg11024682, and cg06500161 were observed to be inversely associated with NSCLC risk [OR (95%CI) =0.22 (0.16, 0.31), 0.39 (0.30, 0.50), and 0.66 (0.53, 0.82), respectively]. Additionally, cg11024682 in SREBF1 and cg06500161 in ABCG1 mediated 45.3% and 19.5% of the association between BMI and decreased NSCLC risk, respectively.In this study, we identified four DNA methylation sites associated with BMI in the Chinese populations at the genome-wide significant level. We also found that the BMI-related methylations of SREBF1 and ABCG1 could mediate about a quintile-to-half of the effect of BMI on reduced NSCLC risk, which adds a potential mechanism underlying this association.© 2021 The Authors.

"33938942","Molecular analysis of the erythroid phenotype of a patient with BCL11A haploinsufficiency.","Blood Adv","The BCL11A gene encodes a transcriptional repressor with essential functions in multiple tissues during human development. Haploinsufficiency for BCL11A causes Dias-Logan syndrome (OMIM 617101), an intellectual developmental disorder with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH). Due to the severe phenotype, disease-causing variants in BCL11A occur de novo. We describe a patient with a de novo heterozygous variant, c.1453G>T, in the BCL11A gene, resulting in truncation of the BCL11A-XL protein (p.Glu485X). The truncated protein lacks the 3 C-terminal DNA-binding zinc fingers and the nuclear localization signal, rendering it inactive. The patient displayed high fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels (12.1-18.7% of total hemoglobin), in contrast to the parents who had HbF levels of 0.3%. We used cultures of patient-derived erythroid progenitors to determine changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. In addition, we investigated DNA methylation of the promoters of the γ-globin genes HBG1 and HBG2. HUDEP1 and HUDEP2 cells were used as models for fetal and adult human erythropoiesis, respectively. Similar to HUDEP1 cells, the patient's cells displayed Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) peaks at the HBG1/2 promoters and significant expression of HBG1/2 genes. In contrast, HBG1/2 promoter methylation and genome-wide gene expression profiling were consistent with normal adult erythropoiesis. We conclude that HPFH is the major erythroid phenotype of constitutive BCL11A haploinsufficiency. Given the essential functions of BCL11A in other hematopoietic lineages and the neuronal system, erythroid-specific targeting of the BCL11A gene has been proposed for reactivation of γ-globin expression in β-hemoglobinopathy patients. Our data strongly support this approach.© 2021 by The American Society of Hematology."
"33938728","Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Alterations and Potential Risk Induced by Subacute and Subchronic Exposure to Food-Grade Nanosilica in Mice.","ACS Nano","The intensive application of nanomaterials in the food industry has raised concerns about their potential risks to human health. However, limited data are available on the biological safety of nanomaterials in food, especially at the epigenetic level. This study examined the implications of two types of synthetic amorphous silica (SAS), food-grade precipitated silica (S200) and fumed silica Aerosil 200F (A200F), which are nanorange food additives. After 28-day continuous and intermittent subacute exposure to these SAS via diet, whole-genome methylation levels in mouse peripheral leukocytes and liver were significantly altered in a dose- and SAS type-dependent manner, with minimal toxicity detected by conventional toxicological assessments, especially at a human-relevant dose (HRD). The 84-day continuous subchronic exposure to all doses of S200 and A200F induced liver steatosis where S200 accumulated in the liver even at HRD. Genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing revealed that the differentially methylated regions induced by both SAS were mainly located in the intron, intergenic, and promoter regions after 84-day high-dose continuous exposure. Bioinformatics analysis of differentially methylated genes indicated that exposure to S200 or A200F may lead to lipid metabolism disorders and cancer development. Pathway validation experiments indicated both SAS types as potentially carcinogenic. While S200 inhibited the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway in mouse liver, A200F activated the HRAS-mediated MAPK signaling pathway, which is a key driver of hepatocarcinogenesis. Thus, caution must be paid to the risk of long-term exposure to food-grade SAS, and epigenetic parameters should be included as end points during the risk assessment of food-grade nanomaterials."
"33935932","An Epigenetically Distinct Subset of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder Resulting From Differences in Blood Cell Composition.","Front Neurol","Background:Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that often involves impaired cognition, communication difficulties and restrictive, repetitive behaviors. ASD is extremely heterogeneous both clinically and etiologically, which represents one of the greatest challenges in studying the molecular underpinnings of ASD. While hundreds of ASD-associated genes have been identified that confer varying degrees of risk, no single gene variant accounts for >1% of ASD cases. Notably, a large number of ASD-risk genes function as epigenetic regulators, indicating potential epigenetic dysregulation in ASD. As such, we compared genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) in the blood of children with ASD (n= 265) to samples from age- and sex-matched, neurotypical controls (n= 122) using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 arrays.Results:While DNAm patterns did not distinctly separate ASD cases from controls, our analysis identified an epigenetically unique subset of ASD cases (n= 32); these individuals exhibited significant differential methylation from both controls than the remaining ASD cases. The CpG sites at which this subset was differentially methylated mapped to known ASD risk genes that encode proteins of the nervous and immune systems. Moreover, the observed DNAm differences were attributable to altered blood cell composition, i.e., lower granulocyte proportion and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio in the ASD subset, as compared to the remaining ASD cases and controls. This ASD subset did not differ from the rest of the ASD cases in the frequency or type of high-risk genomic variants.Conclusion:Within our ASD cohort, we identified a subset of individuals that exhibit differential methylation from both controls and the remaining ASD group tightly associated with shifts in immune cell type proportions. This is an important feature that should be assessed in all epigenetic studies of blood cells in ASD. This finding also builds on past reports of changes in the immune systems of children with ASD, supporting the potential role of altered immunological mechanisms in the complex pathophysiology of ASD. The discovery of significant molecular and immunological features in subgroups of individuals with ASD may allow clinicians to better stratify patients, facilitating personalized interventions and improved outcomes.Copyright © 2021 Jangjoo, Goodman, Choufani, Trost, Scherer, Kelley, Ayub, Nicolson, Georgiades, Crosbie, Schachar, Anagnostou, Grunebaum and Weksberg."

Here, in this epigenetic analysis we preliminarily determine whether the same CpG sites identified in T2D also apply to type 1 diabetes (T1D). We then determine whether BCG vaccination could correct the abnormal methylation patterns, considering that the two diseases share metabolic derangements.T1D (n = 13) and control (n = 8) subjects were studied at baseline and then T1D subjects studied yearly for 3 years after receiving BCG vaccinations in a clinical trial. In this biomarker analysis, methylation patterns were evaluated on CD4+ T-lymphocytes from baseline and yearly blood samples using the human Illumina Methylation EPIC Bead Chip. Methylation analysis combined with mRNA analysis using RNAseq.Broad but not complete overlap was observed between T1D and T2D in CpG sites with abnormal methylation. And in the three-year observation period after BCG vaccinations, the majority of the abnormal methylation sites were corrected in vivo. Genes of particular interest were related to oxidative phosphorylation (CPT1A, LETM1, ABCG1), to the histone lysine demethylase gene (KDM2B), and mTOR signaling through the DDIT4 gene. The highlighted CpG sites for both KDM2B and DDIT4 genes were hypomethylated at baseline compared to controls; BCG vaccination corrected the defect by hypermethylation.Glycolysis is regulated by methylation of genes. This study unexpectedly identified both KDM2B and DDIT4 as genes controlling BCG-driven re-methylation of histones, and the activation of the mTOR pathway for facilitated glucose transport respectively. The BCG effect at the gene level was confirmed by reciprocal mRNA changes. The DDIT4 gene with known inhibitory role of mTOR was re-methylated after BCG, a step likely to allow improved glucose transport. BCGs driven methylation of KDM2B's site should halt augmented histone activity, a step known to allow cytokine activation and increased glycolysis.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Methylation quantitative trait loci, or meQTLs, allow for the exploration of biological mechanisms that underlie complex human phenotypes, with potential insights for human disease onset and progression. In this review, we summarize recent milestones in characterizing the human genetic basis of DNA methylation variation over the last decade, including heritability findings and genome-wide identification of meQTLs. We also discuss challenges in this field and future areas of research geared to generate insights into molecular processes underlying human complex traits."
"33931109","Epigenome-wide association study of kidney function identifies trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific loci.","Genome Med","DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with gene regulation and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function. Decreased eGFR is more common among US Hispanics and African Americans. The causes for this are poorly understood. We aimed to identify trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with eGFR using an agnostic, genome-wide approach.The study included up to 5428 participants from multi-ethnic studies for discovery and 8109 participants for replication. We tested the associations between whole blood DNAm and eGFR using beta values from Illumina 450K or EPIC arrays. Ethnicity-stratified analyses were performed using linear mixed models adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and study-specific and technical variables. Summary results were meta-analyzed within and across ethnicities. Findings were assessed using integrative epigenomics methods and pathway analyses.We identified 93 DMPs associated with eGFR at an FDR of 0.05 and replicated 13 and 1 DMPs across independent samples in trans-ethnic and African American meta-analyses, respectively. The study also validated 6 previously published DMPs. Identified DMPs showed significant overlap enrichment with DNase I hypersensitive sites in kidney tissue, sites associated with the expression of proximal genes, and transcription factor motifs and pathways associated with kidney tissue and kidney development.We uncovered trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific DMPs associated with eGFR, including DMPs enriched in regulatory elements in kidney tissue and pathways related to kidney development. These findings shed light on epigenetic mechanisms associated with kidney function, bridging the gap between population-specific eGFR-associated DNAm and tissue-specific regulatory context."
"33930773","Environmental enrichment during early rearing provokes epigenetic changes in the brain of a salmonid fish.","Comp Biochem Physiol Part D Genomics Proteomics","Environmental enrichment is used to increase structural complexity of captive rearing systems and has been shown to provoke a wide range of effects in the kept animals. Here we studied the effects of enrichment on DNA methylation patterns at the whole-genome level in the brain of rainbow trout reared in an aquaculture setting. We investigated the epigenetic effects between different types of enrichment (natural substrate vs. artificial substrate vs. barren) in three developmental stages (egg vs. alevin vs. fry) and as enrichment was discontinued at the fingerling stage by means of the Methylation-Sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) technique. While enrichment did not affect growth in body size, we found enrichment to affected global DNA methylation in the brain at the egg and alevin stage, i.e., the period during development where the animals are in close physical contact with the substrate. At these stages, trout reared on the two substrates differed more from the control than the substrates differed from each other. Only minor differences between rearing environments were detected following emergence at the fry stage. When enrichment was discontinued during the rearing of fingerlings, no differences in DNA methylation patterns were observed between the rearing environments. Our results provide further evidence on the effects of enrichment in the captive rearing of fish and show that enrichment can even modulate epigenetic patterns. The effect on the epigenome may be causal for the previously reported effects of enrichment on gene expression, behaviour and brain development.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

IBD-associated CRC (IBD-CRC) may represent a distinct pathway of tumorigenesis compared to sporadic CRC (sCRC). Our aim was to comprehensively characterize IBD-associated tumorigenesis integrating multiple high-throughput approaches, and to compare the results with in-house data sets from sCRCs.Whole-genome sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, RNA sequencing, genome-wide methylation analysis, and immunohistochemistry were performed using fresh frozen and formalin-fixed tissue samples of tumor and corresponding normal tissues from 31 IBD-CRC patients.Transcriptome-based tumor subtyping revealed the complete absence of canonical epithelial tumor subtype associated with WNT signaling in IBD-CRCs, dominated instead by mesenchymal stroma-rich subtype. Negative WNT regulators AXIN2 and RNF43 were strongly downregulated in IBD-CRCs and chromosomal gains at HNF4A, a negative regulator of WNT-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), were less frequent compared to sCRCs. Enrichment of hypomethylation at HNF4α binding sites was detected solely in sCRC genomes. PIGR and OSMR involved in mucosal immunity were dysregulated via epigenetic modifications in IBD-CRCs. Genome-wide analysis showed significant enrichment of noncoding mutations to 5'UTR of TP53 in IBD-CRCs. As previously reported, somatic mutations in APC and KRAS were less frequent in IBD-CRCs compared to sCRCs.Distinct mechanisms of WNT pathway dysregulation skew IBD-CRCs towards mesenchymal tumor subtype, which may affect prognosis and treatment options. Increased OSMR signaling may favor the establishment of mesenchymal tumors in IBD patients.Copyright © 2021 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"33926513","Estimands in epigenome-wide association studies.","Clin Epigenetics","In DNA methylation analyses like epigenome-wide association studies, effects in differentially methylated CpG sites are assessed. Two kinds of outcomes can be used for statistical analysis: Beta-values and M-values. M-values follow a normal distribution and help to detect differentially methylated CpG sites. As biological effect measures, differences of M-values are more or less meaningless. Beta-values are of more interest since they can be interpreted directly as differences in percentage of DNA methylation at a given CpG site, but they have poor statistical properties. Different frameworks are proposed for reporting estimands in DNA methylation analysis, relying on Beta-values, M-values, or both.We present and discuss four possible approaches of achieving estimands in DNA methylation analysis. In addition, we present the usage of M-values or Beta-values in the context of bioinformatical pipelines, which often demand a predefined outcome. We show the dependencies between the differences in M-values to differences in Beta-values in two data simulations: a analysis with and without confounder effect. Without present confounder effects, M-values can be used for the statistical analysis and Beta-values statistics for the reporting. If confounder effects exist, we demonstrate the deviations and correct the effects by the intercept method. Finally, we demonstrate the theoretical problem on two large human genome-wide DNA methylation datasets to verify the results.The usage of M-values in the analysis of DNA methylation data will produce effect estimates, which cannot be biologically interpreted. The parallel usage of Beta-value statistics ignores possible confounder effects and can therefore not be recommended. Hence, if the differences in Beta-values are the focus of the study, the intercept method is recommendable. Hyper- or hypomethylated CpG sites must then be carefully evaluated. If an exploratory analysis of possible CpG sites is the aim of the study, M-values can be used for inference."
"33926387","Genome-wide identification and transcriptional characterization of DNA methyltransferases conferring temperature-sensitive male sterility in wheat.","BMC Genomics","DNA methyltransferase (DMT) genes contribute to plant stress responses and development by de novo establishment and subsequent maintenance of DNA methylation during replication. The photoperiod and/or temperature-sensitive genic male sterile (P/TGMS) lines play an important role in hybrid seed production of wheat. However, only a few studies have reported on the effect of DMT genes on temperature-sensitive male sterility of wheat. Although DMT genes have been investigated in some plant species, the identification and analysis of DMT genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) based on genome-wide levels have not been reported.In this study, a detailed overview of phylogeny of 52 wheat DMT (TaDMT) genes was presented. Homoeolog retention for TaDMT genes was significantly above the average retention rate for whole-wheat genes, indicating the functional importance of many DMT homoeologs. We found that the strikingly high number of TaDMT genes resulted mainly from the significant expansion of the TaDRM subfamily. Intriguingly, all 5 paralogs belonged to the wheat DRM subfamily, and we speculated that tandem duplications might play a crucial role in the TaDRM subfamily expansion. Through the transcriptional analysis of TaDMT genes in a TGMS line BS366 and its hybrids with the other six fertile lines under sterile and fertile conditions, we concluded that TaCMT-D2, TaMET1-B1, and TaDRM-U6 might be involved in male sterility in BS366. Furthermore, a correlation analysis showed that TaMET1-B1 might negatively regulate the expression of TaRAFTIN1A, an important gene for pollen development, so we speculated regarding an epigenetic regulatory mechanism underlying the male sterility of BS366 via the interaction between TaMET1-B1 and TaRAFTIN1A.Our findings presented a detailed phylogenic overview of the DMT genes and could provide novel insights into the effects of DMT genes on TGMS wheat."
"33926354","Prenatal medication exposure and epigenetic outcomes: a systematic literature review and recommendations for prenatal pharmacoepigenetic studies.","Epigenetics","When used during pregnancy, analgesics and psychotropics pass the placenta to enter the foetal circulation and may induce epigenetic modifications. Where such modifications occur and whether they disrupt normal foetal developme nt, are currently unanswered questions. This field of prenatal pharmacoepigenetics has received increasing attention, with several studies reporting associations betweenin uteromedication exposure and offspring epigenetic outcomes. Nevertheless, no recent systematic review of the literature is available. Therefore, the objectives of this review were to (i) provide an overview of the literature on the association of prenatal exposure to psychotropics a nd analgesics with epigenetic outcomes, and (ii) suggest recommendations for future studies within prenatal pharmacoepigenetics. We performed systematic literature searches in five databases. The eligible studies assessed human prenatal exposure to psychotropics or analgesics, with epigenetic analyses of offspring tissue as an outcome. We identified 18 eligible studies including 4,419 neonates exposed to either antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, or methadone. The epigenetic outcome in all studies was DNA methylation in cord blood, placental tissue or buccal cells. Although most studies found significant differences in DNA methylation upon medication exposure, almost no differences were persistent across studies for similar medications and sequencing methods. The reviewed studies were challenging to compare due to poor transparency in reporting, and heterogeneous methodology, design, genome coverage, and statistical modelling. We propose 10 recommendations for future prenatal pharmacoepigenetic studies considering both epidemiological and epigenetic perspectives. These recommendations may improve the quality, comparability, and clinical relevance of such studies. PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42020166675."

Epigenetics is a conjunct of mechanisms (like DNA methylation) that regulate gene expression, which are dependent on environmental changes. Analysis of DNA methylation in eating disorders shows that it is reduced. The present study aimed to analyze the genome-wide DNA methylation differences between individuals diagnosed with BED and BN. A total of 46 individuals were analyzed using the Infinium Methylation EPIC array. We found 11 differentially methylated sites between BED- and BN-diagnosed individuals, with genome-wide significance. Most of the associations were found in genes related to metabolic processes (ST3GAL4, PRKAG2,andFRK), which are hypomethylated genes in BED. Cg04781532, located in the body of thePRKAG2gene (protein kinase AMP-activated non-catalytic subunit gamma 2), was hypomethylated in individuals with BED. Agonists of PRKAG2, which is the subunit of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), are proposed to treat obesity, BED, and BN. The present study contributes important insights into the effect that BED could have onPRKAG2activation."

"33920410","Genome-Wide Methylation Mapping Using Nanopore Sequencing Technology Identifies Novel Tumor Suppressor Genes in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.","Int J Mol Sci","Downregulation of multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) plays an important role in cancer formation. Recent evidence has accumulated that cancer progression involves genome-wide alteration of epigenetic modifications, which may cause downregulation of the tumor suppressor gene. Using hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a system, we mapped 5-methylcytosine signal at a genome-wide scale using nanopore sequencing technology to identify novel TSGs. Integration of methylation data with gene transcription profile of regenerated liver and primary HCCs allowed us to identify 10 potential tumor suppressor gene candidates. Subsequent validation led us to focus on functionally characterizing one candidate-glucokinase (GCK). We show here that overexpression of GCK inhibits the proliferation of HCC cells via induction of intracellular lactate accumulation and subsequently causes energy crisis due to NAD+ depletion. This suggests GCK functions as a tumor suppressor gene and may be involved in HCC development. In conclusion, these data provide valuable clues for further investigations of the process of tumorigenesis in human cancer."

The incidence of OPSCC has been increasing and surpassed the number of cervical cancer cases in the United States. Although HPV-associated OPSCC has a relatively better prognosis than HPV-negative cancer, approximately 20% of HPV-associated HNSCC patients show a poor prognosis or therapeutic response, and the molecular mechanism behind this outcome in the intermediate-risk group is yet to be elucidated. These biological differences between HPV-associated HNSCC and HPV-negative HNSCC are partly explained by the differences in mutation patterns. However, recent reports have revealed that epigenetic dysregulation, such as dysregulated DNA methylation, is a strikingly common pathological feature of human malignancy. Notably, viral infections can induce aberrant DNA methylation, leading to carcinogenesis, and HPV-associated HNSCC cases tend to harbor a higher amount of aberrantly methylated DNA than HPV-negative HNSCC cases. Furthermore, recent comprehensive genome-wide DNA-methylation analyses with large cohorts have revealed that a sub-group of HPV-associated HNSCC correlates with increased DNA methylation. Accordingly, in this review, we provide an overview of the relationship between DNA methylation and HPV-associated HNSCC."

The causes of IHC are heterogeneous, and the genetic etiologies are not fully understood. This study aimed to analyze the genetic etiologies of an IHC cohort.The data for 110 IHC patients who had received exome sequencing at the Clinical Genetic Center of the Children's Hospital of Fudan University between 2016 and 2019 were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively. An exome-wide association analysis (EWAS) was performed within this cohort using IHC as the study phenotype.Of the 110 IHC patients, a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was identified in 16 (15%) patients, spanning 13 genes. The genes were mainly associated with metabolic disorders, brain abnormalities, and genetic syndromes. IHC patients who had unclear clinical etiology were more likely to possess a genetic etiology. Based on previous studies and on our EWAS results, ZEB1, SBF2, and GNAI2 were over-represented among IHC patients and might affect the signaling pathways involved in IHC formation.Our study showed heterogeneous genetic etiologies in an IHC cohort. It is essential to perform genetic testing on IHC patients who have unclear clinical etiology, and genes associated with metabolic disorders, brain abnormalities, and genetic syndromes should be noted. In addition, when aiming to discover IHC susceptibility genes, genes that might influence the signaling pathways involved in IHC formation should be prioritized."

The presence of necrosis and/or microvascular proliferation was scored at central pathology review. Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip arrays were used for genome-wide DNA methylation analysis and the determination of copy number variations (CNV). Two DNA methylation-based tumour classifiers were used for risk stratification. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed using one of two glioma-tailored NGS panels. The primary endpoint was overall survival measured from date of randomization.Full analysis (genome-wide DNA methylation and NGS) was successfully performed on 654 tumours. Of these, 432 tumours were IDH1/2mt anaplastic astrocytomas. Both epigenetic classifiers identified poor prognosis patients that partially overlapped. A predictive prognostic Cox proportional hazards model identified that independent prognostic factors for IDH1/2mt anaplastic astrocytoma patients included; age, mini-mental state examination score, treatment with concurrent and/or adjuvant temozolomide, the epigenetic classifiers, PDGFRA amplification, CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion, PI3K mutations and total CNV load. Independent recursive partitioning analysis highlights the importance of these factors for patient prognostication.Both clinical and molecular factors identify IDH1/2mt anaplastic astrocytoma patients with worse outcome.

"33913170","Genetic and epigenetic regulation of skeletal muscle ribosome biogenesis with exercise.","J Physiol","Ribosome biogenesis and MYC transcription are associated with acute resistance exercise (RE) and are distinct from endurance exercise (EE) in human skeletal muscle throughout a 24-hour time-course of recovery. A PCR-based method for relative ribosomal DNA (rDNA) copy number estimation was validated by whole genome sequencing and revealed that rDNA dosage is positively correlated with ribosome biogenesis in response to RE. Acute RE modifies rDNA methylation patterns in enhancer, intergenic spacer, and non-canonical MYC-associated regions, but not the promoter. Myonuclear-specific rDNA methylation patterns with acute mechanical overload in mice corroborate and expand on rDNA findings with RE in humans. A genetic predisposition for hypertrophic responsiveness may exist based on rDNA gene dosage.Ribosomes are the macromolecular engines of protein synthesis. Skeletal muscle ribosome biogenesis is stimulated by exercise, but the contribution of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) copy number and methylation to exercise-induced rDNA transcription is unclear. To investigate the genetic and epigenetic regulation of ribosome biogenesis with exercise, a time-course of skeletal muscle biopsies was obtained from 30 participants (18 men and 12 women; 31±8 yrs, 25±4 kg/m2) at rest and 30 min, 3h, 8h, and 24h after acute endurance (n = 10, 45 min cycling, 70% VO2max) or resistance exercise (n = 10, 4×7×2 exercises); 10 control participants underwent biopsies without exercise. rDNA transcription and dosage were assessed using qPCR and whole genome sequencing. rDNA promoter methylation was investigated using massARRAY EpiTYPER, and global rDNA CpG methylation was assessed using reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing. Ribosome biogenesis and MYC transcription were associated primarily with resistance but not endurance exercise, indicating preferential upregulation during hypertrophic processes. With resistance exercise, ribosome biogenesis was associated with rDNA gene dosage as well as epigenetic changes in enhancer and non-canonical MYC-associated areas in rDNA, but not the promoter. A mouse model of in vivo metabolic RNA labeling and genetic myonuclear fluorescent labeling validated the effects of an acute hypertrophic stimulus on ribosome biogenesis and Myc transcription, and corroborated rDNA enhancer and Myc-associated methylation alterations specifically in myonuclei. This study provides the first information on skeletal muscle genetic and rDNA gene-wide epigenetic regulation of ribosome biogenesis in response to exercise, revealing novel roles for rDNA dosage and CpG methylation.

"33911866","Exploring the Hereditary Nature of Migraine.","Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat","Migraine is a common neurological disorder which affects 15-20% of the population; it has a high socioeconomic impact through treatment and loss of productivity. Current forms of diagnosis are primarily clinical and can be difficult owing to comorbidity and symptom overlap with other neurological disorders. As such, there is a need for better diagnostic tools in the form of genetic testing. Migraine is a complex disorder, encompassing various subtypes, and has a large genetic component. Genetic studies conducted on rare monogenic subtypes, including familial hemiplegic migraine, have led to insights into its pathogenesis via identification of causal mutations in three genes (CACNA1A,ATP1A2andSCN1A) that are involved in transport of ions at synapses and glutamatergic transmission. Study of familial migraine with aura pedigrees has also revealed other causal genes for monogenic forms of migraine. With respect to the more common polygenic form of migraine, large genome-wide association studies have increased our understanding of the genes, pathways and mechanisms involved in susceptibility, which are largely involved in neuronal and vascular functions. Given the preponderance of female migraineurs (3:1), there is evidence to suggest that hormonal or X-linked components can also contribute to migraine, and the role of genetic variants in mitochondrial DNA in migraine has been another avenue of exploration. Epigenetic studies of migraine have shown links between hormonal variation and alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression. While there is an abundance of preliminary studies identifying many potentially causative migraine genes and pathways, more comprehensive genomic and functional analysis to better understand mechanisms may aid in better diagnostic and treatment outcomes.© 2021 Bron et al."

A genetic attribution has been extensively proved. Here, we propose to further prioritize genes that harbor single nucleotide variation (SNV) or structural variation (SV) for AD and explore the underlying potential mechanisms through exploiting their expression and methylation spectra. A high-confidence AD-associated candidate gene list was obtained from the ClinVar and Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). Genome-wide methylation and expression profiles of AD and normal subjects were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Through comprehensive comparison of expression and methylation levels between AD and normal samples, as well as different stages of AD samples, SORL1 was identified as the most plausible gene for AD incidence and progression. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed significant activation of the ABC (ATP binding cassette) transporter with the aberrant up-regulation of SORL1 within AD samples. This study unfolds the expression and methylation spectra of previously probed genes with SNV or SV in AD for the first time, and reports an aberrant activation of the ABC transporter pathway that might contribute to AD progression. This should shed some light on AD diagnosis and precision treatment.© 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
"33909500","A Systematic Analysis of Protein-altering Exonic Variants in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.","Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol","Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified regions associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). GWASs of other diseases have shown an approximately 10-fold overrepresentation of nonsynonymous variants, despite limited exonic coverage on genotyping arrays. We hypothesized that a large-scale analysis of coding variants could discover novel genetic associations with COPD, including rare variants with large effect sizes. We performed a meta-analysis of exome arrays from 218,399 controls and 33,851 moderate-to-severe COPD cases. All exome-wide significant associations were present in regions previously identified by GWAS. We did not identify any novel rare coding variants with large effect sizes. Within GWAS regions on chromosomes 5q, 6p, and 15q, four coding variants were conditionally significant (p < 0.00015) when adjusting for lead GWAS SNPs. A common GSDMB splice variant (rs11078928) previously associated with decreased risk for asthma, was nominally associated with decreased risk for COPD (MAF = 0.46, p=1.8e-4). Two stop variants in CCHCR1, a gene involved in regulating cell proliferation, were associated with COPD (both p < 0.0001). The SERPINA1 Z allele was associated with a random effects odds ratio of 1.43 for COPD (95% CI: 1.17-1.74), though with marked heterogeneity across studies. Overall, COPD-associated exonic variants were identified in genes involved in DNA methylation, cell-matrix interactions, cell proliferation, and cell death. In conclusion, we performed the largest exome array meta-analysis of COPD to date and identified potential functional coding variants. Future studies are needed to identify rarer variants, and further define the role of coding variants in COPD pathogenesis."
"33907578","DNA methylation variations in familial female and male breast cancer.","Oncol Lett","In total, ~25% of familial breast cancer (BC) is attributed to germline mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, while the rest of the cases are included in the BRCAX group. BC is also known to affect men, with a worldwide incidence of 1%. Epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, have been rarely studied in male breast cancer (MBC) on a genome-wide level. The aim of the present study was to examine the global DNA methylation profiles of patients with BC to identify differences between familial female breast cancer (FBC) and MBC, and according to BRCA1, BRCA2 or BRCAX mutation status. The genomic DNA of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 17 women and 7 men with BC was subjected to methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and hybridized on human promoter microarrays. The comparison between FBC and MBC revealed 2,846 significant differentially methylated regions corresponding to 2,486 annotated genes. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed molecular function terms, such as the GTPase superfamily genes (particularly the GTPase Rho GAP/GEF and GTPase RAB), and cellular component terms associated with cytoskeletal architecture, such as 'cytoskeletal part', 'keratin filament' and 'intermediate filament'. When only FBC was considered, several cancer-associated pathways were among the most enriched KEGG pathways of differentially methylated genes when the BRCA2 group was compared with the BRCAX or BRCA1+BRCAX groups. The comparison between the BRCA1 and BRCA2+BRCAX groups comprised the molecular function term 'cytoskeletal protein binding'. Finally, the functional annotation of differentially methylated genes between the BRCAX and BRCA1+BRCA2 groups indicated that the most enriched molecular function terms were associated with GTPase activity. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to compare the global DNA methylation profile of familial FBC and MBC. The results may provide useful insights into the epigenomic subtyping of BC and shed light on a possible novel molecular mechanism underlying BC carcinogenesis.Copyright: © Abeni et al."

While reduced representation sequencing can be an affordable alternative, over 80% of CpGs in the genome are not covered. Building on our recently developed TET-assisted pyridine borane sequencing (TAPS) method, we here described endonuclease enrichment TAPS (eeTAPS), which utilizes dihydrouracil (DHU)-cleaving endonuclease digestion of TAPS-converted DNA to enrich methylated CpG sites (mCpGs). eeTAPS can accurately detect 87% of mCpGs in the mouse genome with a sequencing depth equivalent to 4× whole genome sequencing. In comparison, reduced representation TAPS (rrTAPS) detected less than 4% of mCpGs with 2.5× sequencing depth.

We aimed to describe the methylation patterns in stool and colon from infants with NEC.Methods:We performed a high-resolution genome-wide epigenomic analysis using solution-phase hybridization and next-generation sequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA.Results:Our data reveal significant genomic hypermethylation in NEC tissues compared with non-NEC controls. These changes were more pronounced in regions outside CpG islands and gene regulatory elements, suggesting that NEC-specific hypermethylation is not a nonspecific global phenomenon.Conclusions:This study provides evidence of a methylomic signature associated with NEC that is detectable noninvasively and provides a new opportunity for the development of a novel diagnostic method for NEC."

HGAP has been proposed to be integrated in the upcoming World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors expected in 2021. In this series, we present the first single-center experience with this new entity.During 2017 and 2020, six HGAP were identified. Clinical course, surgical procedure, histopathology, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, imaging, and adjuvant therapy were collected.Tumors were localized in the brain stem (n = 1), cerebellar peduncle (n = 1), diencephalon (n = 1), mesencephalon (n = 1), cerebrum (n = 1) and the thoracic spinal cord (n = 2). The lesions typically presented as T1w hypo- to isointense and T2w hyperintense with inhomogeneous contrast enhancement on MRI. All patients underwent initial surgical intervention. Three patients received adjuvant radiochemotherapy, and one patient adjuvant radiotherapy alone. Four patients died of disease, with an overall survival of 1.8, 9.1, 14.8 and 18.1 months. One patient was alive at the time of last follow-up, 14.6 months after surgery, and one patient was lost to follow-up. Apart from one tumor, the lesions did not present with high grade histology, however patients showed poor clinical outcomes.Here, we provide detailed clinical, neuroradiological, histological, and molecular pathological information which might aid in clinical decision making until larger case series are published. With the exception of one case, the tumors did not present with high-grade histology but patients still showed short intervals between diagnosis and tumor progression or death even after extensive multimodal therapy."
"33904619","Connecting the epigenome, metabolome and proteome for a deeper understanding of disease.","J Intern Med","Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) identify genes that are dysregulated by the studied clinical endpoints, thereby indicating potential new diagnostic biomarkers, drug targets, and therapy options. Combining EWAS with deep molecular phenotyping, such as approaches enabled by metabolomics and proteomics, allow further probing of the underlying disease-associated pathways. For instance, methylation of the TXNIP gene is associated robustly with prevalent type 2 diabetes, and, further, with metabolites that are short-term markers of glycemic control. These associations reflect TXNIP's function as a glucose uptake regulator by interaction with the major glucose transporter GLUT1 and suggest that TXNIP methylation can be used as a readout for the organism's exposure to glucose stress. Another case is the association of DNA methylation of the AHRR and F2RL3 genes with smoking and a protein that is involved in the reprogramming of the bronchial epithelium. These examples show that associations between DNA methylation and intermediate molecular traits can open new windows into how the body copes with physiological challenges. This knowledge, if carefully interpreted, may indicate novel therapy options, and together with monitoring of the methylation state of specific methylation sites, may in the future allow the early diagnosis of impending disease. It is essential for medical practitioners to recognize the potential that this field holds in translating basic research findings to clinical practice. In this review, we present recent advances in the field of EWAS with metabolomics and proteomics and discuss both the potential and the challenges of translating epigenetic associations, with deep molecular phenotypes, to biomedical applications.This article is protected by copyright.

Still, a relevant percentage of patients do not respond to lenalidomide and even experience progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we aimed to investigate whether global DNA methylation patterns could predict response to lenalidomide. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using Illumina 450k methylation arrays was performed on n=51 patients with MDS del5q who were uniformly treated with lenalidomide in a prospective multicenter trial of the German MDS study group. To study potential direct effects of lenalidomide on DNA methylation, 17 paired samples pre- and post-treatment were analyzed. Our results revealed no relevant effect of lenalidomide on methylation status. Furthermore, methylation patterns prior to therapy could not predict lenalidomide response. However, methylation clustering identified a group of patients with a trend towards inferior overall survival. These patients showed hypermethylation of several interesting target genes, including genes of relevant signaling pathways, potentially indicating the evaluation of novel therapeutic targets."
"33902726","Sex-specific DNA methylation differences in Alzheimer's disease pathology.","Acta Neuropathol Commun","Sex is an important factor that contributes to the clinical and biological heterogeneities in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the regulatory mechanisms underlying sex disparity in AD are still not well understood. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that regulates gene transcription and is known to be involved in AD. We performed the first large-scale sex-specific meta-analysis of DNA methylation differences in AD neuropathology, by re-analyzing four recent epigenome-wide association studies totaling more than 1000 postmortem prefrontal cortex brain samples using a uniform analytical pipeline. For each cohort, we employed two complementary analytical strategies, a sex-stratified analysis that examined methylation-Braak stage associations in male and female samples separately, and a sex-by-Braak stage interaction analysis that compared the magnitude of these associations between different sexes. Our analysis uncovered 14 novel CpGs, mapped to genes such as TMEM39A and TNXB that are associated with the AD Braak stage in a sex-specific manner. TMEM39A is known to be involved in inflammation, dysregulated type I interferon responses, and other immune processes. TNXB encodes tenascin proteins, which are extracellular matrix glycoproteins demonstrated to modulate synaptic plasticity in the brain. Moreover, for many previously implicated genes in AD neuropathology, such as MBP and AZU1, our analysis provided the new insights that they were predominately driven by effects in only one sex. These sex-specific DNA methylation differences were enriched in divergent biological processes such as integrin activation in females and complement activation in males. Our study implicated multiple new loci and biological processes that affected AD neuropathology in a sex-specific manner."
"33902696","The role of DNA methylation in syndromic and non-syndromic congenital heart disease.","Clin Epigenetics","Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a common structural birth defect worldwide, and defects typically occur in the walls and valves of the heart or enlarged blood vessels. Chromosomal abnormalities and genetic mutations only account for a small portion of the pathogenic mechanisms of CHD, and the etiology of most cases remains unknown. The role of epigenetics in various diseases, including CHD, has attracted increased attention. The contributions of DNA methylation, one of the most important epigenetic modifications, to CHD have not been illuminated. Increasing evidence suggests that aberrant DNA methylation is related to CHD. Here, we briefly introduce DNA methylation and CHD and then review the DNA methylation profiles during cardiac development and in CHD, abnormalities in maternal genome-wide DNA methylation patterns are also described. Whole genome methylation profile and important differentially methylated genes identified in recent years are summarized and clustered according to the sample type and methodologies. Finally, we discuss the novel technology for and prospects of CHD-related DNA methylation."

"33901611","Early acoustic experience alters genome-wide methylation in the auditory forebrain of songbird embryos.","Neurosci Lett","Early exposure to salient cues can critically shape the development of social behaviors. For example, both oscine birds and humans can hear and learn to recognize familiar sounds in ovo and in utero and recognize them following hatching and birth, respectively. Here we demonstrate that different chronic acoustic playbacks alter genome-wide methylation of the auditory forebrain in late-stage zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) embryos. Within the same subjects, immediate early gene activation in response to acute con- or heterospecific song exposure is negatively correlated with methylation extent in response to repeated daily prior exposure to the same type of stimuli. Specifically, we report less relative global methylation following playbacks of conspecific songs and more methylation following playbacks of distantly-related heterospecific songs. These findings offer a neuroepigenomic mechanism for the ontogenetic impacts of early acoustic experiences in songbirds.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"33901562","Triangulating molecular evidence to prioritize candidate causal genes at established atopic dermatitis loci.","J Invest Dermatol","Genome-wide association studies for atopic dermatitis (AD) have identified 25 reproducible loci. We attempt to prioritize candidate causal genes at these loci using extensive molecular resources compiled into a bioinformatics pipeline. We identified a list of 103 molecular resources for AD aetiology, including expression, protein and DNA methylation QTL datasets in skin or immune-relevant tissues which were tested for overlap with GWAS signals. This was combined with functional annotation using regulatory variant prediction, and features such as promoter-enhancer interactions, expression studies and variant fine-mapping. For each gene at each locus, we condensed the evidence into a prioritization score. Across the investigated loci, we detected significant enrichment of genes with adaptive immune regulatory function and epidermal barrier formation among the top prioritized genes. At 8 loci, we were able to prioritize a single candidate gene (IL6R, ADO, PRR5L, IL7R, ETS1, INPP5D, MDM1, TRAF3). In addition, at 6 of the 25 loci, our analysis prioritizes less familiar candidates (SLC22A5, IL2RA, MDM1, DEXI, ADO, STMN3). Our analysis provides support for previously implicated genes at several AD GWAS loci, as well as evidence for plausible additional candidates at others, which may represent potential targets for drug discovery.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Approximately 66-69% of the human genome may be composed of transposable repetitive elements, including Alu and LINE-1. This study aimed to investigate whether Alu-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) concentrations, Alu index, and LINE-1 methylation could be used to distinguish patients with cancers from healthy individuals.Two sets of primers, shorter and longer Alu fragments, were used to amplify Alu elements, followed by the quantitation of Alu DNA concentration and its integrity index. LINE-1 methylation status was then analyzed with quantitative PCR using methylation- and unmethylation-specific TaqMan probes.Both Alu index and LINE-1 methylation level were significantly different in comparison between patients with lung or breast cancer and the healthy controls. The area under the ROC curve of the Alu index and LINE-1 hypomethylation was 0.742 and 0.848 for lung cancer, respectively, and 0.724 and 0.890 for breast cancer, respectively. However, Alu longer fragment DNA concentration was significantly correlated with Alu index in comparison to LINE-1 hypomethylation. Regression analysis suggested that the LINE-1 methylation level, rather than the Alu index, was a good discriminator for lung and breast cancers.This study investigated the genome-wide Alu index and LINE-1 methylation status; their associations with cancers suggested that these combinatory panels could be implemented as a triage test to discriminate cancer patients from healthy individuals.Copyright © 2021 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists.

"33900608","Analysis of Plant DNA Methylation Profiles Using R.","Methods Mol Biol","DNA methylation is a transgenerational stable epigenetic modification able to regulate gene expression and genome stability. The analysis of DNA methylation by genome-wide bisulfite sequencing become the main genomic approach to study epigenetics in many organisms; leading to standardization of the alignment and methylation call procedures. However, subsequent steps of the computational analysis should be tailored to the biological questions and the organisms used. Since most bioinformatics tools designed for epigenetic studies are built using mammalian models, they are potentially unsuitable for organisms with substantially different epigenetic regulation, such as plants. Therefore, in this chapter we propose a computational workflow for the analysis, visualization, and interpretation of data obtained from alignment of whole genome bisulfite sequencing of plant samples. Using almost exclusively the R working environment we will examine in depth how to tackle some plant-related issues during epigenetic analysis."
"33895575","Air pollution and DNA methylation in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.","Environ Pollut","This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between air pollution and DNA methylation in adults from published observational studies. PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases were systematically searched for available studies on the association between air pollution and DNA methylation published up to March 9, 2021. Three DNA methylation approaches were considered: global methylation, candidate-gene, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Meta-analysis was used to summarize the combined estimates for the association between air pollutants and global DNA methylation levels. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochran Q test and quantified with the I2statistic. In total, 38 articles were included in this study: 16 using global methylation, 18 using candidate genes, and 11 using EWAS, with 7 studies using more than one approach. Meta-analysis revealed an imprecise but inverse association between exposure to PM2.5and global DNA methylation (for each 10-μg/m3PM2.5, combined estimate: 0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.97 - 0.19). The candidate-gene results were consistent for the ERCC3 and SOX2 genes, suggesting hypermethylation in ERCC3 associated with benzene and that in SOX2 associated with PM2.5exposure. EWAS identified 201 CpG sites and 148 differentially methylated regions that showed differential methylation associated with air pollution. Among the 307 genes investigated in 11 EWAS, a locus in nucleoredoxin gene was found to be positively associated with PM2.5in two studies. Current meta-analysis indicates that PM2.5is imprecisely and inversely associated with DNA methylation. The candidate-gene results consistently suggest hypermethylation in ERCC3 associated with benzene exposure and that in SOX2 associated with PM2.5exposure. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) network analyses revealed that these genes were associated with African trypanosomiasis, Malaria, Antifolate resistance, Graft-versus-host disease, and so on. More evidence is needed to clarify the association between air pollution and DNA methylation.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"33892821","Combined epigenetic/genetic study identified an ALS age of onset modifier.","Acta Neuropathol Commun","Age at onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is highly variable (eg, 27-74 years in carriers of the G4C2-expansion in C9orf72). It might be influenced by environmental and genetic factors via the modulation of DNA methylation (DNAm) at CpG-sites. Hence, we combined an epigenetic and genetic approach to test the hypothesis that some common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at CpG-sites (CpG-SNPs) could modify ALS age of onset. Our genome-wide DNAm analysis suggested three CpG-SNPs whose DNAm levels are significantly associated with age of onset in 249 ALS patients (q < 0.05). Next, genetic analysis validated the association of rs4970944 with age of onset in the discovery (n = 469; P = 0.025) and replication (n = 4160; P = 0.007) ALS cohorts. A meta-analysis of the cohorts combined showed that the median onset in AA-carriers is two years later than in GG-carriers (n = 4629; P = 0.0012). A similar association was observed with its tagging SNPs, implicating a 16 Kb region at the 1q21.3 locus as a modifier of ALS age of onset. Notably, rs4970944 genotypes are also associated with age of onset in C9orf72-carriers (n = 333; P = 0.025), suggesting that each A-allele delays onset by 1.6 years. Analysis of Genotype-Tissue Expression data revealed that the protective A-allele is linked with the reduced expression of CTSS in cerebellum (P = 0.00018), which is a critical brain region in the distributed neural circuits subserving motor control. CTSS encodes cathepsin S protein playing a key role in antigen presentation. In conclusion, we identified a 16 Kb locus tagged by rs4970944 as a modifier of ALS age of onset. Our findings support the role of antigen presenting processes in modulating age of onset of ALS and suggest potential drug targets (eg, CTSS). Future replication studies are encouraged to validate the link between the locus tagged by rs4970944 and age of onset in independent ALS cohorts, including different ethnic groups."
"33892786","Identification of ZBTB18 as a novel colorectal tumor suppressor gene through genome-wide promoter hypermethylation analysis.","Clin Epigenetics","Cancer initiation and progression are driven by genetic and epigenetic changes. Although genome/exome sequencing has significantly contributed to the characterization of the genetic driver alterations, further investigation is required to systematically identify cancer driver genes regulated by promoter hypermethylation.Using genome-wide analysis of promoter methylation in 45 colorectal cancer cell lines, we found that higher overall methylation levels were associated with microsatellite instability (MSI), faster proliferation and absence of APC mutations. Because epigenetically silenced genes could represent important oncogenic drivers, we used mRNA expression profiling of colorectal cancer cell lines and primary tumors to identify a subset of 382 (3.9%) genes for which promoter methylation was negatively associated with gene expression. Remarkably, a significant enrichment in zinc finger proteins was observed, including the transcriptional repressor ZBTB18. Re-introduction of ZBTB18 in colon cancer cells significantly reduced proliferation in vitro and in a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ZBTB18 is frequently lost or reduced in colorectal tumors, and reduced ZBTB18 expression was found to be associated with lymph node metastasis and shorter survival of patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer.We identified a set of 382 genes putatively silenced by promoter methylation in colorectal cancer that could significantly contribute to the oncogenic process. Moreover, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that the epigenetically silenced gene ZBTB18 has tumor suppressor activity and is a novel prognostic marker for patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer."
"33892617","Genome-wide DNA methylation of the liver reveals delayed effects of early-life exposure to 17-α-ethinylestradiol in the self-fertilizing mangrove rivulus.","Epigenetics","Organisms exposed to endocrine disruptors in early life can show altered phenotype later in adulthood. Although the mechanisms underlying these long-term effects remain poorly understood, an increasing body of evidence points towards the potential role of epigenetic processes. In the present study, we exposed hatchlings of an isogenic lineage of the self-fertilizing fish mangrove rivulus for 28 days to 4 and 120 ng/L of 17-α-ethinylestradiol. After a recovery period of 140 days, reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) was performed on the liver in order to assess the hepatic genome-wide methylation landscape. Across all treatment comparisons, a total of 146 differentially methylated fragments (DMFs) were reported, mostly for the group exposed to 4 ng/L, suggesting a non-monotonic effect of EE2 exposure. Gene ontology analysis revealed networks involved in lipid metabolism, cellular processes, connective tissue function, molecular transport and inflammation. The highest effect was reported fornipped-B-like protein B(NIPBL) promoter region after exposure to 4 ng/L EE2 (+ 21.9%), suggesting that NIPBL could be an important regulator for long-term effects of EE2. Our results also suggest a significant role of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and potentially in transposable elements. These results support the ability of early exposure to endocrine disruptors of inducing epigenetic alterations during adulthood, providing plausible mechanistic explanations for long-term phenotypic alteration. Additionally, this work demonstrates the usefulness of isogenic lineages of the self-fertilizing mangrove rivulus to better understand the biological significance of long-term alterations of DNA methylation by diminishing the confounding factor of genetic variability."
"33890633","DNA methylation patterns within whole blood of adolescents born from assisted reproductive technology are not different from adolescents born from natural conception.","Hum Reprod","Do the epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles of adolescents born from ART differ from the epigenome of naturally conceived counterparts?No significant differences in the DNA methylation profiles of adolescents born from ART [IVF or ICSI] were observed when compared to their naturally conceived, similar aged counterparts.Short-term and longer-term studies have investigated the general health outcomes of children born from IVF treatment, albeit without common agreement as to the cause and underlying mechanisms of these adverse health findings. Growing evidence suggests that the reported adverse health outcomes in IVF-born offspring might have underlying epigenetic mechanisms.The Growing Up Healthy Study (GUHS) is a prospective study that recruited 303 adolescents and young adults, conceived through ART, to compare various long-term health outcomes and DNA methylation profiles with similar aged counterparts from Generation 2 from the Raine Study. GUHS assessments were conducted between 2013 and 2017. The effect of ART on DNA methylation levels of 231 adolescents mean age 15.96 ± 1.59 years (52.8% male) was compared to 1188 naturally conceived counterparts, 17.25 ± 0.58 years (50.9% male) from the Raine Study.DNA methylation profiles from a subset of 231 adolescents (13-19.9 years) from the GUHS, generated using the Infinium Methylation Epic Bead Chip (EPIC) array were compared to 1188 profiles from the Raine Study previously measured using the Illumina 450K array. We conducted epigenome-wide association approach (EWAS) and tested for an association between the cohorts applying Firth's bias reduced logistic regression against the outcome of ART versus naturally conceived offspring. Additionally, within the GUHS cohort, we investigated differences in methylation status in fresh versus frozen embryo transfers, cause of infertility as well as IVF versus ICSI conceived offspring. Following the EWAS analysis we investigated nominally significant probes using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify enriched biological pathways. Finally, within GUHS we compared four estimates (Horvath, Hanuum, PhenoAge [Levine], and skin Horvath) of epigenetic age and their correlation with chronological age.Between the two cohorts, we did not identify any DNA methylation probes that reached a Bonferroni corrected P-value < 1.24E-0.7. When comparing IVF versus ICSI conceived adolescents within the GUHS cohort, after adjustment for participant age, sex, maternal smoking, multiple births, and batch effect, three methylation probes (cg15016734, cg26744878 and cg20233073) reached a Bonferroni correction of 6.31E-08. After correcting for cell count heterogeneity, two of the aforementioned probes remained significant and an additional two probes (cg 0331628 and cg 20235051) were identified. A general trend towards hypomethylation in the ICSI offspring was observed. All four measures of epigenetic age were highly correlated with chronological age and showed no evidence of accelerated epigenetic aging within their whole blood.The small sample size coupled with the use of whole blood, where epigenetic differences may occur in other tissue. This was corrected by the utilized statistical method that accounts for imbalanced sample size between groups and adjusting for cell count heterogeneity. Only a small portion of the methylome was analysed and rare individual differences may be missed.Our findings provide further reassurance that the effects of the ART manipulations occurring during early embryogenesis, existing in the neonatal period are indeed of a transient nature and do not persist into adolescence. However, we have not excluded that alternative epigenetic mechanisms may be at play.This project was supported by NHMRC project Grant no. 1042269 and R.J.H. received funding support from Ferring Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd.

"33888138","Human brain region-specific variably methylated regions are enriched for heritability of distinct neuropsychiatric traits.","Genome Biol","DNA methylation dynamics in the brain are associated with normal development and neuropsychiatric disease and differ across functionally distinct brain regions. Previous studies of genome-wide methylation differences among human brain regions focus on limited numbers of individuals and one to two brain regions.Using GTEx samples, we generate a resource of DNA methylation in purified neuronal nuclei from 8 brain regions as well as lung and thyroid tissues from 12 to 23 donors. We identify differentially methylated regions between brain regions among neuronal nuclei in both CpG (181,146) and non-CpG (264,868) contexts, few of which were unique to a single pairwise comparison. This significantly expands the knowledge of differential methylation across the brain by 10-fold. In addition, we present the first differential methylation analysis among neuronal nuclei from basal ganglia tissues and identify unique CpG differentially methylated regions, many associated with ion transport. We also identify 81,130 regions of variably CpG methylated regions, i.e., variable methylation among individuals in the same brain region, which are enriched in regulatory regions and in CpG differentially methylated regions. Many variably methylated regions are unique to a specific brain region, with only 202 common across all brain regions, as well as lung and thyroid. Variably methylated regions identified in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus are enriched for heritability of schizophrenia.These data suggest that epigenetic variation in these particular human brain regions could be associated with the risk for this neuropsychiatric disorder."

This study aimed to investigate epigenome-wide DNA methylation associated with B[a]P exposure and their mediation effects on B[a]P-lung cancer association in two lung cancer case-control studies of 462 subjects. Their plasma levels of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide-albumin (BPDE-Alb) adducts and genome-wide DNA methylations were separately detected in peripheral blood by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and genome-wide methylation arrays. The epigenome-wide meta-analysis was performed to analyze the associations between BPDE-Alb adducts and DNA methylations. Mediation analysis was applied to assess effect of DNA methylation on the B[a]P-lung cancer association. We identified 15 CpGs associated with BPDE-Alb adducts (P-meta< 1.0 × 10-5), among which the methylation levels at five loci (cg06245338, cg24256211, cg15107887, cg02211741, and cg04354393 annotated to UBE2O, SAMD4A, ACBD6, DGKZ, and SLFN13, respectively) mediated a separate 38.5%, 29.2%, 41.5%, 47.7%, 56.5%, and a joint 58.2% of the association between BPDE-Alb adducts and lung cancer risk. Compared to the traditional factors [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.788], addition of these CpGs exerted improved discriminations for lung cancer, with AUC ranging 0.828-0.861. Our results highlight DNA methylation alterations as potential mediators in lung tumorigenesis induced by B[a]P exposure.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"33886574","Hypomethylation mediates genetic association with the major histocompatibility complex genes in Sjögren's syndrome.","PLoS One","Differential methylation of immune genes has been a consistent theme observed in Sjögren's syndrome (SS) in CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, whole blood, and labial salivary glands (LSGs). Multiple studies have found associations supporting genetic control of DNA methylation in SS, which in the absence of reverse causation, has positive implications for the potential of epigenetic therapy. However, a formal study of the causal relationship between genetic variation, DNA methylation, and disease status is lacking. We performed a causal mediation analysis of DNA methylation as a mediator of nearby genetic association with SS using LSGs and genotype data collected from 131 female members of the Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance registry, comprising of 64 SS cases and 67 non-cases. Bumphunter was used to first identify differentially-methylated regions (DMRs), then the causal inference test (CIT) was applied to identify DMRs mediating the association of nearby methylation quantitative trait loci (MeQTL) with SS. Bumphunter discovered 215 DMRs, with the majority located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21.3. Consistent with previous findings, regions hypomethylated in SS cases were enriched for gene sets associated with immune processes. Using the CIT, we observed a total of 19 DMR-MeQTL pairs that exhibited strong evidence for a causal mediation relationship. Close to half of these DMRs reside in the MHC and their corresponding meQTLs are in the region spanning the HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DQA2 loci. The risk of SS conferred by these corresponding MeQTLs in the MHC was further substantiated by previous genome-wide association study results, with modest evidence for independent effects. By validating the presence of causal mediation, our findings suggest both genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to disease susceptibility, and inform the development of targeted epigenetic modification as a therapeutic approach for SS."

We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of leukocyte DNA methylation in relation to level and change in cognitive abilities, from midlife through late life in 535 Swedish twins.Methylation levels were measured with the Infinium Human Methylation 450 K or Infinium MethylationEPIC array, and all sites passing quality control on both arrays were selected for analysis (n = 250,816). Empirical Bayes estimates of individual intercept (age 65), linear, and quadratic change were obtained from latent growth curve models of cognitive traits and used as outcomes in linear regression models. Significant sites (p < 2.4 × 10-7) were followed up in between-within twin pair models adjusting for familial confounding and full-growth modeling. We identified six significant associations between DNA methylation and level of cognitive abilities at age 65: cg18064256 (PPP1R13L) with processing speed and spatial ability; cg04549090 (NRXN3) with spatial ability; cg09988380 (POGZ), cg25651129 (-), and cg08011941 (ENTPD8) with working memory. The genes are involved in neuroinflammation, neuropsychiatric disorders, and ATP metabolism. Within-pair associations were approximately half that of between-pair associations across all sites. In full-growth curve models, associations between DNA methylation and cognitive level at age 65 were of small effect sizes, and associations between DNA methylation and longitudinal change in cognitive abilities of very small effect sizes.Leukocyte DNA methylation was associated with level, but not change in cognitive abilities. The associations were substantially attenuated in within-pair analyses, indicating they are influenced in part by genetic factors."

We aimed to identify differentially methylated loci associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and assess their validity as predictive and causal biomarkers.We designed a case-control, two-stage, epigenome-wide association study on AMI (ndiscovery = 391, nvalidation = 204). DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We performed a fixed-effects meta-analysis of the two samples. 34 CpGs were associated with AMI. Only 12 of them were available in two independent cohort studies (n ~ 1800 and n ~ 2500) with incident coronary and cardiovascular disease (CHD and CVD, respectively). The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used in those two studies. Four of the 12 CpGs were validated in association with incident CHD: AHRR-mapping cg05575921, PTCD2-mapping cg25769469, intergenic cg21566642 and MPO-mapping cg04988978. We then assessed whether methylation risk scores based on those CpGs improved the predictive capacity of the Framingham risk function, but they did not. Finally, we aimed to study the causality of those associations using a Mendelian randomization approach but only one of the CpGs had a genetic influence and therefore the results were not conclusive.We have identified 34 CpGs related to AMI. These loci highlight the relevance of smoking, lipid metabolism, and inflammation in the biological mechanisms related to AMI. Four were additionally associated with incident CHD and CVD but did not provide additional predictive information."

The objective of this study was to investigate the hypolipidemic effects and the potential underlying mechanisms of action of CPP-2 in high-fat emulsion (HFE)-induced mice. The results showed that CPP-2 reduced the level of genome-wide DNA methylation in the liver of HFE-induced mice, which had a lipid-lowering effect by regulating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling-, fatty acid metabolism-, fatty acid biosynthesis- and adipocytokine signaling pathways. A series of lipid metabolism genes were screened out by conjoint analysis of the Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Hereafter, fatty acid synthase (FAS) and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor α (PPARα) as target genes were selected to validate the accuracy of the results. The findings demonstrated that CPP-2 might be effective in lowering the lipid content, thereby protecting against HFE-induced hyperlipidemia.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Chronological age and race are associated with preeclampsia, but the role of these factors is not entirely understood. We hypothesized that DNA methylation age, a measure of biological age, would be higher in individuals with preeclampsia than in individuals with normotensive pregnancy and that DNA methylation age would differ by race across pregnancy. This was a longitudinal, exploratory study of 56 pregnant individuals (n = 28 preeclampsia cases and n = 28 normotensive controls). Genome-wide DNA methylation data were generated from trimester-specific peripheral blood samples. DNA methylation age was estimated using the ""Improved Precision"" clock, and ∆age, the difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age, was computed. DNA methylation age was compared with chronological age using Pearson correlations. The relationships between ∆age and preeclampsia status, self-reported race, and covariates were tested using multiple linear regression and performed both with and without consideration of cell-type heterogeneity. We observed strong correlation between chronological age and DNA methylation age across pregnancy, with significantly stronger correlation observed in White participants than in Black participants. We observed no association between ∆age and preeclampsia status. However, ∆age was higher in participants with higher pre-pregnancy body mass index in trimester 1 and lower in Black participants than in White participants in trimesters 2 and 3. Observations were largely consistent when controlling for cell-type heterogeneity. Our findings in a small sample support the need for additional studies to investigate the relationship between race and biological age, which could provide further insight into racial disparities across pregnancy. However, this study does not support an association between ∆age and preeclampsia status."

As an objective, anin-silicogenome-wide DNA methylation (5mC) analysis was performed in rice (Oryza sativacv. Zhonghua11), and the epigenetic role of CYPs in two abiotic stresses was observed. Being a stable representative mark, DNA-methylation alters the gene expression under stressful environmental conditions. Rice plants under salinity and drought stresses were analyzed through MeDIP-chip hybridization, and 14 unique genes of the CYP family were identified in the rice genome with varying degrees of methylation. The gene structure, promoter sequences, and phylogenetic analysis were performed. Furthermore, the responses of CYPs to various abiotic stresses, including salinity, drought, and cold were revealed. Similarly, the expression profile of potential CYPs was also investigated under various phytohormone stresses, which revealed the potential involvement of CYPs to hormone regulations. Overall, the current study provides evidence for CYP's stress regulation and fundamental for further characterization and understanding their epigenetic roles in gene expression regulation and environmental stress regulation in higher plants."

Although genetic factors are collectively associated with the etiology of BD, the underlying molecular mechanisms, particularly how environmental factors affect the brain, remain largely unknown. We performed promoter-wide DNA methylation analysis of neuronal and nonneuronal nuclei in the prefrontal cortex of patients with BD (N = 34) and controls (N = 35). We found decreased DNA methylation at promoters in both cell types in the BD patients. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of differentially methylated region (DMR)-associated genes revealed enrichment of molecular motor-related genes in neurons, chemokines in both cell types, and ion channel- and transporter-related genes in nonneurons. Detailed GO analysis further revealed that growth cone- and dendrite-related genes, including NTRK2 and GRIN1, were hypermethylated in neurons of BD patients. To assess the effect of medication, neuroblastoma cells were cultured under therapeutic concentrations of three mood stabilizers. We observed that up to 37.9% of DMRs detected in BD overlapped with mood stabilizer-induced DMRs. Interestingly, mood stabilizer-induced DMRs showed the opposite direction of changes in DMRs, suggesting the therapeutic effects of mood stabilizers. Among the DMRs, 12 overlapped with loci identified in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BD. We also found significant enrichment of neuronal DMRs in the loci reported in another GWAS of BD. Finally, we performed qPCR of DNA methylation-related genes and found that DNMT3B was overexpressed in BD. The cell-type-specific DMRs identified in this study will be useful for understanding the pathophysiology of BD."

Histone lysine methylation is catalyzed by a class of SET-domain group proteins (SDGs). Although an increasing number of studies have shown that SDGs play important regulatory roles in development and stress responses, the functions of SDGs in apple remain unclear.A total of 67 SDG members were identified in the Malus×domestica genome. Syntenic analysis revealed that most of the MdSDG duplicated gene pairs were associated with a recent genome-wide duplication event of the apple genome. These 67 MdSDG members were grouped into six classes based on sequence similarity and the findings of previous studies. The domain organization of each MdSDG class was characterized by specific patterns, which was consistent with the classification results. The tissue-specific expression patterns of MdSDGs among the 72 apple tissues in the different apple developmental stages were characterized to provide insight into their potential functions in development. The expression profiles of MdSDGs were also investigated in fruit development, the breaking of bud dormancy, and responses to abiotic and biotic stress; the results indicated that MdSDGs might play a regulatory role in development and stress responses. The subcellular localization and putative interaction network of MdSDG proteins were also analyzed.This work presents a fundamental comprehensive analysis of SDG histone methyltransferases in apple and provides a basis for future studies of MdSDGs involved in apple development and stress responses."

We used residential addresses to estimate average daily PM2.5at 1 km resolution. We collected nasal swabs from the anterior nares and measured DNA methylation (DNAm) using the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We tested 719,075 high quality autosomal CpGs using CpG-by-CpG and regional DNAm analyses controlling for multiple comparisons, and adjusted for maternal education, household smokers, child sex, race/ethnicity, BMI z-score, age, season at sample collection and cell-type heterogeneity. We further corrected for bias and genomic inflation. We tested for replication in a cohort from the Netherlands (PIAMA).In adjusted analyses, we found 362 CpGs associated with 1-year PM2.5(FDR < 0.05), 20 CpGs passing Bonferroni correction (P < 7.0x10-8) and 10 Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs). In 445 PIAMA participants (mean age 16.3 years) 11 of 203 available CpGs replicated at P < 0.05. We observed differential DNAm at/near genes implicated in cell cycle, immune and inflammatory responses. There were no CpGs or regions associated with PM2.5levels at 1-day, 1-week, or 1-month prior to sample collection, although 2 CpGs were associated with past 3-month PM2.5.We observed wide-spread DNAm variability associated with average past year PM2.5exposure but we did not detect associations with shorter-term exposure. Our results suggest that nasal DNAm marks reflect chronic air pollution exposure.Copyright © 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved."

In particular, epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, may connect phthalate exposure with health outcomes. Here, we evaluated the association of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) exposure in utero with cord blood epigenome-wide DNA methylation in 203 mother-child pairs enrolled in the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health, using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Epigenome-wide association analysis demonstrated the predominant positive associations between the levels of the primary metabolite of DEHP, mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), in maternal blood and DNA methylation levels in cord blood. The genes annotated to the CpGs positively associated with MEHP levels were enriched for pathways related to metabolism, the endocrine system, and signal transduction. Among them, methylation levels of CpGs involved in metabolism were inversely associated with the offspring's ponderal index (PI). Further, clustering and mediation analyses suggested that multiple increased methylation changes may jointly mediate the association of DEHP exposure in utero with the offspring's PI at birth. Although further studies are required to assess the impact of these changes, this study suggests that differential DNA methylation may link phthalate exposure in utero to fetal growth and further imply that DNA methylation has predictive value for the offspring's obesity.Copyright © 2021.

"33872747","A genome-wide screen for differentially methylated long noncoding RNAs identified that lncAC007255.8 is regulated by promoter DNA methylation in Beas-2B cells malignantly transformed by NNK.","Toxicol Lett","Tobacco exposure is well known to induce genetic and epigenetic changes that contribute to the pathogenesis of lung cancer. 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is a significant tobacco-specific carcinogen, but the oncogenic mechanisms of NNK have not been thoroughly elucidated. In this study we found that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was overexpressed in malignantly transformed human bronchial epithelial Beas-2B cells induced by NNK (2B-NNK cells), by treatment with NNK (400 μg/mL) for 7 days. An Arraystar Human noncoding RNA Promoter Microarray was used to detect the DNA methylation status of the promoter region of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). The result showed that 1010 differentially methylated fragments were present in the lncRNA promoter region. QRT-PCR revealed that the expression of lncRNA AC007255.8 was remarkably downregulated in 2B-NNK cells and lung cancer tissues. Furthermore, Methylation-specific PCR showed that the methylation of the lncRNA AC007255.8 promoter was increased in 2B-NNK cells and lung cancer tissues. The reduced expression of lncRNA AC007255.8 was significantly associated with hypermethylation of lncRNA AC007255.8 promoter region. LncRNA AC007255.8 overexpression could result in decreased cell proliferation and increased cell apoptosis in 2B-NNK cells. In conclusion, NNK induced lncRNA AC007255.8 promoter hypermethylation via upregulation of DNMT1 in Beas-2B cells, leading to downregulation of lncRNA AC007255.8, and ultimately the enhancement of cell proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis.

However, the potential functional variants and the mechanisms by which these loci affect MS risk remain largely unexplained.We used summary data-based Mendelian randomisation to prioritise risk genes and infer potential biological mechanisms for MS risk loci.The data used consisted of DNA methylation (n= 1980) QTL (mQTL) and gene expression (n= 31,684) QTL (eQTL) derived from whole blood as well as MS GWAS summary statistics (14,802 cases, 26,703 controls). The findings were further evaluated using data derived from independent brain mQTL (n= 1160) and eQTL (n= 1194).In whole blood, we identified two independent genomic loci (lincRNA:RP11-326C3.13andTNFSF14) with consistent genome-wide significant pleiotropic associations across different omics layers. In brain tissue, a similar effect for theRP11-326C3.13locus was observed but not forTNFSF14, indicating a potential tissue-specific effect for theTNFSF14locus.We provide in silico evidence for the putative biological mechanisms by which the identified DNA methylation sites and target genes are functionally relevant to MS development in different tissues. Future research targeting these genes and DNA methylation sites will determine their roles in the pathophysiology of MS."
"33869018","Algorithm-Based Meta-Analysis Reveals the Mechanistic Interaction of the Tumor Suppressor LIMD1 With Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma.","Front Oncol","Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the major type of lung cancer, which is among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. LIMD1 was previously identified as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer, but their detailed interaction in this setting remains unclear. In this study, we have carried out multiple genome-wide bioinformatic analyses for a comprehensive understanding of LIMD1 in NSCLC, using various online algorithm platforms that have been built for mega databases derived from both clinical and cell line samples. Our results indicate that LIMD1 expression level is significantly downregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in both lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), with a considerable contribution from its promoter methylation rather than its gene mutations. TheLimd1gene undergoes mutation only at a low rate in NSCLC (0.712%). We have further identified LIMD1-associated molecular signatures in NSCLC, including its natural antisense long non-coding RNA LIMD1-AS1 and a pool of membrane trafficking regulators. We have also identified a subgroup of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, especially neutrophils, whose tumor infiltration levels significantly correlate with LIMD1 level in both LUAD and LUSC. However, a significant correlation of LIMD1 with a subset of immune regulatory molecules, such as IL6R and TAP1, was only found in LUAD. Regarding the clinical outcomes, LIMD1 expression level only significantly correlates with the survival of LUAD (p<0.01) but not with that of LUSC (p>0.1) patients. These findings indicate that LIMD1 plays a survival role in LUAD patients at least by acting as an immune regulatory protein. To further understand the mechanisms underlying the tumor-suppressing function of LIMD1 in NSCLC, we show that LIMD1 downregulation remarkably correlates with the deregulation of multiple pathways that play decisive roles in the oncogenesis of NSCLC, especially those mediated by EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, Keap1, and p63, in both LUAD and LUSC, and those mediated by p53 and CDKN2A only in LUAD. This study has disclosed that LIMD1 can serve as a survival prognostic marker for LUAD patients and provides mechanistic insights into the interaction of LIMD1 with NSCLC, which provide valuable information for clinical applications.Copyright © 2021 Wang, Sparks-Wallace, Casteel, Howell and Ning."
"33868365","Multigenerational Epigenetic Regulation of Allergic Diseases: Utilizing an Experimental Dust Mite-Induced Asthma Model.","Front Genet","Environmental exposures have been linked to increased asthma risk, particularly during pregnancy and in early life. Here we use a mouse model of allergic lung disease to examine the effects of pre- and perinatal house dust mite (HDM) allergen exposure on offspring phenotypic and transcriptional outcomes in three generations. We show that maternal HDM exposure (F0) acts synergistically with adult HDM exposure, leading to enhanced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and lung inflammation when compared to mice exposed solely in adulthood. Additionally, a subset of F1 males were not challenged in adulthood, and used to generate F2 progeny, which was then used to generate F3 progeny. Upon adult challenge to HDM, F2, and F3 males generated from the maternal HDM (F0) exposure lineage displayed increased airway reactivity and inflammation when compared to mice exposed solely in adulthood. These findings indicate that maternal allergen exposure is capable of enhancing either susceptibly to or severity of allergic airway disease. To examine the role of epigenetic inheritance of asthma susceptibility induced by maternal HDM exposure, we utilized a genome-wide MeDIP-seq and hMeDIP-seq analysis to identify genes differentially methylated (DMG) and hydroxymethylated (DHG), and their association with the enhanced AHR. In addition, we validated the relationship between DNA methylation and mRNA expression of the DMGs and DHGs in the male sub-generations (F1-F3). We found the expression ofKchn1,Nron, andSpag17to be differentially hydroxymethylated and upregulated in the F1 exposed to HDM both in early life and in adulthood when compared to F1 mice exposed solely in adulthood.Kcnh1remained upregulated in the F2 and F3 from the maternal HDM (F0) exposure lineage, when compared to F1 mice exposed solely in adulthood. In summary, we demonstrated that maternal HDM exposure in early life can alter the gene expression and phenotype of offspring upon adult HDM exposure, resulting in more severe disease. These effects persist at least two generations past the initial insult, transmitted along the paternal line.Copyright © 2021 Pulczinski, Shang, Dao, Limjunyawong, Sun, Mitzner, Cheng and Tang."

The set of cases was divided into discovery (n = 207) and validation (n = 200) cohorts, balanced for age and sex of individuals. We analysed the DNA methylation status of 850,000 CpG sites in these patients.The DNA methylation status of 44 CpG sites was associated with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Of these loci, 23 (52.3%) were located in 20 annotated coding genes. These genes, such as the inflammasome component Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the Major Histocompatibility Complex, class I C (HLA-C) candidates, were mainly involved in the response of interferon to viral infection. We used the EWAS-identified sites to establish a DNA methylation signature (EPICOVID) that is associated with the severity of the disease.We identified DNA methylation sites as epigenetic susceptibility loci for respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients.

We aimed to evaluate the association between surrounding greenness and genome-wide DNA methylation and potential gene-greenness interaction effects on DNA methylation.We measured blood-derived DNA methylation using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (Illumina) for 479 Australian women, including 66 monozygotic, 66 dizygotic twin pairs, and 215 sisters of these twins. Surrounding greenness was represented by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) within 300, 500, 1000 or 2000 m surrounding participants' home addresses. For each cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG), the associations between its methylation level and NDVI or EVI were evaluated by generalized estimating equations, after adjusting for age, education, marital status, area-level socioeconomic status, smoking behavior, cell-type proportions, and familial clustering. We used comb-p and DMRcate to identify significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs). For each significant CpG, we evaluated the interaction effects of greenness and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ±1 Mb window on its methylation level.We found associations between surrounding greenness and blood DNA methylation for one CpG (cg04720477, mapped to the promoter region of CNP gene) with false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05, and for another 9 CpGs with 0.05 ≤ FDR < 0.10. For two of these CpGs, we found 33 SNPs significantly (FDR < 0.05) modified the greenness-methylation association. There were 35 significant DMRs related to surrounding greenness that were identified by both comb-p (Sidak p-value < 0.01) and DMRcate (FDR < 0.01). Those CpGs and DMRs were mapped to genes related to many human diseases, such as mental health disorders and neoplasms as well as nutritional and metabolic diseases.Surrounding greenness was associated with blood DNA methylation of many loci across human genome, and this association could be modified by genetic variations.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

It is a known human carcinogen that targets the respiratory system and increases risk for many diseases, but there is limited research on the effects of DE exposure on the epigenome of human bronchial epithelial cells. Understanding the epigenetic impact of this environmental pollutant can elucidate biological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of harmful DE-related health effects. To estimate the causal effect of short-term DE exposure on the bronchial epithelial epigenome, we conducted a controlled single-blinded randomized crossover human experiment of exposure to DE and used bronchoscopy and Illumina 450K arrays for data collection and analysis, respectively. Of the 13 participants, 11 (85%) were male and 2 (15%) were female, and 12 (92%) were White and one (8%) was Hispanic; the mean age was 26 years (SD = 3.8 years). Eighty CpGs were differentially methylated, achieving the minimum possible exactP-value ofP = 2.44 × 10-4(i.e.2/213). In regional analyses, we found two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) annotated to the chromosome 5 open reading frame 63 genes (C5orf63; 7-CpGs) and unc-45 myosin chaperone A gene (UNC45A; 5-CpGs). Both DMRs showed increased DNA methylation after DE exposure. The average causal effects for the DMRs ranged from 1.5% to 6.0% increases in DNA methylation at individual CpGs. In conclusion, we found that short-term DE alters DNA methylation of genes in target bronchial epithelial cells, demonstrating epigenetic level effects of exposure that could be implicated in pulmonary pathologies.© The Author(s) 2021.

However, knowledge of the impact of DNA methylation changes on lung carcinogenesis and progression remains limited.Methods:Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were surveyed in 18 pairs of tumors and adjacent normal tissues from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients using Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS). An integrated epigenomic-transcriptomic landscape of lung cancer was depicted using the multi-omics data integration method.Results:We discovered a large number of hypermethylation events pre-marked by poised promoter in embryonic stem cells, being a hallmark of lung cancer. These hypermethylation events showed a high conservation across cancer types. Eight novel driver genes with aberrant methylation (e.g., PCDH17 and IRX1) were identified by integrated analysis of DNA methylome and transcriptome data. Methylation level of the eight genes measured by pyrosequencing can distinguish NSCLC patients from lung tissues with high sensitivity and specificity in an independent cohort. Their tumor-suppressive roles were further experimentally validated in lung cancer cells, which depend on promoter hypermethylation. Similarly, 13 methylation-driven ncRNAs (including 8 lncRNAs and 5 miRNAs) were identified, some of which were co-regulated with their host genes by the same promoter hypermethylation. Finally, by analyzing the transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, we uncovered sets of TFs driving the expression of epigenetically regulated genes and highlighted the epigenetic regulation of gene expression of TCF21 through DNA methylation of EGR1 binding motifs.Conclusions:We discovered several novel methylation driver genes of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance in lung cancer. Our findings revealed that DNA methylation in TF binding motifs regulates target gene expression by affecting the binding ability of TFs. Our study also provides a valuable epigenetic resource for identifying DNA methylation-based diagnostic biomarkers, developing cancer drugs for epigenetic therapy and studying cancer pathogenesis.© The author(s)."

However, identifying causal mechanisms of epigenetic origin has been challenging. New opportunities have risen from recent findings in intra-individual and cyclical epigenetic variation, which includes circadian epigenetic oscillations. Cytosine modifications display deterministic temporal rhythms, which may drive ageing and complex disease. Temporality in the epigenome, or the 'chrono' dimension, may help the integration of epigenetic, environmental and genetic disease studies, and reconcile several disparities stemming from the arbitrarily delimited research fields.

With increasing cohort sizes, more risk variants are predicted to be identified in the near future, but there appears to be a knowledge gap in understanding how these variants contribute to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Majority of the identified common risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are non-coding but are enriched in regulatory regions of the genome. It is therefore of great interest to study the impact of identified psychiatric disorders' risk SNPs on DNA methylation, the best studied epigenetic modification, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of transcriptomic processes, brain development, and functioning. This work outlines the mechanisms through which risk SNPs can impact DNA methylation levels and provides a summary of current evidence on the role of DNA methylation in mediating the genetic risk of psychiatric disorders.Copyright © 2021 Starnawska and Demontis."

We collectively analyzed 35 360 Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K DNAm array samples published on the Gene Expression Omnibus. We learned a controlled vocabulary of sample labels by applying regular expressions to metadata and used existing models to predict various sample properties including epigenetic age. We found approximately two-thirds of samples were from blood, one-quarter were from brain and one-third were from cancer patients. About 19% of samples failed at least one of Illumina's 17 prescribed quality assessments; signal distributions across samples suggest modifying manufacturer-recommended thresholds for failure would make these assessments more informative. We further analyzed DNAm variances in seven tissues (adipose, nasal, blood, brain, buccal, sperm and liver) and characterized specific probes distinguishing them. Finally, we compiled DNAm array data and metadata, including our learned and predicted sample labels, into database files accessible via the recountmethylation R/Bioconductor companion package.

We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the bidirectional relationship between genetically predicted PCOS and periodontitis.From two genome-wide association studies we selected 13 and 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with PCOS and periodontitis, respectively, as instrumental variables. We utilized publicly shared summary-level statistics from European-ancestry cohorts. To explore the causal effect of PCOS on periodontitis, 12,289 cases of periodontitis and 22,326 controls were incorporated, while 4,890 cases of PCOS and 20,405 controls in the reverse MR. Inverse-variance weighted method was employed in the primary MR analysis and multiple sensitivity analyses were implemented.Genetically determined PCOS was not causally associated with risk of periodontitis (odds ratio 0.97; 95% confidence interval 0.88-1.06;P= 0.50) per one-unit increase in the log-odds ratio of periodontitis. Similarly, no causal effect of periodontitis on PCOS was shown with the odds ratio for PCOS was 1.17 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.49;P= 0.21) per one-unit increase in the log-odds ratio of periodontitis. Consistent results were yielded via additional MR methods. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated no presence of horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity.The bidirectional MR study couldn't provide convincing evidence for the causal relationship between genetic liability to PCOS and periodontitis in the Europeans.

While the mechanisms underlying the impact of maternal obesity on fetal myeloid cells are emerging, the consequences for T cells remain poorly defined. In this study, we collected umbilical cord blood samples from infants born to lean mothers and mothers with obesity and profiled CD4 T cells using flow cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing at resting and followingex vivopolyclonal stimulation. We report that maternal obesity is associated with higher frequencies of memory CD4 T cells suggestive ofin vivoactivation. Moreover, single cell RNA sequencing revealed expansion of an activated subset of memory T cells with maternal obesity. However,ex vivostimulation of purified CD4 T cells resulted in poor cytokine responses, suggesting functional defects. These phenotypic and functional aberrations correlated with methylation and chromatin accessibility changes in loci associated with lymphocyte activation and T cell receptor signaling, suggesting a possible link between maternal obesogenic environment and fetal immune reprogramming. These observations offer a potential explanation for the increased susceptibility to microbial infection in babies born to mothers with obesity.Copyright © 2021 Sureshchandra, Mendoza, Jankeel, Wilson, Marshall and Messaoudi."

Linear mixed-effects models were conducted to identify age-, sex- and age-by-sex-associated methylation markers using a discovery (controls)-replication (cases) strategy. Replication was further examined using summary statistics from Generation Scotland (GS). Associations between replicated markers and risk of and survival from cancer were assessed using conditional logistic regression and Cox models (hazard ratios (HR)), respectively. We found 32,659, 23,141 and 48 CpGs with replicated associations for age, sex and age-by-sex, respectively. The replication rates for these CpGs using GS summary data were 94%, 86% and 91%, respectively. Significant associations for cancer risk and survival were identified at some individual age-related CpGs. Opposite to previous findings using epigenetic clocks, there was a strong negative trend in the association between epigenetic drift and risk of colorectal cancer. Methylation at two CpGs overlappingTMEM49andARXgenes was associated with survival of overall (HR = 0.91,p= 7.7 × 10-4) and colorectal (HR = 1.52,p= 1.8 × 10-4) cancer, respectively, with significant age-by-sex interaction.

"33911272","The central role of DNA damage in the ageing process.","Nature","Ageing is a complex, multifaceted process leading to widespread functional decline that affects every organ and tissue, but it remains unknown whether ageing has a unifying causal mechanism or is grounded in multiple sources. Phenotypically, the ageing process is associated with a wide variety of features at the molecular, cellular and physiological level-for example, genomic and epigenomic alterations, loss of proteostasis, declining overall cellular and subcellular function and deregulation of signalling systems. However, the relative importance, mechanistic interrelationships and hierarchical order of these features of ageing have not been clarified. Here we synthesize accumulating evidence that DNA damage affects most, if not all, aspects of the ageing phenotype, making it a potentially unifying cause of ageing. Targeting DNA damage and its mechanistic links with the ageing phenotype will provide a logical rationale for developing unified interventions to counteract age-related dysfunction and disease."

However, the pathophysiology underlying increased rates of somatic disease in MDD remains unknown. It has been proposed that MDD represents a state of accelerated cellular aging, and several measures of cellular aging have been developed in recent years. Among such metrics, estimators of biological age based on predictable age-related patterns of DNA methylation (DNAm), so-called 'epigenetic clocks', have shown particular promise for their ability to capture accelerated aging in psychiatric disease. The recently developed DNAm metric known as 'GrimAge' is unique in that it was trained on time-to-death data and has outperformed its predecessors in predicting both morbidity and mortality. Yet, GrimAge has not been investigated in MDD. Here we measured GrimAge in 49 somatically healthy unmedicated individuals with MDD and 60 age-matched healthy controls. We found that individuals with MDD exhibited significantly greater GrimAge relative to their chronological age ('AgeAccelGrim') compared to healthy controls (p = 0.001), with a median of 2 years of excess cellular aging. This difference remained significant after controlling for sex, current smoking status, and body-mass index (p = 0.015). These findings are consistent with prior suggestions of accelerated cellular aging in MDD, but are the first to demonstrate this with an epigenetic metric predictive of premature mortality."

Therefore, birth weight in a Polish prospective cohort of 912 mothers was investigated depending on the pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). The whole cohort and the subgroup of gestational weight gain (GWG) in the range of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations, as well as 'healthy' women (who did not develop diabetes or hypertension in this pregnancy) were investigated. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of the newborn outcomes (with 95% confidence intervals, CI) for obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) vs. normal BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m2) were calculated using multiple logistic regression. Risk profiles (in the Lowess method) were presented for BMI values (kg/m2) and threshold BMI values were calculated. (1) In the cohort, LBW affected 6.6% of pregnancies, fetal growth restriction (FGR) 2.3%, and macrosomia 10.6%. (2) The adjusted risk of macrosomia was more than three-fold higher for obesity compared to normal BMI in the whole cohort (AOR = 3.21 (1.69-6.1),p< 0.001) and the result was maintained in the subgroups. A 17-fold higher adjusted LBW risk for obesity was found (AOR = 17.42 (1.5-202.6),p= 0.022), but only in the normal GWG subgroup. The FGR risk profile was U-shaped: in the entire cohort, the risk was more than three times higher for obesity (AOR = 3.12 (1.02-9.54),p= 0.045) and underweight (AOR = 3.84 (1.13-13.0),p= 0.031). (3) The risk profiles showed that the highest BMI values were found to be associated with a higher risk of these three newborn outcomes and the threshold BMI was 23.7 kg/m2for macrosomia, 26.2 kg/m2for LBW, and 31.8 kg/m2for FGR. These results confirm the multidirectional effects of obesity on fetal growth (low birth weight, fetal growth restriction, and macrosomia).

Here, we perform a head-to-head comparison of previously published DNA methylation markers and propose a potential prognostic model for clear cell RCC (ccRCC).Promoter methylation of PCDH8, BNC1, SCUBE3, GREM1, LAD1, NEFH, RASSF1A, GATA5, SFRP1, CDO1, and NEURL was determined by nested methylation-specific PCR. To identify clinically relevant methylated regions, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to guide primer design. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from 336 non-metastatic ccRCC patients from the prospective Netherlands Cohort Study (NLCS) were used to develop a Cox proportional hazards model using stepwise backward elimination and bootstrapping to correct for optimism. For validation purposes, FFPE ccRCC tissue of 64 patients from the University Hospitals Leuven and a series of 232 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used.Methylation of GREM1, GATA5, LAD1, NEFH, NEURL, and SFRP1 was associated with poor ccRCC-specific survival, independent of age, sex, tumor size, TNM stage or tumor grade. Moreover, the association between GREM1, NEFH, and NEURL methylation and outcome was shown to be dependent on the genomic region. A prognostic biomarker model containing GREM1, GATA5, LAD1, NEFH and NEURL methylation in combination with clinicopathological characteristics, performed better compared to the model with clinicopathological characteristics only (clinical model), in both the NLCS and the validation population with a c-statistic of 0.71 versus 0.65 and a c-statistic of 0.95 versus 0.86 consecutively. However, the biomarker model had limited added prognostic value in the TCGA series with a c-statistic of 0.76 versus 0.75 for the clinical model.In this study we performed a head-to-head comparison of potential prognostic methylation markers for ccRCC using a novel approach to guide primers design which utilizes the optimal location for measuring DNA methylation. Using this approach, we identified five methylation markers that potentially show prognostic value in addition to currently known clinicopathological factors."

However, the functional role of DNA methylation in regulating the expression of microRNA (miRNA) genes during the formation and development of nitrogen-fixing nodules remains largely unknown. In this study, we profiled DNA methylation patterns of miRNA genes during nodule formation, development, and early senescence stages in soybean (Glycine max) through the analysis of methylC-seq data. Absolute DNA methylation levels in the CG, CHH, and CHH sequence contexts over the promoter and primary transcript regions of miRNA genes were significantly higher in the nodules compared with the corresponding root tissues at these three distinct nodule developmental stages. We identified a total of 82 differentially methylated miRNAs in the nodules compared with roots. Differential DNA methylation of these 82 miRNAs was detected only in the promoter (69), primary transcript region (3), and both in the promoter and primary transcript regions (10). The large majority of these differentially methylated miRNAs were hypermethylated in nodules compared with the corresponding root tissues and were found mainly in the CHH context and showed stage-specific methylation patterns. Differentially methylated regions in the promoters of 25 miRNAs overlapped with transposable elements, a finding that may explain the vulnerability of miRNAs to DNA methylation changes during nodule development. Gene expression analysis of a set of promoter-differentially methylated miRNAs pointed to a negative association between DNA methylation and miRNA expression. Gene Ontology and pathways analyses indicate that changes in DNA methylation of miRNA genes are reprogrammed and contribute to nodule development through indirect regulation of genes involved in cellular processes and pathways with well-established roles in nodulation.Copyright © 2021 Piya, Lopes-Caitar, Kim, Pantalone, Krishnan and Hewezi."
"33891288","Perspectives for epigenetic editing in crops.","Transgenic Res","Site-specific nucleases (SSNs) have drawn much attention in plant biotechnology due to their ability to drive precision mutagenesis, gene targeting or allele replacement. However, when devoid of its nuclease activity, the underlying DNA-binding activity of SSNs can be used to bring other protein functional domains close to specific genomic sites, thus expanding further the range of applications of the technology. In particular, the addition of functional domains encoding epigenetic effectors and chromatin modifiers to the CRISPR/Cas ribonucleoprotein complex opens the possibility to introduce targeted epigenomic modifications in plants in an easily programmable manner. Here we examine some of the most important agronomic traits known to be controlled epigenetically and review the best studied epigenetic catalytic effectors in plants, such as DNA methylases/demethylases or histone acetylases/deacetylases and their associated marks. We also review the most efficient strategies developed to date to functionalize Cas proteins with both catalytic and non-catalytic epigenetic effectors, and the ability of these domains to influence the expression of endogenous genes in a regulatable manner. Based on these new technical developments, we discuss the possibilities offered by epigenetic editing tools in plant biotechnology and their implications in crop breeding."

Following the discovery of the initial CRISPR/Cas-based system, the technology has been advanced to facilitate a multitude of different functions. These include development as a base editor, prime editor, epigenetic editor, and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR activator (CRISPRa) gene regulators. It can also be used for chromatin and RNA targeting and imaging. Its applications have proved revolutionary across numerous biological fields, especially in biomedical and agricultural improvement. As a diagnostic tool, CRISPR has been developed to aid the detection and screening of both human and plant diseases, and has even been applied during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CRISPR/Cas is also being trialed as a new form of gene therapy for treating various human diseases, including cancers, and has aided drug development. In terms of agricultural breeding, precise targeting of biological pathways via CRISPR/Cas has been key to regulating molecular biosynthesis and allowing modification of proteins, starch, oil, and other functional components for crop improvement. Adding to this, CRISPR/Cas has been shown capable of significantly enhancing both plant tolerance to environmental stresses and overall crop yield via the targeting of various agronomically important gene regulators. Looking to the future, increasing the efficiency and precision of CRISPR/Cas delivery systems and limiting off-target activity are two major challenges for wider application of the technology.

This leads to the challenge of treating an aging CF population, while previous research has largely focused on pediatric and adolescent patients. Chronic inflammation is not only a hallmark of CF lung disease, but also of the aging process. However, very little is known about the effects of an accelerated aging pathology in CF lungs. Several chronic lung disease pathologies show signs of chronic inflammation with accelerated aging, also termed ""inflammaging""; the most notable being chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In these disease entities, accelerated aging has been implicated in the pathogenesis via interference with tissue repair mechanisms, alterations of the immune system leading to impaired defense against pulmonary infections and induction of a chronic pro-inflammatory state. In addition, CF lungs have been shown to exhibit increased expression of senescence markers. Sustained airway inflammation also leads to the degradation and increased turnover of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). This further reduces CFTR function and may prevent the novel CFTR modulator therapies from developing their full efficacy. Therefore, novel therapies targeting aging processes in CF lungs could be promising. This review summarizes the current research on CF in an aging population focusing on accelerated aging in the context of chronic airway inflammation and therapy implications.Copyright © 2021 Künzi, Easter, Hirsch and Krick."

Changes in fetal DNA methylation may be an underlying mechanism. This may be reflected in altered epigenetic aging of the fetus, as compared to chronological aging. The difference between gestational age derived in clinical practice and gestational age predicted from neonatal DNA methylation data is referred to as gestational age acceleration. Differences in circulating folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations during fetal development may be associated with gestational age acceleration.Up to 1346 newborns participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study, had both cord blood DNA methylation data available and information on plasma folate, serum total and active B12 and plasma homocysteine concentrations, measured in early pregnancy and/or in cord blood. A subgroup of 380 newborns had mothers with optimal pregnancy dating based on a regular menstrual cycle and a known date of last menstrual period. For comparison, gestational age acceleration was calculated based the method of both Bohlin and Knight. In the total study population, which was more similar to Bohlin's training population, one standard deviation score (SDS) higher maternal plasma homocysteine concentrations was nominally associated with positive gestational age acceleration [0.07 weeks, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02, 0.13] by Bohlin's method. In the subgroup with pregnancy dating based on last menstrual period, the method that was also used in Knight's training population, one SDS higher cord serum total and active B12 concentrations were nominally associated with negative gestational age acceleration [(- 0.16 weeks, 95% CI - 0.30, - 0.02) and (- 0.15 weeks, 95% CI - 0.29, - 0.01), respectively] by Knight's method.We found some evidence to support associations of higher maternal plasma homocysteine concentrations with positive gestational age acceleration, suggesting faster epigenetic than clinical gestational aging. Cord serum vitamin B12 concentrations may be associated with negative gestational age acceleration, indicating slower epigenetic than clinical gestational aging. Future studies could examine whether altered fetal epigenetic aging underlies the associations of circulating homocysteine and vitamin B12 blood concentrations during fetal development with long-term health outcomes."
"33926514","Characteristics of epigenetic aging across gestational and perinatal tissues.","Clin Epigenetics","Epigenetic clocks have been used to indicate differences in biological states between individuals of same chronological age. However, so far, only few studies have examined epigenetic aging in newborns-especially regarding different gestational or perinatal tissues. In this study, we investigated which birth- and pregnancy-related variables are most important in predicting gestational epigenetic age acceleration or deceleration (i.e., the deviation between gestational epigenetic age estimated from the DNA methylome and chronological gestational age) in chorionic villus, placenta and cord blood tissues from two independent study cohorts (ITU, n = 639 and PREDO, n = 966). We further characterized the correspondence of epigenetic age deviations between these tissues.Among the most predictive factors of epigenetic age deviations in single tissues were child sex, birth length, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal mental disorders until childbirth, delivery mode and parity. However, the specific factors related to epigenetic age deviation and the direction of association differed across tissues. In individuals with samples available from more than one tissue, relative epigenetic age deviations were not correlated across tissues.Gestational epigenetic age acceleration or deceleration was not related to more favorable or unfavorable factors in one direction in the investigated tissues, and the relative epigenetic age differed between tissues of the same person. This indicates that epigenetic age deviations associate with distinct, tissue specific, factors during the gestational and perinatal period. Our findings suggest that the epigenetic age of the newborn should be seen as a characteristic of a specific tissue, and less as a general characteristic of the child itself."

However, the importance of DNA methylation in ageing remains unclear. The study of subtelomeric regions could give promising insights into this issue. Previously reported associations between susceptibility to age-related diseases and epigenetic instability at subtelomeres suggest that the DNA methylation profile of subtelomeres undergoes remodelling during ageing. In the present work, this hypothesis has been tested in the context of the European large-scale project MARK-AGE. In this cross-sectional study, we profiled the DNA methylation of chromosomes 5 and 21 subtelomeres, in more than 2000 age-stratified women and men recruited in eight European countries. The study included individuals from the general population as well as the offspring of nonagenarians and Down syndrome subjects, who served as putative models of delayed and accelerated ageing, respectively. Significant linear changes of subtelomeric DNA methylation with increasing age were detected in the general population, indicating that subtelomeric DNA methylation changes are typical signs of ageing. Data also show that, compared to the general population, the dynamics of age-related DNA methylation changes are attenuated in the offspring of centenarian, while they accelerate in Down syndrome individuals. This result suggests that subtelomeric DNA methylation changes reflect the rate of ageing progression. We next attempted to trace the age-related changes of subtelomeric methylation back to the influence of diverse variables associated with methylation variations in the population, including demographics, dietary/health habits and clinical parameters. Results indicate that the effects of age on subtelomeric DNA methylation are mostly independent of all other variables evaluated."

However, within populations, biological aging rates vary. Understanding sources of variation in this process is central to understanding the biodemography of natural populations. We constructed a DNA methylation-based age predictor for an intensively studied wild baboon population in Kenya. Consistent with findings in humans, the resulting 'epigenetic clock' closely tracks chronological age, but individuals are predicted to be somewhat older or younger than their known ages. Surprisingly, these deviations are not explained by the strongest predictors of lifespan in this population, early adversity and social integration. Instead, they are best predicted by male dominance rank: high-ranking males are predicted to be older than their true ages, and epigenetic age tracks changes in rank over time. Our results argue that achieving high rank for male baboons - the best predictor of reproductive success - imposes costs consistent with a 'live fast, die young' life-history strategy.© 2021, Anderson et al."

Disturbance in the circadian clock due to shiftwork and chronic jetlag is related to the risk of several disorders such as metabolic syndrome and cancer. Recently, it has been thought that shiftwork increases the risk of sarcopenia which is characterized by age-related decline of muscle mass and its dysfunctions including muscle strength and/or physical performance. First, we summarize the association between circadian rhythm and the occurrence of sarcopenia and discuss its mechanistic insight by focusing on the muscle function and molecular clock gene in knockout or mutant mice. The clock gene knockout or mutant mice showed early aging phenotypes, including low survival rate and muscle loss. It suggests that improvement in the disturbance of the circadian clock plays an important role in the aging process of healthy muscles. Nutritional intake has the potential to augment muscle growth and entrain the peripheral clock. Second, we discuss the potential of chrono-nutrition in preventing aging-related muscle loss and dysfunction.

However, to what extent acute sleep deprivation (SD) has impact on the circadian rhythms of peripheral tissues is not clear. Here, we show that in mouse lung, a 10-h acute sleep deprivation can alter the circadian expression of approximately 3,000 genes. We found that circadian rhythm disappears in genes related to metabolism and signaling pathways regulating protein phosphorylation after acute sleep deprivation, while the core circadian regulators do not change much in rhythmicity. Importantly, the strong positive correlation between mean expression and amplitude (E-A correlation) of cycling genes has been validated in both control and sleep deprivation conditions, supporting the energetic cost optimization model of circadian gene expression. Thus, we reveal that acute sleep deprivation leads to a profound change in the circadian gene transcription that influences the biological functions in lung.Copyright © 2021 Lu, Liu, Ma, Yang and Huang."
"33911229","Environmental influences on the pace of brain development.","Nat Rev Neurosci","Childhood socio-economic status (SES), a measure of the availability of material and social resources, is one of the strongest predictors of lifelong well-being. Here we review evidence that experiences associated with childhood SES affect not only the outcome but also the pace of brain development. We argue that higher childhood SES is associated with protracted structural brain development and a prolonged trajectory of functional network segregation, ultimately leading to more efficient cortical networks in adulthood. We hypothesize that greater exposure to chronic stress accelerates brain maturation, whereas greater access to novel positive experiences decelerates maturation. We discuss the impact of variation in the pace of brain development on plasticity and learning. We provide a generative theoretical framework to catalyse future basic science and translational research on environmental influences on brain development."
"33923831","Effects of Environmental Conditions on Nephron Number: Modeling Maternal Disease and Epigenetic Regulation in Renal Development.","Int J Mol Sci","A growing body of evidence suggests that low nephron numbers at birth can increase the risk of chronic kidney disease or hypertension later in life. Environmental stressors, such as maternal malnutrition, medication and smoking, can influence renal size at birth. Using metanephric organ cultures to model single-variable environmental conditions, models of maternal disease were evaluated for patterns of developmental impairment. While hyperthermia had limited effects on renal development, fetal iron deficiency was associated with severe impairment of renal growth and nephrogenesis with an all-proximal phenotype. Culturing kidney explants under high glucose conditions led to cellular and transcriptomic changes resembling human diabetic nephropathy. Short-term high glucose culture conditions were sufficient for long-term alterations in DNA methylation-associated epigenetic memory. Finally, the role of epigenetic modifiers in renal development was tested using a small compound library. Among the selected epigenetic inhibitors, various compounds elicited an effect on renal growth, such as HDAC (entinostat, TH39), histone demethylase (deferasirox, deferoxamine) and histone methyltransferase (cyproheptadine) inhibitors. Thus, metanephric organ cultures provide a valuable system for studying metabolic conditions and a tool for screening for epigenetic modifiers in renal development."

Here we aim to identify and validate stool-based DNA methylation markers for the early detection of CRC and investigate the biological pathways prone to DNA methylation.DNA methylation marker discovery was performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colon adenocarcinoma data set consisting of normal and primary colon adenocarcinoma tissue. The performance of the five best candidate markers and a previously identified marker, NDRG4, was evaluated on tissues and whole stool samples of healthy subjects and CRC patients using quantitative MSP assays. The results were compared and combined with FIT data. Finally, pathway and gene ontology enrichment analyses were performed using ToppFun, GOrilla and clusterProfiler.GDNF, HAND2, SLC35F3, SNAP91 and SORCS1 were ranked as the best performing markers. Gene combinations of all five markers, NDRG4 and FIT were evaluated to establish the biomarker panel with the highest diagnostic potential, resulting in the identification of GDNF/SNAP91/NDRG4/FIT as the best performing marker panel. Pathway and gene ontology enrichment analyses revealed that genes associated with the nervous system were enriched in the set of best performing CRC-specific biomarkers.In silico discovery analysis using TCGA-derived data yielded a novel DNA-methylation-based assay for the early detection of CRC, potentially improving current screening modalities. Additionally, nervous system-related pathways were enriched in the identified genes, indicating an epigenetic regulation of neuronal genes in CRC."

This is true especially for infants, who are both more exposed and sensitive to their effects. Phthalates are particularly harmful when the exposure occurs during certain critical temporal windows of the development, such as the prenatal and the early postnatal phases. Phthalates may also interfere with the neuroendocrine systems (e.g., thyroid hormone signaling or metabolism), causing disruption of neuronal differentiation and maturation, increasing the risk of behavioral and cognitive disorders (ADHD and autistic behaviors, reduced mental, psychomotor, and IQ development, and emotional problems). Despite more studies being needed to better understand the role of these substances, plenty of evidence suggests the impact of phthalates on the neuroendocrine system development and function. This review aims to update the knowledge on the neuroendocrine consequences of neonatal and perinatal exposure to phthalates."

"33926512","The impact of cell type and context-dependent regulatory variants on human immune traits.","Genome Biol","The vast majority of trait-associated variants identified using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are noncoding, and therefore assumed to impact gene regulation. However, the majority of trait-associated loci are unexplained by regulatory quantitative trait loci (QTLs).We perform a comprehensive characterization of the putative mechanisms by which GWAS loci impact human immune traits. By harmonizing four major immune QTL studies, we identify 26,271 expression QTLs (eQTLs) and 23,121 splicing QTLs (sQTLs) spanning 18 immune cell types. Our colocalization analyses between QTLs and trait-associated loci from 72 GWAS reveals that genetic effects on RNA expression and splicing in immune cells colocalize with 40.4% of GWAS loci for immune-related traits, in many cases increasing the fraction of colocalized loci by two fold compared to previous studies. Notably, we find that the largest contributors of this increase are splicing QTLs, which colocalize on average with 14% of all GWAS loci that do not colocalize with eQTLs. By contrast, we find that cell type-specific eQTLs, and eQTLs with small effect sizes contribute very few new colocalizations. To investigate the 60% of GWAS loci that remain unexplained, we collect H3K27ac CUT&Tag data from rheumatoid arthritis and healthy controls, and find large-scale differences between immune cells from the different disease contexts, including at regions overlapping unexplained GWAS loci.Altogether, our work supports RNA splicing as an important mediator of genetic effects on immune traits, and suggests that we must expand our study of regulatory processes in disease contexts to improve functional interpretation of as yet unexplained GWAS loci."

We aimed to prioritize genes that were pleiotropically or potentially causally associated with MDD. We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method integrating GWAS and gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data in 13 brain regions to identify genes that were pleiotropically associated with MDD. In addition, we repeated the analysis by using the meta-analyzed version of the eQTL summary data in the brain (brain-eMeta). We identified multiple significant genes across different brain regions that may be involved in the pathogenesis of MDD. The prime-specific gene BTN3A2 (corresponding probe: ENSG00000186470.9) was the top hit showing pleiotropic association with MDD in 9 of the 13 brain regions and in brain-eMeta, after correction for multiple testing. Many of the identified genes are located in the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6 and are mainly involved in the immune response. Our SMR analysis indicated that multiple genes showed pleiotropic association with MDD across the brain regions. These findings provided important leads to a better understanding of the mechanism of MDD and revealed potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and effective treatment of MDD."

Very few studies had evaluated expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), and insights of susceptibility genes were limited due to scarcity of available brain tissues. Moreover, no prior study had examined the effect of glioma risk alleles on alternative RNA splicing.This study explored splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL) as molecular QTL and improved the power of QTL mapping through meta-analyses of bothciseQTL and sQTL.We first evaluated eQTLs and sQTLs of the CommonMind Consortium (CMC) and Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) using genotyping, or whole-genome sequencing and RNA-seq data. Alternative splicing events were characterized using an annotation-free method that detected intron excision events. Then, we conducted meta-analyses by pooling the eQTL and sQTL results of CMC and GTEx using the inverse variance-weighted model. Afterward, we integrated QTL meta-analysis results (Q < 0.05) with the Glioma International Case Control Study (GICC) GWAS meta-analysis (case:12,496, control:18,190), using a summary statistics-based mendelian randomization (SMR) method.Between CMC and GTEx, we combined the QTL data of 354 unique individuals of European ancestry. SMR analyses revealed 15 eQTLs in 11 loci and 32 sQTLs in 9 loci relevant to glioma risk. Two loci only harbored sQTLs (1q44 and 16p13.3). In seven loci, both eQTL and sQTL coexisted (2q33.3, 7p11.2, 11q23.3 15q24.2, 16p12.1, 20q13.33, and 22q13.1), but the target genes were different for five of these seven loci. Three eQTL loci (9p21.3, 20q13.33, and 22q13.1) and 4 sQTL loci (11q23.3, 16p13.3, 16q12.1, and 20q13.33) harbored multiple target genes. Eight target genes of sQTLs (C2orf80,SEC61G,TMEM25,PHLDB1,RP11-161M6.2,HEATR3,RTEL1-TNFRSF6B, andLIME1) had multiple alternatively spliced transcripts.Our study revealed that the regulation of transcriptome by glioma risk alleles is complex, with the potential for eQTL and sQTL jointly affecting gliomagenesis in risk loci. QTLs of many loci involved multiple target genes, some of which were specific to alternative splicing. Therefore, quantitative trait loci that evaluate only total gene expression will miss many important target genes.Copyright © 2021 Patro, Nousome, The Glioma International Case Control Study (GICC) and Lai."

Altered immune responses characterized by increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neuroinflammation are common findings in patients with AD and in corresponding animal models. Dendritic cells (DCs) represent a heterogeneous population of myeloid cells that orchestrate innate and adaptive immune responses and self-tolerance. Upon sensing exogenous and endogenous danger signals, mature DCs secrete proinflammatory factors, acquire migratory and antigen presenting capacities and thus contribute to neuroinflammation in trauma, autoimmunity, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about the involvement of DCs in the pathogenesis of AD. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on DCs in peripheral immune responses and neuroinflammation in MDD and BD. In addition, we consider the impact of DCs on neuroinflammation and behavior in animal models of AD. Finally, we will discuss therapeutic perspectives targeting DCs and their effector molecules in mood disorders."

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified more than 40 loci associated with AD risk. However, most of the disease-associated variants reside in non-coding regions of the genome, making it difficult to elucidate how they affect disease susceptibility. Nonetheless, identification of the regulatory elements, genes, pathways and cell type/tissue(s) impacted by these variants to modulate AD risk is critical to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and ability to develop effective therapeutics. In this review, we provide an overview of the methods and approaches used in the field to identify the functional effects of AD risk variants in the causal path to disease risk modification as well as describe the most recent findings. We first discuss efforts in cell type/tissue prioritization followed by recent progress in candidate causal variant and gene nomination. We discuss statistical methods for fine-mapping as well as approaches that integrate multiple levels of evidence, such as epigenomic and transcriptomic data, to identify causal variants and risk mechanisms of AD-associated loci. Additionally, we discuss experimental approaches and data resources that will be needed to validate and further elucidate the effects of these variants and genes on biological pathways, cellular phenotypes and disease risk. Finally, we discuss future steps that need to be taken to ensure that AD GWAS functional mapping efforts lead to novel findings and bring us closer to finding effective treatments for this devastating disease."

Genetics is increasingly being recognized to play a substantive role in the susceptibility, prognosis, and treatment of common diseases. Due to recent and rapid advancements in characterization of genetic variants and large-scale genotyping platforms, multiple genes and genetic variants have now been identified for common, complex diseases. The most efficient method for gene identification at present appears to be large-scale association-based studies, which integrate genetic and epidemiological principles. As the strategy for gene identification studies has shifted toward genetic association-based methods rather than traditional linkage analysis, epidemiological methods are increasingly being integrated into genetic investigations and in public health research. Consequently, the disciplines of genetics and epidemiology, which historically have functioned separately, have been integrated into a hybrid discipline referred to as genetic epidemiology. In this chapter, we review methods for establishing the genetic burden of complex genetic disease, followed by methods for gene and/or genetic variant identification. When appropriate, we will highlight the epidemiological issues and clinical applications that guide these methods."

"33860357","The regulation mechanisms and the Lamarckian inheritance property of DNA methylation in animals.","Mamm Genome","DNA methylation is a stable and heritable epigenetic mechanism, of which the main functions are stabilizing the transcription of genes and promoting genetic conservation. In animals, the direct molecular inducers of DNA methylation mainly include histone covalent modification and non-coding RNA, whereas the fundamental regulators of DNA methylation are genetic and environmental factors. As is well known, competition is present everywhere in life systems, and will finally strike a balance that is optimal for the animal's survival and reproduction. The same goes for the regulation of DNA methylation. Genetic and environmental factors, respectively, are responsible for the programmed and plasticity changes of DNA methylation, and keen competition exists between genetically influenced procedural remodeling and environmentally influenced plastic alteration. In this process, genetic and environmental factors collaboratively decide the methylation patterns of corresponding loci. DNA methylation alterations induced by environmental factors can be transgenerationally inherited, and exhibit the characteristic of Lamarckian inheritance. Further research on regulatory mechanisms and the environmental plasticity of DNA methylation will provide strong support for understanding the biological function and evolutionary effects of DNA methylation."

Whilst the cumulative effect of exposure to conventional cardiovascular risk factors is important, recent evidence highlights clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminant potential (CHIP) as a further key risk factor. CHIP reflects the accumulation of somatic, potentially pro-leukaemic gene mutations within haematopoietic stem cells over time. The most common mutations associated with CHIP and CVD occur in genes that also play central roles in the regulation of inflammation. While CHIP carriers have a low risk of haematological malignant transformation (<1% per year), their relative risk of mortality is increased by 40% and this reflects an excess of cardiovascular events. Evidence linking CHIP, inflammation and atherosclerotic disease has recently become better defined. However, there is a paucity of information about the role of CHIP in the development and progression of heart failure, particularly heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). While systemic inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of both heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction (EF), it may be of greater relevance in the pathophysiology of HFpEF, which is also strongly associated with ageing. This review describes CHIP and its pathogenetic links with ageing, inflammation and CVD, while providing insight into its putative role in HFpEF.© 2021 The Author(s)."

A total of 291 microRNAs in serum samples of five dogs with myxomatous mitral valve degeneration (MMVD) and five dogs with pulmonic stenosis (PS) were compared with those of five healthy dogs using microarray analysis. Results of microarray analysis revealed up-regulation of cfa-miR-130b [fold change (FC) = 2.13,p= 0.014), down-regulation of cfa-miR-375 (FC = 1.51,p= 0.014), cfa-miR-425 (FC = 2.56,p= 0.045), cfa-miR-30d (FC = 3.02,p= 0.047), cfa-miR-151 (FC = 1.89,p= 0.023), cfa-miR-19b (FC = 3.01,p= 0.008), and cfa-let-7g (FC = 2.53,p= 0.015) in MMVD group which showed eccentric cardiac hypertrophy, up-regulation of cfa-miR-346 (FC = 2.74,p= 0.032), down-regulation of cfa-miR-505 (FC = 1.56,p= 0.016) in PS group which showed concentric cardiac hypertrophy, and down-regulation of cfa-miR-30c (FC = 3.45,p= 0.013 in MMVD group; FC = 3.31,p= 0.014 in PS group) and cfa-let-7b (FC = 11.42,p= 0.049 in MMVD group; FC = 5.88,p= 0.01 in PS group) in both MMVD and PS groups. In addition, the unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed microRNAs in each group resulted in complete separation of healthy dogs from dogs with heart diseases. Therefore, eleven microRNAs among 291 microRNAs were identified as differentially expressed circulating microRNAs related to MMVD or PS in dogs.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between genetic predisposition, Aβ misfolding in blood plasma, a unique marker of Alzheimer associated neuropathological changes, and Alzheimer's disease occurrence within 14 years. Within a German community-based cohort, two polygenic risk scores (clinical Alzheimer's disease and Aβ42based) were calculated, APOE genotype was determined, and Aβ misfolding in blood plasma was measured by immuno-infrared sensor in 59 participants diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease during 14 years of follow-up and 581 participants without dementia diagnosis. Associations between each genetic marker and Aβ misfolding were assessed through logistic regression and the ability of each genetic marker and Aβ misfolding to predict Alzheimer's disease was determined. The Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk score and APOE ε4 presence were associated to Aβ misfolding (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: per standard deviation increase of score: 1.25, 1.03-1.51; APOE ε4 presence: 1.61, 1.04-2.49). No association was evident for the Aβ polygenic risk score. All genetic markers were predictive of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis albeit much less so than Aβ misfolding (areas under the curve: Aβ polygenic risk score: 0.55; AD polygenic risk score: 0.59; APOE ε4: 0.63; Aβ misfolding: 0.84). Clinical Alzheimer's genetic risk was associated to early pathological changes (Aβ misfolding) measured in blood, however, predicted Alzheimer's disease less accurately than Aβ misfolding itself. Genetic predisposition may provide information regarding disease initiation, while Aβ misfolding could be important in clinical risk prediction."

Identifying common genetic variants driving differences in transcript expression that confer AD risk is necessary to elucidate AD mechanism and develop therapeutic interventions. We modify the FUSION transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) pipeline to ingest gene expression values from multiple neocortical regions.A combined dataset of 2003 genotypes clustered to 1000 Genomes individuals from Utah with Northern and Western European ancestry (CEU) was used to construct a training set of 790 genotypes paired to 888 RNASeq profiles from temporal cortex (TCX = 248), prefrontal cortex (FP = 50), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG = 41), superior temporal gyrus (STG = 34), parahippocampal cortex (PHG = 34), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC = 461). Following within-tissue normalization and covariate adjustment, predictive weights to impute expression components based on a gene's surrounding cis-variants were trained. The FUSION pipeline was modified to support input of pre-scaled expression values and support cross validation with a repeated measure design arising from the presence of multiple transcriptome samples from the same individual across different tissues.Cis-variant architecture alone was informative to train weights and impute expression for 6780 (49.67%) autosomal genes, the majority of which significantly correlated with gene expression; FDR < 5%: N = 6775 (99.92%), Bonferroni: N = 6716 (99.06%). Validation of weights in 515 matched genotype to RNASeq profiles from the CommonMind Consortium (CMC) was (72.14%) in DLPFC profiles. Association of imputed expression components from all 2003 genotype profiles yielded 8 genes significantly associated with AD (FDR < 0.05): APOC1, EED, CD2AP, CEACAM19, CLPTM1, MTCH2, TREM2, and KNOP1.We provide evidence of cis-genetic variation conferring AD risk through 8 genes across six distinct genomic loci. Moreover, we provide expression weights for 6780 genes as a valuable resource to the community, which can be abstracted across the neocortex and a wide range of neuronal phenotypes."

As a complex disease, osteoporosis is influenced by many factors, including diet (e.g. calcium and protein intake), physical activity, endocrine status, coexisting diseases and genetic factors. In this review, we first summarize the discovery from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in the bone field in the last 12 years. To date, GWASs and meta-analyses have discovered hundreds of loci that are associated with bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporosis, and osteoporotic fractures. However, the GWAS approach has sometimes been criticized because of the small effect size of the discovered variants and the mystery of missing heritability, these two questions could be partially explained by the newly raised conceptual models, such as omnigenic model and natural selection. Finally, we introduce the clinical use of GWAS findings in the bone field, such as the identification of causal clinical risk factors, the development of drug targets and disease prediction. Despite the fruitful GWAS discoveries in the bone field, most of these GWAS participants were of European descent, and more genetic studies should be carried out in other ethnic populations to benefit disease prediction in the corresponding population."

People in northern Japan tend to be taller than those in southern Japan. The differences in annual temperature and day length between the northern and southern prefectures of Japan have been suggested as possible causes of the height gradient. Although height is well known to be a polygenic trait with high heritability, the genetic contributions to the gradient have not yet been explored. Polygenic score (PS) is calculated by aggregating the effects of genetic variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to predict the traits of individual subjects. Here, we calculated the PS of height for 10,840 Japanese individuals from all 47 prefectures in Japan. The median height PS for each prefecture was significantly correlated with the mean height of females and males obtained from another independent Japanese nation-wide height dataset, suggesting genetic contribution to the observed height gradient. We also found that individuals and prefectures genetically closer to continental East Asian ancestry tended to have a higher PS; modern Japanese people are considered to have originated as result of admixture between indigenous Jomon people and immigrants from continental East Asia. Another PS analysis based on the GWAS using only the mainland Japanese was conducted to evaluate the effect of population stratification on PS. The result also supported genetic contribution to height, and indicated that the PS might be affected by a bias due to population stratification even in a relatively homogenous population like Japanese."
"33900014","Spurious regulatory connections dictate the expression-fitness landscape of translation factors.","Mol Syst Biol","During steady-state cell growth, individual enzymatic fluxes can be directly inferred from growth rate by mass conservation, but the inverse problem remains unsolved. Perturbing the flux and expression of a single enzyme could have pleiotropic effects that may or may not dominate the impact on cell fitness. Here, we quantitatively dissect the molecular and global responses to varied expression of translation termination factors (peptide release factors, RFs) in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. While endogenous RF expression maximizes proliferation, deviations in expression lead to unexpected distal regulatory responses that dictate fitness reduction. Molecularly, RF depletion causes expression imbalance at specific operons, which activates master regulators and detrimentally overrides the transcriptome. Through these spurious connections, RF abundances are thus entrenched by focal points within the regulatory network, in one case located at a single stop codon. Such regulatory entrenchment suggests that predictive bottom-up models of expression-fitness landscapes will require near-exhaustive characterization of parts.© 2021 The Authors.

Phenotypically, the data were best characterized by a single general factor of psychopathology, a factor structure that was replicated across genders and age groups. Although externalizing PGSs (cannabis use, antisocial behavior, alcohol dependence, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) were not associated with any phenotypes, PGSs for major depressive disorder, neuroticism, and anxiety disorders were associated with both internalizing and externalizing phenotypes. Moreover, the variance explained in the general factor of psychopathology increased by twofold (from 1% to 2%) using the latent internalizing or latent one-factor PGSs, derived using weights from Genomic Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), compared with any of the individual PGSs. Collectively, results suggest that genetic risk factors for and phenotypic markers of psychiatric disorders are transdiagnostic in older adults of European ancestry. Alternative explanations are discussed, including methodological limitations of GWAS and phenotypic measurement of psychiatric outcome in large-scale population-based studies."

We used genome-wide data to identify genomic regions associated with key traits that distinguish two ecomorphs of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)-insectivores and piscivores-that coexist for the non-breeding portion of the year in Kootenay Lake, southeastern British Columbia. ""Gerrards"" are large-bodied, rapidly growing piscivores with high metabolic rates that spawn north of Kootenay Lake in the Lardeau River, in contrast to the insectivorous populations that are on average smaller in body size, with lower growth and metabolic rates, mainly forage on aquatic insects, and spawn in tributaries immediately surrounding Kootenay Lake. We used pool-seq data representing ~ 60% of the genome and 80 fish per population to assess the level of genomic divergence between ecomorphs and to identify and interrogate loci that may play functional or selective roles in their divergence.Genomic divergence was high between sympatric insectivores and piscivores ([Formula: see text] = 0.188), and in fact higher than between insectivorous populations from Kootenay Lake and the Blackwater River ([Formula: see text] = 0.159) that are > 500 km apart. A window-based [Formula: see text] analysis did not reveal ""islands"" of genomic differentiation; however, the window with highest [Formula: see text] estimate did include a gene associated with insulin secretion. Although we explored the use of the ""Local score"" approach to identify genomic outlier regions, this method was ultimately not used because simulations revealed a high false discovery rate (~ 20%). Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified several growth processes as enriched in genes occurring in the ~ 200 most divergent genomic windows, indicating many loci of small effect involved in growth and growth-related metabolic processes are associated with the divergence of these ecomorphs.Our results reveal a high degree of genomic differentiation between piscivorous and insectivorous populations and indicate that the large body piscivorous phenotype is likely not due to one or a few loci of large effect. Rather, the piscivore phenotype may be controlled by several loci of small effect, thus highlighting the power of whole-genome resequencing in identifying genomic regions underlying population-level phenotypic divergences."

One approach to achieving this is antenatal vitamin D supplementation. The Maternal Vitamin D Osteoporosis Study is a randomised placebo-controlled trial, the aim of which was to assess the effect of antenatal vitamin D supplementation (1000 IU/day cholecalciferol) on offspring bone mass at birth. The study has since extended the follow up into childhood and diversified to assess demographic, lifestyle and genetic factors that determine the biochemical response to antenatal vitamin D supplementation, and to understand the mechanisms underpinning the effects of vitamin D supplementation on offspring bone development, including epigenetics. The demonstration of positive effects of maternal pregnancy vitamin D supplementation on offspring bone development and the delineation of underlying biological mechanisms inform clinical care and future public-health policies.© The Author(s), 2021."

Short, double-stranded DNA sequence motifs are routinely implicated in TF recruitment, but many questions remain on how binding site specificity is governed.Herein, we reveal a previously unappreciated role for DNA secondary structures as key features for TF recruitment. In a systematic, genome-wide study, we discover that endogenous G-quadruplex secondary structures (G4s) are prevalent TF binding sites in human chromatin. Certain TFs bind G4s with affinities comparable to double-stranded DNA targets. We demonstrate that, in a chromatin context, this binding interaction is competed out with a small molecule. Notably, endogenous G4s are prominent binding sites for a large number of TFs, particularly at promoters of highly expressed genes.Our results reveal a novel non-canonical mechanism for TF binding whereby G4s operate as common binding hubs for many different TFs to promote increased transcription."

The role of the DNA CpG methylome in specifying these two B-cell fates is still unclear. Here we profile the CpG modifications and transcriptomes of peritoneal B1a and follicular B2 cells, as well as their respective proB cell precursors in the fetal liver and adult bone marrow from wild-type and CD19-Cre Dnmt3a floxed mice lacking DNMT3A in the B lineage. We show that an underlying foundational CpG methylome is stably established during B lineage commitment and is overlaid with a DNMT3A-maintained dynamic methylome that is sculpted in distinct ways in B1a and B2 cells. This dynamic DNMT3A-maintained methylome is composed of novel enhancers that are closely linked to lineage-specific genes. While DNMT3A maintains the methylation state of these enhancers in both B1a and B2 cells, the dynamic methylome undergoes a prominent programmed demethylation event during B1a but not B2 cell development. We propose that the methylation pattern of DNMT3A-maintained enhancers is determined by the coincident recruitment of DNMT3A and TET enzymes, which regulate the developmental expression of B1a and B2 lineage-specific genes."

Rumen-protected niacin (RPN) is proposed as a potential alleviator for vasoconstriction produced by fescue toxicity. Complete blood count (CBC) analysis was utilized for detection of significant responses to treatments applied. Our objectives were as follows: (a) to analyze changes in CBC due to fescue toxicity, maternal resistance level, and RPN in growing offspring; and (b) to assess the effects of maternal resistance level when consuming endophyte-infected tall fescue seeds in addition to RPN in offspring performance. Body weight, average daily gain, or health status were not improved by RPN or the genetic test to detect fescue toxicity resistance. Typical signs of alkaloids intoxication and heat stress were noticed in offspring. Particularly, rectal temperature was greater for susceptible control heifers. Results showed that susceptible control offspring presented signs of anemia denoted by low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). High levels of white blood cells (WBC) and basophils in combination to low neutrophils to lymphocytes ratio were the signs of infection or inflammation detected in the CBC analysis, especially in tolerant niacin steers. Furthermore, offspring of control heifers had a greater percentage of reticulocytes and RDW, denoting signs of anemia."

Although most of the SLE-associated loci are located in regulatory regions, there is a lack of global information about transcription factor (TFs) activities, the mode of regulation of the TFs, or the cell or sample-specific regulatory circuits. The aim of this work is to decipher TFs implicated in SLE.In order to decipher regulatory mechanisms in SLE, we have inferred TF activities from transcriptomic data for almost all human TFs, defined clusters of SLE patients based on the estimated TF activities and analyzed the differential activity patterns among SLE and healthy samples in two different cohorts. The Transcription Factor activity matrix was used to stratify SLE patients and define sets of TFs with statistically significant differential activity among the disease and control samples.TF activities were able to identify two main subgroups of patients characterized by distinct neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), with consistent patterns in two independent datasets-one from pediatric patients and other from adults. Furthermore, after contrasting all subgroups of patients and controls, we obtained a significant and robust list of 14 TFs implicated in the dysregulation of SLE by different mechanisms and pathways. Among them, well-known regulators of SLE, such as STAT or IRF, were found, but others suggest new pathways that might have important roles in SLE.These results provide a foundation to comprehend the regulatory mechanism underlying SLE and the established regulatory factors behind SLE heterogeneity that could be potential therapeutic targets."
"33924316","Advances in Understanding of the Role of Lipid Metabolism in Aging.","Cells","During aging, body adiposity increases with changes in the metabolism of lipids and their metabolite levels. Considering lipid metabolism, excess adiposity with increased lipotoxicity leads to various age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. However, the multifaceted nature and complexities of lipid metabolism make it difficult to delineate its exact mechanism and role during aging. With advances in genetic engineering techniques, recent studies have demonstrated that changes in lipid metabolism are associated with aging and age-related diseases. Lipid accumulation and impaired fatty acid utilization in organs are associated with pathophysiological phenotypes of aging. Changes in adipokine levels contribute to aging by modulating changes in systemic metabolism and inflammation. Advances in lipidomic techniques have identified changes in lipid profiles that are associated with aging. Although it remains unclear how lipid metabolism is regulated during aging, or how lipid metabolites impact aging, evidence suggests a dynamic role for lipid metabolism and its metabolites as active participants of signaling pathways and regulators of gene expression. This review describes recent advances in our understanding of lipid metabolism in aging, including established findings and recent approaches."

Diverse and tissue-specific mechanisms drive the health improvement. Here, we performed tissue-specific transcriptional and proteomic profiling of long-livedDrosophila dilp2-3,5mutants, and identified tissue-specific regulation of >3600 transcripts and >3700 proteins. Most expression changes were regulated post-transcriptionally in the fat body, and only in mutants infected with the endosymbiotic bacteria,Wolbachia pipientis, which increases their lifespan. Bioinformatic analysis identified reduced co-translational ER targeting of secreted and membrane-associated proteins and increased DNA damage/repair response proteins. Accordingly, age-related DNA damage and genome instability were lower in fat body of the mutant, and overexpression of a minichromosome maintenance protein subunit extended lifespan. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism showed altered expression in the mutant intestine, and gut-specific overexpression of a lysosomal mannosidase increased autophagy, gut homeostasis, and lifespan. These processes are candidates for combatting ageing-related decline in other organisms.© 2021, Tain et al."

Epigenomic dynamics during human heart organogenesis thus may play a critical role in regulating heart development. However, it is unclear how histone mark H3K36me3 acts on heart development. Here we report that histone-lysine N-methyltransferase SETD2, an H3K36me3 methyltransferase, is a crucial regulator of the mouse heart epigenome.Setd2is highly expressed in embryonic stages and accounts for a predominate role of H3K36me3 in the heart. Loss ofSetd2in cardiac progenitors results in obvious coronary vascular defects and ventricular non-compaction, leading to fetus lethality in mid-gestation, without affecting peripheral blood vessel, yolk sac, and placenta formation. Furthermore, deletion ofSetd2dramatically decreased H3K36me3 level and impacted the transcriptional landscape of key cardiac-related genes, includingRspo3andFlrt2. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that SETD2 plays a primary role in H3K36me3 and is critical for coronary vascular formation and heart development in mice.Copyright © 2021 Chen, Chen, Wang, Tang, Huang, Wang, Wang, Fang, Liu, Li, Ouyang and Han."

This systematic review identified a variety of prenatal and intrapartum factors that were significantly associated with infant temperament: (1) genetic and biological factors: certain genotypes, maternal cortisol and ACTH, and CRHs, (2) environmental factors: substance use such as tobacco, alcohol, and illegal drugs, (3) socio-demographic factor: lower-income, (4) psychological factors: depression or anxiety, eating disorders, personality types of mothers, and domestic violence, and (5) obstetric factors: foetal growth (birth weight), hypertension in mothers, nausea (emesis), and preterm birth.Conclusion:The findings support gene-environment interaction and biological mechanisms for developing infant temperament, suggesting the importance of ensuring a safe and comfortable environment for pregnant mothers, unborn infants, and families during pregnancy and delivery.Copyright © 2021 Takegata, Matsunaga, Ohashi, Toizumi, Yoshida and Kitamura."
"33875015","An EPIC predictor of gestational age and its application to newborns conceived by assisted reproductive technologies.","Clin Epigenetics","Gestational age is a useful proxy for assessing developmental maturity, but correct estimation of gestational age is difficult using clinical measures. DNA methylation at birth has proven to be an accurate predictor of gestational age. Previous predictors of epigenetic gestational age were based on DNA methylation data from the Illumina HumanMethylation 27 K or 450 K array, which have subsequently been replaced by the Illumina MethylationEPIC 850 K array (EPIC). Our aims here were to build an epigenetic gestational age clock specific for the EPIC array and to evaluate its precision and accuracy using the embryo transfer date of newborns from the largest EPIC-derived dataset to date on assisted reproductive technologies (ART).We built an epigenetic gestational age clock using Lasso regression trained on 755 randomly selected non-ART newborns from the Norwegian Study of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (START)-a substudy of the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). For the ART-conceived newborns, the START dataset had detailed information on the embryo transfer date and the specific ART procedure used for conception. The predicted gestational age was compared to clinically estimated gestational age in 200 non-ART and 838 ART newborns using MM-type robust regression. The performance of the clock was compared to previously published gestational age clocks in an independent replication sample of 148 newborns from the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restrictions (PREDO) study-a prospective pregnancy cohort of Finnish women.Our new epigenetic gestational age clock showed higher precision and accuracy in predicting gestational age than previous gestational age clocks (R2 = 0.724, median absolute deviation (MAD) = 3.14 days). Restricting the analysis to CpGs shared between 450 K and EPIC did not reduce the precision of the clock. Furthermore, validating the clock on ART newborns with known embryo transfer date confirmed that DNA methylation is an accurate predictor of gestational age (R2 = 0.767, MAD = 3.7 days).We present the first EPIC-based predictor of gestational age and demonstrate its robustness and precision in ART and non-ART newborns. As more datasets are being generated on the EPIC platform, this clock will be valuable in studies using gestational age to assess neonatal development."

Epigenetic changes of redox homeostasis genes, such as glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLM), glutathione-S-transferase-P1 (GSTP1), thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), and myeloperoxidase (MPO), may be biomarkers of CS. In this study, we assessed the association of DNA methylation levels of these genes with CS and clinical features of CS. We quantitatively analyzed DNA methylation patterns in the promoter or regulatory regions of 4 genes (GCLM, GSTP1, TXNRD1, and MPO) in peripheral blood leukocytes of 59 patients with CS in the acute phase and in 83 relatively healthy individuals (controls) without cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. We found that in both groups, the methylation level of CpG sites in genes TXNRD1 and GSTP1 was ≤ 5%. Lower methylation levels were registered at a CpG site (chr1:94,374,293, GRCh37 [hg19]) in GCLM in patients with ischemic stroke compared with the control group (9% [7%; 11.6%] (median and interquartile range) versus 14.7% [10.4%; 23%], respectively, p < 0.05). In the leukocytes of patients with CS, the methylation level of CpG sites in the analyzed region of MPO (chr17:56,356,470, GRCh3 [hg19]) on average was significantly lower (23.5% [19.3%; 26.7%]) than that in the control group (35.6% [30.4%; 42.6%], p < 0.05). We also found increased methylation of MPO in smokers with CS (27.2% [23.5%; 31.1%]) compared with nonsmokers with CS (21.7% [18.1%; 24.8%]). Thus, hypomethylation of CpG sites in GCLM and MPO in blood leukocytes is associated with CS in the acute phase."

Phase 1: The definitions of self-healing were synthesized from our knowledge of the literature regarding the ontology of self-healing and panels of 25 experts. The initial version of the 12-item questionnaire was developed by the in-depth interviews of focus groups and panels, and the content was validated by six experts. Phase 2: A cross-sectional survey, including a total of 500 community-dwelling older adults with a mean age of 71.76, was then conducted for the preliminary reliability and validity test. The content validity indices were satisfied. Twelve items were retained, and three factors were identified, namely, physical and mental state, socioeconomic and environmental status, and independent lifestyle, which explained 65.8% of the variance under explorative approval. Phase 3: the standardized factor above 60 obtained by confirmatory factorial analysis indicated good convergent validity. The relationship between self-healing and health-related quality of life was confirmed via concurrent validity testing. The SHAS can facilitate the evaluation of factors associated with community-dwelling older adults' self-healing capacity.

Since recent evidence suggests a transgenerational transference of aberrant phenotypes from exposed-parents to non-exposed offspring related to adult-onset diseases including reproductive phenotype. The transgenerational potential of arsenic a well know genotoxic and epigenetic modifier agent has not been assessed in mammals until now. In this experimental study, we evaluated the transgenerational effects of arsenic in a rat model with chronic exposure to arsenic. Rats chronically exposed to arsenic in drinking water (1 mg As2O3/mL) (F0) were mated to produce the arsenic lineage (F1, F2, and F3). The arsenic toxic effects on were evaluated over the four generations by analyzing the DNA methylation percentage, genotoxicity in WBC and physical and reproductive parameters, including sperm quality parameters and histopathological evaluation of the gonads. Chronic exposure to arsenic caused genotoxic damage (F0-F3) different methylation patterns, alterations in physical and reproductive parameters, aberrant morphology in the ovaries (F0 and F1) and testicles (F1-F3), and a decrease in the quality of sperm (F0-F3, except F2). Parental chronic arsenic exposure causes transgenerational genotoxicity and changes in global DNA methylation which might be associated with reproductive defects in rats. Combined with recent studies reveal that disturbances in the early life of an individual can affect the health of later generations."
"33863351","Identification of X-chromosomal genes that drive sex differences in embryonic stem cells through a hierarchical CRISPR screening approach.","Genome Biol","X-chromosomal genes contribute to sex differences, in particular during early development, when both X chromosomes are active in females. Double X-dosage shifts female pluripotent cells towards the naive stem cell state by increasing pluripotency factor expression, inhibiting the differentiation-promoting MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and delaying differentiation.To identify the genetic basis of these sex differences, we use a two-step CRISPR screening approach to comprehensively identify X-linked genes that cause the female pluripotency phenotype in murine embryonic stem cells. A primary chromosome-wide CRISPR knockout screen and three secondary screens assaying for different aspects of the female pluripotency phenotype allow us to uncover multiple genes that act in concert and to disentangle their relative roles. Among them, we identify Dusp9 and Klhl13 as two central players. While Dusp9 mainly affects MAPK pathway intermediates, Klhl13 promotes pluripotency factor expression and delays differentiation, with both factors jointly repressing MAPK target gene expression.Here, we elucidate the mechanisms that drive sex-induced differences in pluripotent cells and our approach serves as a blueprint to discover the genetic basis of the phenotypic consequences of other chromosomal effects."

The role of sex genotype in other paediatric CNS tumours remains unclear. This study sought to examine the role of sex genotype in CNS tumour incidence and overall survival (OS).Age-adjusted incidence and OS rates were collected from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) registry between 2000 and 2011 for common paediatric (<=19 years) CNS tumours: pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma (GBM), medulloblastoma, supratentorial CNS embryonal tumour, ependymoma, and germinoma. All patients with histologically confirmed, ICD-03 coded, first tumours, were included. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR).The total cases are as follows: males=3018 and females=2276. Highest incidence was seen in PA (n=2103). GBM displayed the worst OS, whilst PA displayed the best. Higher incidence was observed in males for all tumours, except PA. Females with ependymoma had significantly better OS compared to males, whereas males with germinomas had better OS compared to females. Females <1 year with AA had better OS than males. Increasing age significantly improved male and female survival in ependymoma and medulloblastoma.Interrogating population-based registries such as SEER minimises bias and provides credible data. Observed differences in incidence and OS between the sexes for different paediatric CNS tumours provide useful prognostic information for clinicians. Sex genotype was a significant independent prognostic factor in ependymomas and germinomas. Further investigation of possible epigenetic and hormonal differences may provide sex-specific vulnerabilities that may be exploitable for targeted therapy."

However, the mechanism of AR signaling in GC especially in female patients remains obscure. We sought to identify the AR signaling pathway that might be related to prognosis and examine the potential clinical utility of the AR antagonist for treatment. Deep learning and gene set enrichment analysis was used to identify potential critical factors associated with gender bias in GC (n = 1390). Gene expression profile analysis was performed to screen differentially expressed genes associated with AR expression in the Tianjin discovery set (n = 90) and TCGA validation set (n = 341). Predictors of survival were identified via lasso regression analyses and validated in the expanded Tianjin cohort (n = 373). In vitro and in vivo experiments were established to determine the drug effect. The GC gender bias was attributable to sex chromosome abnormalities and AR signaling dysregulation. The candidates for AR-related gene sets were screened, and AR combined with miR-125b was associated with poor prognosis, particularly among female patients. AR was confirmed to directly regulate miR-125b expression. AR-miR-125b signaling pathway inhibited apoptosis and promoted proliferation. AR antagonist, bicalutamide, exerted anti-tumor activities and induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, using GC cell lines and female patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. We have shed light on gender differences by revealing a hormone-regulated oncogenic signaling pathway in GC. Our preclinical studies suggest that AR is a potential therapeutic target for this deadly cancer type, especially in female patients."
"33937056","Cancer in Africa: The Untold Story.","Front Oncol","Despite rising incidence and mortality rates in Africa, cancer has been given low priority in the research field and in healthcare services. Indeed, 57% of all new cancer cases around the world occur in low income countries exacerbated by lack of awareness, lack of preventive strategies, and increased life expectancies. Despite recent efforts devoted to cancer epidemiology, statistics on cancer rates in Africa are often dispersed across different registries. In this study our goal included identifying the most promising prevention and treatment approaches available in Africa. To do this, we collated and analyzed the incidence and fatality rates for the 10 most common and fatal cancers in 56 African countries grouped into 5 different regions (North, West, East, Central and South) over 16-years (2002-2018). We examined temporal and regional trends by investigating the most important risk factors associated to each cancer type. Data were analyzed by cancer type, African region, gender, measures of socioeconomic status and the availability of medical devices.We observed that Northern and Southern Africa were most similar in their cancer incidences and fatality rates compared to other African regions. The most prevalent cancers are breast, bladder and liver cancers in Northern Africa; prostate, lung and colorectal cancers in Southern Africa; and esophageal and cervical cancer in East Africa. In Southern Africa, fatality rates from prostate cancer and cervical cancer have increased. In addition, these three cancers are less fatal in Northern and Southern Africa compared to other regions, which correlates with the Human Development Index and the availability of medical devices. With the exception of thyroid cancer, all other cancers have higher incidences in males than females.Our results show that the African continent suffers from a shortage of medical equipment, research resources and epidemiological expertise. While recognizing that risk factors are interconnected, we focused on risk factors more or less specific to each cancer type. This helps identify specific preventive and therapeutic options in Africa. We see a need for implementing more accurate preventive strategies to tackle this disease as many cases are likely preventable. Opportunities exist for vaccination programs for cervical and liver cancer, genetic testing and use of new targeted therapies for breast and prostate cancer, and positive changes in lifestyle for lung, colorectal and bladder cancers. Such recommendations should be tailored for the different African regions depending on their disease profiles and specific needs.Copyright © 2021 Hamdi, Abdeljaoued-Tej, Zatchi, Abdelhak, Boubaker, Brown and Benkahla."

Currently, whether patients with non-reproductive cancers are male or female according to their sex chromosomes is not adequately considered in patient standard of care. This is a matter of consequence because there is growing evidence that these cancer types generally initiate earlier and are associated with higher overall incidence and rates of death in males compared with females. Gender, in contrast to sex, refers to a chosen sexual identity. Hazardous lifestyle choices (notably tobacco smoking) differ in prevalence between genders, aligned with disproportionate cancer risk. These add to underlying genetic predisposition and influences of sex steroid hormones. Together, these factors affect metabolism, immunity and inflammation, and ultimately the fidelity of the genetic code. To accurately understand how human defences against cancer erode, it is crucial to establish the influence of sex. Our Perspective highlights evidence from basic and translational research indicating that including genetic sex considerations in treatments for patients with cancer will improve outcomes.

We conducted a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis to establish the efficacy and safety of CyberKnife treatment for recurrent malignant gliomas.We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from 2000 to 2021 for studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of CyberKnife treatment for recurrent WHO grade III and grade IV gliomas of the brain. Two independent reviewers selected studies and abstracted data. Missing information was requested from the authors via email correspondence. The primary outcomes were median Overall Survival, median Time To Progression, and median Progression-Free Survival. We performed subgroup analyses regarding WHO grade and chemotherapy. Besides, we analyzed the relationship between median Time To Recurrence and median Overall Survival from CyberKnife treatment. The secondary outcomes were complications, local response, and recurrence. Data were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis.Thirteen studies reporting on 398 patients were included. Median Overall Survival from initial diagnosis and CyberKnife treatment was 22.6 months and 8.6 months. Median Time To Progression and median Progression-Free Survival from CyberKnife treatment were 6.7 months and 7.1 months. Median Overall Survival from CyberKnife treatment was 8.4 months for WHO grade IV gliomas, compared to 11 months for WHO grade III gliomas. Median Overall Survival from CyberKnife treatment was 4.4 months for patients who underwent CyberKnife treatment alone, compared to 9.5 months for patients who underwent CyberKnife treatment plus chemotherapy. We did not observe a correlation between median Time To Recurrence and median Overall Survival from CyberKnife. Rates of acute neurological and acute non-neurological side effects were 3.6% and 13%. Rates of corticosteroid dependency and radiation necrosis were 18.8% and 4.3%.Reirradiation of recurrent malignant gliomas with the CyberKnife System provides encouraging survival rates. There is a better survival trend for WHO grade III gliomas and for patients who undergo combined treatment with CyberKnife plus chemotherapy. Rates of complications are low. Larger prospective studies are warranted to provide more accurate results.Copyright © 2021 De Maria, Terzi di Bergamo, Conti, Hayashi, Pinzi, Murai, Lanciano, Burneikiene, Buglione di Monale, Magrini and Fontanella."
"33886023","DNA Methylation, Preterm Birth and Blood Pressure in African American Children: The DPREG Study.","J Immigr Minor Health","Preterm birth (< 37 weeks) has been associated with high blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Epigenetic mechanisms may explain how preterm birth influences later BP. In this study, we examined the association between DNA methylation (DNAm), preterm birth and BP in African American children. We recruited 100 children and collected clinical and birth history data. DNA was extracted from saliva and the Illumina EPIC BeadChip was used for epigenetic analyses. Preterm birth was not associated with systolic or diastolic BP. No significant DNAm sites were associated with preterm birth in candidate gene methylation analyses. Body mass index was associated with systolic BP (p = 0.01). We did not observe an effect of preterm birth on DNAm or BP in early childhood. Our study is one of the few, however, to examine these associations among African Americans."
"33892675","An exploration of the genetic epidemiology of non-suicidal self-harm and suicide attempt.","BMC Psychiatry","Empirical evidence supporting the distinction between suicide attempt (SA) and non-suicidal self-harm (NSSH) is lacking. Although NSSH is a risk factor for SA, we do not currently know whether these behaviours lie on a continuum of severity, or whether they are discrete outcomes with different aetiologies. We conducted this exploratory genetic epidemiology study to investigate this issue further.We explored the extent of genetic overlap between NSSH and SA in a large, richly-phenotyped cohort (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children; N = 4959), utilising individual-level genetic and phenotypic data to conduct analyses of genome-wide complex traits and polygenic risk scores (PRS).The single nucleotide polymorphism heritability of NSSH was estimated to be 13% (SE 0.07) and that of SA to be 0% (SE 0.07). Of the traits investigated, NSSH was most strongly correlated with higher IQ (rG = 0.31, SE = 0.22), there was little evidence of high genetic correlation between NSSH and SA (rG = - 0.1, SE = 0.54), likely due to the low heritability estimate for SA. The PRS for depression differentiated between those with NSSH and SA in multinomial regression. The optimal PRS prediction model for SA (Nagelkerke R20.022, p < 0.001) included ADHD, depression, income, anorexia and neuroticism and explained more variance than the optimal prediction model for NSSH (Nagelkerke R20.010, p < 0.001) which included ADHD, alcohol consumption, autism spectrum conditions, depression, IQ, neuroticism and suicide attempt.Our findings suggest that SA does not have a large genetic component, and that although NSSH and SA are not discrete outcomes there appears to be little genetic overlap between the two. The relatively small sample size and resulting low heritability estimate for SA was a limitation of the study. Combined with low heritability estimates, this implies that family or population structures in SA GWASs may contribute to signals detected."

These tests may not have enough power to detect effects in a small subset of samples, e.g., a drug that works well only on a few patients. We developed a novel statistical test targeting such effects relevant for clinical trials, biomarker discovery, feature selection, etc. We focused on finding meaningful associations in complex genetic diseases in gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation. Our test outperforms traditional statistical tests in simulated and experimental data and detects potentially disease-relevant genes with heterogeneous effects."
"33868898","Advances in Understanding the Causes and Consequences of Health Disparities in Aging Minorities.","Curr Epidemiol Rep","The purpose was to discuss appropriate methods for advancing our understanding of health disparities or minority aging including life-course perspectives, biological measures, pain measurement, and generational approaches.Life course perspectives provide an orientation for studying older minorities that concomitantly captures exposures and stressors that may lead to earlier onset of disease and premature mortality. The use of biological markers to study health disparities in older minorities is necessary in order to identify pathways between psychosocial factors and health outcomes. Work focusing on pain disparities should include explorations of relationships between psychosocial factors, and subjective and objective measures of pain. Studying families can provide insight into genetic associations and coping styles in older minorities.Methodological approaches that take life course, biology, and social factors into account may help identify causal pathways between social determinants of health and health outcomes among older minorities. Once these causal pathways have been identified, more strategies and interventions that strive toward health equity across older adults of all race/ethnic groups can be developed."
"33937299","Uremia-Associated Immunological Aging and Severity of COVID-19 Infection.","Front Med (Lausanne)","One year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic it has become clear that some groups of individuals are at particular high risk of a complicated course of infection resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Two specific risk factors are most prominent, old age and the presence of co-morbidity. Recent studies have shown that patients with compromised renal function, especially those treated with renal replacement therapy or having received a kidney transplant are at a much higher risk for severe COVID infection and increased mortality. This may be in part due to the increased prevalence of co-morbid conditions in these patients but specific alterations in their immune system, reflecting premature immunological aging, may be equally important. In this review the different aspects, in particular thymus function and memory T cell expansion, of uremia-associated immunological aging are reviewed with respect to COVID 19 infection. In essence, the decreased generation of naïve T cells may be instrumental in suboptimal anti-viral immune responses while the relatively uncontrolled expansion of effector T cells may facilitate the feared phase of the COVID-19 infection with excessive and live-threatening inflammation of the lung parenchyma.Copyright © 2021 Betjes."
"33888815","Investigating the effects of chronic perinatal alcohol and combined nicotine and alcohol exposure on dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons in the VTA.","Sci Rep","The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is the origin of dopaminergic neurons and the dopamine (DA) reward pathway. This pathway has been widely studied in addiction and drug reinforcement studies and is believed to be the central processing component of the reward circuit. In this study, we used a well-established rat model to expose mother dams to alcohol, nicotine-alcohol, and saline perinatally. DA and non-DA neurons collected from the VTA of the rat pups were used to study expression profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs. miRNA pathway interactions, putative miRNA-mRNA target pairs, and downstream modulated biological pathways were analyzed. In the DA neurons, 4607 genes were differentially upregulated and 4682 were differentially downregulated following nicotine-alcohol exposure. However, in the non-DA neurons, only 543 genes were differentially upregulated and 506 were differentially downregulated. Cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival pathways were enriched after the treatments. Specifically, in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, there were 41 miRNAs and 136 mRNAs differentially expressed in the DA neurons while only 16 miRNAs and 20 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the non-DA neurons after the nicotine-alcohol exposure. These results depicted that chronic nicotine and alcohol exposures during pregnancy differentially affect both miRNA and gene expression profiles more in DA than the non-DA neurons in the VTA. Understanding how the expression signatures representing specific neuronal subpopulations become enriched in the VTA after addictive substance administration helps us to identify how neuronal functions may be altered in the brain."
"33870089","DNA Methylation at Birth is Associated with Childhood Serum Immunoglobulin E Levels.","Epigenet Insights","Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is known to play an important role in allergic diseases. Epigenetic traits acquired due to modification of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation (DNAm) in early life may have phenotypic consequences through their role in transcriptional regulation with relevance to the developmental origins of diseases including allergy. However, epigenome-scale studies on the longitudinal association of cord blood DNAm with IgE over time are lacking. Our study aimed to examine the association of DNAm at birth with childhood serum IgE levels during early life. Genome-scale DNAm and total serum IgE measured at birth, 5, 8, and 11 years of children in the Taiwan Maternal and Infant Cohort Study were included in the study in the discovery stage. Linear mixed models were implemented to assess the association between cord blood DNAm at ~310K 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites with repeated IgE measurements, adjusting for cord blood IgE. Identified statistically significant CpGs (at a false discovery rate, FDR, of 0.05) were further tested in an independent replication cohort, the Isle of Wight (IoW) birth cohort. We mapped replicated CpGs to genes and conducted gene ontology analysis using ToppFun to identify significantly enriched pathways and biological processes of the genes. Cord blood DNAm of 273 CpG sites were significantly (FDR = 0.05) associated with IgE levels longitudinally. Among the identified CpGs available in both cohorts (184 CpGs), 92 CpGs (50%) were replicated in the IoW in terms of consistency in direction of associations between DNA methylation and IgE levels later in life, and 16 of the 92 CpGs showed statistically significant associations (P < .05). Gene ontology analysis identified 4 pathways (FDR = 0.05). The identified 16 CpG sites had the potential to serve as epigenetic markers associated with later IgE production, beneficial to allergic disease prevention and intervention.© The Author(s) 2021."
"33926553","Elevated APOBEC mutational signatures implicate chronic injury in etiology of an aggressive head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma: a case report.","J Med Case Rep","Aggressive squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) present frequently in the context of chronic skin injury occurring in patients with the congenital blistering disease recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Recently, these cancers were shown to harbor mutation signatures associated with endogenous deaminases of the active polynucleotide cytosine deaminase family, collectively termed APOBEC, and clock-like COSMIC [Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer] signatures, which are associated with normal aging and might result from cumulative DNA replication errors. We present a case of a nasal septal SCC arising in the context of recurrent injury, but also modest past tobacco use. Our genetic analysis of this tumor reveals unusually high APOBEC and clock-like but low tobacco-related COSMIC signatures, suggesting that chronic injury may have played a primary role in somatic mutation. This case report demonstrates how signature-based analyses may implicate key roles for certain mutagenic forces in individual malignancies such as head-and-neck SCC, with multiple etiological origins.We report the case of a 43-year-old male former smoker who presented with congestion and swelling following a traumatic nasal fracture. During surgery, the mucosa surrounding the right nasal valve appeared abnormal, and biopsies revealed invasive keratinizing SCC. Frozen section biopsies revealed multiple areas to be positive for SCC. Gene sequencing showed loss of PTEN (exons 2-8), CDKN2A/B and TP53 (exons 8-9), MYC amplification, and BLM S338*. Exome sequencing data also revealed that 36% of mutations matched an APOBEC mutational signature (COSMIC signatures 2 and 13) and 53% of mutations matched the clock-like mutation signature (COSMIC signature 5). These proportions place this tumor in the 90th percentile bearing each signature, independently, in a reference data set combining cutaneous and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) head and neck SCC data. In contrast, few mutations harbored a tobacco-related COSMIC signature 4, representing about the 10th percentile in our reference SCC data set. The patient was treated with partial rhinectomy with local flap reconstruction, bilateral neck dissection, and adjuvant radiation therapy; the patient remains disease-free to date.Based on comparative mutational signature analysis, we propose that the history of tobacco use and traumatic injury may have collaborated in activating APOBEC enzymes and the clock-like mutational process, ultimately leading to cancer formation. Clinical awareness of the relationship between epithelial injury and tumorigenesis should enhance earlier detection of this particularly aggressive type of cancer."

It is only recently that its unique biology has been assessed in high resolution. Here, we present a meta-analysis of ILC sequencing datasets, to provide a long-awaited ILC-specific resource, and to confirm the prognostic value and strength of association between a number of clinico-pathology features and genomics in this special tumour type. We consider panel (n= 684), whole exome (n= 215) and whole genome sequencing data (n= 48), and review histology of The Cancer Genome Atlas cases to assign grades and determine whether the ILC is of classic type or a variant, such as pleomorphic, prior to performing statistical analyses. We demonstrate evidence of considerable genomic heterogeneity underlying a broadly homogeneous tumour type (typically grade 2, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive); with genomes exhibiting few somatic mutations or structural alterations, genomes with a hypermutator phenotype, and tumours with highly rearranged genomes. We show that whileCDH1(E-cadherin) andPIK3CAmutations do not significantly impact survival, overall survival is significantly poorer for patients with a higher tumour mutation burden; this is also true for grade 3 tumours, and those carrying a somaticTP53mutation (and these cases were more likely to be ER-negative). Taken together, we have compiled a meta-dataset of ILC with molecular profiling, and our analyses show that the genomic landscape significantly impacts the tumour's variable natural history and overall survival of ILC patients."
"33893983","Intratumor heterogeneity, microenvironment, and mechanisms of drug resistance in glioma recurrence and evolution.","Front Med","Glioma is the most common lethal tumor of the human brain. The median survival of patients with primary World Health Organization grade IV glioma is only 14.6 months. The World Health Organization classification of tumors of the central nervous system categorized gliomas into lower-grade gliomas and glioblastomas. Unlike primary glioblastoma that usually develop de novo in the elderly, secondary glioblastoma enriched with an isocitrate dehydrogenase mutant typically progresses from lower-grade glioma within 5-10 years from the time of diagnosis. Based on various evolutional trajectories brought on by clonal and subclonal alterations, the evolution patterns of glioma vary according to different theories. Some important features distinguish the normal brain from other tissues, e.g., the composition of the microenvironment around the tumor cells, the presence of the blood-brain barrier, and others. The underlying mechanism of glioma recurrence and evolution patterns of glioma are different from those of other types of cancer. Several studies correlated tumor recurrence with tumor heterogeneity and the immune microenvironment. However, the detailed reasons for the progression and recurrence of glioma remain controversial. In this review, we introduce the different mechanisms involved in glioma progression, including tumor heterogeneity, the tumor microenvironment and drug resistance, and their pre-clinical implements in clinical trials. This review aimed to provide new insights into further clinical strategies for the treatment of patients with recurrent and secondary glioma."
"33889305","Predicting clinical outcomes using cancer progression associated signatures.","Oncotarget","Somatic mutation signatures are an informative facet of cancer aetiology, however they are rarely useful for predicting patient outcome. The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of a panel of 142 mutation-signature-associated metrics (P142) for predicting cancer progression in patients from a 'TCGA PanCancer Atlas' cohort. The P142 metrics are comprised of AID/APOBEC and ADAR deaminase associated SNVs analyzed for codon context, strand bias, and transitions/transversions. TCGA tumor-normal mutation data was obtained for 10,437 patients, representing 31 of the most prevalent forms of cancer. Stratified random sampling was used to split patients into training, tuning and validation cohorts for each cancer type. Cancer specific machine learning (XGBoost) models were built using the output from the P142 panel to predict patient Progression Free Survival (PFS) status as either ""High PFS"" or ""Low PFS"". Predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the validation cohort. Models accurately predicted PFS status for several cancer types, including adrenocortical carcinoma, glioma, mesothelioma, and sarcoma. In conclusion, the P142 panel of metrics successfully predicted cancer progression status in patients with some, but not all cancer types analyzed. These results pave the way for future studies on cancer progression associated signatures.Copyright: © 2021 Mamrot et al."
"33879792","An integrative analysis of the age-associated multi-omic landscape across cancers.","Nat Commun","Age is the most important risk factor for cancer, as cancer incidence and mortality increase with age. However, how molecular alterations in tumours differ among patients of different age remains largely unexplored. Here, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we comprehensively characterise genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations in relation to patients' age across cancer types. We show that tumours from older patients present an overall increase in genomic instability, somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) and somatic mutations. Age-associated SCNAs and mutations are identified in several cancer-driver genes across different cancer types. The largest age-related genomic differences are found in gliomas and endometrial cancer. We identify age-related global transcriptomic changes and demonstrate that these genes are in part regulated by age-associated DNA methylation changes. This study provides a comprehensive, multi-omics view of age-associated alterations in cancer and underscores age as an important factor to consider in cancer research and clinical practice."

The underlying molecular mechanisms of DPHCC pathogenesis are unclear. We performed whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing of three subtypes of HCC (10 DPHCC, 10 CK19-positive HCC, and 14 CK19-negative HCC), followed by integrated bioinformatics analysis, including somatic mutation analysis, mutation signal analysis, differential gene expression analysis, and pathway enrichment analysis. Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were applied for exploring survival related characteristics. We found that mutated genes in DPHCC patients were associated with carcinogenesis and immunity, and the up-regulated genes were mainly enriched in transcription-related and cancer-related pathways, and the down-regulated genes were mainly enriched in immune-related pathways. CXCL9 was selected as the hub gene, which is associated with immune cells and survival prognosis. Our results showed that low CXCL9 expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis, and its expression was significantly reduced in DPHCC samples. In conclusion, we explored the molecular mechanisms governing DPHCC development and progression and identified CXCL9, which influences the immune microenvironment and prognosis of DPHCC and might be new clinically significant biomarkers for predicting prognosis.© The author(s)."
"33937878","Transcriptome prediction performance across machine learning models and diverse ancestries.","HGG Adv","Transcriptome prediction methods such as PrediXcan and FUSION have become popular in complex trait mapping. Most transcriptome prediction models have been trained in European populations using methods that make parametric linear assumptions like the elastic net (EN). To potentially further optimize imputation performance of gene expression across global populations, we built transcriptome prediction models using both linear and non-linear machine learning (ML) algorithms and evaluated their performance in comparison to EN. We trained models using genotype and blood monocyte transcriptome data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) comprising individuals of African, Hispanic, and European ancestries and tested them using genotype and whole-blood transcriptome data from the Modeling the Epidemiology Transition Study (METS) comprising individuals of African ancestries. We show that the prediction performance is highest when the training and the testing population share similar ancestries regardless of the prediction algorithm used. While EN generally outperformed random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and K nearest neighbor (KNN), we found that RF outperformed EN for some genes, particularly between disparate ancestries, suggesting potential robustness and reduced variability of RF imputation performance across global populations. When applied to a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) phenotype, we show including RF prediction models in PrediXcan revealed potential gene associations missed by EN models. Therefore, by integrating other ML modeling into PrediXcan and diversifying our training populations to include more global ancestries, we may uncover new genes associated with complex traits."

However, the causal variants at this risk locus and their roles in schizophrenia remain elusive. Here we identify the risk missense variant rs1801311 (located in the 1st exon of NDUFA6 gene) as likely causal for schizophrenia at 22q13.2 by disrupting binding of YY1, TAF1, and POLR2A. We systematically elucidated the regulatory mechanisms of rs1801311 and validated the regulatory effect of this missense variant. Intriguingly, rs1801311 physically interacted with NAGA (encodes the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, which is mainly involved in regulating metabolisms of glycoproteins and glycolipids in lysosome) and showed the most significant association with NAGA expression in the human brain, with the risk allele (G) associated with higher NAGA expression. Consistent with eQTL analysis, expression analysis showed that NAGA was significantly upregulated in brains of schizophrenia cases compared with controls, further supporting that rs1801311 may confer schizophrenia risk by regulating NAGA expression. Of note, we found that NAGA regulates important neurodevelopmental processes, including proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. Transcriptome analysis corroborated that NAGA regulates pathways associated with neuronal differentiation. Finally, we independently confirmed the association between rs1801311 and schizophrenia in a large Chinese cohort. Our study elucidates the regulatory mechanisms of the missense schizophrenia risk variant rs1801311 and provides mechanistic links between risk variant and schizophrenia etiology. In addition, this study also revealed the novel role of coding variants in gene regulation and schizophrenia risk, i.e., genetic variant in coding region of a specific gene may confer disease risk through regulating distal genes (act as regulatory variant for distal genes)."

However, the shared genetic etiology underlying BF% and CVDs remains unclear.Using large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we investigated shared genetics between BF% (N = 100,716) and 10 CVD-related traits (n = 6968-977,323) with linkage disequilibrium score regression, multi-trait analysis of GWAS, and transcriptome-wide association analysis, and evaluated causal associations using Mendelian randomization.We found strong positive genetic correlations between BF% and heart failure (HF) (Rg = 0.47, P = 1.27 × 10- 22) and coronary artery disease (CAD) (Rg = 0.22, P = 3.26 × 10- 07). We identified 5 loci and 32 gene-tissue pairs shared between BF% and HF, as well as 16 loci and 28 gene-tissue pairs shared between BF% and CAD. The loci were enriched in blood vessels and brain tissues, while the gene-tissue pairs were enriched in the nervous, cardiovascular, and exo-/endocrine system. In addition, we observed that BF% was causally related with a higher risk of HF (odds ratio 1.63 per 1-SD increase in BF%, P = 4.16 × 10-04) using a MR approach.Our findings suggest that BF% and CVDs have shared genetic etiology and targeted reduction of BF% may improve cardiovascular outcomes. This work advances our understanding of the genetic basis underlying co-morbid obesity and CVDs and opens up a new way for early prevention of CVDs."

However, accumulative evidence shows that global DNA hypomethylation impacts tumorigenesis in a tissue-specific manner, promoting tumorigenesis in some but suppressing tumorigenesis in others including colorectal cancer. The underlying mechanisms, especially how DNA hypomethylation suppresses tumorigenesis, remain largely unknown. Here, we investigate how DNA hypomethylation affects intestinal tumorigenesis by using an Uhrf1 tandem tudor domain knockin mutant mouse model (Uhrf1ki/ki) that exhibits a moderate ~10% reduction of global DNA methylation. We found that both chemical-induced colorectal carcinogenesis and Apc loss of heterozygosity (LOH)-induced intestinal tumorigenesis are substantially suppressed in the Uhrf1 mutant mice. Furthermore, unlike Dnmt1 hypomorphic mice in which DNA hypomethylation suppresses the incidence of macroscopic intestinal tumors but promotes the formation of microadenoma in ApcMin/+background, Uhrf1ki/ki/ApcMin/+mice have markedly reduced incidence of both microadenoma and macroadenoma. DNA hypomethylation does not appear to affect Apc LOH, activation of the Wnt or Hippo pathway, or tumor cell proliferation, but acts cooperatively with activated Wnt pathway to enhance the caspase-3 gene expression, activation, and apoptosis. Furthermore, increased caspase-3 expression correlates with DNA hypomethylation within the caspase-3 enhancer regions. Taken together, we present a new mouse model for investigating the role of and the molecular mechanisms by which DNA hypomethylation suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis. Our finding that a moderate DNA hypomethylation is sufficient to suppress intestinal tumorigenesis by promoting caspase-3 expression and apoptosis sheds new light on DNA-methylation inhibitor-based colorectal cancer therapeutics."

To address this, we develop a method to learn a score of evidence of conservation at the functional genomics level by integrating information from a compendium of epigenomic, transcription factor binding, and transcriptomic data from human and mouse. The method, Learning Evidence of Conservation from Integrated Functional genomic annotations (LECIF), trains neural networks to generate this score for the human and mouse genomes. The resulting LECIF score highlights human and mouse regions with shared functional genomic properties and captures correspondence of biologically similar human and mouse annotations. Analysis with independent datasets shows the score also highlights loci associated with similar phenotypes in both species. LECIF will be a resource for mouse model studies by identifying loci whose functional genomic properties are likely conserved."

This study aims to study the genetic bases of neck circumference.We conducted a multi-ethnic genome-wide association study of neck circumference, adjusted and unadjusted for BMI, in up to 15,090 European Ancestry (EA) and African American (AA) individuals. Because sexually dimorphic associations have been observed for anthropometric traits, we conducted both sex-combined and sex-specific analysis.We identified rs227724 near the Noggin (NOG) gene as a possible quantitative locus for neck circumference in men (N = 8831, P = 1.74 × 10-9) but not in women (P = 0.08). The association was replicated in men (N = 1554, P = 0.045) in an independent dataset. This locus was previously reported to be associated with human height and with self-reported snoring. We also identified rs13087058 on chromosome 3 as a suggestive locus in sex-combined analysis (N = 15090, P = 2.94 × 10-7; replication P =0.049). This locus was also associated with electrocardiogram-assessed PR interval and is a cis-expression quantitative locus for the PDZ Domain-containing ring finger 2 (PDZRN3) gene. Both NOG and PDZRN3 interact with members of transforming growth factor-beta superfamily signaling proteins.Our study suggests that neck circumference may have unique genetic basis independent of BMI."

Here, we show that mice doubly heterozygous for Irx3 and Irx5 mutations exhibit lower food intake with enhanced hypothalamic leptin response. By lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing using the Ins2-Cre system, we identify a previously unreported radial glia-like neural stem cell population with high Irx3 and Irx5 expression in early postnatal hypothalamus and demonstrate that reduced dosage of Irx3 and Irx5 promotes neurogenesis in postnatal hypothalamus leading to elevated numbers of leptin-sensing arcuate neurons. Furthermore, we find that mice with deletion of Irx3 in these cells also exhibit a similar food intake and hypothalamic phenotype. Our results illustrate that Irx3 and Irx5 play a regulatory role in hypothalamic postnatal neurogenesis and leptin response."

Common obesity is a polygenic trait indicating that multiple genetic variants act synergistically to influence its expression. We constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) based on five genetic variants (MC4R rs17782313, BDNF rs6265, FTO rs1421085, TMEM18 rs7561317, and NEGR1 rs2815752) and examined its association with obesity-related traits in a sample of Pakistanis. The study involved 306 overweight/obese (OW/OB) and 300 normal-weight (NW) individuals. The age range of the study participants was 12-63 years. All anthropometric and metabolic parameters were measured for each participant via standard procedures and biochemical assays, respectively. The genetic variants were genotyped by allelic discrimination assays. The age- and gender-adjusted associations between the GRS and obesity-related anthropometric and metabolic measures were determined using linear regression analyses. The results showed that OW/OB individuals had significantly higher mean ranks of GRS than NW individuals. Moreover, a significant association of the GRS with obesity-related anthropometric traits was seen. However, the GRS did not appear to affect any obesity-related metabolic parameter. In conclusion, our findings indicate the combined effect of multiple genetic variants on the obesity-related anthropometric phenotypes in Pakistanis."

To provide additional evidence for these correlations, we built single and multi-trait genetic predictors using GWAS summary statistics for ALS and these traits, (SCZ, CP, EA) in an independent Australian cohort (846 ALS cases and 665 healthy controls). We compared methods for generating the risk predictors and found that the combination of traits improved the prediction (Nagelkerke-R2) of the case-control logistic regression. The combination of ALS, SCZ, CP, and EA, using the SBayesR predictor method gave the highest prediction (Nagelkerke-R2) of 0.027 (P value = 4.6 × 10-8), with the odds-ratio for estimated disease risk between the highest and lowest deciles of individuals being 3.15 (95% CI 1.96-5.05). These results support the genetic correlation between ALS, SCZ, CP and EA providing a better understanding of the complexity of ALS."
"33907183","Genome wide association study identifies four loci for early onset schizophrenia.","Transl Psychiatry","Early onset schizophrenia (EOS, defined as first onset of schizophrenia before age 18) is a rare form of schizophrenia (SCZ). Though genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple risk variants for SCZ, most of the cases included in these GWASs were not stratified according to their first age at onset. To date, the genetic architecture of EOS remains largely unknown. To identify the risk variants and to uncover the genetic basis of EOS, we conducted a two-stage GWAS of EOS in populations of Han Chinese ancestry in this study. We first performed a GWAS using 1,256 EOS cases and 2,661 healthy controls (referred as discovery stage). The genetic variants with a P < 1.0 × 10-04in discovery stage were replicated in an independent sample (903 EOS cases and 3,900 controls). We identified four genome-wide significant risk loci for EOS in the combined samples (2,159 EOS cases and 6,561 controls), including 1p36.22 (rs1801133, Pmeta = 4.03 × 10-15), 1p31.1 (rs1281571, Pmeta = 4.14 × 10-08), 3p21.31 (rs7626288, Pmeta = 1.57 × 10-09), and 9q33.3 (rs592927, Pmeta = 4.01 × 10-11). Polygenic risk scoring (PRS) analysis revealed substantial genetic overlap between EOS and SCZ. These discoveries shed light on the genetic basis of EOS. Further functional characterization of the identified risk variants and genes will help provide potential targets for therapeutics and diagnostics."
"33888908","Genetic analyses identify widespread sex-differential participation bias.","Nat Genet","Genetic association results are often interpreted with the assumption that study participation does not affect downstream analyses. Understanding the genetic basis of participation bias is challenging since it requires the genotypes of unseen individuals. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate comparative biases by performing a genome-wide association study contrasting one subgroup versus another. For example, we showed that sex exhibits artifactual autosomal heritability in the presence of sex-differential participation bias. By performing a genome-wide association study of sex in approximately 3.3 million males and females, we identified over 158 autosomal loci spuriously associated with sex and highlighted complex traits underpinning differences in study participation between the sexes. For example, the body mass index-increasing allele at FTO was observed at higher frequency in males compared to females (odds ratio = 1.02, P = 4.4 × 10-36). Finally, we demonstrated how these biases can potentially lead to incorrect inferences in downstream analyses and propose a conceptual framework for addressing such biases. Our findings highlight a new challenge that genetic studies may face as sample sizes continue to grow."

We now include the X chromosome and new classes of imaging-derived phenotypes (subcortical volumes and tissue contrast). Previously, we found 148 replicated clusters of associations between genetic variants and imaging phenotypes; in this study, we found 692, including 12 on the X chromosome. We describe some of the newly found associations, focusing on the X chromosome and autosomal associations involving the new classes of imaging-derived phenotypes. Our novel associations implicate, for example, pathways involved in the rare X-linked STAR (syndactyly, telecanthus and anogenital and renal malformations) syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and mitochondrial disorders."

While there is epidemiological evidence for inherited susceptibility, the molecular basis remains incompletely understood. We report a genome-wide association study totalling 5,320 cases and 422,289 controls from four Nordic populations, and find a novel MM risk variant at SOHLH2 at 13q13.3 (risk allele frequency = 3.5%; odds ratio = 1.38; P = 2.2 × 10-14). This gene encodes a transcription factor involved in gametogenesis that is normally only weakly expressed in plasma cells. The association is represented by 14 variants in linkage disequilibrium. Among these, rs75712673 maps to a genomic region with open chromatin in plasma cells, and upregulates SOHLH2 in this cell type. Moreover, rs75712673 influences transcriptional activity in luciferase assays, and shows a chromatin looping interaction with the SOHLH2 promoter. Our work provides novel insight into MM susceptibility."
"33859388","Converging genetic and epigenetic drivers of paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia identified by an information-theoretic analysis.","Nat Biomed Eng","In cancer, linking epigenetic alterations to drivers of transformation has been difficult, in part because DNA methylation analyses must capture epigenetic variability, which is central to tumour heterogeneity and tumour plasticity. Here, by conducting a comprehensive analysis, based on information theory, of differences in methylation stochasticity in samples from patients with paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), we show that ALL epigenomes are stochastic and marked by increased methylation entropy at specific regulatory regions and genes. By integrating DNA methylation and single-cell gene-expression data, we arrived at a relationship between methylation entropy and gene-expression variability, and found that epigenetic changes in ALL converge on a shared set of genes that overlap with genetic drivers involved in chromosomal translocations across the disease spectrum. Our findings suggest that an epigenetically driven gene-regulation network, with UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1) as a central node, links genetic drivers and epigenetic mediators in ALL."

HAEC is suggested to be due to a loss of gut homeostasis caused by impairment of immune system, barrier defense, and microbiome, likely related to genetic causes. No gene has been claimed to contribute to HAEC occurrence, yet. Genetic investigation of HAEC by Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) on 24 HSCR patients affected (HAEC) or not affected (HSCR-only) by enterocolitis and replication of results on a larger panel of patients allowed the identification of the HAEC susceptibility variant p.H187Q in the Oncostatin-M receptor (OSMR) gene (14.6% in HAEC and 5.1% in HSCR-only,p= 0.0024). Proteomic analysis on the lymphoblastoid cell lines from one HAEC patient homozygote for this variant and one HAEC patient not carrying the variant revealed two well distinct clusters of proteins significantly up or downregulated upon OSM stimulation. A marked enrichment in immune response pathways (q< 0.0001) was shown in the HAEC H187 cell line, while proteins upregulated in the HAEC Q187 lymphoblasts sustained pathways likely involved in pathogen infection and inflammation. In conclusion,OSMRp.H187Q is an HAEC susceptibility variant and perturbates the downstream signaling cascade necessary for the gut immune response and homeostasis maintenance."
"33889174","System-Level Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease Prioritizes Candidate Genes for Neurodegeneration.","Front Genet","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder. Since the advent of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) we have come to understand much about the genes involved in AD heritability and pathophysiology. Large case-control meta-GWAS studies have increased our ability to prioritize weaker effect alleles, while the recent development ofnetwork-based functional predictionhas provided a mechanism by which we can use machine learning to reprioritize GWAS hits in the functional context of relevant brain tissues like the hippocampus and amygdala. In parallel with these developments, groups like the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) have compiled rich compendia of AD patient data including genotype and biomarker information, including derived volume measures for relevant structures like the hippocampus and the amygdala. In this study we wanted to identify genes involved in AD-related atrophy of these two structures, which are often critically impaired over the course of the disease. To do this we developed a combined score prioritization method which uses the cumulative distribution function of a gene's functional and positional score, to prioritize top genes that not only segregate with disease status, but also with hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy. Our method identified a mix of genes that had previously been identified in AD GWAS includingAPOE,TOMM40, andNECTIN2(PVRL2) and several others that have not been identified in AD genetic studies, but play integral roles in AD-effected functional pathways includingIQSEC1,PFN1, andPAK2. Our findings support the viability of our novel combined score as a method for prioritizing region- and even cell-specific AD risk genes.Copyright © 2021 Brabec, Lara, Tyler and Mahoney."

However, its role in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has not been fully elucidated. Here, we tried to investigate TFAP2A expression profiling, clinical significance, biological function and molecular underpinnings in LUAD. We proved LUAD possessed universal TFAP2A high expression, indicating a pervasively poorer prognosis in multiple independent datasets. Then we found TFAP2A was not indispensable for LUAD proliferation, and exogenous overexpression even caused repression. However, we found TFAP2A could potently promote LUAD metastasis possibly by triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated TFAP2A could transactivate Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 9 (PSG9) to enhance transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-triggering EMT in LUAD. Meanwhile, we discovered suppressed post-transcriptional silencing of miR-16 family upon TFAP2A partly contributed to TFAP2A upregulation in LUAD. In clinical specimens, we also validated cancer-regulating effect of miR-16 family/TFAP2A/PSG9 axis, especially for lymph node metastasis of LUAD. In conclusion, we demonstrated that TFAP2A could pivotally facilitate LUAD progression, possibly through a novel pro-metastasis signaling pathway (miR-16 family/TFAP2A/PSG9/ TGF-β)."

TERF1 (rs79617270) and STN1 (rs139620151) are linked to LTL-associated common index SNPs at these loci. Rs79617270 is associated with cancer mortality [HR95%CI = 1.544 (1.173, 2.032), PAdj = 0.018] and 4.76% of the association between the rs79617270 and colon cancer is mediated through LTL. Overall, genetically determined LTL is particularly associated with lung adenocarcinoma [HR95%CI = 1.123 (1.051, 1.201), Padj = 0.007].

"33937246","Insight Into Chromatin-Enriched RNA: A Key Chromatin Regulator in Tumors.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Chromatin-enriched RNAs (cheRNAs) constitute a special class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are enriched around chromatin and function to activate neighboring or distal gene transcription. Recent studies have shown that cheRNAs affect chromatin structure and gene expression by recruiting chromatin modifiers or acting as bridges between distal enhancers and promoters. The abnormal transcription of cheRNAs plays an important role in the occurrence of many diseases, particularly tumors. The critical effect of cancer stem cells (CSCs) on the formation and development of tumors is well known, but the function of cheRNAs in tumorigenesis, especially in CSC proliferation and stemness maintenance, is not yet fully understood.

"33920121","Fish-Ing for Enhancers in the Heart.","Int J Mol Sci","Precise control of gene expression is crucial to ensure proper development and biological functioning of an organism. Enhancers are non-coding DNA elements which play an essential role in regulating gene expression. They contain specific sequence motifs serving as binding sites for transcription factors which interact with the basal transcription machinery at their target genes. Heart development is regulated by intricate gene regulatory network ensuring precise spatiotemporal gene expression program. Mutations affecting enhancers have been shown to result in devastating forms of congenital heart defect. Therefore, identifying enhancers implicated in heart biology and understanding their mechanism is key to improve diagnosis and therapeutic options. Despite their crucial role, enhancers are poorly studied, mainly due to a lack of reliable way to identify them and determine their function. Nevertheless, recent technological advances have allowed rapid progress in enhancer discovery. Model organisms such as the zebrafish have contributed significant insights into the genetics of heart development through enabling functional analyses of genes and their regulatory elements in vivo. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge on heart enhancers gained through studies in model organisms, discuss various approaches to discover and study their function, and finally suggest methods that could further advance research in this field."
"33911282","Somatic mutation landscapes at single-molecule resolution.","Nature","Somatic mutations drive the development of cancer and may contribute to ageing and other diseases1,2. Despite their importance, the difficulty of detecting mutations that are only present in single cells or small clones has limited our knowledge of somatic mutagenesis to a minority of tissues. Here, to overcome these limitations, we developed nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq), a duplex sequencing protocol with error rates of less than five errors per billion base pairs in single DNA molecules from cell populations. This rate is two orders of magnitude lower than typical somatic mutation loads, enabling the study of somatic mutations in any tissue independently of clonality. We used this single-molecule sensitivity to study somatic mutations in non-dividing cells across several tissues, comparing stem cells to differentiated cells and studying mutagenesis in the absence of cell division. Differentiated cells in blood and colon displayed remarkably similar mutation loads and signatures to their corresponding stem cells, despite mature blood cells having undergone considerably more divisions. We then characterized the mutational landscape of post-mitotic neurons and polyclonal smooth muscle, confirming that neurons accumulate somatic mutations at a constant rate throughout life without cell division, with similar rates to mitotically active tissues. Together, our results suggest that mutational processes that are independent of cell division are important contributors to somatic mutagenesis. We anticipate that the ability to reliably detect mutations in single DNA molecules could transform our understanding of somatic mutagenesis and enable non-invasive studies on large-scale cohorts."

However, due to the limitations of DNA sequencing technologies and computational algorithms, our understanding of genetic variation and somatic mutations is far from complete.In the present study, we performed whole-genome sequencing using long-read sequencing technology (Oxford Nanopore) for 11 Japanese liver cancers and matched normal samples which were previously sequenced for the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). We constructed an analysis pipeline for the long-read data and identified germline and somatic structural variations (SVs).In polymorphic germline SVs, our analysis identified 8004 insertions, 6389 deletions, 27 inversions, and 32 intra-chromosomal translocations. By comparing to the chimpanzee genome, we correctly inferred events that caused insertions and deletions and found that most insertions were caused by transposons and Alu is the most predominant source, while other types of insertions, such as tandem duplications and processed pseudogenes, are rare. We inferred mechanisms of deletion generations and found that most non-allelic homolog recombination (NAHR) events were caused by recombination errors in SINEs. Analysis of somatic mutations in liver cancers showed that long reads could detect larger numbers of SVs than a previous short-read study and that mechanisms of cancer SV generation were different from that of germline deletions.Our analysis provides a comprehensive catalog of polymorphic and somatic SVs, as well as their possible causes.

SCN1A, which encodes the NaV1.1 sodium channel alpha subunit, is one such gene with two co-active promoters. Mutations in SCN1A are associated with epilepsy, including Dravet syndrome (DS). The majority of DS patients harbor coding mutations causing SCN1A haploinsufficiency; however, putative causal non-coding promoter mutations have been identified.To determine the functional role of one of these potentially redundant Scn1a promoters, we focused on the non-coding Scn1a 1b regulatory region, previously described as a non-canonical alternative transcriptional start site. We generated a transgenic mouse line with deletion of the extended evolutionarily conserved 1b non-coding interval and characterized changes in gene and protein expression, and assessed seizure activity and alterations in behavior.Mice harboring a deletion of the 1b non-coding interval exhibited surprisingly severe reductions of Scn1a and NaV1.1 expression throughout the brain. This was accompanied by electroencephalographic and thermal-evoked seizures, and behavioral deficits.This work contributes to functional dissection of the regulatory wiring of a major epilepsy risk gene, SCN1A. We identified the 1b region as a critical disease-relevant regulatory element and provide evidence that non-canonical and seemingly redundant promoters can have essential function."

Since store-operated calcium channel (SOC) signaling is one of the erythropoietin activated pathways, we aimed to investigate the association between the genetic polymorphisms of SOC signaling pathway and erythropoietin resistance in patients with renal failure.Four tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms in STIM1 and five in ORAI1 were selected in this study. Genotyping was performed with the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination assay and the association of individual tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms with erythropoietin resistance was analyzed by multivariable adjusted random intercepts model.194 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age of participants is 68 years, and 56% were men. The mean erythropoietin resistance index was 9.04 ± 4.51 U/Kg/week/g/dL. We found that patients with the AA genotype of rs1561876 in STIM1, and the CC or CT genotypes of rs6486795 in ORAI1, were associated with increased risk of erythropoietin resistance. Functional annotation of expression quantitative trait loci revealed that the AA genotype of rs1561876 in STIM1 has a relatively lower expression of ribonucleotide reductase catalytic subunit M1 in skeletal muscle, while the CC genotype of rs6486795 in ORAI1 has a relatively higher expression of ORAI1 in the whole blood and thyroid.Overall, we demonstrate a significant association between erythropoietin resistance and genetic polymorphisms of STIM1 and ORAI1.

In our study, a luminescence-based methyltransferase assay was used to establish the ZIKV NS5 MTase inhibitor screening model. Through screening a natural product library, we found theaflavin, a polyphenol derived from tea, could inhibit ZIKV NS5 MTase activity with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 10.10 μM. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis analyses identified D146 as the key amino acid in the interaction between ZIKV NS5 MTase and theaflavin. The SPR assay indicated that theaflavin had a stronger binding activity with ZIKV NS5 wild-type (WT)-MTase than it with D146A-MTase. Moreover, theaflavin exhibited a dose dependent inhibitory effect on ZIKV replication with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 8.19 μM.

"33878299","The bone microenvironment increases phenotypic plasticity of ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cells.","Dev Cell","Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer exhibits a strong bone tropism in metastasis. How the bone microenvironment (BME) impacts ER signaling and endocrine therapy remains poorly understood. Here, we discover that the osteogenic niche transiently and reversibly reduces ER expression and activities specifically in bone micrometastases (BMMs), leading to endocrine resistance. As BMMs progress, the ER reduction and endocrine resistance may partially recover in cancer cells away from the osteogenic niche, creating phenotypic heterogeneity in macrometastases. Using multiple approaches, including an evolving barcoding strategy, we demonstrated that this process is independent of clonal selection, and represents an EZH2-mediated epigenomic reprogramming. EZH2 drives ER+BMMs toward a basal and stem-like state. EZH2 inhibition reverses endocrine resistance. These data exemplify how epigenomic adaptation to BME promotes phenotypic plasticity of metastatic seeds, fosters intra-metastatic heterogeneity, and alters therapeutic responses.

We found a strong RA-associated chromatin dysregulation signature in monocytes, but no other examined cell types. Moreover, we found that serum C-reactive protein (CRP) can induce the RA-associated chromatin dysregulation in monocytes via in vitro experiments. And the extent of this dysregulation was regulated through the transcription factor FRA2.Together, our study revealed a CRP-induced pathogenic chromatin dysregulation signature in monocytes from RA patients and predicted the responsible signalling pathway as potential therapeutic targets for the disease."

Cytogenetic analysis, whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing have identified primary structural alterations in T-PLL, including inversion, translocation and copy number variation. Recurrent somatic mutations were also identified in genes encoding chromatin regulators and those in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Epigenetic alterations are the hallmark of many cancers. However, genome-wide epigenomic profiles have not been reported in T-PLL, limiting the mechanistic study of its carcinogenesis. We hypothesize epigenetic mechanisms also play a key role in T-PLL pathogenesis. To systematically test this hypothesis, we generated genome-wide maps of regulatory regions using H3K4me3 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq, as well as RNA-seq data in both T-PLL patients and healthy individuals. We found that genes down-regulated in T-PLL are mainly associated with defense response, immune system or adaptive immune response, while up-regulated genes are enriched in developmental process, as well as WNT signaling pathway with crucial roles in cell fate decision. In particular, our analysis revealed a global alteration of regulatory landscape in T-PLL, with differential peaks highly enriched for binding motifs of immune related transcription factors, supporting the epigenetic regulation of oncogenes and genes involved in DNA damage response and T-cell activation. Together, our work reveals a causal role of epigenetic dysregulation in T-PLL."

MGMT promoter methylation is considered to be a characteristic of subgroups of certain malignancies but has also been described in various peripheral inflammatory diseases. However, MGMT promoter methylation levels have not yet been investigated in non-neoplastic brain diseases. This study demonstrates for the first time that one can indeed detect slightly enhanced MGMT promoter methylation in individual cases of inflammatory demyelinating CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis and progressive multifocal leucencephalopathy (PML), as well as in other demyelinating diseases such as central pontine and exptrapontine myelinolysis, and diseases with myelin damage such as Wallerian degeneration. In this context, we identified a reduction in the expression of the demethylase TET1 as a possible cause for the enhanced MGMT promoter methylation. Hence, we show for the first time that MGMT hypermethylation occurs in chronic diseases that are not strictly associated to distinct pathogens, oncogenic viruses or neoplasms but that lead to damage of the myelin sheath in various ways. While this gives new insights into epigenetic and pathophysiological processes involved in de- and remyelination, which might offer new therapeutic opportunities for demyelinating diseases in the future, it also reduces the specificity of MGMT hypermethylation as a tumor biomarker."

Emerging evidence suggests epigenetic changes in DNA methylation may have a causal role in both T1DM and DKD. The aim of this exploratory investigation was to assess differences in blood-derived DNA methylation patterns between individuals with T1DM-ESKD and individuals with long-duration T1DM but no evidence of kidney disease upon repeated testing to identify potential blood-based biomarkers. Blood-derived DNA from individuals (107 cases, 253 controls and 14 experimental controls) were bisulphite treated before DNA methylation patterns from both groups were generated and analysed using Illumina's Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip arrays (n = 862,927 sites). Differentially methylated CpG sites (dmCpGs) were identified (false discovery rate adjusted p ≤ × 10-8and fold change ± 2) by comparing methylation levels between ESKD cases and T1DM controls at single site resolution. Gene annotation and functionality was investigated to enrich and rank methylated regions associated with ESKD in T1DM.Top-ranked genes within which several dmCpGs were located and supported by functional data with methylation look-ups in other cohorts include: AFF3, ARID5B, CUX1, ELMO1, FKBP5, HDAC4, ITGAL, LY9, PIM1, RUNX3, SEPTIN9 and UPF3A. Top-ranked enrichment pathways included pathways in cancer, TGF-β signalling and Th17 cell differentiation.Epigenetic alterations provide a dynamic link between an individual's genetic background and their environmental exposures. This robust evaluation of DNA methylation in carefully phenotyped individuals has identified biomarkers associated with ESKD, revealing several genes and implicated key pathways associated with ESKD in individuals with T1DM."

However, in a long-term follow-up, a meaningful subgroup of patients with locally advanced disease presents disease recurrence, which demands treatments with high morbidity and important impact in the quality of life. In metastatic or unresectable disease, palliative chemotherapy is the standard of care, but it is still associated with a dismal prognosis. Novel agents are urgently needed in the systemic therapy of SCCA. From a translational standpoint, there are many hurdles to overcome, sincePI3KCAmutation is the most frequent genetic abnormality and actionable mutations are rarely found in SCCA, as well as it is characterized by low tumor mutational burden and low rates of high-frequency microsatellite instability. But the latest studies of immunotherapeutic approaches have produced promising findings and this therapeutic strategy is the major path being followed in the ongoing clinical trials. The latest advances in the systemic therapy of SCCA have provided the framework for the conception of new clinical trials. Therefore, carboplatin plus paclitaxel have become the backbone for novel agents. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), mainly anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, such as retifanlimab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab have been studied in Phase III trials with chemotherapy in first-line therapy. Likewise, ICIs have been evaluated in locally advanced and refractory disease. Novel technologies, such as bispecific antibodies, and immunotherapeutic approaches, such as vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies, have also been tested in ongoing clinical trials. Immunotherapy may bring practice-changing advances in the systemic therapy of SCCA in the next few years and it might play a larger role in the therapeutic management of this challenging disease.© 2021 Farias et al."
"33885932","Early-life exposure to the Chinese famine, genetic susceptibility and the risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood.","Diabetologia","Early famine exposure has been related to the development of type 2 diabetes; however, little is known about whether the genetic background modifies this association. We aimed to investigate the joint effects of famine exposure at different stages of early life and genetic susceptibility on diabetes risk in adulthood.The study included 8350 participants from the Survey on Prevalence in East China for Metabolic Diseases and Risk Factors (SPECT-China) who were born around the time of the Chinese Great Famine. We determined famine exposure subgroups according to the birth year as nonexposed (1963-1974), fetal-exposed (1959-1962), childhood-exposed (1949-1958), and adolescence-exposed (1941-1948). We developed a genetic risk score of 21 variants previously associated with type 2 diabetes in East Asians. Hierarchical logistic models were used to examine the association of famine exposure and genetic risk with diabetes.The age-standardised prevalence of diabetes in nonexposed, fetal-exposed, childhood-exposed and adolescence-exposed subgroups was 13.0%, 18.2%, 15.1% and 13.2%, respectively. Compared with nonexposed participants, fetal-exposed participants showed an increased risk of diabetes in adulthood (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.13, 1.93). A higher genetic risk score was associated with an increased risk of diabetes (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.15, 1.31 per SD increment). The association between famine exposure and diabetes was consistent across genetic risk strata (all p for interaction >0.05). When considered jointly, fetal- or childhood-exposed participants at high genetic risk (highest tertile of genetic risk score) had 2.60-fold (95% CI 1.71, 3.93) and 1.95-fold (95% CI 1.24, 3.05) higher risks of diabetes, respectively, compared with nonexposed participants at low genetic risk (lowest tertile).Prenatal exposure to famine was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in Chinese adults independent of genetic risk score using 21 variants common in the East Asian population. Famine exposure and genetic susceptibility may exhibit an additive effect on diabetes development."
"33911141","Disentangling age-dependent DNA methylation: deterministic, stochastic, and nonlinear.","Sci Rep","DNA methylation variability arises due to concurrent genetic and environmental influences. Each of them is a mixture of regular and noisy sources, whose relative contribution has not been satisfactorily understood yet. We conduct a systematic assessment of the age-dependent methylation by the signal-to-noise ratio and identify a wealth of ""deterministic"" CpG probes (about 90%), whose methylation variability likely originates due to genetic and general environmental factors. The remaining 10% of ""stochastic"" CpG probes are arguably governed by the biological noise or incidental environmental factors. Investigating the mathematical functional relationship between methylation levels and variability, we find that in about 90% of the age-associated differentially methylated positions, the variability changes as the square of the methylation level, whereas in the most of the remaining cases the dependence is linear. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the methylation level itself in more than 15% cases varies nonlinearly with age (according to the power law), in contrast to the previously assumed linear changes. Our findings present ample evidence of the ubiquity of strong DNA methylation regulation, resulting in the individual age-dependent and nonlinear methylation trajectories, whose divergence explains the cross-sectional variability. It may also serve a basis for constructing novel nonlinear epigenetic clocks."

We examined joint exposure to multiple co-occurring metals in relation to infant negative affect, a stable temperamental trait linked to psychopathology among children and adults.Analyses included 308 mother-infant pairs enrolled in the PRISM pregnancy cohort. We measured As, Ba, Cd, Cs, Cr, Pb, and Sb in urine, collected on average during late pregnancy, by ICP-MS. At age 6 months, we assessed negative affect using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised. We used Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression with repeated holdout validation to estimate the joint association between the metals and global negative affectivity, as well as four subdomains (Fear, Sadness, Distress to Limitations, and Falling Reactivity). We also tested for a sex interaction with estimated stratified weights.In adjusted models, urinary metals were associated with higher scores on the Fear scale (βWQS = 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.09, 0.30), which captures behavioral inhibition, characterized by startle or distress to sudden changes in the environment and inhibited approach to novelty. We observed a significant sex interaction (95% CI for the cross-product term: -0.19, -0.01), and stratified weights showed girls (61.6%) contributed substantially more to the mixture effect compared with boys (38.4%). Overall, Ba contributed the greatest mixture weight (22.5%), followed by Cs (14.9%) and As (14.6%).Prenatal exposure to metals was associated with increased infant scores on the temperamental domain of fear, with girls showing particular sensitivity.Key words: Prenatal; Metals; Mixtures; Temperament; Infancy; Negative affect.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

However, heritable effects of environmental chemicals on mammalian offsprings' metabolic health are unclear. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is the top chemical on the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry priority list of hazardous substances. Here, we assess cross-generational effects of iAs in an exclusive male-lineage transmission paradigm. The exposure of male mice to 250 ppb iAs causes glucose intolerance and hepatic insulin resistance in F1 females, but not males, without affecting body weight. Hepatic expression of glucose metabolic genes, glucose output, and insulin signaling are disrupted in F1 females. Inhibition of the glucose 6-phosphatase complex masks the intergenerational effect of iAs, demonstrating a causative role of hepatic glucose production. F2 offspring from grandpaternal iAs exposure show temporary growth retardation at an early age, which diminishes in adults. However, reduced adiposity persists into middle age and is associated with altered gut microbiome and increased brown adipose thermogenesis. In contrast, F3 offspring of the male-lineage iAs exposure show increased adiposity, especially on a high-calorie diet. These findings have unveiled sex- and generation-specific heritable effects of iAs on metabolic physiology, which has broad implications in understanding gene-environment interactions.© 2021 The Authors.

Here, we use RNA sequencing to define cytokine and chemokine genes upregulated in lacrimal glands of NOD mice in a type I IFN-dependent manner. Interleukin (IL)-21 was the highest differentially expressed cytokine gene, andIl21knockout NOD mice were relatively protected from lacrimal gland inflammation. We defined a set of chemokines upregulated early in disease includingCxcl9andCxcl10, which share a receptor, CXCR3. CXCR3+T cells were enriched in lacrimal glands with a dominant proportion of CXCR3+regulatory T cells. Together these data define the early cytokine and chemokine signals associated with type I IFN-signaling in the development of lacrimal gland inflammation in NOD mice providing insight into the role of type I IFN in autoimmunity development."
"33911236","Epithelial-immune cell interplay in primary Sjögren syndrome salivary gland pathogenesis.","Nat Rev Rheumatol","In primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS), the function of the salivary glands is often considerably reduced. Multiple innate immune pathways are likely dysregulated in the salivary gland epithelium in pSS, including the nuclear factor-κB pathway, the inflammasome and interferon signalling. The ductal cells of the salivary gland in pSS are characteristically surrounded by a CD4+T cell-rich and B cell-rich infiltrate, implying a degree of communication between epithelial cells and immune cells. B cell infiltrates within the ducts can initiate the development of lymphoepithelial lesions, including basal ductal cell hyperplasia. Vice versa, the epithelium provides chronic activation signals to the glandular B cell fraction. This continuous stimulation might ultimately drive the development of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. This Review discusses changes in the cells of the salivary gland epithelium in pSS (including acinar, ductal and progenitor cells), and the proposed interplay of these cells with environmental stimuli and the immune system. Current therapeutic options are insufficient to address both lymphocytic infiltration and salivary gland dysfunction. Successful rescue of salivary gland function in pSS will probably demand a multimodal therapeutic approach and an appreciation of the complicity of the salivary gland epithelium in the development of pSS."

"33916465","Impact of Cigarette Smoking on the Risk of Osteoporosis in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.","J Clin Med","Cigarette smoking constitutes one of the most important modifiable factors of osteoporosis, as well as contributes to an early death, tumors, and numerous chronic diseases. The group with an increased risk of a lower bone mineral density are patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases. In fact, tobacco smoke, which contains more than 7000 chemical compounds, affects bone mineral density (BMD) both directly and indirectly, as it has an impact on the RANK-RANKL-OPG pathway, intestinal microbiota composition, and calcium-phosphate balance. Constant cigarette use interferes with the production of protective mucus and inhibits the repair processes in the intestinal mucus. Nicotine as well as the other compounds of the cigarette smoke are important risk factors of the inflammatory bowel disease and osteoporosis. Additionally, cigarette smoking may decrease BMD in the IBD patients. Interestingly, it affects patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in different ways-on the one hand it protects against ulcerative colitis, whereas on the other it increases the risk of Crohn's disease development. Nevertheless, all patients should be encouraged to cease smoking in order to decrease the risk of developing other disorders."

However, the reasons for the high risk of re-infarction and worsened health among patients who continue to smoke after PCI remain unclear.Methods:A total of 129 non-culprit plaques were identified from 97 ACS patients who underwent OCT imaging at the time of PCI and at 1-year follow-up. Patients were divided into the following three groups according to their smoking status at 1-year follow-up: persistent smoking group (n= 26), smoking cessation group (n= 29), and nonsmoking group (n= 42). Medical history, serum cholesterol level, coronary angiography data, and OCT-determined plaque morphology were analyzed among the three groups.Results:Relative to baseline levels, the total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly decreased in all three groups at 1-year follow-up after statin therapy (p< 0.05). The persistent smoking group had a relatively smaller fibrous cap thickness (FCT) and a higher incidence of thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) than the other two groups at 1-year follow-up (p< 0.05), although the FCT increased and the incidence of TCFA decreased in all three groups.Conclusions:Persistent smoking is associated with an attenuated effect of statin therapy on plaque stabilization in ACS patients.Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Peng, Li, Yu and Yu."
"33918736","Fibromyalgia: Pathogenesis, Mechanisms, Diagnosis and Treatment Options Update.","Int J Mol Sci","Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by chronic and widespread musculoskeletal pain, often accompanied by other symptoms, such as fatigue, intestinal disorders and alterations in sleep and mood. It is estimated that two to eight percent of the world population is affected by fibromyalgia. From a medical point of view, this pathology still presents inexplicable aspects. It is known that fibromyalgia is caused by a central sensitization phenomenon characterized by the dysfunction of neuro-circuits, which involves the perception, transmission and processing of afferent nociceptive stimuli, with the prevalent manifestation of pain at the level of the locomotor system. In recent years, the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia has also been linked to other factors, such as inflammatory, immune, endocrine, genetic and psychosocial factors. A rheumatologist typically makes a diagnosis of fibromyalgia when the patient describes a history of pain spreading in all quadrants of the body for at least three months and when pain is caused by digital pressure in at least 11 out of 18 allogenic points, called tender points. Fibromyalgia does not involve organic damage, and several diagnostic approaches have been developed in recent years, including the analysis of genetic, epigenetic and serological biomarkers. Symptoms often begin after physical or emotional trauma, but in many cases, there appears to be no obvious trigger. Women are more prone to developing the disease than men. Unfortunately, the conventional medical therapies that target this pathology produce limited benefits. They remain largely pharmacological in nature and tend to treat the symptomatic aspects of various disorders reported by the patient. The statistics, however, highlight the fact that 90% of people with fibromyalgia also turn to complementary medicine to manage their symptoms."
"33877484","An immuno-blocking agent targeting IL-1β and IL-17A reduces the lesion of DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in mice.","Inflammation","In recent decades when biological agents have flourished, a part of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have received the treatment of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors or IL-1 antibodies. This study aims to investigate the anti-colitis effects of bispecific antibody (FL-BsAb1/17) targeting IL-1β and IL-17A comparing with TNF-α soluble receptor medicine etanercept. IBD model in mice was established by drinking 3% DSS (dextran sulfate sodium salt). On the first day of drinking DSS, treatments with etanercept (5 mg/kg) or different doses of FL-BsAb1/17 (1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg) were started by intraperitoneal injection every other day. The results demonstrated that FL-BsAb1/17 treatment was more effective than etanercept at the same dose (5 mg/kg) in relieving the typical symptom of ulcerative colitis induced by DSS (such as the severity score and intestinal shortening), and down-regulating the expression of inflammatory factors (IL-17A, IL-6, IL-12, IL-22, IL-1β, IL-23, TNF-α) in the serum and colon. FL-BsAb1/17 could also reduce the degree of intestinal fibrosis. The same dose of FL-BsAb1/17 (5 mg/kg) performed better than etanercept in down-regulating MDA and up-regulating SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase), and T-AOC (total antioxidant capacity) in serum. Both FL-BsAb1/17 and etanercept could reduce the transcription of Bax and increase the transcription of Bcl-2 and slow down apoptosis in colitis colon tissue. We conclude that the blocking of IL-1β and IL-17A can inhibit DSS-induced ulcerative colitis and FL-BsAb1/17 may have potential to become a new dual-target candidate for colitis treatment."

Here, we profile the binding of myeloid master regulator PU.1 in primary neutrophils across nearly a hundred volunteers. We show that variants associated with differential PU.1 binding underlie genetically-driven differences in cell count and susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We integrate these results with other multi-individual genomic readouts, revealing coordinated effects of PU.1 binding variants on the local chromatin state, enhancer-promoter contacts and downstream gene expression, and providing a functional interpretation for 27 genes underlying immune traits. Collectively, these results demonstrate the functional role of PU.1 and its target enhancers in neutrophil transcriptional control and immune disease susceptibility."

Later, it was found concomitantly upregulated in podocytes. CMIP expression has also been reported in several types of cancer, including blood malignancies and solid tumors, in many cases accompanied by nephrotic syndrome. In addition to these observations, the duality of CMIP overexpression in the kidney and INS lesions, has been extensively reported as one of the adverse effects of anticancer therapy based on anti-receptor tyrosine kinase drugs. As a consequence, a growing body of evidence points at CMIP as playing a role in cancer. This includes its reciprocal regulatory ties with NF-κB and WT1, and the more recent reports showing an involvement in regulatory circuits in cancer cells. The ensemble of the current information justifies to propose CMIP as an important piece of the puzzle of biological systems involved in cancer and other diseases and its potential as a target."

Simultaneously to the epidemic spreading of childhood obesity, the rate of affected young has dramatically increased in the last decades with an estimated prevalence of NAFLD of 3%-10% in pediatric subjects in the world. The continuous improvement in NAFLD knowledge has significantly defined several risk factors associated to the natural history of this complex liver alteration. Among them, Insulin Resistance (IR) is certainly one of the main features. As well, not surprisingly, abnormal glucose tolerance (prediabetes and diabetes) is highly prevalent among children/adolescents with biopsy-proven NAFLD. In addition, other factors such as genetic, ethnicity, gender, age, puberty and lifestyle might affect the development and progression of hepatic alterations. However, available data are still lacking to confirm whether IR is a risk factor or a consequence of hepatic steatosis. There is also evidence that NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). In fact, NAFLD often coexist with central obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, which represent the main features of MetS. In this Review, main aspects of the natural history and risk factors of the disease are summarized in children and adolescents. In addition, the most relevant scientific evidence about the association between NAFLD and metabolic dysregulation, focusing on clinical, pathogenetic, and histological implication will be provided with some focuses on the main treatment options.Copyright © 2021 Scapaticci, D’Adamo, Mohn, Chiarelli and Giannini."

We performed a complete bioinformatic analysis in BrCa whole methylome datasets, analyzed using the Illumina methylation 450 bead-chip array. Differential methylation analysis vs. clinical end-points resulted in 11,176 to 27,786 differentially methylated genes (DMGs). Innovative automated machine learning (AutoML) was employed to construct signatures with translational value. Three highly performing and low-feature-number signatures were built: (1) A 5-gene signature discriminating BrCa patients from healthy individuals (area under the curve (AUC): 0.994 (0.982-1.000)). (2) A 3-gene signature identifying BrCa metastatic disease (AUC: 0.986 (0.921-1.000)). (3) Six equivalent 5-gene signatures diagnosing early disease (AUC: 0.973 (0.920-1.000)). Validation in independent patient groups verified performance. Bioinformatic tools for functional analysis and protein interaction prediction were also employed. All protein encoding features included in the signatures were associated with BrCa-related pathways. Functional analysis of DMGs highlighted the regulation of transcription as the main biological process, the nucleus as the main cellular component and transcription factor activity and sequence-specific DNA binding as the main molecular functions. Overall, three high-performance diagnostic/prognostic signatures were built and are readily available for improving BrCa precision management upon prospective clinical validation. Revisiting archived methylomes through novel bioinformatic approaches revealed significant clarifying knowledge for the contribution of gene methylation events in breast carcinogenesis."

A low incidence also means a low number of cases, which in turn means a low amount of information. To compensate, researchers have tried to increase the amount of information available from a single test using high-throughput technologies. This approach, referred to as single-omics analysis, has only been partially successful as one type of data may not be able to appropriately describe all the characteristics of a tumor. It is presently unclear what type of data can describe a particular clinical situation. One way to solve this problem is to use multi-omics data. When using many types of data, a selected data type or a combination of them may effectively resolve a clinical question. Hence, we conducted a comprehensive survey of papers in the field of neuro-oncology that used multi-omics data for analysis and found that most of the papers utilized machine learning techniques. This fact shows that it is useful to utilize machine learning techniques in multi-omics analysis. In this review, we discuss the current status of multi-omics analysis in the field of neuro-oncology and the importance of using machine learning techniques."
"33889285","Maternal obesity as a risk factor for developing diabetes in offspring: An epigenetic point of view.","World J Diabetes","According to the developmental origin of health and disease concept, the risk of many age-related diseases is not only determined by genetic and adult lifestyle factors but also by factors acting during early development. In particular, maternal obesity and neonatal accelerated growth predispose offspring to overweight and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adulthood. This concept mainly relies on the developmental plasticity of adipose tissue and pancreatic β-cell programming in response to suboptimalmilieuduring the perinatal period. These changes result in unhealthy hypertrophic adipocytes with decreased capacity to store fat, low-grade inflammation and loss of insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. Over the past years, many efforts have been made to understand how maternal obesity induces long-lasting adipose tissue and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction in offspring and what are the molecular basis of the transgenerational inheritance of T2D. In particular, rodent studies have shed light on the role of epigenetic mechanisms in linking maternal nutritional manipulations to the risk for T2D in adulthood. In this review, we discuss epigenetic adipocyte and β-cell remodeling during development in the progeny of obese mothers and the persistence of these marks as a basis of obesity and T2D predisposition.©The Author(s) 2021.

Inflammation and endocrine effects may act as central mechanisms of DM and cancer and stimulate the insulin-like growth factor 1-phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (IGF-1-PI3K-AKT-mTOR) pathway. Dysregulation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway leads to metabolic imbalance and indicates cancer risk. The use of metformin for chemoprevention has been shown to reduce CRC and adenoma incidence through the upregulation of AMPK, which causes cell cycle arrest in the Gap 1-S (G1-S) phase and inhibits the mTOR pathway, even potentially reversing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, evidence of the effects of metformin remain controversial in cancer prognosis. Several genes, such as transcription factor 7-like 2(TCF7L2), tumor protein P53 inducible nuclear protein 1(TP53INP1), gremlin 1 (GREM1), and potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1(KCNQ1), are pleiotropically related to DM as well as cancer risk and prognosis. Epigenetic modification of members of the Let-7 family such as miR-497, miR-486, and miR-223 is strongly associated with impaired glucose tolerance and CRC risk. Herein we review the pathophysiological and epidemiological evidence as well as potential underlying molecular mechanisms by which DM and hyperglycemia affect CRC risk.

"33916740","Radiation on Earth or in Space: What Does It Change?","Int J Mol Sci","After having been an instrument of the Cold War, space exploration has become a major technological, scientific and societal challenge for a number of countries. With new projects to return to the Moon and go to Mars, radiobiologists have been called upon to better assess the risks linked to exposure to radiation emitted from space (IRS), one of the major hazards for astronauts. To this aim, a major task is to identify the specificities of the different sources of IRS that concern astronauts. By considering the probabilities of the impact of IRS against spacecraft shielding, three conclusions can be drawn: (1) The impacts of heavy ions are rare and their contribution to radiation dose may be low during low Earth orbit; (2) secondary particles, including neutrons emitted at low energy from the spacecraft shielding, may be common in deep space and may preferentially target surface tissues such as the eyes and skin; (3) a ""bath of radiation"" composed of residual rays and fast neutrons inside the spacecraft may present a concern for deep tissues such as bones and the cardiovascular system. Hence, skin melanoma, cataracts, loss of bone mass, and aging of the cardiovascular system are possible, dependent on the dose, dose-rate, and individual factors. This suggests that both radiosusceptibility and radiodegeneration may be concerns related to space exploration. In addition, in the particular case of extreme solar events, radiosensitivity reactions-such as those observed in acute radiation syndrome-may occur and affect blood composition, gastrointestinal and neurologic systems. This review summarizes the specificities of space radiobiology and opens the debate as regards refinements of current radiation protection concepts that will be useful for the better estimation of risks."

Here we focus on the EU Child Cohort Network's core variables. These are a set of basic variables, derivable by the majority of participating cohorts and frequently used as covariates or exposures in lifecourse research. First, we describe the process by which the list of core variables was established. Second, we explain the protocol according to which these variables were harmonised in order to make them interoperable. Third, we describe the catalogue developed to ensure that the network's data are findable and reusable. Finally, we describe the core data, including the proportion of variables harmonised by each cohort and the number of children for whom harmonised core data are available. EU Child Cohort Network data will be analysed using a federated analysis platform, removing the need to physically transfer data and thus making the data more accessible to researchers. The network will add value to participating cohorts by increasing statistical power and exposure heterogeneity, as well as facilitating cross-cohort comparisons, cross-validation and replication.

Previous investigations have shown that autophagy possesses a crucial function in tumors. However, there is no consensus on the value of autophagy-associated genes in predicting the prognosis of CRC patients. This work screens autophagy-related markers and signaling pathways that may participate in the development of CRC, and establishes a prognostic model of CRC based on autophagy-associated genes.Gene transcripts from the TCGA database and autophagy-associated gene data from the GeneCards database were used to obtain expression levels of autophagy-associated genes, followed by Wilcox tests to screen for autophagy-related differentially expressed genes. Then, 11 key autophagy-associated genes were identified through univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis and used to establish prognostic models. Additionally, immunohistochemical and CRC cell line data were used to evaluate the results of our three autophagy-associated genes EPHB2, NOL3, and SNAI1 in TCGA. Based on the multivariate Cox analysis, risk scores were calculated and used to classify samples into high-risk and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, risk profiling, and independent prognosis analysis were carried out. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to estimate the specificity and sensitivity of the prognostic model. Finally, GSEA, GO, and KEGG analysis were performed to identify the relevant signaling pathways.A total of 301 autophagy-related genes were differentially expressed in CRC. The areas under the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year receiver operating characteristic curves of the autophagy-based prognostic model for CRC were 0.764, 0.751, and 0.729, respectively. GSEA analysis of the model showed significant enrichment in several tumor-relevant pathways and cellular protective biological processes. The expression of EPHB2, IL-13, MAP2, RPN2, and TRAF5 was correlated with microsatellite instability (MSI), while the expression of IL-13, RPN2, and TRAF5 was related to tumor mutation burden (TMB). GO analysis showed that the 11 target autophagy genes were chiefly enriched in mRNA processing, RNA splicing, and regulation of the mRNA metabolic process. KEGG analysis showed enrichment mainly in spliceosomes. We constructed a prognostic risk assessment model based on 11 autophagy-related genes in CRC.A prognostic risk assessment model based on 11 autophagy-associated genes was constructed in CRC.

"33926541","Evaluating the transcriptional fidelity of cancer models.","Genome Med","Cancer researchers use cell lines, patient-derived xenografts, engineered mice, and tumoroids as models to investigate tumor biology and to identify therapies. The generalizability and power of a model derive from the fidelity with which it represents the tumor type under investigation; however, the extent to which this is true is often unclear. The preponderance of models and the ability to readily generate new ones has created a demand for tools that can measure the extent and ways in which cancer models resemble or diverge from native tumors.We developed a machine learning-based computational tool, CancerCellNet, that measures the similarity of cancer models to 22 naturally occurring tumor types and 36 subtypes, in a platform and species agnostic manner. We applied this tool to 657 cancer cell lines, 415 patient-derived xenografts, 26 distinct genetically engineered mouse models, and 131 tumoroids. We validated CancerCellNet by application to independent data, and we tested several predictions with immunofluorescence.We have documented the cancer models with the greatest transcriptional fidelity to natural tumors, we have identified cancers underserved by adequate models, and we have found models with annotations that do not match their classification. By comparing models across modalities, we report that, on average, genetically engineered mice and tumoroids have higher transcriptional fidelity than patient-derived xenografts and cell lines in four out of five tumor types. However, several patient-derived xenografts and tumoroids have classification scores that are on par with native tumors, highlighting both their potential as faithful model classes and their heterogeneity.CancerCellNet enables the rapid assessment of transcriptional fidelity of tumor models. We have made CancerCellNet available as a freely downloadable R package ( https://github.com/pcahan1/cancerCellNet ) and as a web application ( http://www.cahanlab.org/resources/cancerCellNet_web ) that can be applied to new cancer models that allows for direct comparison to the cancer models evaluated here."
"33924498","Analysis of TERT Isoforms across TCGA, GTEx and CCLE Datasets.","Cancers (Basel)","Reactivation of the multi-subunit ribonucleoprotein telomerase is the primary telomere maintenance mechanism in cancer, but it is rate-limited by the enzymatic component, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). While regulatory in nature, TERT alternative splice variant/isoform regulation and functions are not fully elucidated and are further complicated by their highly diverse expression and nature. Our primary objective was to characterize TERT isoform expression across 7887 neoplastic and 2099 normal tissue samples using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), respectively. We confirmed the global overexpression and splicing shift towards full-length TERT in neoplastic tissue. Stratifying by tissue type we found uncharacteristic TERT expression in normal brain tissue subtypes. Stratifying by tumor-specific subtypes, we detailed TERT expression differences potentially regulated by subtype-specific molecular characteristics. Focusing on β-deletion splicing regulation, we found the NOVA1trans-acting factor to mediate alternative splicing in a cancer-dependent manner. Of relevance to future tissue-specific studies, we clustered cancer cell lines with tumors from related origin based on TERT isoform expression patterns. Taken together, our work has reinforced the need for tissue and tumour-specific TERT investigations, provided avenues to do so, and brought to light the current technical limitations of bioinformatic analyses of TERT isoform expression."
"33921749","Analysis of LAGEs Family Gene Signature and Prognostic Relevance in Breast Cancer.","Diagnostics (Basel)","Breast cancer (BRCA) is one of the most complex diseases and involves several biological processes. Members of the L-antigen (LAGE) family participate in the development of various cancers, but their expressions and prognostic values in breast cancer remain to be clarified. High-throughput methods for exploring disease progression mechanisms might play a pivotal role in the improvement of novel therapeutics. Therefore, gene expression profiles and clinical data of LAGE family members were acquired from the cBioportal database, followed by verification using the Oncomine and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier method was applied to explore correlations between expressions of LAGE family members and prognoses of breast cancer patients. MetaCore, GlueGo, and GluePedia were used to comprehensively study the transcript expression signatures of LAGEs and their co-expressed genes together with LAGE-related signal transduction pathways in BRCA. The result indicated that higher LAGE3 messenger (m)RNA expressions were observed in BRCA tissues than in normal tissues, and they were also associated with the stage of BRCA patients. Kaplan-Meier plots showed that overexpression of LAGE1, LAGE2A, LAGE2B, and LAGE3 were highly correlated to poor survival in most types of breast cancer. Significant associations of LAGE family genes were correlated with the cell cycle, focal adhesion, and extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interactions as indicated by functional enrichment analyses. Collectively, LAGE family members' gene expression levels were related to adverse clinicopathological factors and prognoses of BRCA patients; therefore, LAGEs have the potential to serve as prognosticators of BRCA patients."
"33919717","Gene Amplification-Associated Overexpression of the Selenoprotein tRNA Enzyme TRIT1 Confers Sensitivity to Arsenic Trioxide in Small-Cell Lung Cancer.","Cancers (Basel)","The alteration of RNA modification patterns is emerging as a common feature of human malignancies. If these changes affect key RNA molecules for mRNA translation, such as transfer RNA, they can have important consequences for cell transformation. TRIT1 is the enzyme responsible for the hypermodification of adenosine 37 in the anticodon region of human tRNAs containing serine and selenocysteine. Herein, we show that TRIT1 undergoes gene amplification-associated overexpression in cancer cell lines and primary samples of small-cell lung cancer. From growth and functional standpoints, the induced depletion of TRIT1 expression in amplified cells reduces their tumorigenic potential and downregulates the selenoprotein transcripts. We observed that TRIT1-amplified cells are sensitive to arsenic trioxide, a compound that regulates selenoproteins, whereas reduction of TRIT1 levels confers loss of sensitivity to the drug. Overall, our results indicate a role for TRIT1 as a small-cell lung cancer-relevant gene that, when undergoing gene amplification-associated activation, can be targeted with the differentiation agent arsenic trioxide."

Treatment is challenging as FA patients display enhanced toxicity to standard treatments, including radio/chemotherapy. Therefore, better therapies as well as new disease models are urgently needed. We have used CRISPR/Cas9 editing tools in order to interrupt the humanFANCAgene by the generation of insertions/deletions (indels) in exon 4 in two cancer cell lines from sporadic HNSCC having no mutation in FA-genes: CAL27 and CAL33 cells. Our approach allowed efficient editing, subsequent purification of single-cell clones, and Sanger sequencing validation at the edited locus. Clones having frameshift indels in homozygosis did not express FANCA protein and were selected for further analysis. When compared with parental CAL27 and CAL33,FANCA-mutant cell clones displayed a FA-phenotype as they (i) are highly sensitive to DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) agents such as mitomycin C (MMC) or cisplatin, (ii) do not monoubiquitinate FANCD2 upon MMC treatment and therefore (iii) do not form FANCD2 nuclear foci, and (iv) they display increased chromosome fragility and G2 arrest after diepoxybutane (DEB) treatment. TheseFANCA-mutant clones display similar growth rates as their parental cells. Interestingly, mutant cells acquire phenotypes associated with more aggressive disease, such as increased migration in wound healing assays. Therefore, CAL27 and CAL33 cells withFANCAmutations are phenocopies of FA-HNSCC cells."
"33912452","LINC00460 Is a Dual Biomarker That Acts as a Predictor for Increased Prognosis in Basal-Like Breast Cancer and Potentially Regulates Immunogenic and Differentiation-Related Genes.","Front Oncol","Breast cancer (BRCA) is a serious public health problem, as it is the most frequent malignant tumor in women worldwide. BRCA is a molecularly heterogeneous disease, particularly at gene expression (mRNAs) level. Recent evidence shows that coding RNAs represent only 34% of the total transcriptome in a human cell. The rest of the 66% of RNAs are non-coding, so we might be missing relevant biological, clinical or regulatory information. In this report, we identified two novel tumor types from TCGA with LINC00460 deregulation. We used survival analysis to demonstrate that LINC00460 expression is a marker for poor overall (OS), relapse-free (RFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in basal-like BRCA patients. LINC00460 expression is a potential marker for aggressive phenotypes in distinct tumors, including HPV-negative HNSC, stage IV KIRC, locally advanced lung cancer and basal-like BRCA. We show that the LINC00460 prognostic expression effect is tissue-specific, since its upregulation can predict poor OS in some tumors, but also predicts an improved clinical course in BRCA patients. We found that the LINC00460 expression is significantly enriched in the Basal-like 2 (BL2) TNBC subtype and potentially regulates the WNT differentiation pathway. LINC00460 can also modulate a plethora of immunogenic related genes in BRCA, such asSFRP5, FOSL1, IFNK, CSF2, DUSP7andIL1Aand interacts with miR-103-a-1,in-silico, which, in turn, can no longer target WNT7A. Finally, LINC00460:WNT7A ratio constitutes a composite marker for decreased OS and DMFS in Basal-like BRCA, and can predict anthracycline therapy response in ER-BRCA patients. This evidence confirms that LINC00460 is a master regulator in BRCA molecular circuits and influences clinical outcome.Copyright © 2021 Cisneros-Villanueva, Hidalgo-Pérez, Cedro-Tanda, Peña-Luna, Mancera-Rodríguez, Hurtado-Cordova, Rivera-Salgado, Martínez-Aguirre, Jiménez-Morales, Alfaro-Ruiz, Arellano-Llamas, Tenorio-Torres, Domínguez-Reyes, Villegas-Carlos, Ríos-Romero and Hidalgo-Miranda."

Many become refractory to drugs due to underlying resistance-associated mutations. KEAP1 mutant NSCLCs further activate NRF2 and upregulate its client PTGR1. LP-184, a novel alkylating agent belonging to the acylfulvene class is a prodrug dependent upon PTGR1. We hypothesized that NSCLC with KEAP1 mutations would continue to remain sensitive to LP-184. LP-184 demonstrated highly potent anticancer activity both in primary NSCLC cell lines and in those originating from brain metastases of primary lung cancers. LP-184 activity correlated with PTGR1 transcript levels but was independent of mutations in key oncogenes (KRAS and KEAP1) and tumor suppressors (TP53 and STK11). LP-184 was orders of magnitude more potentin vitrothan cisplatin and pemetrexed. Correlative analyses of sensitivity with cell line gene expression patterns indicated that alterations in NRF2, MET, EGFR and BRAF consistently modulated LP-184 sensitivity. These correlations were then extended to TCGA analysis of 517 lung adenocarcinoma patients, out of which 35% showed elevated PTGR1, and 40% of those further displayed statistically significant co-occurrence of KEAP1 mutations. The gene correlates of LP-184 sensitivity allow additional personalization of therapeutic options for future treatment of NSCLC.Copyright: © 2021 Kulkarni et al."

Bulk RNA-sequencing approaches have been employed to elucidate transcriptional differences between MSI-H and microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC tumors. These approaches are frequently confounded by the complex cellular heterogeneity of tumors. We performed single-cell deconvolution of bulk RNA-sequencing on The Cancer Genome Atlas colon adenocarcinoma (TCGA-COAD) dataset. Cell composition within each dataset was estimated using CIBERSORTx. Cell composition differences were analyzed using linear regression. Significant differences in abundance were observed for 13 of 19 cell types between MSI-H and MSS/MSI-L tumors in TCGA-COAD. This included a novel finding of increased enteroendocrine (q= 3.71E-06) and reduced colonocyte populations (q= 2.21E-03) in MSI-H versus MSS/MSI-L tumors. We were able to validate some of these differences in an independent biopsy dataset. By incorporating cell composition into our regression model, we identified 3,193 differentially expressed genes (q= 0.05), of which 556 were deemed novel. We subsequently validated many of these genes in an independent dataset of colon cancer cell lines. In summary, we show that some of the challenges associated with cellular heterogeneity can be overcome using single-cell deconvolution, and through our analysis we highlight several novel gene targets for further investigation.Copyright: © 2021 Devall and Casey."

The poor prognosis of HCC is mainly due to late diagnosis; many new biomarkers have been developed for HCC diagnosis. However, few markers are quickly translated into clinical practice; early and differential diagnosis of HCC from cirrhosis and/or hepatitis is still a clinical challenge. Metabolomics and biochemical methods were used to reveal specific serum biomarkers of HCC. Most of the elevated metabolites in HCC and HBV patients were overlapped compared with controls. Urea was the specifically elevated serum biomarker of HCC patients. Moreover, urea combined with AFP and CEA can improve the sensitivity of HCC diagnosis. The plasma ammonia of HCC patients was significantly higher than healthy controls. Co-culture cell model revealed normal liver cells cooperated with cancer cells to metabolize ammonia into urea. The urea metabolism in cancer cells marginally depended on the expression of CPS1. However, the expression of CPS1 did not change with ammonium chloride, which might regulate the urea cycle through enzyme activity. The urea cycle could detoxify high concentrations of ammonia to promote cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, urea was a by-product of ammonia metabolism and could be a potential serum biomarker for HCC. The combined application of metabolomics and biochemical methods can discover new biomarkers for the early diagnosis of HCC and be quickly applied to clinical diagnosis.Copyright © 2021 Bai, Wang, Dong, Li, Yu, Guo, Zhou, Li, Yan, Wang, Wang, Li and Ren."

The goal of those studies is to translate the findings from in vitro studies of cancer cell lines into in vivo therapeutic relevance and, eventually, patients' care. Tremendous progress has been made.In this work, we built predictive models for 453 drugs using data on gene expression and drug sensitivity (IC50) from cancer cell lines. We identified many known drug-gene interactions and uncovered several potentially novel drug-gene associations. Importantly, we further applied these predictive models to ~ 17,000 bulk RNA-seq samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database to predict drug sensitivity for both normal and tumor tissues. We created a web site for users to visualize and download our predicted data ( https://manticore.niehs.nih.gov/cancerRxTissue ). Using trametinib as an example, we showed that our approach can faithfully recapitulate the known tumor specificity of the drug.We demonstrated that our approach can predict drugs that 1) are tumor-type specific; 2) elicit higher sensitivity from tumor compared to corresponding normal tissue; 3) elicit differential sensitivity across breast cancer subtypes.

Although deep learning approaches have shown potential in generating compounds with desired chemical properties, they disregard the cellular environment of target diseases. Bridging systems biology and drug design, we present a reinforcement learning method for de novo molecular design from gene expression profiles. We construct a hybrid Variational Autoencoder that tailors molecules to target-specific transcriptomic profiles, using an anticancer drug sensitivity prediction model (PaccMann) as reward function. Without incorporating information about anticancer drugs, the molecule generation is biased toward compounds with high predicted efficacy against cell lines or cancer types. The generation can be further refined by subsidiary constraints such as toxicity. Our cancer-type-specific candidate drugs are similar to cancer drugs in drug-likeness, synthesizability, and solubility and frequently exhibit the highest structural similarity to compounds with known efficacy against these cancer types.© 2021 The Author(s)."

Investigation of these potential dependency genes from human cancer cell lines in the real-world patients cohort would evaluate their prognostic value thus facilitate their clinical application and guide drug development.A few genes were selected from top clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) lineage preferential dependency candidates from Depmap. Their characteristic including expression levels both in normal and tumor tissues and correlations with methylation or copy number, genetic alterations, functional enrichment, immune-associated interactions, prognostic value were evaluated in KIRC cohort from TCGA, GTEx, and multiple other open databases and platforms.16 genes were collected from 106 ccRCC preferential candidates and further analyzed including B4GALT4, BCL2L1, CDH2, COPG1, CRB3, FERMT2, GET4, GPX4, HNF1B, ITGAV, MDM2, NFE2L2, PAX8, RUVBL1, TFRC, and TNFSF10. The normalized gene effect scores of these genes varied from different ccRCC cell lines and principal component analysis (PCA) showed their tissue specificity expression profiles. Genetic alteration rates of them were low to moderate (0.7%-13%) in KIRC cohort. CDH2, MDM2, TNFSF10 showed a statistically significant higher level in tumors than normal tissues while PAX8 and FERMT2 were significantly downregulated. Moderate positive or negative correlations were observed in several genes between their expression and relative gene copy number or methylation levels, respectively. Based on the multivariable COX regression model adjusted by critical clinical variables revealed the expression of GET4 (p=0.002, HR=1.023 95%CI 1.009-1.038) and CRB3 (p<0.001, HR=0.969 95%CI 0.960-0.980) were independent predictive factors for overall survival in KIRC cohort.A dependency gene validated in cell lines didn't directly represent its role in corresponding patients with same histological type and their prognostic value might be determined by multiple factors including dependency driven types, genetic alteration rates and expression levels. GET4 and CRB3 were the independent prognostic factors for ccRCC patients. CRB3 seemed like a potential broad tumor suppressor gene while GET4 might be a ccRCC preferential dependency gene with a ligandable structure.© The author(s)."
"33836003","High ELF4 expression in human cancers is associated with worse disease outcomes and increased resistance to anticancer drugs.","PLoS One","The malignant phenotype of tumour cells is fuelled by changes in the expression of various transcription factors, including some of the well-studied proteins such as p53 and Myc. Despite significant progress made, little is known about several other transcription factors, including ELF4, and how they help shape the oncogenic processes in cancer cells. To this end, we performed a bioinformatics analysis to facilitate a detailed understanding of how the expression variations of ELF4 in human cancers are related to disease outcomes and the cancer cell drug responses. Here, using ELF4 mRNA expression data of 9,350 samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer project, we identify two groups of patient's tumours: those that expressed high ELF4 transcripts and those that expressed low ELF4 transcripts across 32 different human cancers. We uncover that patients segregated into these two groups are associated with different clinical outcomes. Further, we find that tumours that express high ELF4 mRNA levels tend to be of a higher-grade, afflict a significantly older patient population and have a significantly higher mutation burden. By analysing dose-response profiles to 397 anti-cancer drugs of 612 well-characterised human cancer cell lines, we discover that cell lines that expressed high ELF4 mRNA transcript are significantly less responsive to 129 anti-cancer drugs, and only significantly more response to three drugs: dasatinib, WH-4-023, and Ponatinib, all of which remarkably target the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase SRC and tyrosine-protein kinase ABL1. Collectively our analyses have shown that, across the 32 different human cancers, the patients afflicted with tumours that overexpress ELF4 tended to have a more aggressive disease that is also is more likely more refractory to most anti-cancer drugs, a finding upon which we could devise novel categorisation of patient tumours, treatment, and prognostic strategies."

We study the modification of the gene expression distribution function when the biological state of a system experiences a change. This change may be the result of a selective pressure, as in the Long Term Evolution Experiment with E. Coli populations, or the progression to Alzheimer disease in aged brains, or the progression from a normal tissue to the cancer state. The first two cases seem to belong to a class of transitions, where the initial and final states are relatively close to each other, and the distribution function for the differential expressions is short ranged, with a tail of only a few dozens of strongly varying genes. In the latter case, cancer, the initial and final states are far apart and separated by a low-fitness barrier. The distribution function shows a very heavy tail, with thousands of silenced and over-expressed genes. We characterize the biological states by means of their principal component representations, and the expression distribution functions by their maximal and minimal differential expression values and the exponents of the Pareto laws describing the tails."

In general, DNA methylation of CpG sites in the promoter region impedes gene expression, whereas DNA demethylation contributes to gene expression. Here, we evaluated the methylation status of CpG sites in genomic DNA promoter regions in dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) of diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) mice. In our research, streptozotocin (STZ) was intraperitoneally injected into mice to construct DNP models. The DNP mice showed higher fasting blood glucose (above 11.1 mmol/L), lower body weight, and mechanical allodynia than control mice. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) revealed an altered methylation pattern in CpG sites in the DNA promoter regions in DRGs of DNP mice. The results showed 376 promoter regions with hypermethylated CpG sites and 336 promoter regions with hypomethylated CpG sites. In addition, our data indicated that altered DNA methylation occurs primarily on CpG sites in DNA promoter regions. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that differentially methylated CpG sites annotated genes were involved in activities of the nervous and sensory systems. Enrichment analysis indicated that genes in these pathways contributed to diabetes or pain. In conclusion, our study enriched the role of DNA methylation in DNP."

Primary multi-ancestry analysis in 62,969 individuals in stage 1 identified three novel gene by sleep interactions that were replicated in an additional 59,296 individuals in stage 2 (stage 1 + 2 Pjoint < 5 × 10-8), including rs7955964 (FIGNL2/ANKRD33) that increases BP among long sleepers, and rs73493041 (SNORA26/C9orf170) and rs10406644 (KCTD15/LSM14A) that increase BP among short sleepers (Pint < 5 × 10-8). Secondary ancestry-specific analysis identified another novel gene by long sleep interaction at rs111887471 (TRPC3/KIAA1109) in individuals of African ancestry (Pint = 2 × 10-6). Combined stage 1 and 2 analyses additionally identified significant gene by long sleep interactions at 10 loci including MKLN1 and RGL3/ELAVL3 previously associated with BP, and significant gene by short sleep interactions at 10 loci including C2orf43 previously associated with BP (Pint < 10-3). 2df test also identified novel loci for BP after modeling sleep that has known functions in sleep-wake regulation, nervous and cardiometabolic systems.

The granularity of this knowledge is further propelled when combining two batches of scRNA-seq into a single large dataset. This strategy is however hampered by technical differences between these batches. Typically, these batch effects are resolved by matching similar cells across the different batches. Current approaches, however, do not take into account that we can constrain this matching further as cells can also be matched on their cell type identity. We use an auto-encoder to embed two batches in the same space such that cells are matched. To accomplish this, we use a loss function that preserves: (1) cell-cell distances within each of the two batches, as well as (2) cell-cell distances between two batches when the cells are of the same cell-type. The cell-type guidance is unsupervised, i.e., a cell-type is defined as a cluster in the original batch. We evaluated the performance of our cluster-guided batch alignment (CBA) using pancreas and mouse cell atlas datasets, against six state-of-the-art single cell alignment methods: Seurat v3, BBKNN, Scanorama, Harmony, LIGER, and BERMUDA. Compared to other approaches, CBA preserves the cluster separation in the original datasets while still being able to align the two datasets. We confirm that this separation is biologically meaningful by identifying relevant differential expression of genes for these preserved clusters.Copyright © 2021 Yu, Mahfouz and Reinders."

There is a need to clarify the evidence base on the impact of dietary antioxidant supplementation during chemotherapy on both side effect and treatment efficacy outcomes. We will use a scoping review approach to identify what systematic review evidence exists regarding beneficial and harmful effects of dietary antioxidant supplements when used during cancer treatment.We will use Arksey & O'Malley and Joanna Briggs Institute methods for scoping reviews. We will systematically search PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Dissertations & Theses Global and the Cochrane Library from inception to October 2020. Systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials of oral dietary antioxidant supplements used by participants receiving curative chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other biological therapy for cancer will be eligible. Two reviewers will screen citations and full texts for inclusion and chart data on research questions from included reviews. Two reviewers will assess the overall confidence in systematic review results using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2), and summarised evidence will focus on reviews rated at high or moderate overall confidence. Tables will be used to map existing evidence and identify evidence gaps for safety and effectiveness outcomes.This scoping review does not require ethical approval as it is a secondary assessment of available literature. The results will be presented at conferences and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

"33845875","A benchmark for RNA-seq deconvolution analysis under dynamic testing environments.","Genome Biol","Deconvolution analyses have been widely used to track compositional alterations of cell types in gene expression data. Although a large number of novel methods have been developed, due to a lack of understanding of the effects of modeling assumptions and tuning parameters, it is challenging for researchers to select an optimal deconvolution method suitable for the targeted biological conditions.To systematically reveal the pitfalls and challenges of deconvolution analyses, we investigate the impact of several technical and biological factors including simulation model, quantification unit, component number, weight matrix, and unknown content by constructing three benchmarking frameworks. These frameworks cover comparative analysis of 11 popular deconvolution methods under 1766 conditions.We provide new insights to researchers for future application, standardization, and development of deconvolution tools on RNA-seq data."
"33916664","Interplay between Histone and DNA Methylation Seen through Comparative Methylomes in Rare Mendelian Disorders.","Int J Mol Sci","DNA methylation (DNAme) profiling is used to establish specific biomarkers to improve the diagnosis of patients with inherited neurodevelopmental disorders and to guide mutation screening. In the specific case of mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery, it also provides the basis to infer mechanistic aspects with regard to DNAme determinants and interplay between histone and DNAme that apply to humans. Here, we present comparative methylomes from patients with mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, in their catalytic domain or their N-terminal parts involved in reading histone methylation, or in histone H3 lysine (K) methylases NSD1 or SETD2 (H3 K36) or KMT2D/MLL2 (H3 K4). We provide disease-specific DNAme signatures and document the distinct consequences of mutations in enzymes with very similar or intertwined functions, including at repeated sequences and imprinted loci. We found that KMT2D and SETD2 germline mutations have little impact on DNAme profiles. In contrast, the overlapping DNAme alterations downstream of NSD1 or DNMT3 mutations underlines functional links, more specifically between NSD1 and DNMT3B at heterochromatin regions or DNMT3A at regulatory elements. Together, these data indicate certain discrepancy with the mechanisms described in animal models or the existence of redundant or complementary functions unforeseen in humans."

Previously published data on gene methylation of EOC focused mainly on single gene or on cancer tissues. Objectives of the study were to estimate the promoter hypermethylation status ofDAPK1andp16INK4agenes in circulating blood of EOC patients and to determine their association with clinicopathological features of EOC. This case-control study included 50 EOC patients and 20 apparently healthy and age matched female controls. Isolation of genomic DNA was carried out from peripheral venous blood. Methylation in promoter region ofDAPK1andp16INK4agenes was determined by methylation-specific PCR. Methylation ofDAPK1was occurred in 42 out of 50 cases (84.0%) and methylation ofp16INK4agene was occurred in 34 out of 50 cases (68.0%). Methylation of both genes was occurred in 25 cases (50.0%). Occurrence of methylation inDAPK1andp16INK4agenes was statistically significant (p < 0.0001) in cases compared to controls. Methylation of both genes was not statistically associated with age at diagnosis, menopausal status, histopathological types and FIGO staging of EOC. Identification of the peculiar promoter hypermethylation ofDAPK1andp16INK4agenes might be a successful approach for ancillary diagnosis of EOC at early stage in blood sample.© Association of Clinical Biochemists of India 2020."

Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) play an undeniable role in tumor development by activating multiple signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT/mTOR that facilitate brain tumor formation. CD133, a transmembrane glycoprotein, has been used to classify cancer stem cells (CSCs) in GBM. The therapeutic value of CD133 is a biomarker of the CSC in multiple cancers. It also leads to growth and recurrence of the tumor. More recent findings have confirmed the association of telomerase/TERT with Wnt/β-catenin and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. Advance studies have shown that crosstalk between CD133, Wnt/β-catenin, and telomerase/TERT can facilitate GBM stemness and lead to therapeutic resistance. Mechanistic insight into signaling mechanisms downstream of surface biomarkers has been revolutionized by facilitating targeting of tumor-specific molecular deregulation. This review also addresses the importance of interplay between CD133, Wnt/β-catenin and TERT signaling pathways in GSCs and outlines the future therapeutic goals for glioblastoma treatment.Copyright © 2021 Behrooz and Syahir."

The objective of the present study was to investigate nasal transcriptomic profiles associated with dog dander sensitisation in school children and to reveal clinical symptoms related with these profiles.RNA was extracted from nasal epithelial cell brushings of children sensitised to dog dander and healthy controls. Blood sample analyses included IgE against dog dander, dog allergen molecules, other airborne and food allergens, basophil activation and white blood cell counts. Clinical history of asthma and rhinitis was recorded, and lung function was assessed (spirometry, methacholine provocation and exhaled nitric oxide fraction).The most overexpressed gene in children sensitised to dog dander compared to healthy controls wasCST1, coding for Cystatin 1. A cluster of these children with enhancedCST1expression showed lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s, increased bronchial hyperreactivity, pronounced eosinophilia and higher basophil allergen threshold sensitivity compared with other children sensitised to dog dander. In addition, multi-sensitisation to lipocalins was more common in this group.Overexpression ofCST1is associated with more severe allergic airway disease in children sensitised to dog dander.CST1is thus a possible biomarker of the severity of allergic airway disease and a possible therapeutic target for the future treatment of airborne allergy.Copyright ©The authors 2021.

However, it is unknown how asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and allergic sensitisation relate toFeNO, particularly among adolescents and in overlapping conditions. We sought to determine the associations between asthma, AR, and aeroallergen immunoglobulin (Ig)E andFeNOin adolescents. We measuredFeNOamong 929 adolescents (aged 11-16 years) in Project Viva, an unselected prebirth cohort in Massachusetts, USA. We defined asthma as ever asthma physician diagnosis plus wheezing in the past year or taking asthma medications in the past month, AR as a physician diagnosis of hay fever or AR, and aeroallergen IgE as any IgE >0.35 IU·mL-1among 592 participants who provided blood samples. We examined associations of asthma, AR and IgE with percent difference inFeNOin linear regression models adjusted for sex, race/ethnicity, age and height, maternal education and smoking during pregnancy, and household/neighbourhood demographics. Asthma (14%) was associated with 97% higherFeNO(95% CI 70-128%), AR (21%) with 45% higherFeNO(95% CI 28-65%), and aeroallergen IgE (58%) with 102% higherFeNO(95% CI 80-126%) compared to those without each condition, respectively. In the absence of asthma or AR, aeroallergen IgE was associated with 75% higherFeNO(95% CI 52-101), while asthma and AR were not associated withFeNOin the absence of IgE. The link between asthma and AR withFeNOis limited to those with IgE-mediated phenotypes.FeNOmay be elevated in those with allergic sensitisation alone, even in the absence of asthma or AR.Copyright ©The authors 2021."
"33855158","Adverse childhood circumstances and cognitive function in middle-aged and older Chinese adults: Lower level or faster decline?","SSM Popul Health","We examine the long-term relationship between childhood circumstances and cognitive aging. In particular, we differentiate the level of cognitive deficit from the rate of cognitive decline. Applying a linear mixed-effect model to three waves of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Surveys (CHARLS 2011, 2013, 2015) and matching cognitive outcomes to CHARLS Life History Survey (2014), we find that key domains of childhood circumstances, including family socioeconomic status (SES), neighborhood cohesion, friendship, and health conditions, are significantly associated with both the level of cognitive deficit and the rate of decline. In contrast, childhood neighborhood safety only affects the level of cognitive deficit. Childhood relationship with mother only affects the rate of cognitive decline. The effects of adverse childhood circumstances are generally larger on level of cognitive deficit than on rate of cognitive decline. Moreover, education plays a more important role in mediating the relationships compared to other later-life factors. These findings suggest that exposure to disadvantaged childhood circumstances can exacerbate cognitive deficit as well as cognitive decline over time, which may be partially ameliorated by educational attainment.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"33936161","<i>KLF4</i>, a Key Regulator of a Transitive Triplet, Acts on the TGF-β Signaling Pathway and Contributes to High-Altitude Adaptation of Tibetan Pigs.","Front Genet","Tibetan pigs are native mammalian species on the Tibetan Plateau that have evolved distinct physiological traits that allow them to tolerate high-altitude hypoxic environments. However, the genetic mechanism underlying this adaptation remains elusive. Here, based on multitissue transcriptional data from high-altitude Tibetan pigs and low-altitude Rongchang pigs, we performed a weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and identified key modules related to these tissues. Complex network analysis and bioinformatics analysis were integrated to identify key genes and three-node network motifs. We found that among the six tissues (muscle, liver, heart, spleen, kidneys, and lungs), lung tissue may be the key organs for Tibetan pigs to adapt to hypoxic environment. In the lung tissue of Tibetan pigs, we identifiedKLF4,BCL6B,EGR1,EPAS1,SMAD6,SMAD7,KDR,ATOH8, andCCN1genes as potential regulators of hypoxia adaption. We found thatKLF4andEGR1genes might simultaneously regulate theBCL6Bgene, forming aKLF4-EGR1-BCL6Bcomplex. This complex, dominated byKLF4, may enhance the hypoxia tolerance of Tibetan pigs by mediating the TGF-β signaling pathway. The complex may also affect the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which plays an important role in angiogenesis caused by hypoxia. Therefore, we postulate that theKLF4-EGR1-BCL6Bcomplex may be beneficial for Tibetan pigs to survive better in the hypoxia environments. Although further molecular experiments and independent large-scale studies are needed to verify our findings, these findings may provide new details of the regulatory architecture of hypoxia-adaptive genes and are valuable for understanding the genetic mechanism of hypoxic adaptation in mammals.Copyright © 2021 Wang, Guo, Liu, Zhang, Cui, Ding, Wang, Wang and Wang."
"33897618","Modulating the Microbiota as a Therapeutic Intervention for Type 2 Diabetes.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Mounting evidence suggested that the gut microbiota has a significant role in the metabolism and disease status of the host. In particular, Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), which has a complex etiology that includes obesity and chronic low-grade inflammation, is modulated by the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites. Current literature supports that unbalanced gut microbial composition (dysbiosis) is a risk factor for T2D. In this review, we critically summarize the recent findings regarding the role of gut microbiota in T2D. Beyond these associative studies, we focus on the causal relationship between microbiota and T2D established using fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or probiotic supplementation, and the potential underlying mechanisms such as byproducts of microbial metabolism. These microbial metabolites are small molecules that establish communication between microbiota and host cells. We critically summarize the associations between T2D and microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and trimethylamine N-Oxide (TMAO). Additionally, we comment on how host genetic architecture and the epigenome influence the microbial composition and thus how the gut microbiota may explain part of the missing heritability of T2D found by GWAS analysis. We also discuss future directions in this field and how approaches such as FMT, prebiotics, and probiotics supplementation are being considered as potential therapeutics for T2D.Copyright © 2021 Huda, Kim and Bennett."

The role of placental human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in ensuring the production of TH is less well understood. The objective of the study was to evaluate 1) associations of placental hCG and its subunits, and maternal TH in the second trimester, and 2) the single and joint effects of TH and placental hormones on cognitive development and communication at ages 1 and 3 years. Fifty individuals (5%) were selected from the CANDLE (Conditions Affecting Neurocognitive Development and Early Learning) pregnancy cohort in Memphis, Tennessee, with recruitment from 2006 to 2011, to equally represent male and female fetuses. Participants were 68% Black and 32% White. Hormones measured were maternal thyroid (thyrotropin [TSH] and free thyroxine [FT4]) and placental hormones (hCG, its hyperglycosylated form [hCG-h], and free α- [hCGα] and β-subunits [hCGβ]) in maternal serum (17-28 weeks). The primary outcome measurement was the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. All forms of hCG were negatively associated with FT4 and not associated with TSH. hCGα was associated with cognitive development at age 1 year and jointly interacted with TSH to predict cognitive development at age 3 years. This pilot study added insight into the thyrotropic actions of hCG in the second trimester, and into the significance of this mechanism for brain development. More research is warranted to elucidate differences between hCGα, hCGβ, and hCG-h in relation to TH regulation and child brain function.© The Author(s) 2021.

"33920293","Towards Novel Non-Invasive Colorectal Cancer Screening Methods: A Comprehensive Review.","Cancers (Basel)","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading cancer-related causes of death in the world. Since the 70s, many countries have adopted different CRC screening programs, which has resulted in a decrease in mortality. However, current screening test options still present downsides. The commercialized stool-based tests present high false-positive rates and low sensitivity, which negatively affects the detection of early stage carcinogenesis. The gold standard colonoscopy has low uptake due to its invasiveness and the perception of discomfort and embarrassment that the procedure may bring. In this review, we collected and described the latest data about alternative CRC screening techniques that can overcome these disadvantages. Web of Science and PubMed were employed as search engines for studies reporting on CRC screening tests and future perspectives. The searches generated 555 articles, of which 93 titles were selected. Finally, a total of 50 studies, describing 14 different CRC alternative tests, were included. Among the investigated techniques, the main feature that could have an impact on CRC screening perception and uptake was the ease of sample collection. Urine, exhaled breath, and blood-based tests promise to achieve good diagnostic performance (sensitivity of 63-100%, 90-95%, and 47-97%, respectively) while minimizing stress and discomfort for the patient."

With the present studies, we sought to determine the role of myeloid cells in the vascular vs. cerebral consequences of exposure to aircraft noise. Toxin-mediated ablation of lysozyme M+(LysM+) myeloid cells was performed in LysMCreiDTRmice carrying a cre-inducible diphtheria toxin receptor. In the last 4d of toxin treatment, the animals were exposed to noise at maximum and mean sound pressure levels of 85 and 72 dB(A), respectively. Flow cytometry analysis revealed accumulation of CD45+, CD11b+, F4/80+, and Ly6G-Ly6C+cells in the aortas of noise-exposed mice, which was prevented by LysM+cell ablation in the periphery, whereas brain infiltrates were even exacerbated upon ablation. Aircraft noise-induced increases in blood pressure and endothelial dysfunction of the aorta and retinal/mesenteric arterioles were almost completely normalized by ablation. Correspondingly, reactive oxygen species in the aorta, heart, and retinal/mesenteric vessels were attenuated in ablated noise-exposed mice, while microglial activation and abundance in the brain was greatly increased. Expression of phagocytic NADPH oxidase (NOX-2) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) mRNA in the aorta was reduced, while NFκB signaling appeared to be activated in the brain upon ablation. In sum, we show dissociation of cerebral and peripheral inflammatory reactions in response to aircraft noise after LysM+cell ablation, wherein peripheral myeloid inflammatory cells represent a dominant part of the pathomechanism for noise stress-induced cardiovascular effects and their central nervous counterparts, microglia, as key mediators in stress responses."

Notably, the first insights into their biology emerged over half a century ago from avian and murine tumor viruses-induced erythroleukemia models providing the rationale for several transgenic mouse models that unraveled the transforming potential of signaling effectors and transcription factors in the erythroid lineage. More recently, genetic roadmaps have fueled efforts to establish models that are based on the epigenomic lesions observed in patients with erythroid malignancies. These models, together with often unexpected erythroid phenotypes in genetically modified mice, provided further insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease initiation and maintenance. Here, we review how the increasing knowledge of human erythroleukemia genetics combined with those from various mouse models indicate that the pathogenesis of the disease is based on the interplay between signaling mutations, impaired TP53 function, and altered chromatin organization. These alterations lead to aberrant activity of erythroid transcriptional master regulators like GATA1, indicating that erythroleukemia will most likely require combinatorial targeting for efficient therapeutic interventions.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

NSD family proteins encoding histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methyltransferases are conserved in many species, and Drosophila has a single NSD homolog gene, NSD.To gain insight into the biological functions of NSD1 deficiency in the developmental anomalies seen in SOTOS1 patients using an NSD-deleted Drosophila mutant.We deleted Drosophila NSD using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted gene knock-out, and analyzed pleiotropic phenotypes of the homozygous mutant of NSD (NSD-/-) at various developmental stages to understand the roles of NSD in Drosophila.The site-specific NSD deletion was confirmed in the mutant. The H3K36 di-methylation levels were dramatically decreased in the NSD-/-fly. Compared with the control, the NSD-/-fly displayed an increase in the body size of larvae, similar to the childhood overgrowth phenotype of SOTOS1 patients. Although the NSD mutant flies survived to adulthood, their fecundity was dramatically decreased. Furthermore, the NSD-/-fly showed neurological dysfunctions, such as lower memory performance and motor defects, and a diminished extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity.The NSD-deleted Drosophila phenotype resembles many of the phenotypes of SOTOS1 patients, such as learning disability, deregulated ERK signaling, and overgrowth; thus, this mutant fly is a relevant model organism to study various SOTOS1 phenotypes."

However, the target genes of miR-221-3p and the underlying mechanism involved in HNSCC are still not clear. Therefore, in the current study, we studied the role of miR-221-3p in the HNSCC.Tissues collected from 48 control and 21 HNSCC patients were processed to check the differential expression of miR-221-3p by RT-qPCR. Overexpression of microRNA-221-3p (miR-221-3p) is significantly correlated to the onset and progression of HNSCC. We also conducted the meta-analysis of the cancer literature from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to estimate the expression of miR-221-3p in HNSCC. The miR-221-3p target genes in the HNSCC were predicted with the miRWalk and TCGA databases, and functionally annotated via the Gene Ontology. Finally, Spearman's analysis was used to determine the role of the related target genes in important pathways involved in the development of HNSCC.We observed a significantly higher expression of miR-221-3p in HNSCC compared to the normal with a summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) of 0.86(95% Cl: 0.83,0.89). The KEGG and GO comprehensive analysis predicted that miR-221-3p might be involved in the development of HNSCC through the following metabolic pathways, viz. Drug metabolism - cytochrome P450 UGT1A7 and MAOB may be important genes for the role of miR-221-3p.Based on bioinformatics analysis, our results indicate that miR-221-3p may be used as a non-invasive and hypersensitive biomarker in the diagnosis. Thus, it can be concluded that miR-221-3p may be an extremely important gene locus involved in the process of the deterioration and eventual tumorigenesis of HNSCC. Hopefully, additional work will validate its usefulness as a target for future clinical research."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of human genetic loci statistically linked to autoimmune disease risk, and epigenetic modifications of DNA and chromatin at these loci have been associated with autoimmune disease risk. Because the vast majority of these signals are located far from genes, identifying causal variants, and their functional consequences on the correct effector genes, has been challenging. These limitations have hampered the translation of GWAS findings into novel drug targets and clinical interventions, but recent advances in understanding the spatial organization of the genome in the nucleus have offered mechanistic insights into gene regulation and answers to questions left open by GWAS.

Here, we investigate enhancers that activate gene expression several hundred-fold exclusively in the lactating mouse mammary gland. Using ChIP-seq for activating histone marks and transcription factors, we identify two candidate enhancers and one super-enhancer in the Csn1s2b locus. Through experimental mouse genetics, we dissect the lactation-specific distal enhancer bound by the mammary-enriched transcription factors STAT5 and NFIB and the glucocorticoid receptor. While deletions of canonical binding motifs for NFIB and STAT5, individually or combined, have a limited biological impact, a non-canonical STAT5 site is essential for enhancer activity during lactation. In contrast, the intronic enhancer contributes to gene expression only in late pregnancy and early lactation, possibly by interacting with the distal enhancer. A downstream super-enhancer, which physically interacts with the distal enhancer, is required for the functional establishment of the Csn1s2b promoter and gene activation. Lastly, NFIB binding in the promoter region fine-tunes Csn1s2b expression. Our study provides comprehensive insight into the anatomy and biology of regulatory elements that employ the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and preferentially activate gene expression during lactation."

Existing software tools are typically specialized, only performing one step-such as alignment of reads to a reference genome-of a larger workflow. The demand for a more comprehensive and reproducible workflow has led to the production of a number of publicly available RNA-seq pipelines. However, we have found that most require computational expertise to set up or share among several users, are not actively maintained, or lack features we have found to be important in our own analyses.In response to these concerns, we have developed a Scalable Pipeline for Expression Analysis and Quantification (SPEAQeasy), which is easy to install and share, and provides a bridge towards R/Bioconductor downstream analysis solutions. SPEAQeasy is portable across computational frameworks (SGE, SLURM, local, docker integration) and different configuration files are provided ( http://research.libd.org/SPEAQeasy/ ).SPEAQeasy is user-friendly and lowers the computational-domain entry barrier for biologists and clinicians to RNA-seq data processing as the main input file is a table with sample names and their corresponding FASTQ files.

"33941859","CPEB3-dowregulated Nr3c1 mRNA translation confers resilience to developing posttraumatic stress disorder-like behavior in fear-conditioned mice.","Neuropsychopharmacology","Susceptibility or resilience to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) depends on one's ability to appropriately adjust synaptic plasticity for coping with the traumatic experience. Activity-regulated mRNA translation synthesizes plasticity-related proteins to support long-term synaptic changes and memory. Hence, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3-knockout (CPEB3-KO) mice, showing dysregulated translation-associated synaptic rigidity, may be susceptible to PTSD-like behavior. Here, using a context-dependent auditory fear conditioning and extinction paradigm, we found that CPEB3-KO mice exhibited traumatic intensity-dependent PTSD-like fear memory. A genome-wide screen of CPEB3-bound transcripts revealed that Nr3c1, encoding glucocorticoid receptor (GR), was translationally suppressed by CPEB3. Thus, CPEB3-KO neurons with elevated GR expression exhibited increased corticosterone-induced calcium influx and decreased mRNA and protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf). Moreover, the reduced expression of BDNF was associated with increased GR level during fear extinction in CPEB3-KO hippocampi. Intracerebroventricular delivery of BDNF before extinction training mitigated spontaneous fear intrusion in CPEB3-KO mice during extinction recall. Analysis of two GEO datasets revealed decreased transcriptomic expression of CPEB3 but not NR3C1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of humans with PTSD. Collectively, this study reveals that CPEB3, as a potential PTSD-risk gene, downregulates Nr3c1 translation to maintain proper GR-BDNF signaling for fear extinction."

The mechanisms underlying addiction are orchestrated by transcriptional reprogramming in the reward system of vulnerable subjects. This study aims at revealing gene expression alterations across different types of addiction. We analyzed publicly available transcriptome datasets of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) from a palatable food and a cocaine addiction study. We found 56 common genes upregulated in the PFC of addicted mice in these two studies, whereas most of the differentially expressed genes were exclusively linked to either palatable food or cocaine addiction. Gene ontology analysis of shared genes revealed that these genes contribute to learning and memory, dopaminergic synaptic transmission, and histone phosphorylation. Network analysis of shared genes revealed a protein-protein interaction node among the G protein-coupled receptors (Drd2, Drd1, Adora2a, Gpr6, Gpr88) and downstream targets of the cAMP signaling pathway (Ppp1rb1, Rgs9, Pde10a) as a core network in addiction. Upon extending the analysis to a cell-type specific level, some of these common molecular players were selectively expressed in excitatory neurons, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells. Overall, computational analysis of publicly available whole transcriptome datasets provides new insights into the molecular basis of addiction-like behaviors in PFC."

In an independent sample of Veterans (n= 78) a small minority of these genes were also differentially expressed. We identified 7 gene network modules significantly associated with PTSD and TE (Bonferroni correctedp≤ 0.05), which at a false discovery rate (FDR) ofq≤ 0.2, were significantly enriched for biological pathways involved in focal adhesion, neuroactive ligand receptor interaction, and immune related processes among others.Conclusions:This study uses gene network analyses to identify significant gene modules associated with PTSD, TE, and controls. On an individual gene level, we identified a large number of differentially expressed genes between PTSD-TE groups, a minority of which were also differentially expressed in the independent sample. We also demonstrate a lack of network module preservation between PTSD and TE, suggesting that the molecular signature of PTSD and trauma are likely independent of each other.

Nevertheless, etiology remains elusive in close to 50% of cases, even in those families with multiple affected individuals, strongly hinting at a genetic cause. Here we present a case report of two siblings affected with severe ID and other comorbidities, who embarked on a genetic testing odyssey until diagnosis was reached by using whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS identified a maternally inherited novel missense variant (NM_031466.7:c.1037G > A; p.Gly346Glu) and a paternally inherited 90 kb intragenic deletion inTRAPPC9gene. This report demonstrates the clinical utility of WGS in patients who remain undiagnosed after whole exome sequencing."
"33918773","Epigenome Chaos: Stochastic and Deterministic DNA Methylation Events Drive Cancer Evolution.","Cancers (Basel)","Cancer evolution is associated with genomic instability and epigenetic alterations, which contribute to the inter and intra tumor heterogeneity, making genetic markers not accurate to monitor tumor evolution. Epigenetic changes, aberrant DNA methylation and modifications of chromatin proteins, determine the ""epigenome chaos"", which means that the changes of epigenetic traits are randomly generated, but strongly selected by deterministic events. Disordered changes of DNA methylation profiles are the hallmarks of all cancer types, but it is not clear if aberrant methylation is the cause or the consequence of cancer evolution. Critical points to address are the profound epigenetic intra- and inter-tumor heterogeneity and the nature of the heterogeneity of the methylation patterns in each single cell in the tumor population. To analyze the methylation heterogeneity of tumors, new technological and informatic tools have been developed. This review discusses the state of the art of DNA methylation analysis and new approaches to reduce or solve the complexity of methylated alleles in DNA or cell populations."

"33917037","Tissues and Tumor Microenvironment (TME) in 3D: Models to Shed Light on Immunosuppression in Cancer.","Cells","Immunosuppression in cancer has emerged as a major hurdle to immunotherapy efforts. Immunosuppression can arise from oncogene-induced signaling within the tumor as well as from tumor-associated immune cells. Understanding various mechanisms by which the tumor can undermine and evade therapy is critical in improving current cancer immunotherapies. While mouse models have allowed for the characterization of key immune cell types and their role in tumor development, extrapolating these mechanisms to patients has been challenging. There is need for better models to unravel the effects of genetic alterations inherent in tumor cells and immune cells isolated from tumors on tumor growth and to investigate the feasibility of immunotherapy. Three-dimensional (3D) organoid model systems have developed rapidly over the past few years and allow for incorporation of components of the tumor microenvironment such as immune cells and the stroma. This bears great promise for derivation of patient-specific models in a dish for understanding and determining the impact on personalized immunotherapy. In this review, we will highlight the significance of current experimental models employed in the study of tumor immunosuppression and evaluate current tumor organoid-immune cell co-culture systems and their potential impact in shedding light on cancer immunosuppression."

Early detection, an improved understanding of tumor biology, and novel therapeutic discoveries are needed in order to improve overall patient survival. Scientific progress towards meeting these goals relies upon accurate modeling of the human disease. From two-dimensional (2D) cell lines to the advanced modeling available today, we aim to characterize the critical tools in efforts to further understand PDAC biology. The National Center for Biotechnology Information's PubMed and the Elsevier's SCOPUS were used to perform a comprehensive literature review evaluating preclinical human-derived PDAC models. Keywords included pancreatic cancer, PDAC, preclinical models,KRASmutations, xenograft, co-culturing fibroblasts, co-culturing lymphocytes and PDAC immunotherapy Initial search was limited to articles about PDAC and was then expanded to include other gastrointestinal malignancies where information may complement our effort. A supervised review of the key literature's references was utilized to augment the capture of relevant data. The discovery and refinement of techniques enabling immortalized 2D cell culture provided the cornerstone for modern cancer biology research. Cell lines have been widely used to represent PDACin vitrobut are limited in capacity to model three-dimensional (3D) tumor attributes and interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Xenografts are an alternative method to model PDAC with improved capacity to understand certain aspects of 3D tumor biologyin vivowhile limited by the use of immunodeficient mice. Advances ofin vitromodeling techniques have led to 3D organoid models for PDAC biology.

"33926515","Crosstalk between microRNA expression and DNA methylation drives the hormone-dependent phenotype of breast cancer.","Genome Med","Abnormal DNA methylation is observed as an early event in breast carcinogenesis. However, how such alterations arise is still poorly understood. microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play key roles in various biological processes. Here, we integrate miRNA expression and DNA methylation at CpGs to study how miRNAs may affect the breast cancer methylome and how DNA methylation may regulate miRNA expression.miRNA expression and DNA methylation data from two breast cancer cohorts, Oslo2 (n = 297) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 439), were integrated through a correlation approach that we term miRNA-methylation Quantitative Trait Loci (mimQTL) analysis. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify clusters of miRNAs and CpGs that were further characterized through analysis of mRNA/protein expression, clinicopathological features, in silico deconvolution, chromatin state and accessibility, transcription factor binding, and long-range interaction data.Clustering of the significant mimQTLs identified distinct groups of miRNAs and CpGs that reflect important biological processes associated with breast cancer pathogenesis. Notably, two major miRNA clusters were related to immune or fibroblast infiltration, hence identifying miRNAs associated with cells of the tumor microenvironment, while another large cluster was related to estrogen receptor (ER) signaling. Studying the chromatin landscape surrounding CpGs associated with the estrogen signaling cluster, we found that miRNAs from this cluster are likely to be regulated through DNA methylation of enhancers bound by FOXA1, GATA2, and ER-alpha. Further, at the hub of the estrogen cluster, we identified hsa-miR-29c-5p as negatively correlated with the mRNA and protein expression of DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A, a key enzyme regulating DNA methylation. We found deregulation of hsa-miR-29c-5p already present in pre-invasive breast lesions and postulate that hsa-miR-29c-5p may trigger early event abnormal DNA methylation in ER-positive breast cancer.We describe how miRNA expression and DNA methylation interact and associate with distinct breast cancer phenotypes."

However, few studies have investigated adverse effects of Se exposure on birth weight and placental weight.All participants were selected from the Prenatal Environment and Offspring Health cohort conducted in 2016 in Guangzhou, China. Se in each participant was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry in their urine samples. The urinary Se concentrations were corrected by creatinine and transformed by natural logarithm (ln-Se). Multiple-linear regression models were applied to estimate the associations among Se exposure levels, placenta weight, and birth weight.A total of 2758 mother-newborn pairs were included in this study. Each interquartile range (0.53 μg/g creatinine) increment in urine ln-Se concentration during the first trimester was associated with a mean 21.7 g (95% CI = -41.3g to -2.1g) decrease in birth weight and 3.6g (95% CI = -6.3g to -0.9g) decrease in placental weight. Compared with the lowest quartile (Q1) of ln-Se concentrations during the first trimester, significantly lower birth weight was found in the highest quartile (Q4) (β = -45.7g; 95% CI = -90.7g to -0.7g). Similar dose-response associations with birthweight and placental weight were found for Se exposure during the third trimester. Mediation analyses showed that 44.2% and 18.2% of the effects of Se exposure in first and third trimester on birth weight were mediated by decreased placental weight, respectively.Maternal Se exposure during pregnancy was negatively associated with birth weight, the reduction of placental weight may partially mediate the association of prenatal Se exposure with birth weight.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

This review summarises findings in the fields of AI in psychiatry and patient flow from the past 5 years, finds links and identifies gaps for future research.The OVID database was used to access Embase and Medline. Top journals such as JAMA, Nature and The Lancet were screened for other relevant studies. Selection bias was limited by strict inclusion and exclusion criteria.3,675 papers were identified in March 2020, of which a limited number focused on AI for mental health unit patient flow. After initial screening, 323 were selected and 83 were subsequently analysed. The literature review revealed a wide range of applications with three main themes: diagnosis (33%), prognosis (39%) and treatment (28%). The main themes that emerged from AI in patient flow studies were: readmissions (41%), resource allocation (44%) and limitations (91%). The review extrapolates those solutions and suggests how they could potentially improve patient flow on mental health units, along with challenges and limitations they could face.Research widely addresses potential uses of AI in mental health, with some focused on its applicability in psychiatric inpatients units, however research rarely discusses improvements in patient flow. Studies investigated various uses of AI to improve patient flow across specialities. This review highlights a gap in research and the unique research opportunity it presents.© 2021 The Author(s)."
"33907138","Immune activation and chronic inflammation: Is there an additional effect of HIV in a geriatric population?","Medicine (Baltimore)","HIV infection has become a chronic disease, with a lower mortality, but a consequent increase in age-related noninfectious comorbidities. Metabolic disorders have been linked to the effect of cART as well to the effects of immune activation and chronic inflammation. Whereas it is known that aging is intrinsically associated with hyperinflammation and immune system deterioration, the relative impact of chronic HIV infection on such inflammatory and immune activation has not yet been studied focusing on an elderly HIV-infected population.The objectives of the study were to assess 29 blood markers of immune activation and inflammation using an ultrasensitive technique, in HIV-infected patients aged ≥75 years with no or 1 comorbidity (among hypertension, renal disease, neoplasia, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, stroke, dyslipidemia, and osteoporosis), in comparison with age-adjusted HIV-uninfected individuals to identify whether biomarkers were associated with comorbidities. Wilcoxon nonparametric tests were used to compare the levels of each marker between control and HIV groups; logistic regression to identify biomarkers associated to comorbidity in the HIV group and principal component analysis (PCA) to determine clusters associated with a group or a specific comorbidity.A total of 111 HIV-infected subjects were included from the Dat'AIDS cohort and compared to 63 HIV-uninfected controls. In the HIV-infected group, 4 biomarkers were associated with the risk of developing a comorbidity: monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), neurofilament light chain (NF-L), neopterin, and soluble CD14. Six biomarkers (interleukin [IL]-1B, IL-7, IL-18, neopterin, sCD14, and fatty acid-binding protein) were significantly higher in the HIV-infected group compared to the control group, 11 biomarkers (myeloperoxydase, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, interferon-gamma, MCP-1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2, IL-22, ultra sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, IL-6, and NF-L) were lower. Despite those differences, PCA to determine clusters associated with a group or a specific comorbidity did not reveal clustering nor between healthy control and HIV-infected patients neither between the presence of comorbidity within HIV-infected group.In this highly selected geriatric HIV population, HIV infection does not seem to have an additional impact on age-related inflammation and immune disorder. Close monitoring could have led to optimize prevention and treatment of comorbidities, and have limited both immune activation and inflammation in the aging HIV population.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

Here we present Cell-ID, a clustering-free multivariate statistical method for the robust extraction of per-cell gene signatures from single-cell sequencing data. We applied Cell-ID to data from multiple human and mouse samples, including blood cells, pancreatic islets and airway, intestinal and olfactory epithelium, as well as to comprehensive mouse cell atlas datasets. We demonstrate that Cell-ID signatures are reproducible across different donors, tissues of origin, species and single-cell omics technologies, and can be used for automatic cell-type annotation and cell matching across datasets. Cell-ID improves biological interpretation at individual cell level, enabling discovery of previously uncharacterized rare cell types or cell states.

Recent high-throughput technologies have enabled the identification of both heritable and non-heritable determinants of immune response variation between individuals. In this review, we summarize the advances made through the Human Functional Genomics Projects (HFGPs), challenges and the need for more refined strategies. Inter-individual variability in stimulation-induced cytokine responses is influenced in part by age, gender, seasonality, and gut microbiome. Host genetic regulators especially single nucleotide polymorphisms in multiple immune gene loci, particularly the TLR1-TLR6-TLR10 locus, have been identified using individuals of predominantly European descent. However, transferability of such findings to other populations is challenging. We are beginning to incorporate diverse population cohorts and leverage multi-omics approaches at single cell level to bridge the current knowledge gap. We believe that such an approach presents the opportunities to comprehensively assess both genetic and environmental factors driving variation seen in immune response phenotype and a better understanding of the molecular and biological mechanisms involved.© 2021 The Authors."

MDS is characterized by a hematopoietic differentiation block, evidenced by increased immature hematopoietic cells, termed blast cells and decreased mature circulating leukocytes in at least one lineage (i.e., cytopenia). Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a recently described phenomenon preceding MDS development that is driven by somatic mutations in hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These mutant HSCs have a competitive advantage over healthy cells, resulting in an expansion of these clonal mutated leukocytes. In this review, we discuss the multiphasic development of MDS, the common mutations found in both MDS and CHIP, how a loss-of-function in these CHIP-related genes can alter HSC function and leukocyte development and the potential disease outcomes that can occur with dysfunctional HSCs. In particular, we discuss the novel connections between MDS development and cardiovascular disease."

Persistent inflammation and subsequent chronic fibrosis are major causes of loss of renal function, which is associated with the progression of DKD to ESRD. In fact, DKD progression is affected by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Approximately, one-third of diabetic patients progress to develop DKD despite intensive glycemic control, which propose an essential concept ""metabolic memory."" Epigenetic modifications, an extensively studied mechanism of metabolic memory, have been shown to contribute to the susceptibility to develop DKD. Epigenetic modifications also play a regulatory role in the interactions between the genes and the environmental factors. The epigenetic contributions to the processes of inflammation and fibrogenesis involved in DKD occur at different regulatory levels, including DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA modulation. Compared with genetic factors, epigenetics represents a new therapeutic frontier in understanding the development DKD and may lead to therapeutic breakthroughs due to the possibility to reverse these modifications therapeutically. Early recognition of epigenetic events and biomarkers is crucial for timely diagnosis and intervention of DKD, and for the prevention of the progression of DKD to ESRD. Herein, we will review the latest epigenetic mechanisms involved in the renal pathology of both type 1 (T1DN) and type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN) and highlight the emerging role and possible therapeutic strategies based on the understanding of the role of epigenetics in DKD-associated inflammation and fibrogenesis."

We here present an overview of current evidence supporting the clinical relevance of liquid biopsy assessments. We also discuss the implementation of liquid biopsies in clinical studies and their current and future clinical role, with a special reference to the Nordic healthcare systems. Our considerations are restricted to the most established liquid biopsy specimens: circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTC). Both ctDNA and CTCs have been used for prognostic stratification, treatment choices, and treatment monitoring in solid cancers. Several recent publications also support the role of ctDNA in early cancer detection. ctDNA seems to provide more robust clinically relevant information in general, whereas CTCs have the potential to answer more basic questions related to cancer biology and metastasis. Epidermal growth factor receptor-directed treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer represents a clinical setting where ctDNA already has entered the clinic. The role of liquid biopsies in treatment decisions, standardization of methods, diagnostic performance and the need for further research, as well as cost and regulatory issues were identified as factors that influence further integration in the clinic. In conclusion, substantial evidence supports the clinical utility of liquid biopsies in cancer diagnostics, but further research is still required for a more general application in clinical practice."

Personal medical records are only partially unified by hospital or general practitioner informatics systems, but only for citizens with long-term permanent residence. Otherwise, insight into the medical history of patients greatly depends on their medical archive and memory. Additionally, occupational exposure records are not combined with clinical or general practitioner records. Environmental exposure starts preconceptionally and continues during pregnancy by transplacental exposure. Antenatal exposure is partially dependent on parental lifestyle, residence and occupation. Newborn screening (NBS) is currently being performed in developed countries and includes testing for rare genetic, hormone-related, and metabolic conditions. Transplacental exposure to substances such as endocrine disruptors, air pollutants and drugs may have life-long health consequences. However, despite the recognised impact of transplacental exposure on the increased risk of metabolic syndrome, neurobehavioral disorders as well as immunodisturbances including allergy and infertility, not a single test within NBS is geared toward detecting biomarkers of exposure (xenobiotics or their metabolites, nutrients) or effect such as oestradiol, testosterone and cytokines, known for being associated with various health risks and disturbed by transplacental xenobiotic exposures. The outcomes of ongoing exposome projects might be exploited to this purpose. Developing and using a OneHealth Medical Record (OneHealthMR) may allow the incorporated chip to harvest information from different sources, with high integration added value for health prevention and care: environmental exposures, occupational health records as well as diagnostics of chronic diseases, allergies and medication usages, from birth and throughout life. Such a concept may present legal and ethical issues pertaining to personal data protection, requiring no significant investments and exploits available technologies and algorithms, putting emphasis on the prevention and integration of environmental exposure and health data."

NME7 is an established member of the ciliome and contributes to the regulation of the microtubule-organizing center. We aimed to create a rat model to further investigate the phenotypic consequences ofNme7gene deletion. The CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease system was used for the generation of Sprague DawleyNme7knock-out rats targeting the exon 4 of theNme7gene. We found the homozygousNme7gene deletion to be semi-lethal, as the majority of SDNme7-/-pups died prior to weaning. The most prominent phenotypes in surviving SDNme7-/-animals were hydrocephalus, situs inversus totalis, postnatal growth retardation, and sterility of both sexes. Thinning of the neocortex was histologically evident at 13.5 day of gestation, dilation of all ventricles was detected at birth, and an external sign of hydrocephalus, i.e., doming of the skull, was usually apparent at 2 weeks of age. Heterozygous SDNme7+/-rats developed normally; we did not detect any symptoms of primary ciliary dyskinesia. The transcriptomic profile of liver and lungs corroborated the histological findings, revealing defects in cell function and viability. In summary, the knock-out of the ratNme7gene resulted in a range of conditions consistent with the presentation of primary ciliary dyskinesia, supporting the previously implicated role of the centrosomally locatedNme7gene in ciliogenesis and control of ciliary transport."

Nevertheless, only a subset of NSCLC patients benefits from it. Currently, the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved diagnostic test for first-line immunotherapy in metastatic NSCLC patients uses tissue biopsies to determine the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status. However, obtaining tumor tissue is not always feasible and puts the patient at risk. Liquid biopsy, which refers to the tumor-derived material present in body fluids, offers an alternative approach. This less invasive technique gives real-time information on the tumor characteristics. This review addresses different promising liquid biopsy based biomarkers in NSCLC patients that enable the selection of patients who benefit from immunotherapy and the monitoring of patients during this therapy. The challenges and the opportunities of blood-based biomarkers such as cell-free DNA (cfDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), exosomes, epigenetic signatures, microRNAs (miRNAs) and the T cell repertoire will be addressed. This review also focuses on the less-studied feces-based and breath-based biomarkers."

Leukaemic transformation may be promoted by high MYB levels. Despite much accumulated molecular knowledge of MYB, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of its target genes and its chromatin action. In the present work, we performed a ChIP-seq analysis of MYB in K562 cells accompanied by detailed bioinformatics analyses. We found that MYB occupies both promoters and enhancers. Five clusters (C1-C5) were found when we classified MYB peaks according to epigenetic profiles. C1 was enriched for promoters and C2 dominated by enhancers. C2-linked genes were connected to hematopoietic specific functions and had GATA factor motifs as second in frequency. C1 had in addition to MYB-motifs a significant frequency of ETS-related motifs. Combining ChIP-seq data with RNA-seq data allowed us to identify direct MYB target genes. We also compared ChIP-seq data with digital genomic footprinting. MYB is occupying nearly a third of the super-enhancers in K562. Finally, we concluded that MYB cooperates with a subset of the other highly expressed TFs in this cell line, as expected for a master regulator."

Even if the nomenclature in pulmonary NEN is still different, the terms 'carcinoid' and 'atypical carcinoid' are widely overlapping with NET G1 and NET G2. Molecular data shows an additional heterogeneity both in well-differentiated NET and poorly differentiated NEC. However, no studies are available demonstrating clinical usefulness yet. The heterogeneity of NEN regarding the organ of origin, differentiation and molecular subtypes make development of personalised therapy a challenge needing more international and interdisciplinary collaborations and clinical trials allowing stratification according to biological subgroups."

"33937362","Sortilin as a Biomarker for Cardiovascular Disease Revisited.","Front Cardiovasc Med","Genetic variants in the genomic region containingSORT1(encoding the protein sortilin) are strongly associated with cholesterol levels and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Circulating sortilin has therefore been proposed as a potential biomarker for cardiovascular disease. Multiple studies have reported association between plasma sortilin levels and cardiovascular outcomes. However, the findings are not consistent across studies, and most studies have small sample sizes. The aim of this study was to evaluate sortilin as a biomarker for CAD in a well-characterized cohort with symptoms suggestive of CAD. In total, we enrolled 1,173 patients with suspected stable CAD referred to coronary computed tomography angiography. Sortilin was measured in plasma using two different technologies for quantifying circulating sortilin: a custom-made enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and OLINK Cardiovascular Panel II. We found a relative poor correlation between the two methods (correlation coefficient = 0.21). In addition, genotyping and whole-genome sequencing were performed on all patients. By whole-genome regression analysis of sortilin levels measured with ELISA and OLINK, two independentcisprotein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) on chromosome 1p13.3 were identified, with one of them being a well-established risk locus for CAD. Incorporating rare genetic variants from whole-genome sequence data did not identify any additional pQTLs for plasma sortilin. None of the traditional CAD risk factors, such as sex, age, smoking, and statin use, were associated with plasma sortilin levels. Furthermore, there was no association between circulating sortilin levels and coronary artery calcium score (CACS) or disease severity. Sortilin did not improve discrimination of obstructive CAD, when added to a clinical pretest probability (PTP) model for CAD. Overall, our results indicate that studies using different methodologies for measuring circulating sortilin should be compared with caution. In conclusion, the well-knownSORT1risk locus for CAD is linked to lower sortilin levels in circulation, measured with ELISA; however, the effect sizes are too small for sortilin to be a useful biomarker for CAD in a clinical setting of low- to intermediate-risk chest-pain patients.Copyright © 2021 Møller, Rohde, Winther, Breining, Nissen, Nykjaer, Bøttcher, Nyegaard and Kjolby."
"33941835","Inheritable testicular metabolic memory of high-fat diet causes transgenerational sperm defects in mice.","Sci Rep","The consumption of energy-dense diets has contributed to an increase in the prevalence of obesity and its comorbidities worldwide. The adoption of unhealthy feeding habits often occurs at early age, prompting the early onset of metabolic disease with unknown consequences for reproductive function later in life. Recently, evidence has emerged regarding the intergenerational and transgenerational effects of high-fat diets (HFD) on sperm parameters and testicular metabolism. Hereby, we study the impact of high-fat feeding male mice (F0) on the testicular metabolome and function of their sons (F1) and grandsons (F2). Testicular content of metabolites related to insulin resistance, cell membrane remodeling, nutritional support and antioxidative stress (leucine, acetate, glycine, glutamine, inosine) were altered in sons and grandsons of mice fed with HFD, comparing to descendants of chow-fed mice. Sperm counts were lower in the grandsons of mice fed with HFD, even if transient. Sperm quality was correlated to testicular metabolite content in all generations. Principal Component Analysis of sperm parameters and testicular metabolites revealed an HFD-related phenotype, especially in the diet-challenged generation and their grandsons. Ancestral HFD, even if transient, causes transgenerational ""inherited metabolic memory"" in the testicular tissue, characterized by changes in testicular metabolome and function."
