33956822,Comparative analysis reveals distinctive epigenetic features of the human cerebellum.,PLoS Genet,"Identifying the molecular underpinnings of the neural specializations that underlie human cognitive and behavioral traits has long been of considerable interest. Much research on human-specific changes in gene expression and epigenetic marks has focused on the prefrontal cortex, a brain structure distinguished by its role in executive functions. The cerebellum shows expansion in great apes and is gaining increasing attention for its role in motor skills and cognitive processing, including language. However, relatively few molecular studies of the cerebellum in a comparative evolutionary context have been conducted. Here, we identify human-specific methylation in the lateral cerebellum relative to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in a comparative study with chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Specifically, we profiled genome-wide methylation levels in the three species for each of the two brain structures and identified human-specific differentially methylated genomic regions unique to each structure. We further identified which differentially methylated regions (DMRs) overlap likely regulatory elements and determined whether associated genes show corresponding species differences in gene expression. We found greater human-specific methylation in the cerebellum than the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with differentially methylated regions overlapping genes involved in several conditions or processes relevant to human neurobiology, including synaptic plasticity, lipid metabolism, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, and neurodevelopment, including developmental disorders. Moreover, our results show some overlap with those of previous studies focused on the neocortex, indicating that such results may be common to multiple brain structures. These findings further our understanding of the cerebellum in human brain evolution."
33940396,Blood lead levels in Peruvian adults are associated with proximity to mining and DNA methylation.,Environ Int,"Inorganic lead (Pb) is common in the environment, and is toxic to neurological, renal, and cardiovascular systems. Pb exposure influences the epigenome with documented effects on DNA methylation (DNAm). We assessed the impact of low levels of Pb exposure on DNAm among non-miner individuals from two locations in Peru: Lima, the capital, and Cerro de Pasco, a highland mining town, to study the effects of Pb exposure on physiological outcomes and DNAm.Pb levels were measured in whole blood (n = 305). Blood leukocyte DNAm was determined for 90 DNA samples using the Illumina MethylationEPIC chip. An epigenome-wide association study was performed to assess the relationship between Pb and DNAm.Individuals from Cerro de Pasco had higher Pb than individuals from Lima (p-value = 2.00E-16). Males had higher Pb than females (p-value = 2.36E-04). Pb was positively associated with hemoglobin (p-value = 8.60E-04). In Cerro de Pasco, blood Pb decreased with the distance from the mine (p-value = 0.04), and association with soil Pb was approaching significance (p-value = 0.08). We identified differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with genes SOX18, ZMIZ1, and KDM1A linked to neurological function. We also found 45 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), seven of which were associated with genes involved in metal ion binding and nine to neurological function and development.Our results demonstrate that even low levels of Pb can have a significant impact on the body including changes to DNAm. We report associations between Pb and hemoglobin, Pb and distance from mining, and between blood and soil Pb. We also report associations between loci- and region-specific DNAm and Pb.Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd."
33939316,DNA methylome analysis identifies BMI-related epigenetic changes associated with non-small cell lung cancer susceptibility.,Cancer Med,"Body mass index (BMI) has been reported to be inversely associated with incident risk of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of DNA methylation in the relationship between BMI and NSCLC.We carried out a genome-wide DNA methylation study of BMI in peripheral blood among 2266 Chinese participants by using Illumina Methylation arrays. For the BMI-related DNA methylation changes, their associations with NSCLC risk were further analyzed and their mediation effects on BMI-NSCLC association were also evaluated.The methylation levels of four CpGs (cg12593793, cg17061862, cg11024682, and cg06500161, annotated to LMNA, ZNF143, SREBF1, and ABCG1, respectively) were found to be significantly associated with BMI. Methylation levels of cg12593793, cg11024682, and cg06500161 were observed to be inversely associated with NSCLC risk [OR (95%CI) =0.22 (0.16, 0.31), 0.39 (0.30, 0.50), and 0.66 (0.53, 0.82), respectively]. Additionally, cg11024682 in SREBF1 and cg06500161 in ABCG1 mediated 45.3% and 19.5% of the association between BMI and decreased NSCLC risk, respectively.In this study, we identified four DNA methylation sites associated with BMI in the Chinese populations at the genome-wide significant level. We also found that the BMI-related methylations of SREBF1 and ABCG1 could mediate about a quintile-to-half of the effect of BMI on reduced NSCLC risk, which adds a potential mechanism underlying this association.© 2021 The Authors.

33935932,An Epigenetically Distinct Subset of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder Resulting From Differences in Blood Cell Composition.,Front Neurol,"Background:Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that often involves impaired cognition, communication difficulties and restrictive, repetitive behaviors. ASD is extremely heterogeneous both clinically and etiologically, which represents one of the greatest challenges in studying the molecular underpinnings of ASD. While hundreds of ASD-associated genes have been identified that confer varying degrees of risk, no single gene variant accounts for >1% of ASD cases. Notably, a large number of ASD-risk genes function as epigenetic regulators, indicating potential epigenetic dysregulation in ASD. As such, we compared genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) in the blood of children with ASD (n= 265) to samples from age- and sex-matched, neurotypical controls (n= 122) using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 arrays.Results:While DNAm patterns did not distinctly separate ASD cases from controls, our analysis identified an epigenetically unique subset of ASD cases (n= 32); these individuals exhibited significant differential methylation from both controls than the remaining ASD cases. The CpG sites at which this subset was differentially methylated mapped to known ASD risk genes that encode proteins of the nervous and immune systems. Moreover, the observed DNAm differences were attributable to altered blood cell composition, i.e., lower granulocyte proportion and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio in the ASD subset, as compared to the remaining ASD cases and controls. This ASD subset did not differ from the rest of the ASD cases in the frequency or type of high-risk genomic variants.Conclusion:Within our ASD cohort, we identified a subset of individuals that exhibit differential methylation from both controls and the remaining ASD group tightly associated with shifts in immune cell type proportions. This is an important feature that should be assessed in all epigenetic studies of blood cells in ASD. This finding also builds on past reports of changes in the immune systems of children with ASD, supporting the potential role of altered immunological mechanisms in the complex pathophysiology of ASD. The discovery of significant molecular and immunological features in subgroups of individuals with ASD may allow clinicians to better stratify patients, facilitating personalized interventions and improved outcomes.Copyright © 2021 Jangjoo, Goodman, Choufani, Trost, Scherer, Kelley, Ayub, Nicolson, Georgiades, Crosbie, Schachar, Anagnostou, Grunebaum and Weksberg."
33931130,Genetic impacts on DNA methylation: research findings and future perspectives.,Genome Biol,"Multiple recent studies highlight that genetic variants can have strong impacts on a significant proportion of the human DNA methylome. Methylation quantitative trait loci, or meQTLs, allow for the exploration of biological mechanisms that underlie complex human phenotypes, with potential insights for human disease onset and progression. In this review, we summarize recent milestones in characterizing the human genetic basis of DNA methylation variation over the last decade, including heritability findings and genome-wide identification of meQTLs. We also discuss challenges in this field and future areas of research geared to generate insights into molecular processes underlying human complex traits."
33931109,Epigenome-wide association study of kidney function identifies trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific loci.,Genome Med,"DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with gene regulation and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function. Decreased eGFR is more common among US Hispanics and African Americans. The causes for this are poorly understood. We aimed to identify trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with eGFR using an agnostic, genome-wide approach.The study included up to 5428 participants from multi-ethnic studies for discovery and 8109 participants for replication. We tested the associations between whole blood DNAm and eGFR using beta values from Illumina 450K or EPIC arrays. Ethnicity-stratified analyses were performed using linear mixed models adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and study-specific and technical variables. Summary results were meta-analyzed within and across ethnicities. Findings were assessed using integrative epigenomics methods and pathway analyses.We identified 93 DMPs associated with eGFR at an FDR of 0.05 and replicated 13 and 1 DMPs across independent samples in trans-ethnic and African American meta-analyses, respectively. The study also validated 6 previously published DMPs. Identified DMPs showed significant overlap enrichment with DNase I hypersensitive sites in kidney tissue, sites associated with the expression of proximal genes, and transcription factor motifs and pathways associated with kidney tissue and kidney development.We uncovered trans-ethnic and ethnic-specific DMPs associated with eGFR, including DMPs enriched in regulatory elements in kidney tissue and pathways related to kidney development. These findings shed light on epigenetic mechanisms associated with kidney function, bridging the gap between population-specific eGFR-associated DNAm and tissue-specific regulatory context."
33926513,Estimands in epigenome-wide association studies.,Clin Epigenetics,"In DNA methylation analyses like epigenome-wide association studies, effects in differentially methylated CpG sites are assessed. Two kinds of outcomes can be used for statistical analysis: Beta-values and M-values. M-values follow a normal distribution and help to detect differentially methylated CpG sites. As biological effect measures, differences of M-values are more or less meaningless. Beta-values are of more interest since they can be interpreted directly as differences in percentage of DNA methylation at a given CpG site, but they have poor statistical properties. Different frameworks are proposed for reporting estimands in DNA methylation analysis, relying on Beta-values, M-values, or both.We present and discuss four possible approaches of achieving estimands in DNA methylation analysis. In addition, we present the usage of M-values or Beta-values in the context of bioinformatical pipelines, which often demand a predefined outcome. We show the dependencies between the differences in M-values to differences in Beta-values in two data simulations: a analysis with and without confounder effect. Without present confounder effects, M-values can be used for the statistical analysis and Beta-values statistics for the reporting. If confounder effects exist, we demonstrate the deviations and correct the effects by the intercept method. Finally, we demonstrate the theoretical problem on two large human genome-wide DNA methylation datasets to verify the results.The usage of M-values in the analysis of DNA methylation data will produce effect estimates, which cannot be biologically interpreted. The parallel usage of Beta-value statistics ignores possible confounder effects and can therefore not be recommended. Hence, if the differences in Beta-values are the focus of the study, the intercept method is recommendable. Hyper- or hypomethylated CpG sites must then be carefully evaluated. If an exploratory analysis of possible CpG sites is the aim of the study, M-values can be used for inference."
33902726,Sex-specific DNA methylation differences in Alzheimer's disease pathology.,Acta Neuropathol Commun,"Sex is an important factor that contributes to the clinical and biological heterogeneities in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the regulatory mechanisms underlying sex disparity in AD are still not well understood. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that regulates gene transcription and is known to be involved in AD. We performed the first large-scale sex-specific meta-analysis of DNA methylation differences in AD neuropathology, by re-analyzing four recent epigenome-wide association studies totaling more than 1000 postmortem prefrontal cortex brain samples using a uniform analytical pipeline. For each cohort, we employed two complementary analytical strategies, a sex-stratified analysis that examined methylation-Braak stage associations in male and female samples separately, and a sex-by-Braak stage interaction analysis that compared the magnitude of these associations between different sexes. Our analysis uncovered 14 novel CpGs, mapped to genes such as TMEM39A and TNXB that are associated with the AD Braak stage in a sex-specific manner. TMEM39A is known to be involved in inflammation, dysregulated type I interferon responses, and other immune processes. TNXB encodes tenascin proteins, which are extracellular matrix glycoproteins demonstrated to modulate synaptic plasticity in the brain. Moreover, for many previously implicated genes in AD neuropathology, such as MBP and AZU1, our analysis provided the new insights that they were predominately driven by effects in only one sex. These sex-specific DNA methylation differences were enriched in divergent biological processes such as integrin activation in females and complement activation in males. Our study implicated multiple new loci and biological processes that affected AD neuropathology in a sex-specific manner."
33895575,Air pollution and DNA methylation in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,Environ Pollut,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between air pollution and DNA methylation in adults from published observational studies. PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases were systematically searched for available studies on the association between air pollution and DNA methylation published up to March 9, 2021. Three DNA methylation approaches were considered: global methylation, candidate-gene, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Meta-analysis was used to summarize the combined estimates for the association between air pollutants and global DNA methylation levels. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochran Q test and quantified with the I2statistic. In total, 38 articles were included in this study: 16 using global methylation, 18 using candidate genes, and 11 using EWAS, with 7 studies using more than one approach. Meta-analysis revealed an imprecise but inverse association between exposure to PM2.5and global DNA methylation (for each 10-μg/m3PM2.5, combined estimate: 0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.97 - 0.19). The candidate-gene results were consistent for the ERCC3 and SOX2 genes, suggesting hypermethylation in ERCC3 associated with benzene and that in SOX2 associated with PM2.5exposure. EWAS identified 201 CpG sites and 148 differentially methylated regions that showed differential methylation associated with air pollution. Among the 307 genes investigated in 11 EWAS, a locus in nucleoredoxin gene was found to be positively associated with PM2.5in two studies. Current meta-analysis indicates that PM2.5is imprecisely and inversely associated with DNA methylation. The candidate-gene results consistently suggest hypermethylation in ERCC3 associated with benzene exposure and that in SOX2 associated with PM2.5exposure. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) network analyses revealed that these genes were associated with African trypanosomiasis, Malaria, Antifolate resistance, Graft-versus-host disease, and so on. More evidence is needed to clarify the association between air pollution and DNA methylation.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
33890633,DNA methylation patterns within whole blood of adolescents born from assisted reproductive technology are not different from adolescents born from natural conception.,Hum Reprod,"Do the epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles of adolescents born from ART differ from the epigenome of naturally conceived counterparts?No significant differences in the DNA methylation profiles of adolescents born from ART [IVF or ICSI] were observed when compared to their naturally conceived, similar aged counterparts.Short-term and longer-term studies have investigated the general health outcomes of children born from IVF treatment, albeit without common agreement as to the cause and underlying mechanisms of these adverse health findings. Growing evidence suggests that the reported adverse health outcomes in IVF-born offspring might have underlying epigenetic mechanisms.The Growing Up Healthy Study (GUHS) is a prospective study that recruited 303 adolescents and young adults, conceived through ART, to compare various long-term health outcomes and DNA methylation profiles with similar aged counterparts from Generation 2 from the Raine Study. GUHS assessments were conducted between 2013 and 2017. The effect of ART on DNA methylation levels of 231 adolescents mean age 15.96 ± 1.59 years (52.8% male) was compared to 1188 naturally conceived counterparts, 17.25 ± 0.58 years (50.9% male) from the Raine Study.DNA methylation profiles from a subset of 231 adolescents (13-19.9 years) from the GUHS, generated using the Infinium Methylation Epic Bead Chip (EPIC) array were compared to 1188 profiles from the Raine Study previously measured using the Illumina 450K array. We conducted epigenome-wide association approach (EWAS) and tested for an association between the cohorts applying Firth's bias reduced logistic regression against the outcome of ART versus naturally conceived offspring. Additionally, within the GUHS cohort, we investigated differences in methylation status in fresh versus frozen embryo transfers, cause of infertility as well as IVF versus ICSI conceived offspring. Following the EWAS analysis we investigated nominally significant probes using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify enriched biological pathways. Finally, within GUHS we compared four estimates (Horvath, Hanuum, PhenoAge [Levine], and skin Horvath) of epigenetic age and their correlation with chronological age.Between the two cohorts, we did not identify any DNA methylation probes that reached a Bonferroni corrected P-value < 1.24E-0.7. When comparing IVF versus ICSI conceived adolescents within the GUHS cohort, after adjustment for participant age, sex, maternal smoking, multiple births, and batch effect, three methylation probes (cg15016734, cg26744878 and cg20233073) reached a Bonferroni correction of 6.31E-08. After correcting for cell count heterogeneity, two of the aforementioned probes remained significant and an additional two probes (cg 0331628 and cg 20235051) were identified. A general trend towards hypomethylation in the ICSI offspring was observed. All four measures of epigenetic age were highly correlated with chronological age and showed no evidence of accelerated epigenetic aging within their whole blood.The small sample size coupled with the use of whole blood, where epigenetic differences may occur in other tissue. This was corrected by the utilized statistical method that accounts for imbalanced sample size between groups and adjusting for cell count heterogeneity. Only a small portion of the methylome was analysed and rare individual differences may be missed.Our findings provide further reassurance that the effects of the ART manipulations occurring during early embryogenesis, existing in the neonatal period are indeed of a transient nature and do not persist into adolescence. However, we have not excluded that alternative epigenetic mechanisms may be at play.This project was supported by NHMRC project Grant no. 1042269 and R.J.H. received funding support from Ferring Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd.

33890479,DNA methylation as the link between migration and the major noncommunicable diseases: the RODAM study.,Epigenomics,"Aim:We assessed epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) differences between migrant and non-migrant Ghanaians.Materials & methods:We used the Illumina Infinium®HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to profile DNAm of 712 Ghanaians in whole blood. We used linear models to detect differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with migration. We performed multiple post hoc analyses to validate our findings.Results:We identified 13 DMPs associated with migration (delta-beta values: 0.2-4.5%). Seven DMPs inCPLX2,EIF4E3,MEF2D,TLX3,ST8SIA1,ANGandCHRM3were independent of extrinsic genomic influences in public databases. Two DMPs inNLRC5were associated with duration of stay in Europe among migrants. All DMPs were biologically linked to migration-related factors.Conclusion:Our findings provide the first insights into DNAm differences between migrants and non-migrants."
33883019,Epigenome-wide association study of level and change in cognitive abilities from midlife through late life.,Clin Epigenetics,"Epigenetic mechanisms are important in aging and may be involved in late-life changes in cognitive abilities. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study of leukocyte DNA methylation in relation to level and change in cognitive abilities, from midlife through late life in 535 Swedish twins.Methylation levels were measured with the Infinium Human Methylation 450 K or Infinium MethylationEPIC array, and all sites passing quality control on both arrays were selected for analysis (n = 250,816). Empirical Bayes estimates of individual intercept (age 65), linear, and quadratic change were obtained from latent growth curve models of cognitive traits and used as outcomes in linear regression models. Significant sites (p < 2.4 × 10-7) were followed up in between-within twin pair models adjusting for familial confounding and full-growth modeling. We identified six significant associations between DNA methylation and level of cognitive abilities at age 65: cg18064256 (PPP1R13L) with processing speed and spatial ability; cg04549090 (NRXN3) with spatial ability; cg09988380 (POGZ), cg25651129 (-), and cg08011941 (ENTPD8) with working memory. The genes are involved in neuroinflammation, neuropsychiatric disorders, and ATP metabolism. Within-pair associations were approximately half that of between-pair associations across all sites. In full-growth curve models, associations between DNA methylation and cognitive level at age 65 were of small effect sizes, and associations between DNA methylation and longitudinal change in cognitive abilities of very small effect sizes.Leukocyte DNA methylation was associated with level, but not change in cognitive abilities. The associations were substantially attenuated in within-pair analyses, indicating they are influenced in part by genetic factors."
33883000,DNA methylation biomarkers of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease.,Clin Epigenetics,"The epigenetic landscape underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) is not completely understood and the clinical value of the identified biomarkers is still limited. We aimed to identify differentially methylated loci associated with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and assess their validity as predictive and causal biomarkers.We designed a case-control, two-stage, epigenome-wide association study on AMI (ndiscovery = 391, nvalidation = 204). DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We performed a fixed-effects meta-analysis of the two samples. 34 CpGs were associated with AMI. Only 12 of them were available in two independent cohort studies (n ~ 1800 and n ~ 2500) with incident coronary and cardiovascular disease (CHD and CVD, respectively). The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used in those two studies. Four of the 12 CpGs were validated in association with incident CHD: AHRR-mapping cg05575921, PTCD2-mapping cg25769469, intergenic cg21566642 and MPO-mapping cg04988978. We then assessed whether methylation risk scores based on those CpGs improved the predictive capacity of the Framingham risk function, but they did not. Finally, we aimed to study the causality of those associations using a Mendelian randomization approach but only one of the CpGs had a genetic influence and therefore the results were not conclusive.We have identified 34 CpGs related to AMI. These loci highlight the relevance of smoking, lipid metabolism, and inflammation in the biological mechanisms related to AMI. Four were additionally associated with incident CHD and CVD but did not provide additional predictive information."
33872906,Effect of prenatal exposure to phthalates on epigenome-wide DNA methylations in cord blood and implications for fetal growth: The Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health.,Sci Total Environ,"Prenatal exposure to phthalates negatively affects the offspring's health. In particular, epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, may connect phthalate exposure with health outcomes. Here, we evaluated the association of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) exposure in utero with cord blood epigenome-wide DNA methylation in 203 mother-child pairs enrolled in the Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health, using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Epigenome-wide association analysis demonstrated the predominant positive associations between the levels of the primary metabolite of DEHP, mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), in maternal blood and DNA methylation levels in cord blood. The genes annotated to the CpGs positively associated with MEHP levels were enriched for pathways related to metabolism, the endocrine system, and signal transduction. Among them, methylation levels of CpGs involved in metabolism were inversely associated with the offspring's ponderal index (PI). Further, clustering and mediation analyses suggested that multiple increased methylation changes may jointly mediate the association of DEHP exposure in utero with the offspring's PI at birth. Although further studies are required to assess the impact of these changes, this study suggests that differential DNA methylation may link phthalate exposure in utero to fetal growth and further imply that DNA methylation has predictive value for the offspring's obesity.Copyright © 2021.

33867313,Epigenome-wide association study of COVID-19 severity with respiratory failure.,EBioMedicine,"Patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), exhibit a wide spectrum of disease behaviour. Since DNA methylation has been implicated in the regulation of viral infections and the immune system, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify candidate loci regulated by this epigenetic mark that could be involved in the onset of COVID-19 in patients without comorbidities.Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 407 confirmed COVID-19 patients ≤ 61 years of age and without comorbidities, 194 (47.7%) of whom had mild symptomatology that did not involve hospitalization and 213 (52.3%) had a severe clinical course that required respiratory support. The set of cases was divided into discovery (n = 207) and validation (n = 200) cohorts, balanced for age and sex of individuals. We analysed the DNA methylation status of 850,000 CpG sites in these patients.The DNA methylation status of 44 CpG sites was associated with the clinical severity of COVID-19. Of these loci, 23 (52.3%) were located in 20 annotated coding genes. These genes, such as the inflammasome component Absent in Melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the Major Histocompatibility Complex, class I C (HLA-C) candidates, were mainly involved in the response of interferon to viral infection. We used the EWAS-identified sites to establish a DNA methylation signature (EPICOVID) that is associated with the severity of the disease.We identified DNA methylation sites as epigenetic susceptibility loci for respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. These candidate biomarkers, combined with other clinical, cellular and genetic factors, could be useful in the clinical stratification and management of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2.The Unstoppable campaign of the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Foundation, the Cellex Foundation and the CERCA Programme/Generalitat de Catalunya.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

33862401,Residential surrounding greenness and DNA methylation: An epigenome-wide association study.,Environ Int,"DNA methylation is a potential biological mechanism through which residential greenness affects health, but little is known about its association with greenness and whether the association could be modified by genetic background. We aimed to evaluate the association between surrounding greenness and genome-wide DNA methylation and potential gene-greenness interaction effects on DNA methylation.We measured blood-derived DNA methylation using the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array (Illumina) for 479 Australian women, including 66 monozygotic, 66 dizygotic twin pairs, and 215 sisters of these twins. Surrounding greenness was represented by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) within 300, 500, 1000 or 2000 m surrounding participants' home addresses. For each cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG), the associations between its methylation level and NDVI or EVI were evaluated by generalized estimating equations, after adjusting for age, education, marital status, area-level socioeconomic status, smoking behavior, cell-type proportions, and familial clustering. We used comb-p and DMRcate to identify significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs). For each significant CpG, we evaluated the interaction effects of greenness and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ±1 Mb window on its methylation level.We found associations between surrounding greenness and blood DNA methylation for one CpG (cg04720477, mapped to the promoter region of CNP gene) with false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05, and for another 9 CpGs with 0.05 ≤ FDR < 0.10. For two of these CpGs, we found 33 SNPs significantly (FDR < 0.05) modified the greenness-methylation association. There were 35 significant DMRs related to surrounding greenness that were identified by both comb-p (Sidak p-value < 0.01) and DMRcate (FDR < 0.01). Those CpGs and DMRs were mapped to genes related to many human diseases, such as mental health disorders and neoplasms as well as nutritional and metabolic diseases.Surrounding greenness was associated with blood DNA methylation of many loci across human genome, and this association could be modified by genetic variations.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

33903745,Origins of human disease: the chrono-epigenetic perspective.,Nat Rev Genet,"Epigenetics has enriched human disease studies by adding new interpretations to disease features that cannot be explained by genetic and environmental factors. However, identifying causal mechanisms of epigenetic origin has been challenging. New opportunities have risen from recent findings in intra-individual and cyclical epigenetic variation, which includes circadian epigenetic oscillations. Cytosine modifications display deterministic temporal rhythms, which may drive ageing and complex disease. Temporality in the epigenome, or the 'chrono' dimension, may help the integration of epigenetic, environmental and genetic disease studies, and reconcile several disparities stemming from the arbitrarily delimited research fields. The ultimate goal of chrono-epigenetics is to predict disease risk, age of onset and disease dynamics from within individual-specific temporal dynamics of epigenomes."
33937763,Human methylome variation across Infinium 450K data on the Gene Expression Omnibus.,NAR Genom Bioinform,"While DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most-studied epigenetic mark, few recent studies probe the breadth of publicly available DNAm array samples. We collectively analyzed 35 360 Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K DNAm array samples published on the Gene Expression Omnibus. We learned a controlled vocabulary of sample labels by applying regular expressions to metadata and used existing models to predict various sample properties including epigenetic age. We found approximately two-thirds of samples were from blood, one-quarter were from brain and one-third were from cancer patients. About 19% of samples failed at least one of Illumina's 17 prescribed quality assessments; signal distributions across samples suggest modifying manufacturer-recommended thresholds for failure would make these assessments more informative. We further analyzed DNAm variances in seven tissues (adipose, nasal, blood, brain, buccal, sperm and liver) and characterized specific probes distinguishing them. Finally, we compiled DNAm array data and metadata, including our learned and predicted sample labels, into database files accessible via the recountmethylation R/Bioconductor companion package. Its vignettes walk the user through some analyses contained in this paper.© The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics."
33911272,The central role of DNA damage in the ageing process.,Nature,"Ageing is a complex, multifaceted process leading to widespread functional decline that affects every organ and tissue, but it remains unknown whether ageing has a unifying causal mechanism or is grounded in multiple sources. Phenotypically, the ageing process is associated with a wide variety of features at the molecular, cellular and physiological level-for example, genomic and epigenomic alterations, loss of proteostasis, declining overall cellular and subcellular function and deregulation of signalling systems. However, the relative importance, mechanistic interrelationships and hierarchical order of these features of ageing have not been clarified. Here we synthesize accumulating evidence that DNA damage affects most, if not all, aspects of the ageing phenotype, making it a potentially unifying cause of ageing. Targeting DNA damage and its mechanistic links with the ageing phenotype will provide a logical rationale for developing unified interventions to counteract age-related dysfunction and disease."
33926538,"Associations of circulating folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations in early pregnancy and cord blood with epigenetic gestational age: the Generation R Study.",Clin Epigenetics,"Circulating folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations during fetal development have been associated with health outcomes in childhood. Changes in fetal DNA methylation may be an underlying mechanism. This may be reflected in altered epigenetic aging of the fetus, as compared to chronological aging. The difference between gestational age derived in clinical practice and gestational age predicted from neonatal DNA methylation data is referred to as gestational age acceleration. Differences in circulating folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine concentrations during fetal development may be associated with gestational age acceleration.Up to 1346 newborns participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study, had both cord blood DNA methylation data available and information on plasma folate, serum total and active B12 and plasma homocysteine concentrations, measured in early pregnancy and/or in cord blood. A subgroup of 380 newborns had mothers with optimal pregnancy dating based on a regular menstrual cycle and a known date of last menstrual period. For comparison, gestational age acceleration was calculated based the method of both Bohlin and Knight. In the total study population, which was more similar to Bohlin's training population, one standard deviation score (SDS) higher maternal plasma homocysteine concentrations was nominally associated with positive gestational age acceleration [0.07 weeks, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02, 0.13] by Bohlin's method. In the subgroup with pregnancy dating based on last menstrual period, the method that was also used in Knight's training population, one SDS higher cord serum total and active B12 concentrations were nominally associated with negative gestational age acceleration [(- 0.16 weeks, 95% CI - 0.30, - 0.02) and (- 0.15 weeks, 95% CI - 0.29, - 0.01), respectively] by Knight's method.We found some evidence to support associations of higher maternal plasma homocysteine concentrations with positive gestational age acceleration, suggesting faster epigenetic than clinical gestational aging. Cord serum vitamin B12 concentrations may be associated with negative gestational age acceleration, indicating slower epigenetic than clinical gestational aging. Future studies could examine whether altered fetal epigenetic aging underlies the associations of circulating homocysteine and vitamin B12 blood concentrations during fetal development with long-term health outcomes."
33926514,Characteristics of epigenetic aging across gestational and perinatal tissues.,Clin Epigenetics,"Epigenetic clocks have been used to indicate differences in biological states between individuals of same chronological age. However, so far, only few studies have examined epigenetic aging in newborns-especially regarding different gestational or perinatal tissues. In this study, we investigated which birth- and pregnancy-related variables are most important in predicting gestational epigenetic age acceleration or deceleration (i.e., the deviation between gestational epigenetic age estimated from the DNA methylome and chronological gestational age) in chorionic villus, placenta and cord blood tissues from two independent study cohorts (ITU, n = 639 and PREDO, n = 966). We further characterized the correspondence of epigenetic age deviations between these tissues.Among the most predictive factors of epigenetic age deviations in single tissues were child sex, birth length, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal mental disorders until childbirth, delivery mode and parity. However, the specific factors related to epigenetic age deviation and the direction of association differed across tissues. In individuals with samples available from more than one tissue, relative epigenetic age deviations were not correlated across tissues.Gestational epigenetic age acceleration or deceleration was not related to more favorable or unfavorable factors in one direction in the investigated tissues, and the relative epigenetic age differed between tissues of the same person. This indicates that epigenetic age deviations associate with distinct, tissue specific, factors during the gestational and perinatal period. Our findings suggest that the epigenetic age of the newborn should be seen as a characteristic of a specific tissue, and less as a general characteristic of the child itself."
33870444,Ageing affects subtelomeric DNA methylation in blood cells from a large European population enrolled in the MARK-AGE study.,Geroscience,"Ageing leaves characteristic traces in the DNA methylation make-up of the genome. However, the importance of DNA methylation in ageing remains unclear. The study of subtelomeric regions could give promising insights into this issue. Previously reported associations between susceptibility to age-related diseases and epigenetic instability at subtelomeres suggest that the DNA methylation profile of subtelomeres undergoes remodelling during ageing. In the present work, this hypothesis has been tested in the context of the European large-scale project MARK-AGE. In this cross-sectional study, we profiled the DNA methylation of chromosomes 5 and 21 subtelomeres, in more than 2000 age-stratified women and men recruited in eight European countries. The study included individuals from the general population as well as the offspring of nonagenarians and Down syndrome subjects, who served as putative models of delayed and accelerated ageing, respectively. Significant linear changes of subtelomeric DNA methylation with increasing age were detected in the general population, indicating that subtelomeric DNA methylation changes are typical signs of ageing. Data also show that, compared to the general population, the dynamics of age-related DNA methylation changes are attenuated in the offspring of centenarian, while they accelerate in Down syndrome individuals. This result suggests that subtelomeric DNA methylation changes reflect the rate of ageing progression. We next attempted to trace the age-related changes of subtelomeric methylation back to the influence of diverse variables associated with methylation variations in the population, including demographics, dietary/health habits and clinical parameters. Results indicate that the effects of age on subtelomeric DNA methylation are mostly independent of all other variables evaluated."
33821798,High social status males experience accelerated epigenetic aging in wild baboons.,Elife,"Aging, for virtually all life, is inescapable. However, within populations, biological aging rates vary. Understanding sources of variation in this process is central to understanding the biodemography of natural populations. We constructed a DNA methylation-based age predictor for an intensively studied wild baboon population in Kenya. Consistent with findings in humans, the resulting 'epigenetic clock' closely tracks chronological age, but individuals are predicted to be somewhat older or younger than their known ages. Surprisingly, these deviations are not explained by the strongest predictors of lifespan in this population, early adversity and social integration. Instead, they are best predicted by male dominance rank: high-ranking males are predicted to be older than their true ages, and epigenetic age tracks changes in rank over time. Our results argue that achieving high rank for male baboons - the best predictor of reproductive success - imposes costs consistent with a 'live fast, die young' life-history strategy.© 2021, Anderson et al."
33875015,An EPIC predictor of gestational age and its application to newborns conceived by assisted reproductive technologies.,Clin Epigenetics,"Gestational age is a useful proxy for assessing developmental maturity, but correct estimation of gestational age is difficult using clinical measures. DNA methylation at birth has proven to be an accurate predictor of gestational age. Previous predictors of epigenetic gestational age were based on DNA methylation data from the Illumina HumanMethylation 27 K or 450 K array, which have subsequently been replaced by the Illumina MethylationEPIC 850 K array (EPIC). Our aims here were to build an epigenetic gestational age clock specific for the EPIC array and to evaluate its precision and accuracy using the embryo transfer date of newborns from the largest EPIC-derived dataset to date on assisted reproductive technologies (ART).We built an epigenetic gestational age clock using Lasso regression trained on 755 randomly selected non-ART newborns from the Norwegian Study of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (START)-a substudy of the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). For the ART-conceived newborns, the START dataset had detailed information on the embryo transfer date and the specific ART procedure used for conception. The predicted gestational age was compared to clinically estimated gestational age in 200 non-ART and 838 ART newborns using MM-type robust regression. The performance of the clock was compared to previously published gestational age clocks in an independent replication sample of 148 newborns from the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restrictions (PREDO) study-a prospective pregnancy cohort of Finnish women.Our new epigenetic gestational age clock showed higher precision and accuracy in predicting gestational age than previous gestational age clocks (R2 = 0.724, median absolute deviation (MAD) = 3.14 days). Restricting the analysis to CpGs shared between 450 K and EPIC did not reduce the precision of the clock. Furthermore, validating the clock on ART newborns with known embryo transfer date confirmed that DNA methylation is an accurate predictor of gestational age (R2 = 0.767, MAD = 3.7 days).We present the first EPIC-based predictor of gestational age and demonstrate its robustness and precision in ART and non-ART newborns. As more datasets are being generated on the EPIC platform, this clock will be valuable in studies using gestational age to assess neonatal development."
33863351,Identification of X-chromosomal genes that drive sex differences in embryonic stem cells through a hierarchical CRISPR screening approach.,Genome Biol,"X-chromosomal genes contribute to sex differences, in particular during early development, when both X chromosomes are active in females. Double X-dosage shifts female pluripotent cells towards the naive stem cell state by increasing pluripotency factor expression, inhibiting the differentiation-promoting MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and delaying differentiation.To identify the genetic basis of these sex differences, we use a two-step CRISPR screening approach to comprehensively identify X-linked genes that cause the female pluripotency phenotype in murine embryonic stem cells. A primary chromosome-wide CRISPR knockout screen and three secondary screens assaying for different aspects of the female pluripotency phenotype allow us to uncover multiple genes that act in concert and to disentangle their relative roles. Among them, we identify Dusp9 and Klhl13 as two central players. While Dusp9 mainly affects MAPK pathway intermediates, Klhl13 promotes pluripotency factor expression and delays differentiation, with both factors jointly repressing MAPK target gene expression.Here, we elucidate the mechanisms that drive sex-induced differences in pluripotent cells and our approach serves as a blueprint to discover the genetic basis of the phenotypic consequences of other chromosomal effects."
33886023,"DNA Methylation, Preterm Birth and Blood Pressure in African American Children: The DPREG Study.",J Immigr Minor Health,"Preterm birth (< 37 weeks) has been associated with high blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Epigenetic mechanisms may explain how preterm birth influences later BP. In this study, we examined the association between DNA methylation (DNAm), preterm birth and BP in African American children. We recruited 100 children and collected clinical and birth history data. DNA was extracted from saliva and the Illumina EPIC BeadChip was used for epigenetic analyses. Preterm birth was not associated with systolic or diastolic BP. No significant DNAm sites were associated with preterm birth in candidate gene methylation analyses. Body mass index was associated with systolic BP (p = 0.01). We did not observe an effect of preterm birth on DNAm or BP in early childhood. Our study is one of the few, however, to examine these associations among African Americans."
33870089,DNA Methylation at Birth is Associated with Childhood Serum Immunoglobulin E Levels.,Epigenet Insights,"Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is known to play an important role in allergic diseases. Epigenetic traits acquired due to modification of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation (DNAm) in early life may have phenotypic consequences through their role in transcriptional regulation with relevance to the developmental origins of diseases including allergy. However, epigenome-scale studies on the longitudinal association of cord blood DNAm with IgE over time are lacking. Our study aimed to examine the association of DNAm at birth with childhood serum IgE levels during early life. Genome-scale DNAm and total serum IgE measured at birth, 5, 8, and 11 years of children in the Taiwan Maternal and Infant Cohort Study were included in the study in the discovery stage. Linear mixed models were implemented to assess the association between cord blood DNAm at ~310K 5'-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3' (CpG) sites with repeated IgE measurements, adjusting for cord blood IgE. Identified statistically significant CpGs (at a false discovery rate, FDR, of 0.05) were further tested in an independent replication cohort, the Isle of Wight (IoW) birth cohort. We mapped replicated CpGs to genes and conducted gene ontology analysis using ToppFun to identify significantly enriched pathways and biological processes of the genes. Cord blood DNAm of 273 CpG sites were significantly (FDR = 0.05) associated with IgE levels longitudinally. Among the identified CpGs available in both cohorts (184 CpGs), 92 CpGs (50%) were replicated in the IoW in terms of consistency in direction of associations between DNA methylation and IgE levels later in life, and 16 of the 92 CpGs showed statistically significant associations (P < .05). Gene ontology analysis identified 4 pathways (FDR = 0.05). The identified 16 CpG sites had the potential to serve as epigenetic markers associated with later IgE production, beneficial to allergic disease prevention and intervention.© The Author(s) 2021."
