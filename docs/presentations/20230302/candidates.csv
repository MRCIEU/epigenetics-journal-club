matt,36849614,Nucleated red blood cells explain most of the association between DNA methylation and gestational age.,Commun Biol,"Determining if specific cell type(s) are responsible for an association between DNA methylation (DNAm) and a given phenotype is important for understanding the biological mechanisms underlying the association. Our EWAS of gestational age (GA) in 953 newborns from the Norwegian MoBa study identified 13,660 CpGs significantly associated with GA (pBonferroni<0.05) after adjustment for cell type composition. When the CellDMC algorithm was applied to explore cell-type specific effects, 2,330 CpGs were significantly associated with GA, mostly in nucleated red blood cells [nRBCs; n = 2,030 (87%)]. Similar patterns were found in another dataset based on a different array and when applying an alternative algorithm to CellDMC called Tensor Composition Analysis (TCA). Our findings point to nRBCs as the main cell type driving the DNAm-GA association, implicating an epigenetic signature of erythropoiesis as a likely mechanism. They also explain the poor correlation observed between epigenetic age clocks for newborns and those for adults.© 2023. The Author(s)."
sarah,36849136,Age-related methylation changes in the human sperm epigenome.,Aging (Albany NY),"Advanced paternal age is associated with increased risks for reproductive and offspring medical problems. Accumulating evidence suggests age-related changes in the sperm epigenome as one underlying mechanism. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on 73 sperm samples of males attending a fertility center, we identified 1,162 (74%) regions which were significantly (FDR-adjusted) hypomethylated and 403 regions (26%) being hypermethylated with age. There were no significant correlations with paternal BMI, semen quality, or ART outcome. The majority (1,152 of 1,565; 74%) of age-related differentially methylated regions (ageDMRs) were located within genic regions, including 1,002 genes with symbols. Hypomethylated ageDMRs were closer to transcription start sites than hypermethylated DMRs, half of which reside in gene-distal regions. In this and conceptually related genome-wide studies, so far 2,355 genes have been reported with significant sperm ageDMRs, however most (90%) of them in only one study. The 241 genes which have been replicated at least once showed significant functional enrichments in 41 biological processes associated with development and the nervous system and in 10 cellular components associated with synapses and neurons. This supports the hypothesis that paternal age effects on the sperm methylome affect offspring behaviour and neurodevelopment. It is interesting to note that sperm ageDMRs were not randomly distributed throughout the human genome; chromosome 19 showed a highly significant twofold enrichment with sperm ageDMRs. Although the high gene density and CpG content have been conserved, the orthologous marmoset chromosome 22 did not appear to exhibit an increased regulatory potential by age-related DNA methylation changes."
alec,36843037,"Cross-tissue correlations of genome-wide DNA methylation in Japanese live human brain and blood, saliva, and buccal epithelial tissues.",Transl Psychiatry,"Neuroepigenetics considers genetic sequences and the interplay with environmental influences to elucidate vulnerability risk for various neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, evaluating DNA methylation of brain tissue is challenging owing to the issue of tissue specificity. Consequently, peripheral surrogate tissues were used, resulting in limited progress compared with other epigenetic studies, such as cancer research. Therefore, we developed databases to establish correlations between the brain and peripheral tissues in the same individuals. Four tissues, resected brain tissue, blood, saliva, and buccal mucosa (buccal), were collected from 19 patients (aged 13-73 years) who underwent neurosurgery. Moreover, their genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip arrays to determine the cross-tissue correlation of each combination. These correlation analyses were conducted with all methylation sites and with variable CpGs, and with when these were adjusted for cellular proportions. For the averaged data for each CpG across individuals, the saliva-brain correlation (r = 0.90) was higher than that for blood-brain (r = 0.87) and buccal-brain (r = 0.88) comparisons. Among individual CpGs, blood had the highest proportion of CpGs correlated to the brain at nominally significant levels (19.0%), followed by saliva (14.4%) and buccal (9.8%). These results were similar to the previous IMAGE-CpG results; however, cross-database correlations of the correlation coefficients revealed a relatively low (brain vs. blood: r = 0.27, saliva: r = 0.18, and buccal: r = 0.24). To the best of our knowledge, this is the fifth study in the literature initiating the development of databases for correlations between the brain and peripheral tissues in the same individuals. We present the first database developed from an Asian population, specifically Japanese samples (AMAZE-CpG), which would contribute to interpreting individual epigenetic study results from various Asian populations.© 2023.

,36842935,Maternal and Paternal Dietary Quality and Dietary Inflammation Associations with Offspring DNA Methylation and Epigenetic Biomarkers of Aging in the Lifeways Cross-Generation Study.,J Nutr,"Early-life nutritional exposures may contribute to offspring epigenetic modifications. However, few studies have evaluated parental dietary quality effects on offspring DNA methylation (DNAm).We aim to fill this gap by elucidating the influence of maternal and paternal whole-diet quality and inflammatory potential on offspring DNAm in the Lifeways Cross-generation cohort.Families (n = 1124) were recruited around 16 weeks of gestation in the Republic of Ireland between 2001 and 2003. Maternal dietary intake during the first trimester and paternal diet during the 12 previous months were assessed with an FFQ. Parental dietary inflammatory potential and quality were determined using the energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII), the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015), and the maternal DASH score. DNAm in the saliva of 246 children at age nine was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC array. DNAm-derived biomarkers of aging, the Pediatric-Buccal-Epigenetic clock and DNAm estimator of telomere length, were calculated. Parental diet associations with the DNAm concentrations of 850K Cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpG sites) and with DNAm-derived biomarkers of aging were examined using an epigenome-wide association study and linear regressions, respectively.Maternal HEI-2015 scores were inversely associated with DNAm at CpG site (cg21840035) located near the PLEKHM1 gene, whose functions involve regulation of bone development (β = -0.0036, per 1 point increase in the score; P = 5.6 × 10-8). Higher paternal HEI-2015 score was related to lower methylation at CpG site (cg22431767), located near cell signaling gene LUZP1 (β = -0.0022, per 1 point increase in the score, P = 4.1 × 10-8). There were no associations with parental E-DII and DASH scores, and no evidence of major effects on biomarkers of aging.Parental dietary quality in the prenatal period, evaluated by the HEI-2015, may influence offspring DNAm during childhood. Further research to improve our understanding of parental nutritional programming is warranted. J Nutr 2023;xx:xx-xx.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
ryan,36834337,DNA-Methylation Signatures of Tobacco Smoking in a High Cardiovascular Risk Population: Modulation by the Mediterranean Diet.,Int J Environ Res Public Health,"Biomarkers based on DNA methylation are relevant in the field of environmental health for precision health. Although tobacco smoking is one of the factors with a strong and consistent impact on DNA methylation, there are very few studies analyzing its methylation signature in southern European populations and none examining its modulation by the Mediterranean diet at the epigenome-wide level. We examined blood methylation smoking signatures on the EPIC 850 K array in this population (n = 414 high cardiovascular risk subjects). Epigenome-wide methylation studies (EWASs) were performed analyzing differential methylation CpG sites by smoking status (never, former, and current smokers) and the modulation by adherence to a Mediterranean diet score was explored. Gene-set enrichment analysis was performed for biological and functional interpretation. The predictive value of the top differentially methylated CpGs was analyzed using receiver operative curves. We characterized the DNA methylation signature of smoking in this Mediterranean population by identifying 46 differentially methylated CpGs at the EWAS level in the whole population. The strongest association was observed at the cg21566642 (p= 2.2 × 10-32) in the 2q37.1 region. We also detected other CpGs that have been consistently reported in prior research and discovered some novel differentially methylated CpG sites in subgroup analyses. In addition, we found distinct methylation profiles based on the adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Particularly, we obtained a significant interaction between smoking and diet modulating the cg5575921 methylation in the AHRR gene. In conclusion, we have characterized biomarkers of the methylation signature of tobacco smoking in this population, and suggest that the Mediterranean diet can increase methylation of certain hypomethylated sites."
sam?,36815102,Longitudinal Epigenome-Wide Analysis of Kidney Transplant Recipients Pretransplant and Posttransplant.,Kidney Int Rep,"Kidney transplantation remains the gold standard of treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with improved patient outcomes compared with dialysis. Epigenome-Wide Association Analysis (EWAS) of DNA methylation may identify markers that contribute to an individual's risk of adverse transplant outcomes, yet only a limited number of EWAS have been conducted in kidney transplant recipients. This EWAS aimed to interrogate the methylation profile of a kidney transplant recipient cohort with minimal posttransplant complications, exploring differences in samples pretransplant and posttransplant.We compared differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (dmCpGs) in samples derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the same kidney transplant recipients, collected both pretransplant and posttransplant (N = 154), using the Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Recipients received kidneys from deceased donors and had a mean of 17 years of follow-up.Five top-ranked dmCpGs were significantly different at false discovery rate (FDR) adjustedP ≤ 9 × 10-8; cg23597162 withinJAZF1, cg25187293 withinBTNL8, cg17944885, located betweenZNF788PandZNF625-ZNF20,cg14655917 located betweenASB4andPDK4and cg09839120 located betweenGIMAP6andEIF2AP3.Five dmCpGs were identified at the generally accepted EWAS critical significance level of FDR adjustedP(PFDRadj) ≤ 9 × 10-8, including cg23597162 (withinJAZF1) and cg17944885, which have prior associations with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Comparing individuals with no evidence of posttransplant complications (N = 105) demonstrated that 693,555 CpGs (89.57%) did not display any significant difference in methylation (PFDRadj ≥ 0.05), thereby this study establishes an important reference for future epigenetic studies that seek to identify markers of posttransplant complications.© 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the International Society of Nephrology."
,36811307,Genome-wide methylomic regulation of multiscale gene networks in Alzheimer's disease.,Alzheimers Dement,"Recent studies revealed the association of abnormal methylomic changes with Alzheimer's disease (AD) but there is a lack of systematic study of the impact of methylomic alterations over the molecular networks underlying AD.We profiled genome-wide methylomic variations in the parahippocampal gyrus from 201 post mortem control, mild cognitive impaired, and AD brains.We identified 270 distinct differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with AD. We quantified the impact of these DMRs on each gene and each protein as well as gene and protein co-expression networks. DNA methylation had a profound impact on both AD-associated gene/protein modules and their key regulators. We further integrated the matched multi-omics data to show the impact of DNA methylation on chromatin accessibility, which further modulates gene and protein expression.The quantified impact of DNA methylation on gene and protein networks underlying AD identified potential upstream epigenetic regulators of AD.A cohort of DNA methylation data in the parahippocampal gyrus was developed from 201 post mortem control, mild cognitive impaired, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Two hundred seventy distinct differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found to be associated with AD compared to normal control. A metric was developed to quantify methylation impact on each gene and each protein. DNA methylation was found to have a profound impact on not only the AD-associated gene modules but also key regulators of the gene and protein networks. Key findings were validated in an independent multi-omics cohort in AD. The impact of DNA methylation on chromatin accessibility was also investigated by integrating the matched methylomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data.© 2023 The Authors.
