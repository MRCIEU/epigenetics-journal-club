"36854344","Wide arthroscopic dorsal capsuloligamentous repair in patients with severe scapholunate instability.","Bone Joint J","A conventional arthroscopic capsuloligamentous repair is a reliable surgical solution in most patients with scapholunate instability. However, this repair does not seem to be sufficient for more advanced injuries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional results of a wide arthroscopic dorsal capsuloligamentous repair (WADCLR) in the management of severe scapholunate instability. This was a prospective single-centre study undertaken between March 2019 and May 2021. The primary outcome was the evaluation of the reduction of the radiological deformity and the functional outcomes after WADCLR. A secondary outcome was the evaluation of the effectiveness of this technique in patients with the most severe instability (European Wrist Arthroscopy Society (EWAS) stage 5). The patients were reviewed postoperatively at three, six, and 12 months. The study included 112 patients (70 male and 42 female). Their mean age was 31.6 years (16 to 55). A total of three patients had EWAS stage 3A injuries, 12 had stage 3B injuries, 29 had stage 3C injuries, 56 had stage 4 injuries, and 12 had stage 5 injuries. There was a significant improvement of the radiological signs in all patients with a return to normal values. There was also a significant improvement in all aspects of function except for flexion, in which the mean increase was negligible (0.18° on average). There was also a significant improvement in all criteria for patients with a stage 5 injury, except for some limitation of extension, flexion, and radial and ulnar deviation, although these showed a trend towards improvement (except for flexion). WADCLR is a minimally invasive, easy, and reproducible technique with few complications, offering a clear improvement in function and a reduction in the radiological deformity at one year postoperatively.© 2023 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery."

It is widely distributed in China's warm temperate zone. In plants, WRKY transcription factors play important regulatory roles in seed germination, flower development, fruit ripening and coloring, and biotic and abiotic stress response. To date, WRKY transcription factors have not been systematically studied in weeping forsythia. In this study, we identified 79 WRKY genes in weeping forsythia and classified them according to their naming rules in Arabidopsis thaliana. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that, except for IIe subfamily, whose clustering was inconsistent with A. thaliana clustering, other subfamily clustering groups were consistent. Cis-element analysis showed that WRKY genes related to pathogen resistance in weeping forsythia might be related to methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid-mediated signaling pathways. Combining cis-element and expression pattern analyses of WRKY genes showed that more than half of WRKY genes were involved in light-dependent development and morphogenesis in different tissues. The gene expression results showed that 13 WRKY genes were involved in drought response, most of which might be related to the abscisic acid signaling pathway, and a few of which might be regulated by MYB transcription factors. The gene expression results under cold stress showed that 17 WRKY genes were involved in low temperature response, and 9 of them had low temperature responsiveness cis-elements. Our study of WRKY family in weeping forsythia provided useful resources for molecular breeding and important clues for their functional verification.© 2023.

Herein, we successfully prepared poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) hydrogel/β-FeOOH-coated poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF/PAMPS/β-FeOOH) membrane through free-radical polymerization and the in situ mineralization process. In this work, owing to the combination of hydrophilic PAMPS hydrogel coating and β-FeOOH nanorods anchored onto PVDF membrane, the resultant PVDF/PAMPS/β-FeOOH membrane achieved outstanding superhydrophilicity/underwater superoleophobicity. Moreover, the membrane not only effectively separated surfactant-stabilized oil/water emulsions, but also possessed a long-term use capacity. In addition, excellent photocatalytic activity against organic pollutants was demonstrated so that the PVDF/PAMPS/β-FeOOH membrane could be utilized to deal with wastewater. It is envisioned that these hydrogel/β-FeOOH-coated PVDF membranes have versatile applications in the fields of oil/water separation and wastewater purification."

Our EWAS of gestational age (GA) in 953 newborns from the Norwegian MoBa study identified 13,660 CpGs significantly associated with GA (pBonferroni<0.05) after adjustment for cell type composition. When the CellDMC algorithm was applied to explore cell-type specific effects, 2,330 CpGs were significantly associated with GA, mostly in nucleated red blood cells [nRBCs; n = 2,030 (87%)]. Similar patterns were found in another dataset based on a different array and when applying an alternative algorithm to CellDMC called Tensor Composition Analysis (TCA). Our findings point to nRBCs as the main cell type driving the DNAm-GA association, implicating an epigenetic signature of erythropoiesis as a likely mechanism. They also explain the poor correlation observed between epigenetic age clocks for newborns and those for adults.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Accumulating evidence suggests age-related changes in the sperm epigenome as one underlying mechanism. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on 73 sperm samples of males attending a fertility center, we identified 1,162 (74%) regions which were significantly (FDR-adjusted) hypomethylated and 403 regions (26%) being hypermethylated with age. There were no significant correlations with paternal BMI, semen quality, or ART outcome. The majority (1,152 of 1,565; 74%) of age-related differentially methylated regions (ageDMRs) were located within genic regions, including 1,002 genes with symbols. Hypomethylated ageDMRs were closer to transcription start sites than hypermethylated DMRs, half of which reside in gene-distal regions. In this and conceptually related genome-wide studies, so far 2,355 genes have been reported with significant sperm ageDMRs, however most (90%) of them in only one study. The 241 genes which have been replicated at least once showed significant functional enrichments in 41 biological processes associated with development and the nervous system and in 10 cellular components associated with synapses and neurons. This supports the hypothesis that paternal age effects on the sperm methylome affect offspring behaviour and neurodevelopment. It is interesting to note that sperm ageDMRs were not randomly distributed throughout the human genome; chromosome 19 showed a highly significant twofold enrichment with sperm ageDMRs. Although the high gene density and CpG content have been conserved, the orthologous marmoset chromosome 22 did not appear to exhibit an increased regulatory potential by age-related DNA methylation changes."

While compound 1 has been proposed to be assembled via a type I modular polyketide synthase (PKS) system, most of the putative biosynthetic steps lack experimental evidence. In this study, we elucidated the post-PKS tailoring steps of compound 1 throughin vivogene inactivation andin vitrobiochemical assays. We demonstrated that the amide synthetase HexB andO-methyltransferase HexF are responsible for the installations of the C5N moiety and the methyl group at 15-OH of compound 1, respectively; two new hexacosalactone analogs, named hexacosalactones B (4) and C (5), were purified and structurally characterized, followed by anti-multidrug resistance (anti-MDR) bacterial assays, revealing that the C5N ring and the methyl group are necessary for the antibacterial bioactivities. Through database mining of C5N-forming proteins HexABC, six uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), putatively encoding compounds with different types of backbones, were identified, providing potentials to discover novel bioactive compounds with C5N moiety.IMPORTANCEIn this study, we elucidate the post-PKS tailoring steps during the biosynthesis of compound 1 and demonstrate that both C5N and 15-OMe groups are critical for the antibacterial activities of compound 1, paving the way for generation of hexacosalactone derivativesviasynthetic biology strategy. In addition, mining of HexABC homologs from the GenBank database revealed their wide distribution across the bacterial world, facilitating the discovery of other bioactive natural products with C5N moiety."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of a 6-month exercise training program on DNA methylation profile in women who underwent bariatric surgery. In this exploratory, quasi-experimental study, we analyzed DNA methylation levels by array technology in eleven women who underwent Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and a 6-month, three-times-a-week, supervised exercise training program. Epigenome Wide Association Analysis showed 722 CpG sites with different methylation level equal to or greater than 5% (P < 0.01) after exercise training. Some of these CpGs sites were related to pathophysiological mechanisms of inflammation, specially Th17 cell differentiation (FDR value < 0.05 andP < 0.001). Our data showed epigenetic modification in specific CpG sites related to Th17 cell differentiation pathway in post-bariatric women following a 6-months exercise training program.© 2023 Nicoletti, Roschel, Merege-Filho, Lima, Gil, Pinhel, Noronha, Santo, Jacome, Crujeiras, Gualano and Nonino."
"36845425","The role of histone methyltransferases in neurocognitive disorders associated with brain size abnormalities.","Front Neurosci","Brain size is controlled by several factors during neuronal development, including neural progenitor proliferation, neuronal arborization, gliogenesis, cell death, and synaptogenesis. Multiple neurodevelopmental disorders have co-morbid brain size abnormalities, such as microcephaly and macrocephaly. Mutations in histone methyltransferases that modify histone H3 on Lysine 36 and Lysine 4 (H3K36 and H3K4) have been identified in neurodevelopmental disorders involving both microcephaly and macrocephaly. H3K36 and H3K4 methylation are both associated with transcriptional activation and are proposed to sterically hinder the repressive activity of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2). During neuronal development, tri-methylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3) by PRC2 leads to genome wide transcriptional repression of genes that regulate cell fate transitions and neuronal arborization. Here we provide a review of neurodevelopmental processes and disorders associated with H3K36 and H3K4 histone methyltransferases, with emphasis on processes that contribute to brain size abnormalities. Additionally, we discuss how the counteracting activities of H3K36 and H3K4 modifying enzymes vs. PRC2 could contribute to brain size abnormalities which is an underexplored mechanism in relation to brain size control.Copyright © 2023 Ritchie and Lizarraga."

Molecular parameters are needed to better inform management following gross total resection (GTR).We performed comprehensive genomic analysis of tumor tissue from 63 patients who underwent radiologically confirmed GTR of a primary grade 2 meningioma, including a CLIA-certified target next-generation sequencing panel (n= 61), chromosomal microarray (n= 63), genome-wide methylation profiling (n= 62), H3K27me3 immunohistochemistry (n= 62), and RNA-sequencing (n= 19). Genomic features were correlated with long-term clinical outcomes (median follow-up: 10 years) using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling and published molecular prognostic signatures were evaluated.The presence of specific copy number variants (CNVs), including -1p, -10q, -7p, and -4p, was the strongest predictor of decreased recurrence-free survival (RFS) within our cohort (P< .05).NF2mutations were frequent (51%) but did not show a significant association with RFS. DNA methylation-based classification assigned tumors to DKFZ Heidelberg benign (52%) or intermediate (47%) meningioma subclasses and was not associated with RFS. H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) was unequivocally lost in 4 tumors, insufficient for RFS analysis. Application of published integrated histologic/molecular grading systems did not improve prediction of recurrence risk over the presence of -1p or -10q alone.CNVs are strong predictors of RFS in grade 2 meningiomas following GTR. Our study supports incorporation of CNV profiling into clinical evaluation to better guide postoperative patient management, which can be readily implemented using existing, clinically validated technologies.© The Author(s) 2023.

For better management of aflatoxin contamination, we report the cloning and characterization of a novelA. flavusinducible promoter of the O-methyltransferase gene (AhOMT1) from peanut. TheAhOMT1gene was identified as the highest inducible gene byA. flavusinfection through genome-wide microarray analysis and verified by qRT-PCR analysis.AhOMT1gene was studied in detail, and its promoter, fussed with theGUSgene, was introduced into Arabidopsis to generate homozygous transgenic lines. Expression ofGUSgene was studied in transgenic plants under the infection ofA. flavus. The analysis ofAhOMT1gene characterized by in silico assay, RNAseq, and qRT-PCR revealed minute expression in different organs and tissues with trace or no response to low temperature, drought, hormones, Ca2+, and bacterial stresses, but highly induced byA. flavusinfection. It contains four exons encoding 297 aa predicted to transfer the methyl group of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). The promoter contains different cis-elements responsible for its expression characteristics. Functional characterization ofAhOMT1P in transgenic Arabidopsis plants demonstrated highly inducible behavior only underA. flavusinfection. The transgenic plants did not showGUSexpression in any tissue(s) without inoculation ofA. flavusspores. However,GUSactivity increased significantly after inoculation ofA. flavusand maintained a high level of expression after 48 hours of infection. These results provided a novel way for future management of peanut aflatoxins contamination through driving resistance genes inA. flavusinducible manner.Copyright © 2023 Zhuang, Sharif, Zeng, Chen, Chen, Zhuang, Deng, Ruan, Chen and Weijian."

However, evaluating DNA methylation of brain tissue is challenging owing to the issue of tissue specificity. Consequently, peripheral surrogate tissues were used, resulting in limited progress compared with other epigenetic studies, such as cancer research. Therefore, we developed databases to establish correlations between the brain and peripheral tissues in the same individuals. Four tissues, resected brain tissue, blood, saliva, and buccal mucosa (buccal), were collected from 19 patients (aged 13-73 years) who underwent neurosurgery. Moreover, their genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC BeadChip arrays to determine the cross-tissue correlation of each combination. These correlation analyses were conducted with all methylation sites and with variable CpGs, and with when these were adjusted for cellular proportions. For the averaged data for each CpG across individuals, the saliva-brain correlation (r = 0.90) was higher than that for blood-brain (r = 0.87) and buccal-brain (r = 0.88) comparisons. Among individual CpGs, blood had the highest proportion of CpGs correlated to the brain at nominally significant levels (19.0%), followed by saliva (14.4%) and buccal (9.8%). These results were similar to the previous IMAGE-CpG results; however, cross-database correlations of the correlation coefficients revealed a relatively low (brain vs. blood: r = 0.27, saliva: r = 0.18, and buccal: r = 0.24). To the best of our knowledge, this is the fifth study in the literature initiating the development of databases for correlations between the brain and peripheral tissues in the same individuals. We present the first database developed from an Asian population, specifically Japanese samples (AMAZE-CpG), which would contribute to interpreting individual epigenetic study results from various Asian populations.© 2023.

However, few studies have evaluated parental dietary quality effects on offspring DNA methylation (DNAm).We aim to fill this gap by elucidating the influence of maternal and paternal whole-diet quality and inflammatory potential on offspring DNAm in the Lifeways Cross-generation cohort.Families (n = 1124) were recruited around 16 weeks of gestation in the Republic of Ireland between 2001 and 2003. Maternal dietary intake during the first trimester and paternal diet during the 12 previous months were assessed with an FFQ. Parental dietary inflammatory potential and quality were determined using the energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII), the Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015), and the maternal DASH score. DNAm in the saliva of 246 children at age nine was measured using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylationEPIC array. DNAm-derived biomarkers of aging, the Pediatric-Buccal-Epigenetic clock and DNAm estimator of telomere length, were calculated. Parental diet associations with the DNAm concentrations of 850K Cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (CpG sites) and with DNAm-derived biomarkers of aging were examined using an epigenome-wide association study and linear regressions, respectively.Maternal HEI-2015 scores were inversely associated with DNAm at CpG site (cg21840035) located near the PLEKHM1 gene, whose functions involve regulation of bone development (β = -0.0036, per 1 point increase in the score; P = 5.6 × 10-8). Higher paternal HEI-2015 score was related to lower methylation at CpG site (cg22431767), located near cell signaling gene LUZP1 (β = -0.0022, per 1 point increase in the score, P = 4.1 × 10-8). There were no associations with parental E-DII and DASH scores, and no evidence of major effects on biomarkers of aging.Parental dietary quality in the prenatal period, evaluated by the HEI-2015, may influence offspring DNAm during childhood. Further research to improve our understanding of parental nutritional programming is warranted. J Nutr 2023;xx:xx-xx.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Many host-adapted bacterial pathogens encode systems known as phasevarions (phase-variable regulons). Phasevarions result from variable expression of cytoplasmic DNA methyltransferases. Variable expression results in genome-wide methylation differences within a bacterial population, leading to altered expression of multiple genes via epigenetic mechanisms. Our examination of a diverse population of A. pleuropneumoniae strains determined that Type I and Type III DNA methyltransferases with the hallmarks of phase variation were present in this species. We demonstrate that phase variation is occurring in these methyltransferases, and show associations between particular Type III methyltransferase alleles and serovar. Using Pacific BioSciences Single-Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing and Oxford Nanopore sequencing, we demonstrate the presence of the first ever characterised phase-variable, cytosine-specific Type III DNA methyltransferase. Phase variation of distinct Type III DNA methyltransferase in A. pleuropneumoniae results in the regulation of distinct phasevarions, and in multiple phenotypic differences relevant to pathobiology. Our characterisation of these newly described phasevarions in A. pleuropneumoniae will aid in the selection of stably expressed antigens, and direct and inform development of a rationally designed subunit vaccine against this major veterinary pathogen.© The Author(s) 2023.

It controls the expressions of several other genes which are involved in multiple regulatory functions. KLF14 plays a significant role in lipid metabolism, glucose regulation and insulin sensitivity. Cell apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation are regulated by the KLF14 gene, and up-regulation of KLF14 prevents cancer progression. KLF14 has been used as an epigenetic biomarker for the estimation of chronological age due to the presence of different age-related CpG sites on genes that become methylated with age. Different genome-wide association studies have identified several KLF14 variants in adipose tissues. These single nucleotide polymorphisms in KLF14 have been associated with dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. Moreover, the prevalence of genetic polymorphism is different in different populations due to ethnic differences and epigenetic modifications. In addition, environmental and physiological factors such as diet, age, gender, and obesity are also responsible for genetic mutations in KLF14."

We sought to investigate relations between eosinophilic inflammation, a phenotypic feature frequent in severe asthma, bronchial epithelial transcriptome, and functional and structural measures of airway remodeling. We compared epithelial gene expression, spirometry, airway cross-sectional geometry (computed tomography), reticular basement membrane thickness (histology), and blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytokines ofn= 40 moderate to severe eosinophilic (EA) and non-eosinophilic asthma (NEA) patients distinguished by BAL eosinophilia. EA patients showed a similar extent of airway remodeling as NEA but had an increased expression of genes involved in the immune response and inflammation (e.g.,KIR3DS1), reactive oxygen species generation (GYS2,ATPIF1), cell activation and proliferation (ANK3), cargo transporting (RAB4B,CPLX2), and tissue remodeling (FBLN1,SOX14,GSN), and a lower expression of genes involved in epithelial integrity (e.g.,GJB1) and histone acetylation (SIN3A). Genes co-expressed in EA were involved in antiviral responses (e.g.,ATP1B1), cell migration (EPS8L1,STOML3), cell adhesion (RAPH1), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (ASB3), and airway hyperreactivity and remodeling (FBN3,RECK), and several were linked to asthma in genome- (e.g.,MRPL14,ASB3) or epigenome-wide association studies (CLC,GPI,SSCRB4,STRN4). Signaling pathways inferred from the co-expression pattern were associated with airway remodeling (e.g., TGF-β/Smad2/3, E2F/Rb, and Wnt/β-catenin)."

In many respects, this ssvRNA resembles a very large, polycistronic messenger RNA (mRNA) possessing a 5'-methyl cap (m7GpppN), a 3'- and 5'-untranslated region (3'-UTR, 5'-UTR), and a poly-adenylated (poly-A+) tail. As such, the SARS-CoV-2 ssvRNA is susceptible to targeting by small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) and/or microRNA (miRNA), as well as neutralization and/or inhibition of its infectivity via the human body's natural complement of about ~2650 miRNA species. Depending on host cell and tissue type, in silico analysis, RNA sequencing, and molecular-genetic investigations indicate that, remarkably, almost every single human miRNA has the potential to interact with the primary sequence of SARS-CoV-2 ssvRNA. Individual human variation in host miRNA abundance, speciation, and complexity among different human populations and additional variability in the cell and tissue distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor (ACE2R) appear to further contribute to the molecular-genetic basis for the wide variation in individual host cell and tissue susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. In this paper, we review recently described aspects of the miRNA and ssvRNA ribonucleotide sequence structure in this highly evolved miRNA-ssvRNA recognition and signaling system and, for the first time, report the most abundant miRNAs in the control superior temporal lobe neocortex (STLN), an anatomical area involved in cognition and targeted by both SARS-CoV-2 invasion and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We further evaluate important factors involving the neurotropic nature of SARS-CoV-2 and miRNAs and ACE2R distribution in the STLN that modulate significant functional deficits in the brain and CNS associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19's long-term neurological effects."
"36834503","PGC7 Regulates Genome-Wide DNA Methylation by Regulating ERK-Mediated Subcellular Localization of DNMT1.","Int J Mol Sci","DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays a vital role in a variety of biological processes, including the regulation of gene expression, cell differentiation, early embryonic development, genomic imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation. PGC7 is a maternal factor that maintains DNA methylation during early embryonic development. One mechanism of action has been identified by analyzing the interactions between PGC7 and UHRF1, H3K9 me2, or TET2/TET3, which reveals how PGC7 regulates DNA methylation in oocytes or fertilized embryos. However, the mechanism by which PGC7 regulates the post-translational modification of methylation-related enzymes remains to be elucidated. This study focused on F9 cells (embryonic cancer cells), which display high levels of PGC7 expression. We found that both knockdown ofPgc7and inhibition of ERK activity resulted in increased genome-wide DNA methylation levels. Mechanistic experiments confirmed that inhibition of ERK activity led to the accumulation of DNMT1 in the nucleus, ERK phosphorylated DNMT1 at ser717, and DNMT1 Ser717-Ala mutation promoted the nuclear localization of DNMT1. Moreover, knockdown ofPgc7also caused downregulation of ERK phosphorylation and promoted the accumulation of DNMT1 in the nucleus. In conclusion, we reveal a new mechanism by which PGC7 regulates genome-wide DNA methylation via phosphorylation of DNMT1 at ser717 by ERK. These findings may provide new insights into treatments for DNA methylation-related diseases."

Although tobacco smoking is one of the factors with a strong and consistent impact on DNA methylation, there are very few studies analyzing its methylation signature in southern European populations and none examining its modulation by the Mediterranean diet at the epigenome-wide level. We examined blood methylation smoking signatures on the EPIC 850 K array in this population (n = 414 high cardiovascular risk subjects). Epigenome-wide methylation studies (EWASs) were performed analyzing differential methylation CpG sites by smoking status (never, former, and current smokers) and the modulation by adherence to a Mediterranean diet score was explored. Gene-set enrichment analysis was performed for biological and functional interpretation. The predictive value of the top differentially methylated CpGs was analyzed using receiver operative curves. We characterized the DNA methylation signature of smoking in this Mediterranean population by identifying 46 differentially methylated CpGs at the EWAS level in the whole population. The strongest association was observed at the cg21566642 (p= 2.2 × 10-32) in the 2q37.1 region. We also detected other CpGs that have been consistently reported in prior research and discovered some novel differentially methylated CpG sites in subgroup analyses. In addition, we found distinct methylation profiles based on the adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Particularly, we obtained a significant interaction between smoking and diet modulating the cg5575921 methylation in the AHRR gene. In conclusion, we have characterized biomarkers of the methylation signature of tobacco smoking in this population, and suggest that the Mediterranean diet can increase methylation of certain hypomethylated sites."
"36834053","Clinical Epigenomic Explanation of the Epidemiology of Cannabinoid Genotoxicity Manifesting as Transgenerational Teratogenesis, Cancerogenesis and Aging Acceleration.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","As global interest in the therapeutic potential of cannabis and its' derivatives for the management of selected diseases increases, it is increasingly imperative that the toxic profile of cannabinoids be thoroughly understood in order to correctly assess the balance between the therapeutic risks and benefits. Modern studies across a number of jurisdictions, including Canada, Australia, the US and Europe have confirmed that some of the most worrying and severe historical reports of both congenital anomalies and cancer induction following cannabis exposure actually underestimate the multisystem thousand megabase-scale transgenerational genetic damage. These findings from teratogenic and carcinogenic literature are supported by recent data showing the accelerated patterns of chronic disease and the advanced DNA methylation epigenomic clock age in cannabis exposed patients. Together, the increased multisystem carcinogenesis, teratogenesis and accelerated aging point strongly to cannabinoid-related genotoxicity being much more clinically significant than it is widely supposed and, thus, of very considerable public health and multigenerational impact. Recently reported longitudinal epigenome-wide association studies elegantly explain many of these observed effects with considerable methodological sophistication, including multiple pathways for the inhibition of the normal chromosomal segregation and DNA repair, the inhibition of the basic epigenetic machinery for DNA methylation and the demethylation and telomerase acceleration of the epigenomic promoter hypermethylation characterizing aging. For cancer, 810 hits were also noted. The types of malignancy which were observed have all been documented epidemiologically. Detailed epigenomic explications of the brain, heart, face, uronephrological, gastrointestinal and limb development were provided, which amply explained the observed teratological patterns, including the inhibition of the key morphogenic gradients. Hence, these major epigenomic insights constituted a powerful new series of arguments which advanced both our understanding of the downstream sequalae of multisystem multigenerational cannabinoid genotoxicity and also, since mechanisms are key to the causal argument, inveighed strongly in favor of the causal nature of the relationship. In this introductory conceptual overview, we present the various aspects of this novel synthetic paradigmatic framework. Such concepts suggest and, indeed, indicate numerous fields for further investigation and basic science research to advance the exploration of many important issues in biology, clinical medicine and population health.

(2) Methods: Here, we tested the relationship between the DNA methylation-based epigenetic biomarkers PhenoAge and GrimAge and methylation of the promoter region of the KL gene, the circulating level of KL, and the stage of physical fitness and grip force in two groups of volunteer subjects, trained (TRND) and sedentary (SED), aged between 37 and 85 years old. (3) Results: The circulating KL level is negatively associated with chronological age in the TRND group (r = -0.19;p= 0.0295) but not in the SED group (r = -0.065;p= 0.5925). The age-associated decrease in circulating KL is partly due to the increased methylation of the KL gene. In addition, higher plasma KL is significantly related to epigenetic age-deceleration in the TRND group, assessed by the biomarker of PhenoAge (r = -0.21;p= 0.0192). (4) Conclusions: The level of physical fitness, on the other hand, does not relate to circulating KL levels, nor to the rate of the methylation of the promoter region of the KL gene, only in males."
"36828869","A DNA methylation signature for the prediction of tumour recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer.","Br J Cancer","A major challenge in stage II colorectal carcinoma is to identify patients with increased risk of recurrence. Biomarkers that distinguish patients with poor prognosis from patients without recurrence are currently lacking. This study aims to develop a robust DNA methylation classifier that allows the prediction of recurrence and chemotherapy benefit in patients with stage II colorectal cancer. We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation capture sequencing in 243 stage II colorectal carcinoma samples and identified a relapse-specific DNA methylation signature consisting of eight CpG sites.Two hundred and forty-three patients with stage II CRC were enrolled in this study. In order to select differential methylation sites among recurrence and non-recurrence stage II CRC samples, DNA methylation profiles of 62 tumour samples including 31 recurrence and 31 nonrecurrence samples were analysed using the Agilent SureSelectXT Human Methyl-Seq, a comprehensive target enrichment system to analyse CpG methylation. Pyrosequencing was applied to quantify the methylation level of candidate DNA methylation sites in 243 patients. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was employed to build the disease recurrence prediction classifier.We identified a relapse-related DNA methylation signature consisting of eight CpG sites in stage II CRC by DNA methylation capture sequencing. The classifier showed significantly higher prognostic accuracy than any clinicopathological risk factors. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed an association of high-risk score with poor prognosis. In multivariate analysis, the signature was the most significant prognosis factor, with an HR of 2.80 (95% CI, 1.71-4.58, P < 0.001). The signature could identify patients who are suitable candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy.An eight-CpG DNA methylation signature is a reliable prognostic and predictive tool for disease recurrence in patients with stage II CRC.© 2023.

"36828588","The aberrant epigenome of DNMT3B-mutated ICF1 patient iPSCs is amenable to correction, with the exception of a subset of regions with H3K4me3- and/or CTCF-based epigenetic memory.","Genome Res","Bi-allelic hypomorphic mutations inDNMT3Bdisrupt DNA methyltransferase activity and lead to immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, facial anomalies syndrome, type 1 (ICF1). Although several ICF1 phenotypes have been linked to abnormally hypomethylated repetitive regions, the unique genomic regions responsible for the remaining disease phenotypes remain largely uncharacterized. Here we explored two ICF1 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their CRISPR-Cas9-corrected clones to determine whetherDNMT3Bcorrection can globally overcome DNA methylation defects and related changes in the epigenome. Hypomethylated regions throughout the genome are highly comparable between ICF1 iPSCs carrying differentDNMT3Bvariants, and significantly overlap with those in ICF1 patient peripheral blood and lymphoblastoid cell lines. These regions include large CpG island domains, as well as promoters and enhancers of several lineage-specific genes, in particular immune-related, suggesting that they are premarked during early development. CRISPR-corrected ICF1 iPSCs reveal that the majority of phenotype-related hypomethylated regions reacquire normal DNA methylation levels following editing. However, at the most severely hypomethylated regions in ICF1 iPSCs, which also display the highest increases in H3K4me3 levels and/or abnormal CTCF binding, the epigenetic memory persists, and hypomethylation remains uncorrected. Overall, we demonstrate that restoring the catalytic activity of DNMT3B can reverse the majority of the aberrant ICF1 epigenome. However, a small fraction of the genome is resilient to this rescue, highlighting the challenge of reverting disease states that are due to genome-wide epigenetic perturbations. Uncovering the basis for the persistent epigenetic memory will promote the development of strategies to overcome this obstacle.© 2023 Poondi Krishnan et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press."
"36824980","Tet-dependent 5-hydroxymethyl-Cytosine modification of mRNA regulates the axon guidance genes robo2 and slit in Drosophila.","Res Sq","Modifications of mRNA, especially methylation of adenosine, have recently drawn much attention. The much rarer modification, 5-hydroxymethylation of cytosine (5hmC), is not well understood and is the subject of this study. Vertebrate Tet proteins are 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylases enzymes catalyzing the transition of 5mC to 5hmC in DNA and have recently been shown to have the same function in messenger RNAs in both vertebrates and in Drosophila. TheTetgene is essential in Drosophila because Tet knock-out animals do not reach adulthood. We describe the identification of Tet-target genes in the embryo and larval brain by determining Tet DNA-binding sites throughout the genome and by mapping the Tet-dependent 5hmrC modifications transcriptome-wide. 5hmrC-modified sites can be found along the entire transcript and are preferentially located at the promoter where they overlap with histone H3K4me3 peaks. The identified mRNAs are frequently involved in neuron and axon development and Tet knock-out led to a reduction of 5hmrC marks on specific mRNAs. Among the Tet-target genes were therobo2receptor and itsslitligand that function in axon guidance in Drosophila and in vertebrates.Tetknock-out embryos show overlapping phenotypes withrobo2and are sensitized to reduced levels ofslit. Both Robo2 and Slit protein levels were markedly reduced in Tet KO larval brains. Our results establish a role for Tet-dependent 5hmrC in facilitating the translation of modified mRNAs, primarily in developing nerve cells."

Given the importance of the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventrical to cortical development, we compared molecular, cellular, and structural differences in the SVZ and linked cortical regions in specimens of ASD cases and sex and age-matched unaffected brain.We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tractography onex vivopostmortem brain samples, which we further analyzed by Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), Flow Cytometry, and RT qPCR.Through MRI, we observed decreased tractography pathways from the dorsal SVZ, increased pathways from the posterior ventral SVZ to the insular cortex, and variable cortical thickness within the insular cortex in ASD diagnosed case relative to unaffected controls. Long-range tractography pathways from and to the insula were also reduced in the ASD case. FACS-based cell sorting revealed an increased population of proliferating cells in the SVZ of ASD case relative to the unaffected control. Targeted qPCR assays of SVZ tissue demonstrated significantly reduced expression levels of genes involved in differentiation and migration of neurons in ASD relative to the control counterpart. Finally, using genome-wide DNA methylation analyses, we identified 19 genes relevant to neurological development, function, and disease, 7 of which have not previously been described in ASD, that were significantly differentially methylated in autistic SVZ and insula specimens.These findings suggest a hypothesis that epigenetic changes during neurodevelopment alter the trajectory of proliferation, migration, and differentiation in the SVZ, impacting cortical structure and function and resulting in ASD phenotypes.Copyright © 2023 Takahashi, Allan, Peres, Ortug, van der Kouwe, Valli, Ethier, Levman, Baumer, Tsujimura, Vargas-Maya, McCracken, Lee and Maunakea."

Epigenome-Wide Association Analysis (EWAS) of DNA methylation may identify markers that contribute to an individual's risk of adverse transplant outcomes, yet only a limited number of EWAS have been conducted in kidney transplant recipients. This EWAS aimed to interrogate the methylation profile of a kidney transplant recipient cohort with minimal posttransplant complications, exploring differences in samples pretransplant and posttransplant.We compared differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine sites (dmCpGs) in samples derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the same kidney transplant recipients, collected both pretransplant and posttransplant (N = 154), using the Infinium MethylationEPIC microarray (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Recipients received kidneys from deceased donors and had a mean of 17 years of follow-up.Five top-ranked dmCpGs were significantly different at false discovery rate (FDR) adjustedP ≤ 9 × 10-8; cg23597162 withinJAZF1, cg25187293 withinBTNL8, cg17944885, located betweenZNF788PandZNF625-ZNF20,cg14655917 located betweenASB4andPDK4and cg09839120 located betweenGIMAP6andEIF2AP3.Five dmCpGs were identified at the generally accepted EWAS critical significance level of FDR adjustedP(PFDRadj) ≤ 9 × 10-8, including cg23597162 (withinJAZF1) and cg17944885, which have prior associations with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Comparing individuals with no evidence of posttransplant complications (N = 105) demonstrated that 693,555 CpGs (89.57%) did not display any significant difference in methylation (PFDRadj ≥ 0.05), thereby this study establishes an important reference for future epigenetic studies that seek to identify markers of posttransplant complications.© 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of the International Society of Nephrology."

MBD genes are not only inseparable from DNA methylation but have also been identified and validated in various plants. Although MBD is involved in a group of physiological processes and stress regulation in these plants, MBD genes in Eleutherococcus senticosus remain largely unknown.Twenty EsMBD genes were identified in E. senticosus. Among the 24 chromosomes of E. senticosus, EsMBD genes were unevenly distributed on 12 chromosomes, and only one tandem repeat gene existed. Collinearity analysis showed that the fragment duplication was the main motif for EsMBD gene expansion. As the species of Araliaceae evolved, MBD genes also evolved and gradually exhibited different functional differentiation. Furthermore, cis-acting element analysis showed that there were numerous cis-acting elements in the EsMBD promoter region, among which light response elements and anaerobic induction elements were dominant. The expression motif analysis revealed that 60% of the EsMBDs were up-regulated in the 30% water content group.By comparing the transcriptome data of different saponin contents of E. senticosus and integrating them with the outcomes of molecular docking analysis, we hypothesized that EsMBD2 and EsMBD5 jointly affect the secondary metabolic processes of E. senticosus saponins by binding to methylated CpG under conditions of drought stress. The results of this study laid the foundation for subsequent research on the E. senticosus and MBD genes.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36813766","Accelerated epigenetic aging in women with emotionally unstable personality disorder and a history of suicide attempts.","Transl Psychiatry","Emotional unstable personality disorder (EUPD; previously borderline personality disorder, BPD) is associated with excess natural-cause mortality, comorbid medical conditions, poor health habits and stress related epigenomic alterations. Previous studies demonstrated that GrimAge - a state-of-the-art epigenetic age (EA) estimator - strongly predicts mortality risk and physiological dysregulation. Herein, we utilize the GrimAge algorithm to investigate whether women with EUPD and a history of recent suicide attempts exhibit EA acceleration (EAA) in comparison to healthy controls. Genome-wide methylation patterns were measured using the Illumina Infinum Methylation Epic BeadChip in whole blood from 97 EUPD patients and 32 healthy controls. The control group was significantly older (p < 0.0001) and reported lesser exposure to violent behavior in both youth and adulthood (p < 0.0001). Groups were otherwise comparable regarding gender, BMI, or tobacco usage (p > 0.05). EA estimator DNAmGrimAge exceeded chronological age by 8.8 and 2.3 years in the EUPD and control group, respectively. Similarly, EAA marker AgeAccelGrim was substantially higher in EUPD subjects when compared to controls, in both univariate and multivariate analyzes (p < 0.00001). Tobacco usage conferred substantial within-group effects on the EA-chronological age difference, i.e., 10.74 years (SD = 4.19) compared to 6.00 years (SD = 3.10) in the non-user EUPD group (p < 0.00001). Notably, past alcohol and substance abuse, use of psychotropic medications, global assessment of functioning, self-reported exposure to violent behavior in youth and adulthood, later completed suicide (N = 8) and age at first suicide attempt did not predict EAA in the EUPD group (p > 0.05). These results underscore the importance of addressing medical health conditions along with low-cost preventative interventions aimed at improving somatic health outcomes in EUPD, such as efforts to support cessation of tobacco use. The independency of GrimAge to other EA algorithms in this group of severely impaired EUPD patients, suggest it may have unique characteristics to evaluate risk of adverse health outcomes in context of psychiatric disorders.© 2023.

Sesquiterpenoids and 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromones are the major phytochemicals in agarwood and Cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are one of the important enzymes in the biosynthesis of these fragrant chemicals. Thus, understanding the repertoire of CYP superfamily in Aquilaria can not only give insights into the fundamentals of agarwood formation, but can also provide a tool for the overproduction of the aroma chemicals. Therefore, current study was designed to investigate CYPs of an agarwood producing plant, Aquilaria agallocha. We identified 136 CYP genes from A. agallocha genome (AaCYPs) and classified them into 8 clans and 38 families. The promoter regions had stress and hormone-related cis-regulatory elements which indicate their participation in the stress response. Duplication and synteny analysis revealed segmental and tandem duplicated and evolutionary related CYP members in other plants. Potential members involved in the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoids and phenylpropanoids were identified and found to be upregulated in methyl jasmonate-induced callus and infected Aquilaria trees by real-time quantitative PCR analyses. This study highlights the possible involvement of AaCYPs in agarwood resin development and their complex regulation during stress exposure.Copyright © 2023. Published by Elsevier B.V."

We quantified the impact of these DMRs on each gene and each protein as well as gene and protein co-expression networks. DNA methylation had a profound impact on both AD-associated gene/protein modules and their key regulators. We further integrated the matched multi-omics data to show the impact of DNA methylation on chromatin accessibility, which further modulates gene and protein expression.The quantified impact of DNA methylation on gene and protein networks underlying AD identified potential upstream epigenetic regulators of AD.A cohort of DNA methylation data in the parahippocampal gyrus was developed from 201 post mortem control, mild cognitive impaired, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Two hundred seventy distinct differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found to be associated with AD compared to normal control. A metric was developed to quantify methylation impact on each gene and each protein.

Persistent oncogenic Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection is the most common cause for cervical cancer. Here, we investigate HPV-induced host epigenome-wide changes prior to development of cytological abnormalities. Using cervical sample methylation array data from disease-free women with or without an oncogenic HPV infection, we develop the WID (Women's cancer risk identification)-HPV, a signature reflective of changes in the healthy host epigenome related to high-risk HPV strains (AUC=0.78, 95% CI: 0.72-0.85, in non-diseased women). Looking at HPV-associated changes across disease development, HPV-infected women with minor cytological alterations (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1/2, CIN1/2), but surprisingly not those with precancerous changes or invasive cervical cancer (CIN3+), show an increased WID-HPV index, indicating the WID-HPV may reflect a successful viral clearance response absent in progression to cancer. Further investigation revealed the WID-HPV is positively associated with apoptosis (ρ=0.48; p<0.001) and negatively associated with epigenetic replicative age (ρ=-0.43; p<0.001). Taken together, our data suggest the WID-HPV captures a clearance response associated with apoptosis of HPV-infected cells. This response may be dampened or lost with increased underlying replicative age of infected cells, resulting in progression to cancer. This article is protected by copyright.

To support the novel hypertension link, we used the Taiwan Puberty Longitudinal Study (TPLS) to investigate the influence of precocious puberty on childhood cardiometabolic traits.We discovered 27 novel loci, with an overlap between age at menarche and cardiometabolic traits, including body fat and blood pressure. Among the novel genes discovered, SEC16B, CSK, CYP1A1, FTO, and USB1 are within a protein interaction network with known cardiometabolic genes, including traits for obesity and hypertension. These loci were confirmed through demonstration of significant changes in the methylation or expression levels of neighboring genes. Moreover, the TPLS provided evidence regarding a twofold higher risk of early onset hypertension that occurred in girls with central precocious puberty.Our study highlights the usefulness of cross-trait analyses for identifying shared etiology between age at menarche and cardiometabolic traits, especially early onset hypertension.

Here, we show that m5C regulators including writers, readers and erasers, are predominantly upregulated in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) derived from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center and The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort. In addition, NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family member 2 (NSUN2) as a methyltransferase and Aly/REF export factor (ALYREF) as a nuclear m5C reader, are frequently coexpressed in UCB. By applying patient-derived organoids model and orthotopic xenograft mice model, we demonstrate that ALYREF enhances proliferation and invasion of UCB cells in an m5C-dependent manner. Integration of tanscriptome-wide RNA bisulphite sequencing (BisSeq), RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP)-seq analysis revealed that ALYREF specifically binds to hypermethylated m5C site in RAB, member RAS oncogene family like 6 (RABL6) and thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) mRNA via its K171 domain. ALYREF controls UCB malignancies through promoting hypermethylated RABL6 and TK1 mRNA for splicing and stabilization. Moreover, ALYREF recognizes hypermethylated m5C site of NSUN2, resulting in NSUN2 upregulation in UCB. Clinically, the patients with high coexpression of ALYREF/RABL6/TK1 axis had the poorest overall survival. Our study unveils an m5C dependent cross-regulation between nuclear reader ALYREF and m5C writer NSUN2 in activation of hypermethylated m5C oncogenic RNA through promoting splicing and maintaining stabilization, consequently leading to tumor progression, which provides profound insights into therapeutic strategy for UCB.© 2023.

Many studies have shown that m6A methylation plays key roles in sex determination, neuronal functions, and embryonic development in Drosophila and mammals. Here, we analyzed transcriptome-wide profile of m6A modification in the embryonic development of the destructive agricultural pest Spodoptera frugiperda. We found that the 2 key mRNA m6A methyltransferases SfrMETTL3 and SfrMETTL14 have high homologies with other insects and mammals, suggesting that SfrMETTL3 and SfrMETTL14 may have conserved function among different species. From methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis, we obtained 46 869 m6A peaks representing 8 587 transcripts in the 2-h embryos after oviposition, and 41 389 m6A peaks representing 9 230 transcripts in the 24-h embryos. In addition, 5 995 m6A peaks were differentially expressed including 3 752 upregulated and 2243 downregulated peaks. Functional analysis with Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes suggested that differentially expressed m6A peak-modified genes were enriched in cell and organ development between the 2- and 24-h embryos. By conjoint analysis of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation-seq and RNA-seq data, we found that RNA m6A methylation may regulate the transcriptional levels of genes related to tissue and organ development from 2- to 24-h embryos.
