"36719767","Epigenome-wide association study reveals CpG sites associated with thyroid function and regulatory effects on KLF9.","Thyroid","Thyroid hormones play a key role in differentiation and metabolism, and are known regulators of gene expression through both genomic and epigenetic processes including DNA methylation. The aim of this study was to examine associations between thyroid hormones and DNA methylation.We carried out a fixed-effect meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association study of blood DNA methylation sites from 8 cohorts from the ThyroidOmics Consortium, incorporating up to 7,073 participants of both European and African ancestry, implementing a discovery and replication stage. Statistical analyses were conducted using normalized beta CpG values as dependent and log-transformed thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels, respectively, as independent variable in a linear model. The replicated findings were correlated with gene expression levels in whole-blood, and tested for causal influence of TSH and free thyroxine by two-sample Mendelian randomization.Epigenome-wide significant associations (p-value < 1.1E-7) of 3 CpGs for free thyroxine, 5 for free triiodothyronine, and 2 for TSH concentrations were discovered and replicated (combined p-values = 1.5E-9 to 4.3E-28). The associations included CpG sites annotated to KLF9 (cg00049440) and DOT1L (cg04173586) that overlap with all three traits, consistent with hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis physiology. Significant associations were also found for CpGs in FKBP5 for free thyroxine, and at CSNK1D/LINCO1970 and LRRC8D for free triiodothyronine. Mendelian randomization analyses supported a causal effect of thyroid status on DNA methylation of KLF9. DNA methylation of cg00049440 in KLF9 was inversely correlated with KLF9 gene expression in blood. The CpG at CSNK1D/LINC01970 overlapped with thyroid hormone receptor alpha binding peaks in liver cells. The total additive heritability of the methylation levels of the six significant CpG sites was between 25% and 57%. Significant methylation QTLs were identified for CpGs at KLF9, FKBP5, LRRC8D and CSNK1D/LINC01970.We report novel associations between TSH, thyroid hormones and blood-based DNA methylation. This study advances our understanding of thyroid hormone action particularly related to KLF9, and serves as a proof-of-concept that integrations of EWAS with other -omics data can provide a valuable tool for unravelling thyroid hormone signaling in humans by complementing and feeding classical in-vitro and animal studies."
"36718948","Spatiotemporal regulation of maternal mRNAs during vertebrate oocyte meiotic maturation.","Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc","Vertebrate oocytes face a particular challenge concerning the regulation of gene expression during meiotic maturation. Global transcription becomes quiescent in fully grown oocytes, remains halted throughout maturation and fertilization, and only resumes upon embryonic genome activation. Hence, the oocyte meiotic maturation process is largely regulated by protein synthesis from pre-existing maternal messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that are transcribed and stored during oocyte growth. Rapidly developing genome-wide techniques have greatly expanded our insights into the global translation changes and possible regulatory mechanisms during oocyte maturation. The storage, translation, and processing of maternal mRNAs are thought to be regulated by factors interacting with elements in the mRNA molecules. Additionally, posttranscriptional modifications of mRNAs, such as methylation and uridylation, have recently been demonstrated to play crucial roles in maternal mRNA destabilization. However, a comprehensive understanding of the machineries that regulate maternal mRNA fate during oocyte maturation is still lacking. In particular, how the transcripts of important cell cycle components are stabilized, recruited at the appropriate time for translation, and eliminated to modulate oocyte meiotic progression remains unclear. A better understanding of these mechanisms will provide invaluable insights for the preconditions of developmental competence acquisition, with important implications for the treatment of infertility. This review discusses how the storage, localization, translation, and processing of oocyte mRNAs are regulated, and how these contribute to oocyte maturation progression.© 2023 Cambridge Philosophical Society."
"36717836","Multi-omics analyses of CD276 in pan-cancer reveals its clinical prognostic value in glioblastoma and other major cancer types.","BMC Cancer","CD276 (also known as B7-H3) is one of the most important immune checkpoints of the CD28 and B7 superfamily, and its abnormal expression is closely associated with various types of cancer. It has been shown that CD276 is able to inhibit the function of T cells, and that this gene may potentially be a promising immunotherapy target for different types of cancer.Since few systematic studies have been published on the role of CD276 in cancer to date, the present study has employed single-cell sequencing and bioinformatics methods to analyze the expression patterns, clinical significance, prognostic value, epigenetic alterations, DNA methylation level, tumor immune cell infiltration and immune functions of CD276 in different types of cancer. In order to analyze the potential underlying mechanism of CD276 in glioblastoma (GBM) to assess its prognostic value, the LinkedOmics database was used to explore the biological function and co-expression pattern of CD276 in GBM, and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed. In addition, a simple validation of the above analyses was performed using reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR assay.The results revealed that CD276 was highly expressed, and was often associated with poorer survival and prognosis, in the majority of different types of cancer. In addition, CD276 expression was found to be closely associated with T cell infiltration, immune checkpoint genes and immunoregulatory interactions between lymphoid and a non-lymphoid cell. It was also shown that the CD276 expression network exerts a wide influence on the immune activation of GBM. The expression of CD276 was found to be positively correlated with neutrophil-mediated immunity, although it was negatively correlated with the level of neurotransmitters, neurotransmitter transport and the regulation of neuropeptide signaling pathways in GBM. It is noteworthy that CD276 expression was found to be significantly higher in GBM compared with normal controls according to the RT-qPCR analysis, and the co-expression network, biological function and chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity of CD276 in GBM were further explored. In conclusion, the findings of the present study have revealed that CD276 is strongly expressed and associated with poor prognosis in most types of cancer, including GBM, and its expression is strongly associated with T-cell infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, and immunomodulatory interactions between lymphocytes and non-lymphoid cells.Taken together, based on our systematic analysis, our findings have revealed important roles for CD276 in different types of cancers, especially GBM, and CD276 may potentially serve as a biomarker for cancer.© 2023.

"36716967","DNA methylation analysis identifies novel genetic loci associated with circulating fibrinogen levels in blood.","J Thromb Haemost","Fibrinogen plays an essential role in blood coagulation and inflammation. Circulating fibrinogen levels may be determined by inter-individual differences in DNA methylation at CpG sites, and vice versa.We performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of circulating fibrinogen levels in 18,037 White, Black, American Indian, and Hispanic participants representing 14 studies from the CHARGE consortium. Circulating leukocyte DNA methylation was measured in 12,904 participants using the Illumina 450K array, and in 5,133 participants using the EPIC array. Each study performed an EWAS of fibrinogen using linear mixed models adjusted for potential confounders. Study-specific results were combined using array-specific meta-analysis, followed by cross-replication of epigenome-wide significant associations. We compared models with and without C-reactive protein (CRP) adjustment to examine the role of inflammation.We identified 208 and 87 significant CpG sites associated with fibrinogen from the 450K (p-value<1.03×10-7) and EPIC arrays (p-value<5.78×10-8), respectively. There were 78 associations from the 450K array that replicated in the EPIC array and 26 vice versa. After accounting for the overlapping sites, there were 83 replicated CpG sites located in 61 loci, of which only 4 have been previously reported for fibrinogen. Examples of genes located near these CpG sites were SOCS3 and AIM2, which are involved in inflammatory pathways. The associations for all 83 replicated CpG sites were attenuated after CRP adjustment, although many remained significant.We identified 83 CpG sites associated with circulating fibrinogen levels. These associations are partially driven by inflammatory pathways shared by both fibrinogen and CRP.Copyright © 2023 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. All rights reserved."
"36715159","Accelerated epigenetic aging and DNA methylation alterations in Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy.","Hum Mol Genet","Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy type 2 (CGL2) is a very rare human genetic disorder with potential significance to the understanding of the pathobiology of aging. CGL2 patients display characteristic progeroid features and suffer from type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and fatty liver. In this study, we profiled genome-wide DNA methylation levels in CGL2 patients with BSCL2 mutations to study epigenetic age acceleration and DNA methylation alterations. This analysis revealed significant age acceleration in blood DNA of CGL2 patients using both first and second generation epigenetic clocks. We also observed a shortened lifespan of C. elegans following knockdown of the BSCL2 homolog seip-1 on a daf-16/Foxo mutant background. DNA methylation analysis revealed significant differentially methylated sites enriched for lyase activity, kinase regulator activity, protein kinase regulator activity, and kinase activator activity. We could also observe significant hypomethylation in the promoter of the Dual Specificity Phosphatase 22 (DUSP22) gene when comparing CGL2 patients vs controls. We conclude that in line with the observed progeroid features, CGL2 patients exhibit significant epigenetic age acceleration and DNA methylation alterations that might affect pathways/genes of potential relevance to the disease.© The Author(s) 2023.

Transplantation of testosterone-producing cells is a promising treatment for male hypogonadism. However, getting a cell source with the characteristics of Leydig cells (LCs) is still a challenge. Here, a high-efficiency reprogramming of skin-derived fibroblasts into functional Leydig-like cells (LLCs) based on epigenetic mechanism was described. By performing an integrated analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome profiling in LCs and fibroblasts, the potentially epigenetic-regulating steroidogenic genes and signaling pathways were identified. Then by using CRISPR/dCas9 activation system and signaling pathway regulators, the male- or female-derived fibroblasts were reprogrammed into LLCs with main LC-specific traits. Transcriptomic analysis further indicated that the correlation coefficients of global genes and transcription factors between LLCs and LCs were higher than 0.81 and 0.96, respectively. After transplantation in the testes of hypogonadal rodent models, LLCs increased serum testosterone concentration significantly. In type 2 diabetic rats model, LLCs which were transplanted in armpit, have the capability to restore the serum testosterone level and improve the hyperglycemia status. In conclusion, our approach enables skin-derived fibroblasts reprogramming into LLCs with high fidelity, providing a potential cell source for the therapeutics of male hypogonadism and metabolic-related comorbidities.© The Author(s) 2022.

"36714706","Genome-wide analysis of epigenetic and transcriptional changes in the pathogenesis of RGSV in rice.","Front Plant Sci","Rice grassy stunt virus (RGSV), a typical negative single-stranded RNA virus, invades rice and generates several disease signs, including dwarfing, tillering, and sterility. Previous research has revealed that RGSV-encoded proteins can force the host's ubiquitin-proteasome system to utilize them for viral pathogenesis. However, most of the studies were limited to a single omics level and lacked multidimensional data collection and correlation analysis on the mechanisms of RGSV-rice interactions. Here, we performed a comprehensive association analysis of genome-wide methylation sequencing, transcriptome sequencing, and histone H3K9me3 modification in RGSV-infested as well as non-infested rice leaves, and the levels of all three cytosine contexts (CG, CHG and CHH) were found to be slightly lower in RGSV-infected rice leaves than in normal rice. Large proportions of DMRs were distributed in the promoter and intergenic regions, and most DMRs were enriched in the CHH context, where the number of CHH hypo-DMRs was almost twice as high as that of hyper-DMRs. Among the genes with down-regulated expression and hypermethylation, we analyzed and identified 11 transcripts involved in fertility, plant height and tillering, and among the transcribed up-regulated and hypermethylated genes, we excavated 7 transcripts related to fertility, plant height and tillering. By analyzing the changes of histone H3K9me3 modification before and after virus infestation, we found that the distribution of H3K9me3 modification in the whole rice genome was prevalent, mainly concentrated in the gene promoter and gene body regions, which was distinctly different from the characteristics of animals. Combined with transcriptomic data, H3K9me3 mark was found to favor targeting highly expressed genes. After RGSV infection, H3K9me3 modifications in several regions of CTK and BR hormone signaling-related genes were altered, providing important targets for subsequent studies.Copyright © 2023 Wu, Liu, Lian, Jiang, Chen, Tang, Ding, Hu, Zhao, Zhang and Wu."
"36714033","Computer analysis of regulation of hepatocarcinoma marker genes hypermethylated by HCV proteins.","Vavilovskii Zhurnal Genet Selektsii","Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a risk factor that leads to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Epigenetic changes are known to play an important role in the molecular genetic mechanisms of virus-induced oncogenesis. Aberrant DNA methylation is a mediator of epigenetic changes that are closely associated with the HCC pathogenesis and considered a biomarker for its early diagnosis. The ANDSystem software package was used to reconstruct and evaluate the statistical significance of the pathways HCV could potentially use to regulate 32 hypermethylated genes in HCC, including both oncosuppressor and protumorigenic ones identified by genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation. The reconstructed pathways included those affecting protein-protein interactions (PPI), gene expression, protein activity, stability, and transport regulations, the expression regulation pathways being statistically significant. It has been shown that 8 out of 10 HCV proteins were involved in these pathways, the HCV NS3 protein being implicated in the largest number of regulatory pathways. NS3 was associated with the regulation of 5 tumor-suppressor genes, which may be the evidence of its central role in HCC pathogenesis. Analysis of the reconstructed pathways has demonstrated that following the transcription factor inhibition caused by binding to viral proteins, the expression of a number of oncosuppressors (WT1, MGMT, SOCS1, P53) was suppressed, while the expression of others (RASF1, RUNX3, WIF1, DAPK1) was activated. Thus, the performed gene-network reconstruction has shown that HCV proteins can influence not only the methylation status of oncosuppressor genes, but also their transcriptional regulation. The results obtained can be used in the search for pharmacological targets to develop new drugs against HCV-induced HCC.Copyright © AUTHORS."
"36712964","Associations between epigenetic aging and childhood peer victimization, depression, and suicidal ideation in adolescence and adulthood: A study of two population-based samples.","Front Cell Dev Biol","Background:Prior studies indicate that peer victimization (including bullying) is associated with higher risk for depression and suicidal ideation across the life course. However, molecular mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. This two-cohort study proposes to test whether epigenetic aging and pace of aging, as well as a DNA methylation marker of responsive to glucocorticoids, are associated to childhood peer victimization and later depressive symptoms, or suicidal ideation.Methods:Cohort 1: Epigenome-wide DNA methylation (EPIC array) was measured in saliva collected when participants were 10.47 years (standard deviation = 0.35) in a subsample of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD,n= 149 participants), with self-reported peer victimization at 6-8 years, depressive symptoms (mean symptoms, and dichotomized top 30% symptoms) and suicidal ideation at 15-17 years. Cohort 2: Epigenome-wide DNA methylation (EPIC array) was measured in blood collected from participants aged 45.13 years (standard deviation = 0.37) in a subsample of the 1958 British Birth cohort (1958BBC,n= 238 participants) with information on mother-reported peer victimization at 7-11 years, self-reported depressive symptoms at 50 years, and suicidal ideation at 45 years. Five epigenetic indices were derived: three indicators of epigenetic aging [Horvath's pan-tissue (Horvath1), Horvath's Skin-and-Blood (Horvath2), Pediatric-Buccal-Epigenetic age (PedBE)], pace of aging (DunedinPACE), and stress response reactivity (Epistress).Results:Peer victimization was not associated with the epigenetic indices in either cohort. In the QLSCD, higher PedBE epigenetic aging and a slower pace of aging as measured by DunedinPACE predicted higher depressive symptoms scores. In contrast, neither the Horvath1, or Horvath2 epigenetic age estimates, nor the Epistress score were associated with depressive symptoms in either cohort, and none of the epigenetic indices predicted suicidal ideation.Conclusion:The findings are consistent with epigenome-wide and candidate gene studies suggesting that these epigenetic indices did not relate to peer victimization, challenging the hypothesis that cumulative epigenetic aging indices could translate vulnerability to depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation following peer victimization. Since some indices of epigenetic aging and pace of aging signaled higher risk for depressive symptoms, future studies should pursue this investigation to further evaluate the robustness and generalization of these preliminary findings.Copyright © 2023 Perret, Geoffroy, Barr, Parnet, Provencal, Boivin, O’Donnell, Suderman, Power, Turecki and Ouellet-Morin."
"36712935","2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin induces multigenerational alterations in the expression of microRNA in the thymus through epigenetic modifications.","PNAS Nexus","2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a potent AhR ligand, is an environmental contaminant that is known for mediating toxicity across generations. However, whether TCDD can induce multigenerational changes in the expression of microRNAs (miRs) has not been previously studied. In the current study, we investigated the effect of administration of TCDD in pregnant mice (F0) on gestational day 14, on the expression of miRs in the thymus of F0 and subsequent generations (F1 and F2). Of the 3200 miRs screened, 160 miRs were dysregulated similarly in F0, F1, and F2 generations, while 46 miRs were differentially altered in F0 to F2 generations. Pathway analysis revealed that the changes in miR signature profile mediated by TCDD affected the genes that regulate cell signaling, apoptosis, thymic atrophy, cancer, immunosuppression, and other physiological pathways. A significant number of miRs that showed altered expression exhibited dioxin response elements (DRE) on their promoters. Focusing on one such miR, namely miR-203 that expressed DREs and was induced across F0 to F2 by TCDD, promoter analysis showed that one of the DREs expressed by miR-203 was functional to TCDD-mediated upregulation. Also, the histone methylation status of H3K4me3 in the miR-203 promoter was significantly increased near the transcriptional start site in TCDD-treated thymocytes across F0 to F2 generations. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing study suggested that TCDD may cause alterations in histone methylation in certain genes across the three generations. Together, the current study demonstrates that gestational exposure to TCDD can alter the expression of miRs in F0 through direct activation of DREs as well as across F0, F1, and F2 generations through epigenetic pathways.© The Author(s) 2022.

We aimed to explore the resilience-associated DNA methylation signatures and evaluate the abilities of methylation risk scores to discriminate low resilience (LR) individuals. The study recruited 78 young adults and used Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) to divide them into low and high resilience groups. We randomly allocated all participants of two groups to the discovery and validation sets. We used the blood DNA of the subjects to conduct a genome-wide methylation scan and identify the significant methylation differences of CpG Sites in the discovery set. Moreover, the classification accuracy of the DNA methylation probes was confirmed in the validation set by real-time quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. In the genome-wide methylation profiling between LR and HR individuals, seventeen significantly differentially methylated probes were detected. In the validation set, nine DNA methylation signatures within gene coding regions were selected for verification. Finally, three methylation probes [cg18565204 (AARS), cg17682313 (FBXW7), and cg07167608 (LINC01107)] were included in the final model of the methylation risk score for LR versus HR. These methylation risk score models of low resilience demonstrated satisfactory discrimination by logistic regression and support vector machine, with an AUC of 0.81 and 0.93, accuracy of 72.3% and 87.1%, sensitivity of 75%, and 87.5%, and specificity of 70% and 80%. Our findings suggest that methylation signatures can be utilized to identify individuals with LR and establish risk score models that may contribute to the field of psychology.Copyright © 2023 Lu, Hsieh, Yang, Wang and Lin."

We aimed to observe the direction of each DMEG in CLL based on the DMPs in the promoter and the body region respectively to narrow down DMEGs. We also aimed to explore the methylation heterogeneity of CLL subgroups and the effect of B cells maturation on CLL.Methods:In this population-based case control study, we reported a genome-wide DNA methylation association study using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, profiling the DNA methylation of CD19+B Cells from 48 CLL cases and 28 healthy controls. By integrating methylation data and expression data from public databases, gene sets were jointly screened, and then the relationship between methylation sites in promoter and body region and expression of each gene was explored. In addition, support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm was used to identify subgroups of CLL cases based on methylation pattern, and the effect of B-cell differentiation related methylation sites on CLL-related sites was observed.Results:We identified 34,797 DMPs related to CLL across the genome, most of which were hypomethylated; the majority were located in gene body regions. By combining these DMPs with published DNA methylation and RNA sequencing data, we detected 26,244 replicated DMPs associated with 1,130 genes whose expression were significantly different in CLL cases. Among these DMEGs, nine low expressed DMEGs were selected with hypermethylated in promoter and hypomethylated in body region, and 83 high expressed DMEGs were selected with both hypomethylated in promoter and body region. The 48 CLL cases were divided into 3 subgroups based on methylation site by SVM algorithm. Over 92% of CpGs associated with B cell subtypes were found in CLL-related DMPs.Conclusion:The DNA methylation pattern was altered across the genome in CLL patients. The methylation ofZAP70,FMOD, andADAMTS17was significantly different between CLL cases and controls. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings and identify the underlying mechanisms through which these methylation markers are associated with CLL.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Gao, Lin, Goldin, Wang, Stevenson, Edelman, Killian, Marti, Meltzer, Xiang and Caporaso."

The genetic underpinnings of resistance are still only partially understood, with much of the variance in resistance phenotype left unexplained. We performed a multi-country large scale genome-wide association study of resistance to two insecticides widely used in malaria control: deltamethrin and pirimiphos-methyl. Using a bioassay methodology designed to maximise the phenotypic difference between resistant and susceptible samples, we sequenced 969 phenotyped femaleAn. gambiaeandAn. coluzziifrom ten locations across four countries in West Africa (Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Togo), identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) segregating in the populations. The patterns of resistance association were highly multiallelic and variable between populations, with different genomic regions contributing to resistance, as well as different mutations within a given region. While the strongest and most consistent association with deltamethrin resistance came from the region aroundCyp6aa1, this resistance was based on a combination of several independent CNVs inAn. coluzzii, and on a non-CNV bearing haplotype inAn. gambiae. Further signals involved a range of cytochrome P450, mitochondrial, and immunity genes. Similarly, for pirimiphos-methyl, while the strongest signal came from the region ofAce1, more widespread signals included cytochrome P450s, glutathione S-transferases, and a subunit of thenAChRtarget site of neonicotinoid insecticides. The regions aroundCyp9k1and theTepfamily of immune genes were associated with resistance to both insecticide classes, suggesting possible cross-resistance mechanisms. These locally-varying, multigenic and multiallelic patterns highlight the challenges involved in genomic monitoring and surveillance of resistance, and form the basis for improvement of methods used to detect and predict resistance. Based on simulations of resistance variants, we recommend that yet larger scale studies, exceeding 500 phenotyped samples per population, are required to better identify associated genomic regions."

The much rarer modification, 5-hydroxymethylation of cytosine (5hmC), is not well understood and is the subject of this study. Vertebrate Tet proteins are 5-methylcytosine (5mC) hydroxylases enzymes catalyzing the transition of 5mC to 5hmC in DNA and have recently been shown to have the same function in messenger RNAs in both vertebrates and in Drosophila. TheTetgene is essential in Drosophila because Tet knock-out animals do not reach adulthood. We describe the identification of Tet-target genes in the embryo and larval brain by determining Tet DNA-binding sites throughout the genome and by mapping the Tet-dependent 5hmrC modifications transcriptome-wide. 5hmrC-modified sites can be found along the entire transcript and are preferentially located at the promoter where they overlap with histone H3K4me3 peaks. The identified mRNAs are frequently involved in neuron and axon development and Tet knock-out led to a reduction of 5hmrC marks on specific mRNAs. Among the Tet-target genes were therobo2receptor and itsslitligand that function in axon guidance in Drosophila and in vertebrates.Tetknock-out embryos show overlapping phenotypes withrobo2and are sensitized to reduced levels ofslit. Both Robo2 and Slit protein levels were markedly reduced in Tet KO larval brains. Our results establish a role for Tet-dependent 5hmrC in facilitating the translation of modified mRNAs, primarily in developing nerve cells."

Compared to existing methods, EpiMix showed higher sensitivity in detecting abnormal DNAme that was present in only small patient subsets. We extended the model-based analyses of EpiMix to cis-regulatory elements within protein-coding genes, distal enhancers, and genes encoding microRNAs and lncRNAs.

"36711749","Phenome-wide analysis identifies parent-of-origin effects on the human methylome associated with changes in the rate of aging.","bioRxiv","Variation in the rate at which humans age may be rooted in early life events acting through genomic regions that are influenced by such events and subsequently are related to health phenotypes in later life. The parent-of-origin-effect (POE)-regulated methylome includes regions either enriched for genetically controlled imprinting effects (the typical type of POE) or atypical POE introduced by environmental effects associated with parents. This part of the methylome is heavily influenced by early life events, making it a potential route connecting early environmental exposures, the epigenome and the rate of aging. Here, we aim to test the association of POE-influenced methylation of CpG dinucleotides (POE-CpG sites) with early and later environmental exposures and subsequently with health-related phenotypes and adult aging phenotypes. We do this by performing phenome-wide association analyses of the POE-influenced methylome using a large family-based population cohort (GS:SFHS, Ndiscovery=5,087, Nreplication=4,450). At the single CpG level, 92 associations of POE-CpGs with phenotypic variation were identified and replicated. Most of the associations were contributed by POE-CpGs belonging to the atypical class and the most strongly enriched associations were with aging (DNAmTL acceleration), intelligence and parental (maternal) smoking exposure phenotypes. We further found that a proportion of the atypical-POE-CpGs formed co-methylation networks (modules) which are associated with these phenotypes, with one of the aging-associated modules displaying increased internal module connectivity (strength of methylation correlation across constituent CpGs) with age. Atypical POE-CpGs also displayed high levels of methylation heterogeneity and epigenetic drift (i.e. information loss with age) and a strong correlation with CpGs contained within epigenetic clocks. These results identified associations between the atypical-POE-influenced methylome and aging and provided new evidence for the ""early development of origin"" hypothesis for aging in humans."

In this study, we examined the impact of vitamin D3and its receptor (VDR) on the NMD-ROS-EMT signaling axis in osteosarcoma cells and spheroids, as well as wound-induced cell migration and osteosarcoma metastasisin vivomodels. Activated VDR signaling enriched the EMT pathway in gene set enrichment analysis, whereas the active vitamin D3metabolite, 1,25(OH)2D, inhibited EMT in osteosarcoma subtypes. Because EMT processes in cancer and tissue wounds are similar, experimentally induced EMT of mouse hair follicle stem cells revealed thatVdrsignaling restricts cell migration during cutaneous wound healing. In osteosarcoma cells, ligand bound VDR inhibited EMT by interacting directly with and downregulating the EMT inducerSNAI2. Differential epigenetic regulation ofSNAI2andVDRdistinguished highly metastatic from low metastatic osteosarcoma subtypes and responsiveness to 1,25(OH)2D. Furthermore, epigenome-wide motif and putative target gene analysis revealed the integration of the VDR with the NMD tumor immunogenic pathway. In an autoregulatory manner, 1,25(OH)2D inhibited NMD machinery genes, while simultaneously inducing the overexpression of known NMD target genes involved in tumor immune recognition and cell-to-cell adhesion. Dicer substrate siRNA knockdown ofSNAI2revealed superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)-mediated antioxidative responses and 1,25(OH)2D sensitization, which involves the non-canonical SOD2 nuclear-to-mitochondrial translocalization and inhibition of ROS. Calcipotriol, a clinically relevant non-calcemic vitamin D3derivative, inhibited osteosarcoma metastasis in a mouse xenograft model.

In vivo testing indicated that BIOIO-1001 reduced high fat, high sugar diet-induced metabolic derangements, inflammation, and fibrosis, each being characteristic of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). An unbiased screen of patient datasets suggested a potential link between the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of BIOIO-1001 in NASH models to those in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Directed experiments subsequently determined that BIOIO-1001 was protective in both sporadic and familial ALS models. Both NASH and ALS have no treatments and suffer from a lack of convenient biomarkers to monitor therapeutic efficacy. A potential strength in considering BIOIO-1001 as a therapy is that the blood biomarker that it modulates, namely plasma triglycerides, can be conveniently used to screen patients for responders. More conceptually, to our knowledge BIOIO-1001 is a first therapy that fits the geroscience hypothesis by acting on multiple core aging pathways and that can alleviate multiple conditions after they have set in.These studies characterize a novel gerotherapy, BIOIO-1001, that identifies lipid metabolism as an intersection of the mTOR and NAD+ pathways."

However, studies on the characteristics and functions of cotton FLZ family genes are still lacking. This study systematically identified members of the cotton FLZ gene family based on cotton genome data. The cotton FLZ family genes were systematically analyzed by bioinformatics, and their expression patterns in different tissues and under low-temperature stress were analyzed by transcriptome and qRT-PCR. TheG. hirsutumgenome contains 56 FLZ genes distributed on 20 chromosomes, and most of them are located in the nucleus. According to the number and evolution analysis of FLZ family genes, FLZ family genes can be divided into five subgroups in cotton. TheG. hirsutumFLZ gene has a wide range of tissue expression types, among which the expression is generally higher in roots, stems, leaves, receptacles and calyx. Through promoter analysis, it was found that it contained the most cis-acting elements related to methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Combined with the promoter and qRT-PCR results, it was speculated thatGhFLZ11, GhFLZ25, GhFLZ44andGhFLZ55were involved in the response of cotton to low-temperature stress. Taken together, our findings suggest an important role for the FLZ gene family in the cotton response to cold stress. This study provides an important theoretical basis for further research on the function of the FLZ gene family and the molecular mechanism of the cotton response to low temperature.© 2023 Wang et al."
"36710687","DNA Methylation Signature of Aging: Potential Impact on the Pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease.","J Parkinsons Dis","Regulation of gene expression by epigenetic modifications means lasting and heritable changes in the function of genes without alterations in the DNA sequence. Of all epigenetic mechanisms identified thus far, DNA methylation has been of particular interest in both aging and age-related disease research over the last decade given the consistency of site-specific DNA methylation changes during aging that can predict future health and lifespan. An increasing line of evidence has implied the dynamic nature of DNA (de)methylation events that occur throughout the lifespan has a role in the pathophysiology of aging and age-associated neurodegenerative conditions, including Parkinson's disease (PD). In this regard, PD methylome shows, to some extent, similar genome-wide changes observed in the methylome of healthy individuals of matching age. In this review, we start by providing a brief overview of studies outlining global patterns of DNA methylation, then its mechanisms and regulation, within the context of aging and PD. Considering diverging lines of evidence from different experimental and animal models of neurodegeneration and how they combine to shape our current understanding of tissue-specific changes in DNA methylome in health and disease, we report a high-level comparison of the genomic methylation landscapes of brain, with an emphasis on dopaminergic neurons in PD and in natural aging. We believe this will be particularly useful for systematically dissecting overlapping genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation during PD and healthy aging, and for improving our knowledge of PD-specific changes in methylation patterns independent of aging process."

This study aimed to assess the associations of urinary Se (SeU) with blood lipids and explore the potential mediating DNA methylation sites. We included 2844 non-smoke participants from the second follow-up (2017-2018) of the Wuhan-Zhuhai cohort (WHZH) in this study. SeU and blood lipids [i.e., total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL)] for all participants were determined. The associations of SeU with blood lipids were analyzed by generalized linear models. Then, we conducted the blood lipids related epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) among 221 never smokers, and the mediation analysis was conducted to explore the potential mediating cytosine-phosphoguanine (CpG) sites in the above associations. In this study, the SeU concentration of the participants in this study was 1.40 (0.94, 2.08) μg/mmol Cr. The SeU was positively associated with TC and LDL, and not associated with TG and HDL. We found 131, 3, and 1 new CpG sites related to TC, HDL, and LDL, respectively. Mediation analyses found that the methylation of cg06964030 (within MIR1306) and cg15824094 (within PLCH2) significantly mediated the positive association between SeU and TC. In conclusion, high levels of Se exposure were associated with increased TC and LDL among non-smokers, and the methylation of MIR1306 and PLCH2 partly mediated Se-associated TC increase. These findings provide new insights into the effects and mechanisms of Se exposure on lipids metabolism and highlight the importance of controlling Se exposure and intake for preventing high blood lipids.Copyright © 2023.

We therefore conducted a genome-wide search for heritable methylation marks associated with prostate cancer risk. Peripheral blood DNA methylation was measured for 133 of the 469 members of 25 multiple-case prostate cancer families, using the EPIC array. We used these families to systematically search the genome for methylation marks with Mendelian patterns of inheritance, then we tested the 1,000 most heritable marks for association with prostate cancer risk. After correcting for multiple testing, 41 heritable methylation marks were associated with prostate cancer risk. Separate analyses, based on 869 incident cases and 869 controls from a prospective cohort study, showed that 9 of these marks near the metastable epiallele VTRNA2-1 were also nominally associated with aggressive prostate cancer risk in the population.© 2023.

Post-transcriptional RNA modifications are important epigenetic mechanism that regulate gene expression at the genome-wide level. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent modification that occurs in the messenger RNAs (mRNA) of most eukaryotes, which is installed by methyltransferases called ""writers"", removed by demethylases called ""erasers"", and recognised by RNA-binding proteins called ""readers"". To date, m6A is emerging to play essential part in both physiological processes and pathological progression, including skin diseases. However, a systematic summary of m6A in skin disease has not yet been reported. This review starts by illustrating each m6A-related modifier specifically and their roles in RNA processing, and then focus on the existing research advances of m6A in immune homeostasis and skin diseases."

Although different microarray based EWAS studies have been conducted, the impact of epigenetic regulation in asthma development is still widely unknown. We have therefore applied unbiased whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to characterize global DNA-methylation profiles of asthmatic children compared to healthy controls.Peripheral blood samples of 40 asthmatic and 42 control children aged 5-15 years from three birth cohorts were sequenced together with paired cord blood samples. Identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were categorized in genotype-associated, cell-type-dependent, or prenatally-primed. Network analysis and subsequent natural language processing of DMR-associated genes was complemented by targeted analysis of functional translation of epigenetic regulation on the transcriptional and protein level.In total, 158 DMRs were identified in asthmatic children compared to controls of which 37% were related to the eosinophil content. A global hypomethylation was identified affecting predominantly enhancer regions and regulating key immune genes such as IL4, IL5RA, and EPX. These DMRs were confirmed in n=267 samples and could be linked to aberrant gene expression. Out of the 158 DMRs identified in the established phenotype, 56 were perturbed already at birth and linked, at least in part, to prenatal influences such as tobacco smoke exposure or phthalate exposure.This is the first epigenetic study based on whole genome sequencing to identify marked dysregulation of enhancer regions as a hallmark of childhood asthma.This article is protected by copyright.

However, there has been minimal research about the effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment on thebHLHgene family inLycoris radiata(L'Her.) Herb. In this study, based on transcriptome sequencing data, 50 putativeL. radiata bHLH (LrbHLH)genes with complete open reading frames (ORFs), which were divided into 20 bHLH subfamilies, were identified. The protein motif analyses showed that a total of 10 conserved motifs were found in LrbHLH proteins and motif 1 and motif 2 were the most highly conserved motifs. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis ofLrbHLHgenes revealed their involvement in regulation of plant growth, jasmonic acid (JA) mediated signaling pathway, photoperiodism, and flowering. Furthermore, subcellular localization revealed that most LrbHLHs were located in the nucleus. Expression pattern analysis ofLrbHLHgenes in different tissues and at flower developmental stages suggested that their expression differed across lineages and might be important for plant growth and organ development inLycoris. In addition, allLrbHLHgenes exhibited specific spatial and temporal expression patterns under MeJA treatment. Moreover, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and yeast two-hybrid assay showed that numerous LrbHLHs could interact with jasmonate ZIM (zinc-finger inflorescence meristem) domain (JAZ) proteins.

"36702107","Epigenetic mechanisms governing female and male germline development in mammals.","Sex Dev","Background DNA methylation (DNAme) and histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) play an integral role in the transcriptional regulation of specific sets of genes and retrotransposons. In turn, these chromatin marks are essential for cellular reprogramming, including during germline development. While DNAme is stably propagated in most somatic tissues, this epigenetic mark undergoes cycles of widespread erasure and re-establishment in the early embryo as well as in the germline. Summary De novo DNAme occurs at distinct developmental stages in male and female germ cells; before birth in prospermatogonia (PSG) and after birth in growing oocytes. Furthermore, while only ~40% of the mouse genome is methylated in mature oocytes, ~80% of the genome is methylated in mature sperm. Here, we review recent epigenome studies which reveal a complex interplay between histone PTMs and de novo DNAme in shaping the sexually dimorphic profiles of DNAme observed in mature gametes in the mouse, including in intergenic regions as well as at imprinted gametic differentially methylated regions (gDMRs). We discuss the dynamics and distribution of key histone PTMs in male and female germ cells, including H3K36me2/me3, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, and the implications of positive and negative crosstalk between these PTMs and the DNAme machinery. Finally, we reflect on how the sex-specific epigenetic landscapes observed in the mouse germline impact transcriptional regulation in both the gametes and the early embryo. Key Messages Investigation of the roles of chromatin modifying enzymes and the interplay between the chromatin marks that they deposit in germ cells has been facilitated by analyses of conventional or germline-specific knockout mice, combined with low-input genome-wide profiling methods that have been developed in recent years. While clearly informative, these findings generally reflect ""snapshots"" of chromatin states derived from analyses of cells analyzed in bulk at a specific period in development. Technological advances and novel experimental models will be required to further refine our understanding of the underlying mechanism and order of establishment of chromatin marks and the impact of sexually dimorphic epigenetic patterning on transcription and other nuclear processes in germ cells, the early embryo and beyond.S.

"36699871","An exposome connectivity paradigm for the mechanistic assessment of the effects of prenatal and early life exposure to metals on neurodevelopment.","Front Public Health","The exposome paradigm through an integrated approach to investigating the impact of perinatal exposure to metals on child neurodevelopment in two cohorts carried out in Slovenia (PHIME cohort) and Greece (HERACLES cohort) respectively, is presented herein. Heavy metals are well-known neurotoxicants with well-established links to impaired neurodevelopment. The links between inuteroand early-life exposure to metals, metabolic pathway dysregulation, and neurodevelopmental disorders were drawn through urinary and plasma untargeted metabolomics analysis, followed by the combined application ofin silicoand biostatistical methods. Heavy metal prenatal and postnatal exposure was evaluated, including parameters indirectly related to exposure and health adversities, such as sociodemographic and anthropometric parameters and dietary factors. The primary outcome of the study was that the identified perturbations related to the TCA cycle are mainly associated with impaired mitochondrial respiration, which is detrimental to cellular homeostasis and functionality; this is further potentiated by the capacity of heavy metals to induce oxidative stress. Insufficient production of energy from the mitochondria during the perinatal period is associated with developmental disorders in children. The HERACLES cohort included more detailed data regarding diet and sociodemographic status of the studied population, allowing the identification of a broader spectrum of effect modifiers, such as the beneficial role of a diet rich in antioxidants such as lycopene and ω-3 fatty acids, the negative effect the consumption of food items such as pork and chicken meat has or the multiple impacts of fish consumption. Beyond diet, several other factors have been proven influential for child neurodevelopment, such as the proximity to pollution sources (e.g., waste treatment site) and the broader living environment, including socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Overall, our results demonstrate the utility of exposome-wide association studies (EWAS) toward understanding the relationships among the multiple factors that determine human exposure and the underlying biology, reflected as omics markers of effect on neurodevelopment during childhood.Copyright © 2023 Anesti, Papaioannou, Gabriel, Karakoltzidis, Dzhedzheia, Petridis, Stratidakis, Dickinson, Horvat, Snoj Tratnik, Tsatsakis, Karakitsios and Sarigiannis."

In plants, RNA methylation is ubiquitous and is involved in all aspects of RNA post-transcriptional regulation. For instance, long-distance mobile RNAs, strongly influenced by their methylation status, play important roles in plant growth, development and environmental adaptation. Cucumber/pumpkin heterografts are widely used to improve stress tolerance of cucumber and to study mobile RNA signals due to their strong developed vasculature system. Here, we developed the Cucume (Cucurbit RNA methylation, http://cucume.cn/) database for these two important vegetables, cucumber (Cucumis sativusL.) and pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) with high productivity worldwide. We identified mRNAs harboring 5-methylcytosine (m5C) and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) sites in pumpkin and cucumber at the whole genome level via Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) of different tissues and the vascular exudates. In addition to RNA methylation sites, the Cucume database includes graft-transmissible systemic mRNAs identified in previous studies using cucumber/pumpkin heterografts. The further integration of cucumber genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) allows the study of RNA methylation-related genetic and epigenetic regulation in cucurbits. Therefore, the here developed Cucume database will promote understanding the role of cucurbit RNA methylation in RNA mobility and QTL, ultimately benefitting future breeding of agronomic crop germplasms.© 2023 The Authors."
"36697378","Transgenerational impact of grand-paternal lifetime exposures to both folic acid deficiency and supplementation on genome-wide DNA methylation in male germ cells.","Andrology","DNA methylation (DNAme) erasure and reacquisition occurs during prenatal male germ cell development; some further remodelling takes place after birth during spermatogenesis. Environmental insults during germline epigenetic reprogramming may affect DNAme, presenting a potential mechanism for transmission of environmental exposures across multiple generations.We investigated how germ cell DNAme is impacted by lifetime exposures to diets containing either low or high, clinically relevant, levels of the methyl donor folic acid and whether resulting DNAme alterations were inherited in germ cells of male offspring of subsequent generations.Female mice were placed on a 7-fold folic acid deficient (7FD) and 10- or 20-fold supplemented (10FS and 20FS) diets before and during pregnancy. Resulting F1 litters were weaned on the respective diets. F2 and F3 males received control diets. Genome-wide DNAme at cytosines (within CpG sites) was assessed in F1 spermatogonia, and in F1, F2 and F3 sperm.In F1 germ cells, a greater number of differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) was observed in spermatogonia as compared with F1 sperm for all folic acid diets. DMCs were lower in number in F2 versus F1 sperm, while an unexpected increase was found in F3 sperm. DMCs were predominantly hypomethylated, with genes in neurodevelopmental pathways commonly affected in F1, F2 and F3 male germ cells. While no DMCs were found to be significantly inherited inter- or transgenerationally, we observed over-representation of repetitive elements, particularly young LINEs.These results suggest that the prenatal window is the time most susceptible to folate-induced alterations in sperm DNAme in male germ cells. Altered methylation of specific sites in F1 germ cells was not present in later generations. However, the presence of DNAme perturbations in the sperm of males of the F2 and F3 generations suggests that epigenetic inheritance mechanisms other than DNAme may have been impacted by the folate diet exposure of F1 germ cells.

"36694897","DNA Methylation: Genomewide Distribution, Regulatory Mechanism and Therapy Target.","Acta Naturae","DNA methylation is the most important epigenetic modification involved in the regulation of transcription, imprinting, establishment of X-inactivation, and the formation of a chromatin structure. DNA methylation in the genome is often associated with transcriptional repression and the formation of closed heterochromatin. However, the results of genome-wide studies of the DNA methylation pattern and transcriptional activity of genes have nudged us toward reconsidering this paradigm, since the promoters of many genes remain active despite their methylation. The differences in the DNA methylation distribution in normal and pathological conditions allow us to consider methylation as a diagnostic marker or a therapy target. In this regard, the need to investigate the factors affecting DNA methylation and those involved in its interpretation becomes pressing. Recently, a large number of protein factors have been uncovered, whose ability to bind to DNA depends on their methylation. Many of these proteins act not only as transcriptional activators or repressors, but also affect the level of DNA methylation. These factors are considered potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases resulting from either a change in DNA methylation or a change in the interpretation of its methylation level. In addition to protein factors, a secondary DNA structure can also affect its methylation and can be considered as a therapy target. In this review, the latest research into the DNA methylation landscape in the genome has been summarized to discuss why some DNA regions avoid methylation and what factors can affect its level or interpretation and, therefore, can be considered a therapy target.Copyright ® 2022 National Research University Higher School of Economics."

It presents the emerging literature showing associations between individual- and neighborhood-level SEP exposures and DNAm across the life course. In contrast to questionnaire-based methods of assessing SEP, we suggest that DNAm biomarkers may offer an accessible metric to study questions about SEP and health outcomes, acting as a personal dosimeter of exposure. However, further work remains in standardizing SEP measures across studies and evaluating consistency across domains, tissue types, and time periods. Meta-analyses of epigenetic associations with SEP are offered as one approach to confirm the replication of DNAm loci across studies. The development of DNAm biomarkers of SEP would provide a method for examining its impact on health outcomes in a more robust way, increasing the rigor of epidemiological studies.© The Author(s) 2023.

However, the molecular targets as well as the mechanisms that determine the specificity of the de novo methylation machinery during differentiation are not completely elucidated. Here we show that the DNMT3B-dependent DNA methylation of key developmental regulatory regions at epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) provides an epigenetic priming that ensures flawless commitment at later stages. Using in vitro stem cell differentiation and loss of function experiments combined with high-throughput genome-wide bisulfite-, bulk-, and single cell RNA-sequencing we dissected the specific role of DNMT3B in cell fate. We identify DNMT3B-dependent regulatory elements on the genome which, in Dnmt3b knockout (3BKO), impair the differentiation into meso-endodermal (ME) progenitors and redirect EpiLCs towards the neuro-ectodermal lineages. Moreover, ectopic expression of DNMT3B in 3BKO re-establishes the DNA methylation of the master regulator Sox2 super-enhancer, downmodulates its expression, and restores the expression of ME markers. Taken together, our data reveal that DNMT3B-dependent methylation at the epiblast stage is essential for the priming of the meso-endodermal lineages and provide functional characterization of the de novo DNMTs during EpiLCs lineage determination.© 2023.

Due to the fast emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, understanding the molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and developing novel inhibitors are essential and urgent. Here, we investigated the potential roles ofN6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am), one of the most abundant modifications of eukaryotic messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNAs), in SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells. Using genome-wide m6Am-exo-seq, RNA sequencing analysis, and Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 genome editing, we demonstrate that phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD)-interacting factor 1 (PCIF1), a cap-specific adenineN6-methyltransferase, plays a major role in facilitating infection of primary human lung epithelial cells and cell lines by SARS-CoV-2, variants of concern, and other coronaviruses. We show that PCIF1 promotes infection by sustaining expression of the coronavirus receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) via m6Am-dependent mRNA stabilization. In PCIF1-depleted cells, both ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and viral infection are rescued by re-expression of wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, PCIF1. These findings suggest a role for PCIF1 and cap m6Amin regulating SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and identify a potential therapeutic target for prevention of infection."

Here, we studied the combined aspects evaluating to the role of methylation of miRNA encoding genes in HM.Materials and Methods:From the genome-wide DNA methylation data of 18 Polish children with HM and 18 matched controls, we retrieved differentially methylated CG dinucleotides localized in miRNA encoding genes. Putative target genes of the highest-ranked miRNAs were obtained from the miRDB and included in overrepresentation analyses in the ConsensusPathDB. Expression of target genes was assessed using the RNA sequencing data of retinal ARPE-19 cell line.Results:We identified differential methylation of CG dinucleotides in promoter regions ofMIR3621,MIR34C,MIR423(increased methylation level), andMIR1178,MIRLET7A2,MIR885,MIR548I3,MIR6854,MIR675,MIRLET7C,MIR99A(decreased methylation level) genes. Several targets of these miRNAs, e.g.GNAS,TRAM1,CTNNB1,EIF4B,TENM3andRUNXwere previously associated with myopia/HM/refractive error in Europeans in genome-wide association studies. Overrepresentation analyses of miRNAs' targets revealed enrichment in pathways/processes related to eye structure/function, such as axon guidance, transcription, focal adhesion, and signaling pathways of TGF-β, insulin, MAPK and EGF-EGFR.Conclusion:Differential methylation of indicated miRNA encoding genes might influence their expression and contribute to HM pathogenesisviadisrupted regulation of transcription of miRNAs' target genes. Methylation of genes encoding miRNAs may be a new direction in research on both the mechanisms determining HM and non-invasive indicators in diagnostics.Copyright © 2023 Swierkowska, Vishweswaraiah, Mrugacz, Radhakrishna and Gajecka."
"36685876","Differential DNA methylation associated with multiple sclerosis and disease modifying treatments in an underrepresented minority population.","Front Genet","Black and Hispanic American patients frequently develop earlier onset of multiple sclerosis (MS) and a more severe disease course that can be resistant to disease modifying treatments. The objectives were to identify differential methylation of genomic DNA (gDNA) associated with disease susceptibility and treatment responses in a cohort of MS patients from underrepresented minority populations. Patients with MS and controls with non-inflammatory neurologic conditions were consented and enrolled under an IRB-approved protocol. Approximately 64% of donors identified as Black or African American and 30% as White, Hispanic-Latino. Infinium MethylationEPIC bead arrays were utilized to measure epigenome-wide gDNA methylation of whole blood. Data were analyzed in the presence and absence of adjustments for unknown covariates in the dataset, some of which corresponded to disease modifying treatments. Global patterns of differential methylation associated with MS were strongest for those probes that showed relative demethylation of loci with lower M values. Pathway analysis revealed unexpected associations with shigellosis and amoebiasis. Enrichment analysis revealed an over-representation of probes in enhancer regions and an under-representation in promoters. In the presence of adjustments for covariates that included disease modifying treatments, analysis revealed 10 differentially methylated regions (DMR's) with an FDR <1E-77. Five of these genes (ARID5B, BAZ2B, RABGAP1, SFRP2, WBP1L) are associated with cancer risk and cellular differentiation and have not been previously identified in MS studies. Hierarchical cluster and multi-dimensional scaling analysis of differential DNA methylation at 147 loci within those DMR's was sufficient to differentiate MS donors from controls. In the absence of corrections for disease modifying treatments, differential methylation in patients treated with dimethyl fumarate was associated with immune regulatory pathways that regulate cytokine and chemokine signaling, axon guidance, and adherens junctions. These results demonstrate possible associations of gastrointestinal pathogens and regulation of cellular differentiation with MS susceptibility in our patient cohort. This work further suggests that analyses can be performed in the presence and absence of corrections for immune therapies. Because of their high representation in our patient cohort, these results may be of specific relevance in the regulation of disease susceptibility and treatment responses in Black and Hispanic Americans.Copyright © 2023 Bingen, Clark, Band, Munzir and Carrithers."

However, the mechanisms whereby PM2.5contribute to COPD risk have not been fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetics, including DNA methylation, play an important role in this process; however, the association between PM2.5exposure and genome-wide DNA methylation in patients with COPD has not been studied.To evaluate the association of personal exposure to PM2.5and genome-wide DNA methylation changes in the peripheral blood of patients with COPD.A panel study was conducted in Beijing, China. We repeatedly measured and collected personal PM2.5data for 72 h. Genome-wide DNA-methylation of peripheral blood was analyzed using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation BeadChip (850 k). A linear-mixed effect model was used to identify the differentially methylated probe (DMP) associated with PM2.5. Finally, we performed a functional enrichment analysis of the DMPs that were significantly associated with PM2.5.A total of 24 COPD patients were enrolled and 48 repeated DNA methylation measurements were associated in this study. When the false discovery rate was < 0.05, 19 DMPs were significantly associated with PM2.5and were annotated to corresponding genes. Functional enrichment analysis of these genes showed that they were related to the response to toxic substances, regulation of tumor necrosis factor superfamily cytokine production, regulation of photosensitivity 3-kinase signaling, and other pathways.This study provided evidence for a significant relationship between personal PM2.5exposure and DNA methylation in patients with COPD. Our research also revealed a new biological pathway explaining the adverse effects of PM2.5exposure on COPD risk.Copyright © 2023 Duan, Niu, Dong, Yu, Li, Wu, Zhang and Yang."

SETD2 methylates histone H3 as well as a growing list of non-histone proteins.Initially, we sought to explore SETD2-dependent changes in lysine methylation of proteins in proximal renal tubule cells. Subsequently, we focused on changes in lysine methylation of the translation elongation factor eEF1A1.To accomplish these objectives, we initially performed a systems-wide analysis of protein lysine-methylation and expression in wild type (WT) andSETD2-knock out (KO) kidney cells and later focused our studies on eEF1A1 as well as the expression of lysine methyltransferases that regulate its lysine methylation.We observed decreased lysine methylation of the translation elongation factor eEF1A1.EEF1AKMT2andEEF1AKMT3are known to methylate eEF1A1, and we show here that their expression is dependent on SET-domain function ofSETD2.Globally, we observe differential expression of hundreds of proteins in WT versusSETD2-KO cells, including increased expression of many involved in protein translation. Finally, we observe decreased progression free survival and loss of EEF1AKMT2 gene expression inSETD2-mutated tumors predicted to have loss of function of the SET domain.Overall, these data suggest thatSETD2-mutated ccRCC, via loss of enzymatic function of the SET domain, displays dysregulation of protein translation as a potentially important component of the transformed phenotype."

However, little is known about the function of the m7G in colon adenocarcinoma.We established two clusters based on the expression of all genes associated with m7G to explore the expression pattern of 31 key regulatory factors of m7G RNA and assess the prognostic value of regulatory factors. Wilcoxon test and differential box line plots were applied for bioinformatics analysis. Receiver Operating and Kaplan‒Meier curves were utilized to evaluate the prognostic value. Finally, four genes' expression in the colon cancer cell line was confirmed by qRT-PCR.From The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we found that the expression levels of 25 out of the 31 key N7-methylguanosine RNA modification regulators were significantly different in colon adenocarcinoma. According to 25 methylation regulators' expression, we identified two subgroups by consensus clustering, in which the prognosis was worse in Group 2 than in Group 1 and was significantly correlated with age. Cluster 2 was significantly enriched in tumor-associated pathways, and immune cells were highly infiltrated in Cluster 1 but weakly infiltrated in Cluster 2. Further results indicated that this risk profile may serve as a standalone predictive factor for colon adenocarcinoma, and the four genetic risk profiles' prognostic relatedness was successfully verified through Gene Expression Omnibus dataset. At last, A nomogram for prognosis was created according to age, sex, histological grading, clinicopathological staging, and hazard score to accurately predict patient prognosis in colon adenocarcinoma. We successfully validated the differential expression of four genes using qRT-PCR.In the present study, we revealed the important contribution of key regulators associated with m7G RNA modifications based on all gene expression in colon adenocarcinoma and developed a signature of risk that serves as a promising prognostic marker for patients with colon adenocarcinoma.© 2023.

"36678953","DNA Methylation in Algae and Its Impact on Abiotic Stress Responses.","Plants (Basel)","Epigenetics, referring to heritable gene regulatory information that is independent of changes in DNA sequences, is an important mechanism involved both in organism development and in the response to environmental events. About the epigenetic marks, DNA methylation is one of the most conserved mechanisms, playing a pivotal role in organism response to several biotic and abiotic stressors. Indeed, stress can induce changes in gene expression through hypo- or hyper-methylation of DNA at specific loci and/or in DNA methylation at the genome-wide level, which has an adaptive significance and can direct genome evolution. Exploring DNA methylation in responses to abiotic stress could have important implications for improving stress tolerance in algae. This article summarises the DNA methylation pattern in algae and its impact on abiotic stress, such as heavy metals, nutrients and temperature. Our discussion provides information for further research in algae for a better comprehension of the epigenetic response under abiotic stress, which could favour important implications to sustain algae growth under abiotic stress conditions, often related to high biosynthesis of interesting metabolites."

Thus, biomarkers predicting the occurrence of this pathology are of great importance from a clinical and therapeutic standpoint. By means of a pilot study on peripheral blood cells (PBMCs) of subjects with no coronary lesions (CTR; n = 2) and patients with stable CAD (CAD; n = 2), we revealed 61 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (18 promoter regions, 24 genes and 19 CpG islands) and 14.997 differentially methylated single CpG sites (DMCs) in CAD patients. MiRNA-seq results displayed a peculiar miRNAs profile in CAD patients with 18 upregulated and 32 downregulated miRNAs (FC ≥ ±1.5,p≤ 0.05). An integrated analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation and miRNA-seq results indicated a significant downregulation of hsa-miR-200c-3p (FCCAD= -2.97,p≤ 0.05) associated to the hypermethylation of two sites (genomic coordinates: chr12:7073122-7073122 and chr12:7072599-7072599) located intragenic to the miR-200c/141 genomic locus (encoding hsa-miR-200c-3p) (p-value = 0.009) in CAD patients. We extended the hsa-miR-200c-3p expression study in a larger cohort (CAD = 72, CTR = 24), confirming its reduced expression level in CAD patients (FCCAD= -2;p= 0.02). However, when we analyzed the methylation status of the two CpG sites in the same cohort, we failed to identify significant differences. A ROC curve analysis showed good performance of hsa-miR-200c-3p expression level (AUC = 0.65;p= 0.02) in distinguishing CAD from CTR. Moreover, we found a significant positive correlation between hsa-miR-200c-3p expression and creatinine clearance (R2= 0.212,p&lt; 0.005, Pearson r = 0.461) in CAD patients. Finally, a phenotypic correlation performed in the CAD group revealed lower hsa-miR-200c-3p expression levels in CAD patients affected by dyslipidemia (+DLP, n = 58) (p&lt; 0.01). These results indicate hsa-miR-200c-3p as potential epi-biomarker for the diagnosis and clinical progression of CAD and highlight the importance of deeper studies on the expression of this miRNA to understand its functional role in coronary artery disease development."
"36672773","Novel Insights into Potential Cannabis-Related Cancerogenesis from Recent Key Whole Epigenome Screen of Cannabis Dependence and Withdrawal: Epidemiological Commentary and Explication of Schrott et al.","Genes (Basel)","Whilst the cannabis-cancer link has been traditionally described as controversial recent whole nation and whole continent studies have demonstrated that well documented laboratory-based multimodal cannabinoid genotoxicity is indeed reflected in numerous cancer types in larger epidemiological series. A recent longitudinal human sperm epigenome-wide DNA methylation screen in both cannabis dependence and cannabis withdrawal has revealed remarkable insights into the manner in which widespread perturbations of DNA methylation may lead to cancerogenic changes in both the exposed and subsequent generations as a result of both cannabis exposure and withdrawal. These results therefore powerfully strengthen and further robustify the causal nature of the relationship between cannabinoid exposure and cancerous outcomes well beyond the previously published extensive mechanistic literature on cannabinoid genotoxicity. The reported epigenomic results are strongly hypothesis generating and call powerfully for further work to investigate oncogenic mechanisms in many tissues, organs and preclinical models. These epigenomic results provide an extraordinarily closepredictiveaccount for the epidemiologically observed pattern of cannabis-related malignant disease and indicate that malignant and multigenerational cannabinoid epigenotoxicity is potentially a significant and major public health concern."

The first cohort included 100 benign (grade 1, World Health Organization 2021) meningiomas, and the second 69 atypical meningiomas (grade 2). Immunohistochemical Ki-67 and MCM6 labeling indices (LI) were evaluated independently by two observers. Among the atypical meningiomas, 33 cases were also studied by genome-wide DNA methylation. In grade 2 meningiomas, but not grade 1, both Ki-67 and MCM6 LIs were correlated with PFS (p= 0.004 andp= 0.005, respectively; Cox univariate analyses). Additionally, MCM6 was correlated with overall survival only in univariate analysis. In a multivariate model, including mitotic index, Ki-67, MCM6, age, sex, and the quality of surgical resection, only MCM6 was correlated with PFS (p= 0.046). Additionally, we found a significant correlation between PTEN loss and high MCM6 or Ki-67 LIs. Although no correlation was found with the methylation classes and subtypes returned by the meningioma algorithm MNGv2.4., MCM6 LI was significantly correlated with the methylation of 2 MCM6 gene body loci. In conclusion, MCM6 is a relevant prognostic marker in atypical meningiomas. This reproducible and easy-to-use marker allows the identification of a highly aggressive subtype of proliferative meningiomas, characterized notably by frequent PTEN losses, which was previously reported to be sensitive to histone deacetylase inhibitors."
"36672228","The Histone H3K27 Demethylase REF6 Is a Positive Regulator of Light-Initiated Seed Germination in Arabidopsis.","Cells","Seed germination is the first step in initiating a new life cycle in seed plants. Light is a major environmental factor affecting seed germination. Phytochrome B (phyB) is the primary photoreceptor promoting germination during the initial phase of imbibition. Post-translational histone methylation occurring at both lysine and arginine residues plays a crucial role in transcriptional regulation in plants. However, the role of histone lysine demethylation in light-initiated seed germination is not yet reported. Here, we identified that Relative of Early Flowering 6 (REF6)/Jumonji Domain-containing Protein 12 (JMJ12), a histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylase, acts as a positive regulator of light-initiated seed germination. The loss of function ofREF6in Arabidopsis inhibits phyB-dependent seed germination. Genome-wide RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that REF6 regulates about half of the light-responsive transcriptome in imbibed seeds, including genes related to multiple hormonal signaling pathways and cellular processes. Phenotypic analyses indicated that REF6 not only regulates seed germination through GA (gibberellin) and ABA (abscisic acid) processes but also depends on the auxin signaling pathway. Furthermore, REF6 directly binds to and decreases the histone H3K27me3 levels of auxin-signaling- and cell-wall-loosening-related genes, leading to the activated expression of these genes in imbibed seeds. Taken together, our study identifies REF6 as the first histone lysine demethylase required for light-initiated seed germination. Our work also reveals the important role of REF6-mediated histone H3K27 demethylation in transcriptional reprogramming in the light-initiated seed germination process."
"36672222","Genome-Wide Methylation Changes Associated with Replicative Senescence and Differentiation in Endothelial and Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells.","Cells","Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) are multipotent cells able to self-renew and differentiate, depending on the microenvironment, into adipocytes and osteoblasts. These cells have a limited number of replications and enter replicative senescence during in vitro expansion. The role of DNA methylation (DNAm) assumes importance in cell function and commitment; however, its exact contribution to BMSC differentiation and replicative senescence is still unclear. We performed a genome-wide DNAm analysis on BMSCs cultured in vitro at early passages and induced to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts, and on replicative senescent BMSCs and HUVECs, to identify DNAm patterns of senescence and differentiation. We also compared BMSCs and HUVECs in replicative senescence and found that, in both cellular systems, genome-wide hypomethylation was accompanied by a higher-than-expected overlap of differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and concordance in terms of direction of the change. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis on lineage-independent senescence-associated DMPs revealed 16 common pathways, including Insulin resistance, Molecule adhesion, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. In both adipogenesis and osteogenesis, we observed a general demethylation of CpG sites compared with undifferentiated BMSCs with a higher number of DMPs in osteogenesis. KEGG analysis resulted in 30 pathways enriched in osteoblasts and only 2 in adipocytes when compared to undifferentiated cells. When comparing differentiated BMSCs with senescent ones, osteogenesis exhibited a greater overlap with senescence in terms of number of DMPs and direction of methylation change compared to adipogenesis. In conclusion, this study may be useful for future research on general mechanisms that occur in replicative senescence and furthermore to identify trajectories of BMSC differentiation and common aspects of differentiated and senescent cells."

Trained college-aged males (n= 11, 23 ± 4 years old, 4 ± 3 years self-reported training) performed LL or HL bouts to failure separated by one week. The HL bout (i.e., 80 Fail) consisted of four sets of back squats and four sets of leg extensions to failure using 80% of participants estimated one-repetition maximum (i.e., est. 1-RM). The LL bout (i.e., 30 Fail) implemented the same paradigm with 30% of est. 1-RM. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were collected before, 3 h, and 6 h after each bout. Muscle DNA and RNA were batch-isolated and analyzed using the 850k Illumina MethylationEPIC array and Clariom S mRNA microarray, respectively. Performed repetitions were significantly greater during the 30 Fail versus 80 Fail (p&lt; 0.001), although total training volume (sets × reps × load) was not significantly different between bouts (p= 0.571). Regardless of bout, more CpG site methylation changes were observed at 3 h versus 6 h post exercise (239,951 versus 12,419, respectively;p&lt; 0.01), and nuclear global ten-eleven translocation (TET) activity, but not global DNA methyltransferase activity, increased 3 h and 6 h following exercise regardless of bout. The percentage of genes significantly altered at the mRNA level that demonstrated opposite DNA methylation patterns was greater 3 h versus 6 h following exercise (~75% versus ~15%, respectively). Moreover, high percentages of genes that were up- or downregulated 6 h following exercise also demonstrated significantly inversed DNA methylation patterns across one or more CpG sites 3 h following exercise (65% and 82%, respectively). While 30 Fail decreased DNA methylation across various promoter regions versus 80 Fail, transcriptome-wide mRNA and bioinformatics indicated that gene expression signatures were largely similar between bouts. Bioinformatics overlay of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data indicated that genes related to ""Focal adhesion,"" ""MAPK signaling,"" and ""PI3K-Akt signaling"" were significantly affected at the 3 h and 6 h time points, and again this was regardless of bout. In conclusion, extensive molecular profiling suggests that post-exercise alterations in the skeletal muscle DNA methylome and mRNA transcriptome elicited by LL and HL training bouts to failure are largely similar, and this could be related to equal volumes performed between bouts."

This study aimed to reveal the epigenetic basis for differences between zebu (Bos indicus) and taurine cattle (Bos taurus) in disease, disease resistance, and economic traits, and provide a theoretical basis for the genetic improvement of domestic cattle. In this study, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was used to analyze the whole-genome methylation of spleen and liver samples from Yunnan zebu and Holstein cattle. In the genome-wide methylation pattern analysis, it was found that the methylation pattern of all samples was dominated by the CG type, which accounted for &gt;94.9%. The DNA methylation levels of different functional regions and transcriptional elements in the CG background varied widely. However, the methylation levels of different samples in the same functional regions or transcriptional elements did not differ significantly. In addition, we identified a large number of differentially methylation region (DMR) in both the spleen and liver groups, of which 4713 and 4663 were annotated to functional elements, and most of them were annotated to the intronic and exonic regions of genes. GO and KEGG functional analysis of the same differentially methylation region (DMG) in the spleen and liver groups revealed that significantly enriched pathways were involved in neurological, disease, and growth functions. As a result of the results of DMR localization, we screened six genes (DNM3,INPP4B,PLD,PCYT1B,KCNN2, andSLIT3) that were tissue-specific candidates for economic traits, disease, and disease resistance in Yunnan zebu. In this study, DNA methylation was used to construct links between genotypes and phenotypes in domestic cattle, providing useful information for further screening of epigenetic molecular markers in zebu and taurine cattle."
"36658480","Contribution of RdDM to the ecotype-specific differential methylation on conserved as well as highly variable regions between Arabidopsis ecotypes.","BMC Genomics","Several studies showed genome-wide DNA methylation during Arabidopsis embryogenesis and germination. Although it has been known that the change of DNA methylation mainly occurs at CHH context mediated by small RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway during seed ripening and germination, the causality of the methylation difference exhibited in natural Arabidopsis ecotypes has not been thoroughly studied.In this study we compared DNA methylation difference using comparative pairwise multi-omics dynamics in Columbia-0 (Col) and Cape Verde Island (Cvi) ecotypes. Arabidopsis genome was divided into two regions, common regions in both ecotypes and Col-specific regions, depending on the reads mapping of whole genome bisulfite sequencing libraries from both ecotypes. Ecotype comparison was conducted within common regions and the levels of DNA methylation on common regions and Col-specific regions were also compared. we confirmed transcriptome were relatively dynamic in stage-wise whereas the DNA methylome and small RNAome were more ecotype-dependent. While the global CG methylation remains steady during maturation and germination, we found genic CG methylation differs the most between the two accessions. We also found that ecotype-specific differentially methylated regions (eDMR) are positively correlated with ecotype-specifically expressed 24-nt small RNA clusters. In addition, we discovered that Col-specific regions enriched with transposable elements (TEs) and structural variants that tend to become hypermethylated, and TEs in Col-specific regions were longer in size, more pericentromeric, and more hypermethylated than those in the common regions. Through the analysis of RdDM machinery mutants, we confirmed methylation on Col-specific region as well as on eDMRs in common region are contributed by RdDM pathway. Lastly, we demonstrated that highly variable sequences between ecotypes (HOT regions) were also affected by RdDM-mediated regulation.Through ecotype comparison, we revealed differences and similarities of their transcriptome, methylome and small RNAome both in global and local regions. We validated the contribution of RdDM causing differential methylation of common regions. Hypermethylated ecotype-specific regions contributed by RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway largely depend on the presence of TEs and copy-gain structural variations. These ecotype-specific regions are frequently associated with HOT regions, providing evolutionary insights into the epigenome dynamics within a species.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Genome-wide mapping of myocardial DNA methylation in 36 HF patients at LVAD implantation, 8 patients at LVAD explantation, and 7 non-failing donors using a high-density bead array platform identified 2079 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in ischemic cardiomyopathy and 261 DMPs in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. LVAD support resulted in normalization of only 3.2% of HF-associated DMPs. Methylation-expression correlation analysis yielded several protein-coding genes that are hypomethylated and upregulated (HTRA1, FBXO16, EFCAB13, AKAP13) or hypermethylated and downregulated (TBX3) in HF. A novel cardiac-specific super-enhancer lncRNA (LINC00881) is hypermethylated and downregulated in human HF. LINC00881 is an upstream regulator of sarcomere and calcium channel gene expression including MYH6, CACNA1C, and RYR2. LINC00881 knockdown reduces peak calcium amplitude in the beating human iPS cell derived cardiomyocytes. Collectively, these data suggest that HF-associated changes in myocardial DNA methylation within coding and non-coding genome are minimally reversible with mechanical unloading. Epigenetic reprogramming strategies may be necessary to achieve sustained clinical recovery from heart failure."

Here, we demonstrate that the hypercompact CasΦ nuclease is able to generate stably inherited gene edits inArabidopsis, and that CasΦ guide RNAs can be expressed with either the Pol-III U6 promoter or a Pol-II promoter together with ribozyme mediated RNA processing. Using theArabidopsis fwaepiallele, we show that CasΦ displays higher editing efficiency when the target locus is not DNA methylated, suggesting that CasΦ is sensitive to chromatin environment. Importantly, two CasΦ protein variants, vCasΦ and nCasΦ, both showed much higher editing efficiency relative to the wild-type CasΦ enzyme. Consistently, vCasΦ and nCasΦ yielded offspring plants with inherited edits at much higher rates compared to WTCasΦ. Extensive genomic analysis of gene edited plants showed no off-target editing, suggesting that CasΦ is highly specific. The hypercompact size, T-rich minimal protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), and wide range of working temperatures make CasΦ an excellent supplement to existing plant genome editing systems."

Several mechanisms for acquired resistance to EGFRi in LUAD have been identified; however, the molecular basis for this resistance remains unknown in ~30% of LUAD. Chromatin and DNA modifiers and their regulators play important roles in determining response to anticancer therapies. Therefore, to identify nongenetic mechanisms of EGFRi resistance in LUAD, we performed an epigenome-wide shRNA screen targeting 363 human epigenetic regulator genes. This screen identified loss of the transcriptional repressor chromobox homolog 5 (CBX5) as a driver of EGFRi resistance in EGFR-mutant LUAD. Loss of CBX5 confers resistance to multiple EGFRi in both cell culture and mice. We found that CBX5 loss in EGFR-mutant LUAD cells leads to increased expression of the transcription factor E2F1, which in turn stimulates expression of the antiapoptotic geneBIRC5(survivin). This E2F1-mediated upregulation of BIRC5 inCBX5-knockdown LUAD cells attenuates apoptosis induction following EGFRi treatment. Consistent with these results, knockdown ofE2F1orBIRC5partly rescuesCBX5-knockdown-induced EGFRi resistance in cell culture and mice. EGFRi-resistant LUAD cell lines show reduced CBX5 expression compared to parental lines; however, bromo- and extra-terminal (BET)-domain inhibitors (BETi) restore CBX5 expression in these cells and sensitize them to EGFRi/BETi combination therapy. Similarly, treatment with a BIRC5 inhibitor suppresses growth of EGFRi-resistant LUAD cells. Collectively, these studies identify CBX5 loss as a driver of EGFRi resistance and reveal therapeutic opportunities for treating EGFRi-resistant LUAD."
"36650278","Epigenomic signatures reveal mechanistic clues and predictive markers for autism spectrum disorder.","Mol Psychiatry","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with a commonality in deficits in social communication and language combined with repetitive behaviors and interests. The etiology of ASD is heterogeneous, as several hundred genes have been implicated as well as multiple in utero environmental exposures. Over the past two decades, epigenetic investigations, including DNA methylation, have emerged as a novel way to capture the complex interface of multivariate ASD etiologies. More recently, epigenome-wide association studies using human brain and surrogate accessible tissues have revealed some convergent genes that are epigenetically altered in ASD, many of which overlap with known genetic risk factors. Unlike transcriptomes, epigenomic signatures defined by DNA methylation from surrogate tissues such as placenta and cord blood can reflect past differences in fetal brain gene transcription, transcription factor binding, and chromatin. For example, the discovery of NHIP (neuronal hypoxia inducible, placenta associated) through an epigenome-wide association in placenta, identified a common genetic risk for ASD that was modified by prenatal vitamin use. While epigenomic signatures are distinct between different genetic syndromic causes of ASD, bivalent chromatin and some convergent gene pathways are consistently epigenetically altered in both syndromic and idiopathic ASD, as well as some environmental exposures. Together, these epigenomic signatures hold promising clues towards improved early prediction and prevention of ASD as well genes and gene pathways to target for pharmacological interventions. Future advancements in single cell and multi-omic technologies, machine learning, as well as non-invasive screening of epigenomic signatures during pregnancy or newborn periods are expected to continue to impact the translatability of the recent discoveries in epigenomics to precision public health.© 2022.

"36649705","Epigenome-wide meta-analysis of BMI in nine cohorts: Examining the utility of epigenetically predicted BMI.","Am J Hum Genet","This study sought to examine the association between DNA methylation and body mass index (BMI) and the potential of BMI-associated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites to provide information about metabolic health. We pooled summary statistics from six trans-ethnic epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of BMI representing nine cohorts (n = 17,034), replicated these findings in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI, n = 4,822), and developed an epigenetic prediction score of BMI. In the pooled EWASs, 1,265 CpG sites were associated with BMI (p < 1E-7) and 1,238 replicated in the WHI (FDR < 0.05). We performed several stratified analyses to examine whether these associations differed between individuals of European and African descent, as defined by self-reported race/ethnicity. We found that five CpG sites had a significant interaction with BMI by race/ethnicity. To examine the utility of the significant CpG sites in predicting BMI, we used elastic net regression to predict log-normalized BMI in the WHI (80% training/20% testing). This model found that 397 sites could explain 32% of the variance in BMI in the WHI test set. Individuals whose methylome-predicted BMI overestimated their BMI (high epigenetic BMI) had significantly higher glucose and triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared to accurately predicted BMI. Individuals whose methylome-predicted BMI underestimated their BMI (low epigenetic BMI) had significantly higher HDL cholesterol and lower glucose and triglycerides. This study confirmed 553 and identified 685 CpG sites associated with BMI. Participants with high epigenetic BMI had poorer metabolic health, suggesting that the overestimation may be driven in part by cardiometabolic derangements characteristic of metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2022 American Society of Human Genetics.

"36648581","Genome-wide methylation analysis of treatment resistant schizophrenia.","J Neural Transm (Vienna)","Various studies have investigated the relationship between genetic polymorphisms of antipsychotic drug-metabolizing agents and drug response. DNA methylation is a form of epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression. Few studies have analyzed the relationship between genome-wide methylation patterns and treatment resistance schizophrenia. The primary aim of this pilot study is to investigate the association between treatment resistance status and genome-wide DNA methylation in schizophrenia patients. Treatment resistance status was determined for 109 patients with schizophrenia. Treatment resistance was the primary outcome variable in a model, including methylation status of white blood cells using the Illumina 450 array. The genome-wide DNA methylation levels in 109 Schizophrenia subjects did not show that DNA methylation sties were associated with resistance status. From our study, it is evident the importance of continuing to investigate the relationship between DNA methylation and antipsychotic response to personalize treatment in schizophrenia. Future studies require larger prescription databases to build on the results presented in this pilot study.© 2023.

"36647174","Genome-wide assessment of DNA methylation alterations induced by superovulation, sexual immaturity and in vitro follicle growth in mouse blastocysts.","Clin Epigenetics","In their attempt to fulfill the wish of having children, women who suffer from fertility issues often undergo assisted reproductive technologies such as ovarian stimulation, which has been associated with adverse health outcomes and imprinting disorders in children. However, given the crucial role of exogenous hormone stimulation in improving human infertility treatments, a more comprehensive analysis of the potential impacts on DNA methylation in embryos following ovarian stimulation is needed. Here, we provide genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of blastocysts generated after superovulation of prepubertal or adult mice, compared with blastocysts derived from non-stimulated adult mice. Additionally, we assessed the impact of the in vitro growth and maturation of oocytes on methylation in blastocysts.Neither hormone stimulation nor sexual maturity had an impact on the low global methylation levels characteristic of the blastocyst stage or was associated with extensive DNA methylation alterations. However, we found hormone- and age-associated changes at specific positions but dispersed throughout the genome. In particular, we detected anomalous methylation at a limited number of CpG islands. Additionally, superovulation in adult mice was associated with alterations at the Sgce and Zfp777 imprinted genes. On the other hand, in vitro culture of follicles from the early pre-antral stage was associated with globally reduced methylation and increased variability at imprinted loci in blastocysts.Our results indicate a minimal effect of ovarian stimulation of adult and prepubertal mice on the DNA methylation landscape attained at the blastocyst stage, but potentially greater impacts of in vitro growth and maturation of oocytes. These findings have potential significance for the improvement of assisted reproductive techniques, in particular for those related to treatments in prepubertal females, which could be crucial for improving human fertility preservation strategies.© 2023.

"36645283","Oral Microbiota Alteration and Roles in Epstein-Barr Virus Reactivation in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.","Microbiol Spectr","Microbiota has recently emerged as a critical factor associated with multiple malignancies. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is highly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV); the oncovirus resides and is transmitted in the oral cavity. However, the alternation of oral microbiota in NPC patients and its potential link to EBV reactivation and host cell response under the simultaneous existence of EBV and specific bacteria is largely unknown. Here, oral microbiota profiles of 303 NPC patients and controls with detailed clinical information, including serum EBV anti-virus capsid antigen (VCA) IgA level, were conducted. A distinct microbial community with lower diversity and imbalanced composition in NPC patients was observed. Notably, among enriched bacteria in patients, Streptococcus sanguinis was associated with anti-VCA IgA, an indicator of NPC risk and EBV reactivation. By measuring the concentration of its metabolite, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in the saliva of clinical patients, we found the detection rate of H2O2was 2-fold increased compared to healthy controls. Further coculture assay of EBV-positive Akata cells with bacteriain vitroshowed that S. sanguinis induced EBV lytic activation by its metabolite, H2O2. Host and EBV whole genome-wide transcriptome sequencing and EBV methylation assays showed that H2O2triggered the host cell signaling pathways, notably tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) via NF-κB, and induced the demethylation of the global EBV genome and the expression of EBV lytic-associated genes, which could result in an increase of virus particle release and potential favorable events toward tumorigenesis. In brief, our study identified a characterized oral microbial profile in NPC patients and established a robust link between specific oral microbial alteration and switch of latency to lytic EBV infection status in the oral cavity, which provides novel insights into EBV's productive cycle and might help to further clarify the etiology of NPC.IMPORTANCEEBV is classified as the group I human carcinogen and is associated with multiple cancers, including NPC. The interplays between the microbiota and oncovirus in cancer development remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the interactions between resident microbes and EBV coexistence in the oral cavity of NPC patients. We identify a distinct oral microbial feature for NPC patients. Among NPC-enriched bacteria, we illustrated that a specific species, S. sanguinis, associated with elevated anti-IgA VCA in patients, induced EBV lytic activation by its by-product, H2O2, and activated the TNF-α/NF-κB pathway of EBV-positive B cellsin vitro, together with increased detection rate of H2O2in patients' oral cavities, which strengthened the evidence of bacteria-virus-host interaction in physiological circumstances. The effects of imbalanced microbiota on the EBV latent-to-lytic switch in the oral cavity might create the likelihood of EBV infection in epithelial cells at the nasopharynx and help malignant transition and cancer development."

These processes involve multiple developmental stages covering ages and are prone to suffer signal interference or gene mutations, ultimately leading to developmental defects of enamel (DDE). Epigenetic modifications have important regulatory roles in gene expression during enarnel development. New technologies including high-throughput sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and DNA methylation chip are emerging in recent years, making it possible to establish genome-wide epigenetic modification profiles during developmental processes. The regulatory role of epigenetic modification with spatio-temporal pattern, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and non-coding RNA, has significantly expanded our understanding of the regulatory network of enamel formation, providing a new theoretical basis of clinical management and intervention strategy for DDE. The present review briefly describes the enamel formation process of human beings' teeth as well as rodent incisors and summarizes the dynamic characteristics of epigenetic modification during enamel formation. The functions of epigenetic modification in enamel formation and DDE are also emphatically discussed."

However, it remains unclear how antiretroviral therapy (ART) affects the HIV-induced epigenetic modifications.184 individuals with HIV from the NEAT001/ANRS143 clinical trial (with pre-ART and post-ART samples [96 weeks of follow-up]) and 44 age-and-sex matched individuals without HIV were included. We compared genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in whole blood between groups adjusting for age, sex, batch effects, and DNA methylation-based estimates of leucocyte composition.We identified 430 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between HIV+ pre-ART individuals and HIV-uninfected controls. In participants with HIV, ART initiation modified the DNA methylation levels at 845 CpG positions and restored 49.3% of the changes found between HIV+ pre-ART and HIV-uninfected individuals. We only found 15 DMPs when comparing DNA methylation profiles between HIV+ post-ART individuals and participants without HIV. The Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of DMPs associated with untreated HIV infection revealed an enrichment in biological processes regulating the immune system and antiviral responses. In participants with untreated HIV infection, DNA methylation levels at top HIV-related DMPs were associated with CD4/CD8 ratios and viral loads. Changes in DNA methylation levels after ART initiation were weakly correlated with changes in CD4+ cell counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio.Control of HIV viraemia after 96 weeks of ART initiation partly restores the host DNA methylation changes that occurred before antiretroviral treatment of HIV infection.NEAT-ID Foundation and Instituto de Salud Carlos III, co-funded by European Union.Copyright © 2022 Fundacion Investigacion Biomedica del Hospital La Paz.

"36639817","Vitamin C boosts DNA demethylation in TET2 germline mutation carriers.","Clin Epigenetics","Accurate regulation of DNA methylation is necessary for normal cells to differentiate, develop and function. TET2 catalyzes stepwise DNA demethylation in hematopoietic cells. Mutations in the TET2 gene predispose to hematological malignancies by causing DNA methylation overload and aberrant epigenomic landscape. Studies on mice and cell lines show that the function of TET2 is boosted by vitamin C. Thus, by strengthening the demethylation activity of TET2, vitamin C could play a role in the prevention of hematological malignancies in individuals with TET2 dysfunction. We recently identified a family with lymphoma predisposition where a heterozygous truncating germline mutation in TET2 segregated with nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma. The mutation carriers displayed a hypermethylation pattern that was absent in the family members without the mutation.In a clinical trial of 1 year, we investigated the effects of oral 1 g/day vitamin C supplementation on DNA methylation by analyzing genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression patterns from the family members.We show that vitamin C reinforces the DNA demethylation cascade, reduces the proportion of hypermethylated loci and diminishes gene expression differences between TET2 mutation carriers and control individuals.These results suggest that vitamin C supplementation increases DNA methylation turnover and provide a basis for further work to examine the potential benefits of vitamin C supplementation in individuals with germline and somatic TET2 mutations.This trial was registered at EudraCT with reference number of 2018-000155-41 (01.04.2019).© 2023.

"36639538","Potential for mercury methylation by Asgard archaea in mangrove sediments.","ISME J","Methylmercury (MeHg) is a potent neurotoxin that bioaccumulates along food chains. The conversion of MeHg from mercury (Hg) is mediated by a variety of anaerobic microorganisms carrying hgcAB genes. Mangrove sediments are potential hotspots of microbial Hg methylation; however, the microorganisms responsible for Hg methylation are poorly understood. Here, we conducted metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses to investigate the diversity and distribution of putative microbial Hg-methylators in mangrove ecosystems. The highest hgcA abundance and expression occurred in surface sediments in Shenzhen, where the highest MeHg concentration was also observed. We reconstructed 157 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) carrying hgcA and identified several putative novel Hg-methylators, including one Asgard archaea (Lokiarchaeota). Further analysis of MAGs revealed that Deltaproteobacteria, Euryarchaeota, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Lokiarchaeota were the most abundant and active Hg-methylating groups, implying their crucial role in MeHg production. By screening publicly available MAGs, 104 additional Asgard MAGs carrying hgcA genes were identified from a wide range of coast, marine, permafrost, and lake sediments. Protein homology modelling predicts that Lokiarchaeota HgcAB proteins contained the highly conserved amino acid sequences and folding structures required for Hg methylation. Phylogenetic tree revealed that hgcA genes from Asgard clustered with fused hgcAB genes, indicating a transitional stage of Asgard hgcA genes. Our findings thus suggest that Asgard archaea are potential novel Hg-methylating microorganisms and play an important role in hgcA evolution.© 2023.

Most genetic associations with lung function have been identified in adults of European descent and therefore may not represent those most relevant to pediatric populations and populations of different ancestries. In this study, we performed genome-wide association analyses of lung function in a multiethnic cohort of children (n = 1,035) living in low-income urban neighborhoods. We identified one novel locus at the TDRD9 gene in chromosome 14q32.33 associated with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (p = 2.4x10-9; βz = -0.31, 95% CI = -0.41- -0.21). Mendelian randomization and mediation analyses revealed that this genetic effect on FEV1 was partially mediated by DNA methylation levels at this locus in airway epithelial cells, which were also associated with environmental tobacco smoke exposure (p = 0.015). Promoter-enhancer interactions in airway epithelial cells revealed chromatin interaction loops between FEV1-associated variants in TDRD9 and the promoter region of the PPP1R13B gene, a stimulator of p53-mediated apoptosis. Expression of PPP1R13B in airway epithelial cells was significantly associated the FEV1 risk alleles (p = 1.3x10-5; β = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.06-0.17). These combined results highlight a potential novel mechanism for reduced lung function in urban youth resulting from both genetics and smoking exposure.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Although the utility of noninvasive biomarkers based on circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation profiling has been widely recognized, limited studies have been reported so far regarding the dynamics of cfDNA methylome in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). It is hypothesized in this study that comparison of methylation profiles in pre- and postsurgery plasma samples will reveal OCSCC-specific prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers. As a strategy to further prioritize tumor-specific targets, top differential methylated regions (DMRs) were called by reanalyzing methylation data from paired tumor and normal tissue collected in the the cancer genome atlas head-neck squamous cell carcinoma (TCGA) head and neck cancer cohort. Matched plasma samples from eight patients with OCSCC were collected at Moffitt Cancer Center before and after surgical resection. Plasma-derived cfDNA was analyzed by cfMBD-seq, which is a high-sensitive methylation profiling assay. Differential methylation analysis was then performed based on the matched samples profiled. In the top 200 HNSCC-specific DMRs detected based on the TCGA data set, a total of 23 regions reached significance in the plasma-based DMR test. The top five validated DMR regions (ranked by the significance in the plasma study) are located in the promoter regions of genes PENK, NXPH1, ZIK1, TBXT, and CDO1, respectively. The genome-wide cfDNA DMR analysis further highlighted candidate biomarkers located in genes SFRP4, SOX1, IRF4, and PCDH17. The prognostic relevance of candidate genes was confirmed by survival analysis using the TCGA data. This study supports the utility of cfDNA-based methylome profiling as a promising noninvasive biomarker source for OCSCC and HNSCC.© 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"36635485","OxPhos defects cause hypermetabolism and reduce lifespan in cells and in patients with mitochondrial diseases.","Commun Biol","Patients with primary mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) defects present with fatigue and multi-system disorders, are often lean, and die prematurely, but the mechanistic basis for this clinical picture remains unclear. By integrating data from 17 cohorts of patients with mitochondrial diseases (n = 690) we find evidence that these disorders increase resting energy expenditure, a state termed hypermetabolism. We examine this phenomenon longitudinally in patient-derived fibroblasts from multiple donors. Genetically or pharmacologically disrupting OxPhos approximately doubles cellular energy expenditure. This cell-autonomous state of hypermetabolism occurs despite near-normal OxPhos coupling efficiency, excluding uncoupling as a general mechanism. Instead, hypermetabolism is associated with mitochondrial DNA instability, activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), and increased extracellular secretion of age-related cytokines and metabokines including GDF15. In parallel, OxPhos defects accelerate telomere erosion and epigenetic aging per cell division, consistent with evidence that excess energy expenditure accelerates biological aging. To explore potential mechanisms for these effects, we generate a longitudinal RNASeq and DNA methylation resource dataset, which reveals conserved, energetically demanding, genome-wide recalibrations. Taken together, these findings highlight the need to understand how OxPhos defects influence the energetic cost of living, and the link between hypermetabolism and aging in cells and patients with mitochondrial diseases.© 2023.

However, it is unclear whether it is a cause of cancer. This two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, uses genetic instruments to proxy the exposure of mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer summary statistics as outcomes, allowing for causal inferences.Summary statistics from 18 common cancers (2107-491,974 participants), gene expression, DNA methylation and protein expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTL and pQTL, respectively, 1000-31,684 participants) on individuals of European ancestry, were included. Genetic variants located within or close to the 1136 mitochondrial-related genes (in cis) and robustly associated with the mitochondrial molecular alterations were used as instrumental variables, and their causal associations with cancers were examined using summary-data-based MR (SMR) analyses. An additional five MR methods were used as sensitivity analyses to confirm the casual associations. A Bayesian test for colocalization between mitochondrial molecular QTLs and cancer risk loci was performed to provide insights into the potential regulatory mechanisms of risk variants on cancers.We identified potential causal relationships between mitochondrial-related genes and breast, prostate, gastric, lung cancer and melanoma by primary SMR analyses. The sensitivity and the colocalization analyses further refined four genes that have causal effects on three types of cancer. We found strong evidence of positive association of FDPS expression level with breast cancer risk (OR per SD, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.83; P = 9.77 × 10-7), NSUN4 expression level with both breast cancer risk (OR per SD, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.07; P = 5.24 × 10-6) and prostate cancer risk (OR per SD, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.09; P = 1.01 × 10-5), NSUN4 methylation level with both breast and prostate cancer risk, and VARS2 methylation level with lung cancer risk.This data-driven MR study demonstrated the causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple cancers.

"36633903","Reduced methylation corresponds with diabetic nephropathy risk in type 1 diabetes.","J Clin Invest","Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a polygenic disorder with few risk variants showing robust replication in large-scale genome-wide association studies. To understand the role of DNA methylation, it is important to have the prevailing genomic view to distinguish key sequence elements that influence gene expression. This is particularly challenging for DN because genome wide methylation patterns are poorly defined. While methylation is known to alter gene expression the importance of this causal relationship is obscured by array-based technologies since coverage outside promoter regions is low. To overcome these challenges, we performed methylation sequencing using leukocytes derived from participants of the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) type 1 diabetes (T1D) study (n=39) that was subsequently replicated in a larger validation cohort (n=296). Gene body related regions made up >60% of the methylation differences and emphasised the importance of methylation sequencing. We observe differentially methylated genes associated with DN (DDN) in three independent T1D registries originating from Denmark (n=445), Hong Kong (n=107) and Thailand (n=130). Reduced DNA methylation at CTCF and Pol2B sites were tightly connected with DN pathways that include insulin signalling, lipid metabolism and fibrosis. To define the pathophysiological significance of these population findings, methylation indices were assessed in human renal cells such as podocytes and proximal convoluted tubules. The expression of core genes was associated with reduced methylation, elevated CTCF and Pol2B binding and the activation of insulin signalling phosphoproteins in hyperglycaemic cells. These experimental observations also closely parallel methylation-mediated regulation in human macrophage and vascular endothelial cells."

Their diverse scaffolds are generated via a multi-step cyclization cascade of linear isoprene substrates catalysed by terpene synthases (TPSs). Bisabolene NPs, which are sesquiterpenes (C15), have wide applications in medicines and biofuels and serve as bioactive substances in ecology. Despite the discovery of some canonical class I TPSs that synthesize bisabolenes from plants, bacteria and insects, it remained unknown whether any bisabolene synthases from fungi could produce bisabolenes as a main product.Antrodia cinnamomea, a Basidiomycota fungus, is a medicinal mushroom indigenous to Taiwan and a known prolific producer of bioactive terpenoids, but little is known regarding the enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathways. Here, we applied a genome mining approach againstA. cinnamomeaand discovered two non-canonical UbiA-type TPSs that both synthesize (+)-(S,Z)-α-bisabolene (1). It was determined that two tailoring enzymes, a P450 monooxygenase and a methyltransferase, install a C14-methyl ester on the bisabolene scaffold.

We present the first large-scale assessment of mQTL at human genomic regions selected for interindividual variation in CpG methylation, which we call correlated regions of systemic interindividual variation (CoRSIVs). These can be assayed in blood DNA and do not reflect interindividual variation in cellular composition.We use target-capture bisulfite sequencing to assess DNA methylation at 4086 CoRSIVs in multiple tissues from each of 188 donors in the NIH Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program. At CoRSIVs, DNA methylation in peripheral blood correlates with methylation and gene expression in internal organs. We also discover unprecedented mQTL at these regions. Genetic influences on CoRSIV methylation are extremely strong (median R2=0.76), cumulatively comprising over 70-fold more human mQTL than detected in the most powerful previous study. Moreover, mQTL beta coefficients at CoRSIVs are highly skewed (i.e., the major allele predicts higher methylation). Both surprising findings are independently validated in a cohort of 47 non-GTEx individuals. Genomic regions flanking CoRSIVs show long-range enrichments for LINE-1 and LTR transposable elements; the skewed beta coefficients may therefore reflect evolutionary selection of genetic variants that promote their methylation and silencing. Analyses of GWAS summary statistics show that mQTL polymorphisms at CoRSIVs are associated with metabolic and other classes of disease.A focus on systemic interindividual epigenetic variants, clearly enhanced in mQTL content, should likewise benefit studies attempting to link human epigenetic variation to the risk of disease.© 2022.

A number of environmental factors have been shown to be associated with hypospadias development. The current study investigated the role of epigenetics in the etiology of hypospadias and compared mild (distal), moderate (mid shaft), and severe (proximal) hypospadias. Penile foreskin samples were collected from hypospadias and non-hypospadias individuals to identify alterations in DNA methylation associated with hypospadias. Dramatic numbers of differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs) were observed in the mild hypospadias, with reduced numbers in moderate and low numbers in severe hypospadias. Atresia (cell loss) of the principal foreskin fibroblast is suspected to be a component of the disease etiology. A genome-wide (> 95%) epigenetic analysis was used and the genomic features of the DMRs identified. The DMR associated genes identified a number of novel hypospadias associated genes and pathways, as well as genes and networks known to be involved in hypospadias etiology. Observations demonstrate altered DNA methylation sites in penile foreskin is a component of hypospadias etiology. In addition, a potential role of environmental epigenetics and epigenetic inheritance in hypospadias disease etiology is suggested.© 2023. The Author(s)."

On the chromatin level, signal transduction leads to changes in epigenetic marks, such as histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility to regulate gene expression. Crosstalk between different epigenetic mechanisms, such as that between histone PTMs and DNA methylation, leads to an intricate network of chromatin-binding proteins where pre-existing epigenetic marks promote or inhibit the writing of new marks. The recent technical advances in mass spectrometry (MS) -based proteomic methods and in genome-wide DNA sequencing approaches have broadened our understanding of epigenetic networks greatly.

The aim of this study was to assess the association of genome-wide genetic and epigenetic alterations with the response to anti-HER2 agents in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. PubMed was screened for articles published until March 2021 on observational studies investigating the association of genome-wide genetic and epigenetic alterations, measured in breast cancer tissues or blood, with the response to targeted treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Sixteen studies were included in the review along with ours, in which we compared the genome-wide DNA methylation pattern in breast tumor tissues of patients who acquired resistance to treatment (case group,n= 6) to that of patients who did not develop resistance (control group,n= 6). Among genes identified as differentially methylated between the breast cancer tissue of cases and controls, one of them,PRKACA, was also reported as differentially expressed in two studies included in the review. Although included studies were heterogeneous in terms of methodology and study population, our review suggests that genes of the PI3K pathway may play an important role in developing resistance to anti-HER2 agents in breast cancer patients. Genome-wide genetic and epigenetic alterations measured in breast cancer tissue or blood might be promising markers of resistance to anti-HER2 agents in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.

DNA methylation, interfacing early-life exposures and subsequent diseases, is a possible mechanism underlying early-life programming.Here, a meta-analysis of Illumina HumanMethylation 450K/EPIC-array associations of cord blood DNA methylation at single CpG sites and CpG genomic regions with rapid weight growth at 1 year of age (defined with reference to WHO growth charts) was conducted in six European-based child cohorts (ALSPAC, ENVIRONAGE, Generation XXI, INMA, Piccolipiù, and RHEA, N = 2003). The association of gestational age acceleration (calculated using the Bohlin epigenetic clock) with rapid weight growth was also explored via meta-analysis. Follow-up analyses of identified DNA methylation signals included prediction of rapid weight growth, mediation of the effect of conventional risk factors on rapid weight growth, integration with transcriptomics and metabolomics, association with overweight in childhood (between 4 and 8 years), and comparison with previous findings.Forty-seven CpGs were associated with rapid weight growth at suggestive p-value <1e-05 and, among them, three CpGs (cg14459032, cg25953130 annotated to ARID5B, and cg00049440 annotated to KLF9) passed the genome-wide significance level (p-value <1.25e-07). Sixteen differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified as associated with rapid weight growth at false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted/Siddak p-values < 0.01. Gestational age acceleration was associated with decreasing risk of rapid weight growth (p-value = 9.75e-04). Identified DNA methylation signals slightly increased the prediction of rapid weight growth in addition to conventional risk factors. Among the identified signals, three CpGs partially mediated the effect of gestational age on rapid weight growth. Both CpGs (N=3) and DMRs (N=3) were associated with differential expression of transcripts (N=10 and 7, respectively), including long non-coding RNAs. An AURKC DMR was associated with childhood overweight.

"36624943","DNA Methylation: From Cancer Biology to Clinical Perspectives.","Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)","DNA methylation plays an important role in the silence of tissue-specific genes to prevent them from being expressed in the wrong tissue. Aberrant DNA methylation (genome-wide hypomethylation and site-specific hypermethylation) are observed in many types of cancer. DNA methylation patterns are established and maintained through the combined actions of methyltransferase and demethylase, such as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)-1, DNMT-3, and ten-eleven translocation (TET) family enzymes. It is well known that the process of tumor evolution is complicated with different hallmarks. Early findings put forward the model that focal hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSG) could straightly trigger transcriptional silencing and malignant transformation, whereas varying levels of DNA methylation also occur at other sites and can differently regulate gene expression and biological processes. The interplay of tumor and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment is complex. Understanding the role of DNA methylation in cancer immunity is critical to better navigate epigenetic agents. Furthermore, a greater understanding of the interaction of DNA methylation with tumor metabolic reprogramming would create a bright avenue for pharmacologic managements of malignancies. In this review, we will describe the molecular mechanisms of DNA methylation abnormalities in cancer biology, introduce the roles of DNA methylation patterns on cancer-immunity cycle and metabolic reprogramming, summarize modulators that are used in targeting DNA remodeling, and highlight the importance of combining epigenome-targeting drugs with other cancer therapies.© 2022 The Author(s).

"36624125","Patient-specific identification of genome-wide DNA-methylation differences between intracranial and extracranial melanoma metastases.","Sci Rep","Melanomas frequently metastasize to distant organs and especially intracranial metastases still represent a major clinical challenge. Epigenetic reprogramming of intracranial metastases is thought to be involved in therapy failure, but so far only little is known about patient-specific DNA-methylation differences between intra- and extracranial melanoma metastases. Hierarchical clustering of the methylomes of 24 patient-matched intra- and extracranial melanoma metastases pairs revealed that intra- and extracranial metastases of individual patients were more similar to each other than to metastases in the same tissue from other patients. Therefore, a personalized analysis of each metastases pair was done by a Hidden Markov Model to classify methylation levels of individual CpGs as decreased, unchanged or increased in the intra- compared to the extracranial metastasis. The predicted DNA-methylation alterations were highly patient-specific differing in the number and methylation states of altered CpGs. Nevertheless, four important general observations were made: (i) intracranial metastases of most patients mainly showed a reduction of DNA-methylation, (ii) cytokine signaling was most frequently affected by differential methylation in individual metastases pairs, but also MAPK, PI3K/Akt and ECM signaling were often altered, (iii) frequently affected genes were mainly involved in signaling, growth, adhesion or apoptosis, and (iv) an enrichment of functional terms related to channel and transporter activities supports previous findings for a brain-like phenotype. In addition, the derived set of 17 signaling pathway genes that distinguished intra- from extracranial metastases in more than 50% of patients included well-known oncogenes (e.g. PRKCA, DUSP6, BMP4) and several other genes known from neuronal disorders (e.g. EIF4B, SGK1, CACNG8). Moreover, associations of gene body methylation alterations with corresponding gene expression changes revealed that especially the three signaling pathway genes JAK3, MECOM, and TNXB differ strongly in their expression between patient-matched intra- and extracranial metastases. Our analysis contributes to an in-depth characterization of DNA-methylation differences between patient-matched intra- and extracranial melanoma metastases and may provide a basis for future experimental studies to identify targets for new therapeutic approaches.© 2023.

"36622671","Genome-wide DNA methylation predicts environmentally driven life history variation in a marine fish.","Evolution","Epigenetic modifications are thought to be one of the molecular mechanisms involved in plastic adaptive responses to environmental variation. However, studies reporting associations between genome-wide epigenetic changes and habitat-specific variations in life history traits (e.g., lifespan, reproduction) are still scarce, likely due to the recent application of methylome resequencing methods to non-model species. In this study, we examined associations between whole genome DNA methylation and environmentally driven life history variation in 2 lineages of a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus), from North America and Europe. In both lineages, capelin harbor 2 contrasting life history tactics (demersal vs. beach-spawning). Performing whole genome and methylome sequencing, we showed that life history tactics are associated with epigenetic changes in both lineages, though the effect was stronger in European capelin. Genetic differentiation between the capelin harboring different life history tactics was negligible, but we found genome-wide methylation changes in both lineages. We identified 9,125 European and 199 North American differentially methylated regions (DMRs) due to life history. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for both lineages revealed an excess of terms related to neural function. Our results suggest that environmental variation causes important epigenetic changes that are associated with contrasting life history tactics in lineages with divergent genetic backgrounds, with variable importance of genetic variation in driving epigenetic variation. Our study emphasizes the potential role of genome-wide epigenetic variation in adaptation to environmental variation.© The Author(s) 2022.

Here, we used anin vitromodel to differentiate mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into ventral midbrain and hindbrain neural progenitors, followed by characterizing global 5hmC distribution using a nano-5hmC-seal approach. The 5hmC pattern was dynamic in promoter, exon, and enhancer regions, associated with gene activation and repression. For example, ventral midbrain markers (Lmx1a,Otx2, andTh) and hindbrain markers (Hoxa1,Zic1, andTph1) acquire 5hmC and are upregulated during differentiation. Among the differentially expressed genes involved in both midbrain and hindbrain lineage commitment, phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) was identified as a key regulator for neuronal development. We confirmed that Pten knockout disrupted the normal differentiation of midbrain/hindbrain neural progenitors, resulting in immature neurons. In addition, 5421 and 4624 differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) were identified in the differentiation of Pten-/-mESC into ventral midbrain and hindbrain progenitors, respectively. Gene ontology analysis showed that the majority of these DhMRs were associated with neurogenesis, ectoderm development, and signal transduction. Moreover, further combinational analysis of the 5hmC pattern and transcriptomic profile in the midbrain progenitor cells demonstrated Pten as a toggle to modulate mitochondrial associated pathways. Therefore, our findings elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying lineage-specific differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to the midbrain/hindbrain progenitors, where Pten participates as one key regulator.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Miu, Chan, Ou, Wai-Nok Law and Chan."

Genomic DNA methylation patterns were assessed using the Agilent Human DNA Methylation Microarray.Results:We identified numerous differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) associated with antipsychotic response.CYP46A1,SPATS2, andATP6V1E1had the most significant DMPs, withpvalues of 2.50 × 10-6, 3.53 × 10-6, and 5.71 × 10-6, respectively. The top-ranked DMR was located on chromosome 7, corresponding to thePTPRN2gene with a Šidák-correctedp-value of 9.04 × 10-13. Additionally, a significant enrichment of synaptic function and neurotransmitters was found in the differentially methylated genes after gene ontology and pathway analysis.Conclusion:The identified DMP- and DMR-overlapping genes associated with antipsychotic response are related to synaptic function and neurotransmitters.

"36617744","Mediating effect of genome-wide DNA methylation on suicidal ideation induced by stressful events.","Psychiatr Genet","Schizophrenia is a debilitating disease that is associated with higher rates of death by unnatural causes including suicide. Exposure to stressful events is an important risk factor for suicidal ideation (SI); however, the mechanisms that link stress, SI, and suicide remain unclear. Epigenetic processes are involved in both vulnerability to suicidal behavior and stress. Therefore, we sought to study the relationship between epigenetic modifications and suicidal behavior and stress.This pilot study was conducted on 39 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (54% men and age 45.5 ± 12.7). We analyzed the effects of (a) stress exposure and (b) the mediation of DNA methylation [via an epigenetic wide association study (EWAS) of more than 450 000 CpG sites across the genome] on SI severity.The top CpG site mediating the effect of global stress exposure on SI was cg27660192 located in an intergenic region on chromosome 11, exerting a facilitating effect on worsening SI through DNA hypomethylation.These preliminary results indicate that DNA methylation in peripheral tissues can shed light on the complex relationship between stress and SI in schizophrenia.Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Lam].","Int J Mol Sci","The xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XET/XEH, also named XTH) family is a multigene family, the function of which plays a significant role in cell-wall rebuilding and stress tolerance in plants. However, the specific traits of theXTHgene family members and their expression pattern in different tissues and under stress have not been carried out in sweet potato. Thirty-six XTH genes were identified inI. batatas,all of which had conserved structures (Glyco_hydro_16). Based on Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic analysis theIbXTHscan be divided into three subfamilies-the I/II, IIIA, and IIIB subfamilies, which were unevenly distributed on 13 chromosomes, with the exception of Chr9 and Chr15. Multiple cis-acting regions related to growth and development, as well as stress responses, may be found in theIbXTHgene promoters. The segmental duplication occurrences greatly aided the evolution ofIbXTHs. The results of a collinearity analysis showed that theXTHgenes of sweet potato shared evolutionary history with three additional species, includingA. thaliana,G. max, andO. sativa. Additionally, based on the transcriptome sequencing data, the results revealed that theIbXTHshave different expression patterns in leaves, stems, the root body (RB), the distal end (DE), the root stock (RS), the proximal end (PE), the initiative storage root (ISR), and the fibrous root (FR), and many of them are well expressed in the roots. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis of FRs after hormone treatment of the roots indicated that IbXTH28 and IbXTH30 are up-regulated under salicylic acid (SA) treatment but down-regulated under methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. Attentionally, there were only two genes showing down-regulation under the cold and drought treatment. Collectively, all of the findings suggested that genes from the XTH family are crucial for root specificity. This study could provide a theoretical basis for further research on the molecular function of sweet potatoXTHgenes."

Here, we identified 2 SnRK1 catalytic α subunit encoding genes (GiSnRK1α1andGiSnRK1α2) and 21 FLZ genes inG. inflata. Polygenetic analysis showed that the 21 GiFLZs could be divided into three groups. A total of 10 representative GiFLZ proteins interact with GiSnRK1α1, and they display overlapped subcellular localization (mainly in the nucleus and the cytoplasm) when transiently expressed inNicotiana benthamianaleaf cells. Coinciding with the existence of various phytohormone-responsive and stress-responsive cis-regulatory elements in theGiSnRK1α andGiFLZgene promoters,GiFLZsare actively responsive to methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments, and severalGiFLZsandGiSnRK1α1are regulated by drought and saline-alkaline stresses. Interestingly,GiSnRK1α and 20 of 21GiFLZs(except forGiFLZ2) show higher expression in the roots than in the leaves. These data provide comprehensive information on the SnRK1 catalytic α subunit and the FLZ proteins in licorice for future functional characterization."

African Americans (AAs) shoulder a greater CRC burden than European Americans (EA) and are more likely to develop CRC at a younger age. The effects of aging in AA and EA normal rectal tissue have yet to be defined. Here, we performed epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis in the first, large-scale biracial cohort of normal rectum (n= 140 samples). We identified increased epigenetic age acceleration in EA than AA rectum (p= 3.91 × 10-4) using linear regression. We also identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with chronological aging in AA and EA, separately using DMRcate. Next, a consensus set of regions associated with cancer was identified through DMR analysis of two rectal cancer cohorts. The vast majority of AA DMRs were present in our analysis of aging in rectum of EA subjects, though rates of epigenetic drift were significantly greater in AA (p= 1.94 × 10-45). However, 3.66-fold more DMRs were associated with aging in rectum of EA subjects, many of which were also associated with rectal cancer. Our findings reveal a novel relationship between race, age, DNA methylation and rectal cancer risk that warrants further investigation."

Fluctuations in gene expression influenced by DNA methylation are critical for homeostatic responses in muscle. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this fluctuation regulation and myogenic differentiation of skeletal muscle. Here we report a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation dynamics in bovine skeletal muscle myogenesis after myostatin editing. We show that, after myostatin editing, an increase in TETs (DNA demethylases) and a concomitant increase in the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) control the myogenic development of skeletal muscle. Interestingly, enhancement of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling by RACK1 appears to be an essential driver of myogenic differentiation, as it was associated with an increase in myogenic differentiation marker factors (MyHC and MyoG) during muscle differentiation. Overall, our results suggest that loss of myostatin promotes the myogenic differentiation response in skeletal muscle by decreasing DNA methylation of RACK1."

The consumption of natural dietary components such as broccoli sprouts (BSp) and green tea polyphenols (GTPs) has demonstrated exciting potential in reducing the risk of BC through the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms. However, little is known about their impacts on reversing epigenomic aberrations that are centrally involved in the initiation and progression of BC. Previously, we have determined the efficacy of combined BSp and GTPs treatment on the inhibition of the growth of a mammary tumor in a transgenic Her2/neu mouse model. We sought to extend our previous study to identify universal biomarkers that represent common mechanistic changes among different mouse models in response to this dietary regime by including a new transgenic mouse model, C3(1)-SV40 TAg (SV40). As a result, we identified novel target genes that were differentially expressed and methylated in response to dietary botanicals when administered singly (BSp and GTPs) and in combination (BSp + GTPs) in both mouse models. We discovered more differentially expressed and methylated genes in the combination treatment group compared to the singly administered groups. Subsequently, several biological pathways related to epigenetic regulations were identified in response to the combination treatment. Furthermore, when compared to the BSp and GTPs treatment alone, the combinatorial treatment showed a more significant impact on the regulation of the epigenetic modifier activities involved in DNA methylation and histone modifications. Our study provides key insights about the impact of the combined administration of BSp and GTPs on BC using a multi-omics analysis, suggesting a combinatorial approach is more efficacious in preventing and inhibiting BC by impacting key tumor-related genes at transcriptomic and methylomic levels. Our findings could be further extrapolated as a comprehensive source for understanding the epigenetic modifications that are associated with the effects of these dietary botanicals on BC prevention."

We performed whole exome sequencing and methylation profiling on matched primary and recurrent tumors from four pediatric patients with hemispheric high-grade gliomas. Genetic analysis showed the presence of some variants shared between primary and recurrent tumors, along with other variants exclusive of primary or recurrent tumors.NSD1variants, all novel and not previously reported, were present at high frequency in our series (100%) and were all shared between the samples, independently of primary or recurrence. For every variant, in silico prediction tools estimated a high probability of altering protein function. The novelNSD1variant (c.5924T &gt; A; p.Leu1975His) was present in one in four cases at recurrence, and in two in four cases at primary. The novelNSD1variant (c.5993T &gt; A; p.Met1998Lys) was present in one in four cases both at primary and recurrence, and in one in four cases only at primary. The presence ofNSD1mutations only at recurrence may suggest that they can be sub-clonal, while the presence in both primary and recurrence implies that they can also represent early and stable events. Furthermore, their presence only in primary, but not in recurrent tumors, suggest thatNSD1mutations may also be influenced by treatment."

All the samples were subjected to wide panel-genomic sequencing. Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium Human Methylation 850 K BeadChip. RNA-seq and CIBERSORT analyses were performed to identify the immune characteristics in these two groups.Lesions from sMPLC patients had lower TMB levels than that from SPLC patients. sMPLC had a similar genetic mutational landscape with SPLC, despite some subgroup genetic discrepancies. Distinct DNA methylation patterns were identified between the two groups. The differentially methylated genes were related to immune response pathways. RNA-seq analyses revealed more immune-related DEGs in sMPLC. Accordingly, more immune-related biological processes and pathways were identified in sMPLC. Aberrant DNA methylation was associated with the abnormal expression of immune-related genes. CIBERSORT analysis revealed the infiltration of immune cells was different between the two groups.Our study for the first time demonstrated genetic, epigenetic, and immune profile discrepancies between sMPLC and SPLC.

However, questions concerning the quality of spermatozoa after treatment have arisen. While studies have shown evidence of DNA damage and aneuploidy in spermatozoa years following anticancer treatment, the sperm epigenome has received little attention. Our objectives here were to determine the impact of HD and TC, as well as their treatments, on sperm DNA methylation. Semen samples were collected from community controls (CC) and from men undergoing treatment for HD or TC, both before initiation of chemotherapy and at multiple times post-treatment. Sperm DNA methylation was assessed using genome-wide and locus-specific approaches.Imprinted gene methylation was not affected in the sperm of HD or TC men, before or after treatment. Prior to treatment, using Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450 K) arrays, a subset of 500 probes was able to distinguish sperm samples from TC, HD and CC subjects; differences between groups persisted post-treatment. Comparing altered sperm methylation between HD or TC patients versus CC men, twice as many sites were affected in TC versus HD men; for both groups, the most affected CpGs were hypomethylated. For TC patients, the promoter region of GDF2 contained the largest region of differential methylation. To assess alterations in DNA methylation over time/post-chemotherapy, serial samples from individual patients were compared. With restriction landmark genome scanning and 450 K array analyses, some patients who underwent chemotherapy showed increased alterations in DNA methylation, up to 2 to 3 years post-treatment, when compared to the CC cohort. Similarly, a higher-resolution human sperm-specific assay that includes assessment of environmentally sensitive regions, or ""dynamic sites,"" also demonstrated persistently altered sperm DNA methylation in cancer patients post-treatment and suggested preferential susceptibility of ""dynamic"" CpG sites.Distinct sperm DNA methylation signatures were present pre-treatment in men with HD and TC and may help explain increases in birth defects reported in recent clinical studies. Epigenetic defects in spermatozoa of some cancer survivors were evident even up to 2 years post-treatment. Abnormalities in the sperm epigenome both pre- and post-chemotherapy may contribute to detrimental effects on future reproductive health.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Identification of lysine methylation sites proteome-wide has been a critical barrier to identifying the non-histone substrates of KMTs and KDMs and for studying functions of non-histone lysine methylation. Detection of lysine methylation by mass spectrometry (MS) typically relies on the enrichment of methylated peptides by pan-methyllysine antibodies. In this study, we use peptide microarrays to show that pan-methyllysine antibodies have sequence bias, and we evaluate how the differential selectivity of these reagents impacts the detection of methylated peptides in MS-based workflows. We discovered that most commercially available pan-Kme antibodies have an in vitro sequence bias, and multiple enrichment approaches provide the most comprehensive coverage of the lysine methylome. Overall, global lysine methylation proteomics with multiple characterized pan-methyllysine antibodies resulted in the detection of 5089 lysine methylation sites on 2751 proteins from two human cell lines, nearly doubling the number of reported lysine methylation sites in the human proteome.© 2023.

Clinical trials of the efficacy of OT in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have reported mixed results due in part to ASD's complex etiology. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic variation contribute to variable endogenous OT levels that modulate sensitivity to OT therapy. To carry out this analysis, we integrated genome-wide profiles of DNA-methylation, transcriptional activity, and genetic variation with plasma OT levels in 290 participants with ASD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of OT. Our analysis identified genetic variants with novel association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known ASD risk genes. We also show subtle but statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with peripheral transcriptional activity and DNA-methylation profiles across several annotated gene sets. These findings broaden our understanding of the effects of the peripheral oxytocin system and provide novel genetic candidates for future studies to decode the complex etiology of ASD and its interaction with OT signaling and OT-based interventions. LAY SUMMARY: Oxytocin (OT) is an abundant chemical produced by neurons that plays an important role in social interaction and motivation. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to variable OT levels in the blood. To this, we integrated genetic, gene expression, and non-DNA regulated (epigenetic) signatures with blood OT levels in 290 participants with autism enrolled in an OT clinical trial. We identified genetic association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known autism risk genes. We also show statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with gene expression and epigenetic across several gene pathways. These findings broaden our understanding of the factors that influence OT levels in the blood for future studies to decode the complex presentation of autism and its interaction with OT and OT-based treatment.© 2023 The Authors.

"36607439","MethylC-analyzer: a comprehensive downstream pipeline for the analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation.","Bot Stud","DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic modification involved in multiple biological processes and diseases. Current approaches for measuring genome-wide DNA methylation via bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) include whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq). The computational analysis tools available for BS-seq data include customized aligners for mapping bisulfite-converted reads and computational pipelines for downstream data analysis. Current post-alignment methylation tools are specialized for the interpretation of CG methylation, which is known to dominate mammalian genomes, however, non-CG methylation (CHG and CHH, where H refers to A, C, or T) is commonly observed in plants and fungi and is closely associated with gene regulation, transposon silencing, and plant development. Thus, we have developed a MethylC-analyzer to analyze and visualize post-alignment WGBS, RRBS, and EM-seq data focusing on CG. The tool is able to also analyze non-CG sites to enhance deciphering genomes of plants and fungi. By processing aligned data and gene location files, MethylC-analyzer generates a genome-wide view of methylation levels and methylation in user-specified genomic regions. The meta-plot, for example, allows the investigation of DNA methylation within specific genomic elements. Moreover, our tool identifies differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and investigates the enrichment of genomic features associated with variable methylation. MethylC-analyzer functionality is not limited to specific genomes, and we demonstrated its performance on both plant and human BS-seq data.

"36604111","TXNIP DNA methylation is associated with glycemic control over 28 years in type 1 diabetes: findings from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) study.","BMJ Open Diabetes Res Care","DNA methylation (DNAme) has been cross-sectionally associated with type 2 diabetes and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the general population. However, longitudinal data and data in type 1 diabetes are currently very limited. Thus, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in an observational type 1 diabetes cohort to identify loci with DNAme associated with concurrent and future HbA1cs, as well as other clinical risk factors, over 28 years.Whole blood DNAme in 683 597 CpGs was analyzed in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications study of childhood onset (<17 years) type 1 diabetes (n=411). An EWAS of DNAme beta values and concurrent HbA1c was performed using linear models adjusted for diabetes duration, sex, pack years of smoking, estimated cell type composition variables, and technical/batch covariates. A longitudinal EWAS of subsequent repeated HbA1c measures was performed using mixed models. We further identified methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) for significant CpGs and conducted a Mendelian randomization.DNAme at cg19693031 (Chr 1,Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein(TXNIP)) and cg21534330 (Chr 17,Casein Kinase 1 Isoform Delta) was significantly inversely associated with concurrent HbA1c. In longitudinal analyses, hypomethylation of cg19693031 was associated with consistently higher HbA1c over 28 years, and with higher triglycerides, pulse rate, and albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) independently of HbA1c. We further identified 34 meQTLs inSLC2A1/SLC2A1-AS1significantly associated with cg19693031 DNAme.Our results extend prior findings thatTXNIPhypomethylation relates to worse glycemic control in type 1 diabetes by demonstrating the association persists over the long term. Additionally, the associations with triglycerides, pulse rate, and ACR suggestTXNIPDNAme could play a role in vascular damage independent of HbA1c. These findings strengthen potential for interventions targeting TXNIP to improve glycemic control in type 1 diabetes through its role inSLC2A1/glucose transporter 1-mediated glucose regulation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

"36602701","DNA Methylation Description of Hippocampus, Cortex, Amygdala, and Blood of Drug-Resistant Temporal Lobe Epilepsy.","Mol Neurobiol","Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation were observed in drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (DR-TLE), a disease that affects 25-30% of epilepsy patients. The main objective is to simultaneously describe DNA methylation patterns associated with DR-TLE in hippocampus, amygdala, surrounding cortex to the epileptogenic zone (SCEZ), and peripheral blood. An Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array was performed in 19 DR-TLE patients and 10 postmortem non-epileptic controls. Overall, 32, 59, and 3210 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) were associated with DR-TLE in the hippocampus, amygdala, and SCEZ, respectively. These DMP-affected genes were involved in neurotrophic and calcium signaling in the hippocampus and voltage-gated channels in SCEZ, among others. One of the hippocampus DMPs (cg26834418 (CHORDC1)) showed a strong blood-brain correlation with BECon and IMAGE-CpG, suggesting that it could be a potential surrogate peripheral biomarker of DR-TLE. Moreover, in three of the top SCEZ's DMPs (SHANK3, SBF1, and MCF2L), methylation status was verified with methylation-specific qPCR. The differentially methylated CpGs were classified in DMRs: 2 in the hippocampus, 12 in the amygdala, and 531 in the SCEZ. We identified genes that had not been associated to DR-TLE so far such as TBX5, EXOC7, and WRHN. The area with more DMPs associated with DR-TLE was the SCEZ, some of them related to voltage-gated channels. The DMPs found in the amygdala were involved in inflammatory processes. We also found a potential surrogate peripheral biomarker of DR-TLE. Thus, these results provide new insights into epigenetic modifications involved in DR-TLE.© 2022.

"36601577","MC profiling: a novel approach to analyze DNA methylation heterogeneity in genome-wide bisulfite sequencing data.","NAR Genom Bioinform","DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark implicated in crucial biological processes. Most of the knowledge about DNA methylation is based on bulk experiments, in which DNA methylation of genomic regions is reported as average methylation. However, average methylation does not inform on how methylated cytosines are distributed in each single DNA molecule. Here, we propose Methylation Class (MC) profiling as a genome-wide approach to the study of DNA methylation heterogeneity from bulk bisulfite sequencing experiments. The proposed approach is built on the concept of MCs, groups of DNA molecules sharing the same number of methylated cytosines. The relative abundances of MCs from sequencing reads incorporates the information on the average methylation, and directly informs on the methylation level of each molecule. By applying our approach to publicly available bisulfite-sequencing datasets, we individuated cell-to-cell differences as the prevalent contributor to methylation heterogeneity. Moreover, we individuated signatures of loci undergoing imprinting and X-inactivation, and highlighted differences between the two processes. When applying MC profiling to compare different conditions, we identified methylation changes occurring in regions with almost constant average methylation. Altogether, our results indicate that MC profiling can provide useful insights on the epigenetic status and its evolution at multiple genomic regions.© The Author(s) 2022.

"36600398","Comparison between indicine and taurine cattle DNA methylation reveals epigenetic variation associated to differences in morphological adaptive traits.","Epigenetics","Indicine and taurine subspecies present distinct morphological traits as a consequence of environmental adaptation and artificial selection. Although the two subspecies have been characterized and compared at genome-wide level and at specific loci, their epigenetic diversity has not yet been explored. In this work, Reduced Representation Bisulphite Sequencing (RRBS) profiling of the taurine Angus (A) and indicine Nellore (N) cattle breeds was applied to identify methylation differences between the two subspecies. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) of the same animals was performed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at cytosines in CpG dinucleotides and remove them from the differential methylation analysis. A total of 660,845 methylated cytosines were identified within the CpG context (CpGs) across the 10 animals sequenced (5 N and 5 A). A total of 25,765 of these were differentially methylated (DMCs). Most DMCs clustered in CpG stretches nearby genes involved in cellular and anatomical structure morphogenesis. Also, sequences flanking DMC were enriched in SNPs compared to all other CpGs, either methylated or unmethylated in the two subspecies. Our data suggest a contribution of epigenetics to the regulation and divergence of anatomical morphogenesis in the two subspecies relevant for cattle evolution and sub-species differentiation and adaptation."
"36600305","Methylation in MAD1L1 is associated with the severity of suicide attempt and phenotypes of depression.","Clin Epigenetics","Depression is a multifactorial disorder representing a significant public health burden. Previous studies have linked multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms with depressive phenotypes and suicidal behavior. MAD1L1 is a mitosis metaphase checkpoint protein that has been linked to depression in GWAS. Using a longitudinal EWAS approach in an adolescent cohort at two time points (n = 216 and n = 154), we identified differentially methylated sites that were associated with depression-related genetic variants in MAD1L1. Three methylation loci (cg02825527, cg18302629, and cg19624444) were consistently hypomethylated in the minor allele carriers, being cross-dependent on several SNPs. We further investigated whether DNA methylation at these CpGs is associated with depressive psychiatric phenotypes in independent cohorts. The first site (cg02825527) was hypomethylated in blood (exp(β) = 84.521, p value ~ 0.003) in participants with severe suicide attempts (n = 88). The same locus showed increased methylation in glial cells (exp(β) = 0.041, p value ~ 0.004) in the validation cohort, involving 29 depressed patients and 29 controls, and showed a trend for association with suicide (n = 40, p value ~ 0.089) and trend for association with depression treatment (n = 377, p value ~ 0.075). The second CpG (cg18302629) was significantly hypomethylated in depressed participants (exp(β) = 56.374, p value ~ 0.023) in glial cells, but did not show associations in the discovery cohorts. The last methylation site (cg19624444) was hypomethylated in the whole blood of severe suicide attempters; however, this association was at the borderline for statistical significance (p value ~ 0.061). This locus, however, showed a strong association with depression treatment in the validation cohort (exp(β) = 2.237, p value ~ 0.003) with 377 participants. The direction of associations between psychiatric phenotypes appeared to be different in the whole blood in comparison with brain samples for cg02825527 and cg19624444. The association analysis between methylation at cg18302629 and cg19624444 and MAD1L1 transcript levels in CD14+cells shows a potential link between methylation at these CpGs and MAD1L1 expression. This study suggests evidence that methylation at MAD1L1 is important for psychiatric health as supported by several independent cohorts.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36598481","Natural Recombination among Type I Restriction-Modification Systems Creates Diverse Genomic Methylation Patterns among Xylella fastidiosa Strains.","Appl Environ Microbiol","Xylella fastidiosa is an important bacterial plant pathogen causing high-consequence diseases in agricultural crops around the world. Although as a species X. fastidiosa can infect many host plants, there is significant variability between strains regarding virulence on specific host plant species and other traits. Natural competence and horizontal gene transfer are believed to occur frequently in X. fastidiosa and likely influence the evolution of this pathogen. However, some X. fastidiosa strains are difficult to manipulate genetically using standard transformation techniques. Several type I restriction-modification (R-M) systems are encoded in the X. fastidiosa genome, which may influence horizontal gene transfer and recombination. Type I R-M systems themselves may undergo recombination, exchanging target recognition domains (TRDs) between specificity subunits (hsdS) to generate novel alleles with new target specificities. In this study, several conserved type I R-M systems were compared across 129 X. fastidiosa genome assemblies representing all known subspecies and 32 sequence types. Forty-four unique TRDs were identified among 50hsdSalleles, which are arrayed in 31 allele profiles that are generally conserved within a monophyletic cluster of strains. Inactivating mutations were identified in type I R-M systems of specific strains, showing heterogeneity in the complements of functional type I R-M systems across X. fastidiosa. Genomic DNA methylation patterns were characterized in 20 X. fastidiosa strains and associated with type I R-M system allele profiles. Overall, these data suggesthsdSgenes recombine amongXylellastrains and/or unknown donors, and the resulting TRD reassortment establishes differential epigenetic modifications acrossXylellalineages.IMPORTANCEEconomic impacts on agricultural production due to X. fastidiosa have been severe in the Americas, Europe, and parts of Asia. Despite a long history of research on this pathogen, certain fundamental questions regarding the biology, pathogenicity, and evolution of X. fastidiosa have still not been answered. Wide-scale whole-genome sequencing has begun to provide more insight into X. fastidiosa genetic diversity and horizontal gene transfer, but the mechanics of genomic recombination in natural settings and the extent to which this directly influences bacterial phenotypes such as plant host range are not well understood. Genome methylation is an important factor in horizontal gene transfer and bacterial recombination that has not been comprehensively studied in X. fastidiosa. This study characterizes methylation associated with type I restriction-modification systems across a wide range of X. fastidiosa strains and lays the groundwork for a better understanding of X. fastidiosa biology and evolution through epigenetics."

We report a complex prenatal diagnosis with discordant results from cultured and uncultured samples. A pregnant woman was referred for placental mesenchymal dysplasia and fetal omphalocele. Karyotype, array-CGH and Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) testing (methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) of 11p15) performed on amniocytes were negative. After intrauterine fetal demise, the clinical suspicion persisted and BWS MS-MLPA was repeated on cultured cells from umbilical cord and amniotic fluid, revealing a mosaicism for KvH19 hypermethylation/KCNQ1OT1:TSS:DMR hypomethylation. These results, along with microsatellite analysis of the BWS region, were consistent with mosaic paternal 11p15 isodisomy. A concurrent maternal contamination exclusion test, analyzing polymorphic microsatellite markers on multiple chromosomes, showed an imbalance in favor of paternal alleles at all examined loci on cultured amniocytes and umbilical cord samples. This led to suspicion of mosaic GWpUPD, later confirmed by SNP-array, identifying a mosaic genome-wide paternal isodisomy affecting 60% of fetal cells. The assessment of mosaic GWpUPD requires multiple approaches beyond the current established diagnostic processes, also entertaining possible low-rate mosaicism.

We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of a clinically and neuropathologically characterized cohort of 296 brains, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-demented controls (ND), exploring the relationship with the RNA expression from matched donors. We detected 5246 CpGs and 832 regions differentially methylated, finding overlap with previous EWAS but also new associations. CpGs previously identified in ANK1, MYOC, and RHBDF2 were differentially methylated, and one of our top hits (GPR56) was not previously detected. ANK1 was differentially methylated at the region level, along with APOE and RHBDF2. Only a small number of genes showed a correlation between DNA methylation and RNA expression statistically significant. Multiblock partial least-squares discriminant analysis showed several CpG sites and RNAs discriminating AD and ND (AUC = 0.908) and strongly correlated with each other. Furthermore, the CpG site cg25038311 was negatively correlated with the expression of 22 genes. Finally, with the functional epigenetic module analysis, we identified a protein-protein network characterized by inverse RNA/DNA methylation correlation and enriched for ""Regulation of insulin-like growth factor transport"", with IGF1 as the hub gene. Our results confirm and extend the previous EWAS, providing new information about a brain region not previously explored in AD DNA methylation studies. The relationship between DNA methylation and gene expression is not significant for most of the genes in our sample, consistently with the complexities in the gene expression regulation.© 2023.

We aimed to construct an individualized DNA methylation-based signature for CD8 + TILs (CD8 + MeTIL) that may characterize melanoma immune microenvironment and guide therapeutic selection.The transcriptome profiles and DNA methylation data of 457 melanoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed. Differential methylation analysis between groups with high and low CD8 + TILs was performed to select differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and define CD8 + MeTIL. The prognostic value of CD8 + MeTIL and its predictive value for immunotherapy response were investigated using multiple melanoma cohorts.We successfully constructed the CD8 + MeTIL signature based on four DMPs. The survival analyses showed that higher CD8 + MeTIL score was associated with worse survival outcomes in TCGA-SKCM and GSE144487 cohorts. The ROC curve for the predictive analysis revealed that the survival prediction of CD8 + MeTIL score was superior compared with CD8 + TILs (CIBERSORT) and CD8B mRNA expression. Furthermore, we founded that tumors with higher CD8 + MeTIL score were marked with immunosuppressive characteristics, including low immune score and downregulated immune-related pathways. More importantly, the CD8 + MeTIL score showed a potential predictive value for the benefit from immunotherapy in two published cohorts. When combined CD8 + MeTIL with PD-L1 expression, the patient classification showed significantly different immunotherapy response rates and long-term survival outcomes.The CD8 + MeTIL signature might be as a novel method to evaluate CD8 + TILs and guide immunotherapy approaches.© 2023.

Liver fibrosis was found to exist in all kinds of chronic liver diseases. Many studies suggested that DNA methylation was associated with the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis. This study aimed to quantitatively detect DNA methylation changes in the whole genome in fibrotic liver tissues of mice.Liver fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 4 weeks. A genome-wide methylome analysis was performed using 850K BeadChips assays. The methylation status of 27 CpG dinucleotides located in 3 genes was detected by pyrosequencing to confirm chip data accuracy, and mRNA expressions of these 3 genes were examined by RT-qPCR methods.A total of 130,068 differentially methylated sites (DMS, 58,474 hypermethylated, and 71,594 hypomethylated) between fibrotic liver tissues and control mice liver tissues were identified by the 850k BeadChips array. Consistency between pyrosequencing data and 850k BeadChips array data was observed (R=0.928;P<0.01). Apoptosis, positive regulation of transcription of Notch receptor target, and negative regulation of p38MAPK signal cascade activities were significantly enriched in the Gene Ontology (GO) analyses. Cholesterol metabolism, bile secretion, and more biosynthesis and metabolism pathways were enriched in KEGG pathway analyses. Ten key genes were identified by the Cytoscape plugin cytoHubba.7850 genes were found to have methylation change in fibrotic liver tissues of mice, which facilitates future research for clinical application."
"36593717","Intergenerational arsenic exposure on the mouse epigenome and metabolic physiology.","Environ Mol Mutagen","Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is one of the largest toxic exposures to impact humanity worldwide. Exposure to iAs during pregnancy may disrupt the proper remodeling of the epigenome of F1 developing offspring and potentially their F2 grand-offspring via disruption of fetal primordial germ cells (PGCs). There is a limited understanding between the correlation of disease phenotype and methylation profile within offspring of both generations and whether it persists to adulthood. Our study aims to understand the intergenerational effects of in utero iAs exposure on the epigenetic profile and onset of disease phenotypes within F1 and F2 adult offspring, despite the lifelong absence of direct arsenic exposure within these generations. We exposed F0 female mice (C57BL6/J) to the following doses of iAs in drinking water 2 weeks before pregnancy until the birth of the F1 offspring: 1, 10, 245, and 2300 ppb. We found sex- and dose-specific changes in weight and body composition that persist from early time to adulthood within both generations. Fasting blood glucose challenge suggests iAs exposure causes dysregulation of glucose metabolism, revealing generational, exposure, and sex-specific differences. Toward understanding the mechanism, genome-wide DNA methylation data highlights exposure-specific patterns in liver, finding dysregulation within genes associated with cancer, T2D, and obesity. We also identified regions containing persistently differentially methylated CpG sites between F1 and F2 generations. Our results indicate the F1 developing embryos and their PGCs, which will result in F2 progeny, retain epigenetic damage established during the prenatal period and are associated with adult metabolic dysfunction.© 2023 Environmental Mutagen Society."
"36593667","First report of Klebsiella Leaf Streak on Sorghum Caused by Klebsiella variicola in Haryana, India.","Plant Dis","Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench) is one of the top ten cereal crops in the world and is grown for fodder and seed purposes. During the fall of 2019 to 2022, a disease causing small to long streaks on leaves was observed in sorghum fields of Hisar (29° 9' 6.6996'' N, 75° 43' 16.0428'' E), Rohtak (28° 53' 43.8540'' N, 76° 36' 23.8068'' E) and Mohindergarh (28° 16' 6.0492'' N, 76° 9' 3.3552'' E) regions of Haryana between July and October. The reddish brown streaks were observed in the interveinal spaces of upper and lower leaves. The disease incidence reached 20-30% of plants in affected fields. The diseased leaf tissues were disinfected with 70% alcohol and placed in a tube with sterile water. After 30 minutes, 100 µl of the suspension was inoculated onto nutrient agar medium, incubated at 28 ± 2°C for three days, and a pure culture was obtained by restreaking on nutrient agar (Janse, 2005). The rod-shaped gram-negative bacterium with round, cream to white colonies was positive for methyl red, citrate utilization, urease activity, and glucose, lactose, sorbitol, rhamnose and sucrose fermentation tests. The genomic DNA of the bacterial suspension was extracted and 16S rDNA was amplified using universal 27F/1492R primers (Marchesi et al. 1998), resulting in tentative identification as Klebsiella sp. It was further confirmed with PCR amplification of Klebsiella specific primers (F:5'-CGCGTACTATACGCCATGAACGTA-3'; R:5'-ACCGTTGATCACTTCGGTCAGG-3') for gyrA gene (Brisse and Verhoef 2001). Discrete PCR amplicons of 1,500 (16S rDNA) and 300 bp (gyrA) were observed in a 1% (w/v) agarose gel. Forward and reverse DNA sequencing of both amplicons of the Hisar isolate (VMKV101) was carried out using a BDT v3.1 Cycle sequencing kit and consensus sequences were generated by using the program SeqMan Ultra (DNASTAR Lasergene). Sequences of the PCR products were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers MZ569433 (16S rDNA) and OP390080 (gyrA). The 16S rDNA sequence was 97.32% similar to K. variicola strain 13450 (CP026013; 1,450/1,490 bp) and the gyrA sequence had 99.66% similarity to K. variicola strain FH-1 (CP054254; 297/298 bp). A 16S RNA-based phylogenetic tree done by MEGA11 (Tamura et al. 2021) using the Maximum Likelihood method showed that strain VMKV101 clustered with K. variicola type strain F2R9. The complete bacterial genome (GCA025629215), sequenced by the Ion GeneStudio S5 system using Ion 530 chips (Thermo Fisher Scientific), was 99.03% identical by average nucleotide identity (ANI) to the type genome (CP045783) of Klebsiella variicola, with 87.8% genome coverage. For pathogenicity testing, a bacterial suspension (10 ml, 1×107 colony forming units/ml) was injected into the whole whorl after mechanical injury on 15-20 days old seedlings of the susceptible genotype HC-171, then plants were incubated at 35 ± 2°C, >80% relative humidity. Control plants were injected with sterile distilled water. Initial symptoms were observed on leaves of inoculated plants after 5 to 7 days as narrow, small longitudinal reddish brown streaks. As the disease progressed, the streaks on the leaf blade increased in number and size maintaining the reddish brown color. These streaks had slightly wavy margins and were surrounded by bright yellow halos. After 15 to 20 days, the streaks were 0.5 to 2.0 mm wide and 1.0 to 5.0 cm long, occasionally up to 10.0 cm long on both side of the leaves. Over time, neighboring streaks coalesced to form large necrotic areas. All inoculated plants exhibited identical symptoms. No symptoms were observed on control leaves. The reisolated bacterium from diseased sorghum leaves showed exactly the same morphological, biochemical and 16S RNA and gyrA molecular characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first report of K. variicola causing a leaf streak disease on sorghum. Klebsiella species primarily cause diseases in humans and animals, but K. variicola has been found to incite banana soft rot (Fan et al. 2015) and K. aerogenes to cause stem rot in pearl millet (Malik et al. 2022). Differences of prevalence, spread and control between K. variicola and two other bacteria (Xanthomonas vasicola pv. holcicola causing Bacterial leaf streak; Paraburkholderia andropogonis causing Bacterial leaf stripe) causing leaf streak diseases on sorghum need to be determined. The identification of Klebsiella leaf streak disease lays the groundwork for future investigations into epidemiology and management of K. variicola on sorghum."

DNA methylation machinery controls the dynamic regulation of methylation patterns in discrete brain regions.This review aims to describe the role of DNA methylation in inhibiting and progressing neurological and neurodegenerative disorders and therapeutic approaches.A Systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was conducted for all qualified studies from 2000 to 2022.For the current need of time, we have focused on the DNA methylation role in neurological and neurodegenerative diseases and the expression of genes involved in neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's, Depression, and Rett Syndrome. Finally, it appears that the various epigenetic changes do not occur separately and that DNA methylation and histone modification changes occur side by side and affect each other. We focused on the role of modification of DNA methylation in several genes associated with depression (NR3C1, NR3C2, CRHR1, SLC6A4, BDNF, and FKBP5), Rett syndrome (MECP2), Alzheimer's, depression (APP, BACE1, BIN1 or ANK1) and Parkinson's disease (SNCA), as well as the co-occurring modifications to histones and expression of non-coding RNAs. Understanding these epigenetic changes and their interactions will lead to better treatment strategies.This review captures the state of understanding of the epigenetics of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. With new epigenetic mechanisms and targets undoubtedly on the horizon, pharmacological modulation and regulation of epigenetic processes in the brain holds great promise for therapy.© 2022 The Authors."

Clinical features of WHS include distinct dysmorphic facial features, growth restriction, developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and other malformations. TheNSD2gene localizes within this critical region along with several other genes. Pathogenic variants inNSD2cause Rauch-Steindl (RAUST) syndrome. Clinical features of RAUST syndrome partially overlap with WHS, however epilepsy and the recognizable facial gestalt are not observed. Here, we report a case of a young boy who presented with developmental delay, dysmorphic features and short stature. After negative chromosomal microarray and whole exome sequencing, genomic DNA methylation episignature analysis was performed. Episignatures are sensitive and specific genome-wide DNA methylation patterns associated with a growing number of rare disorders. The patient was positive for the WHS episignature. Reanalysis of the patient's exome data identified a previously undetected frameshift variant inNSD2, leading to a diagnosis of RAUST. This report demonstrates the clinical utility of DNA methylation episignature analysis for unresolved patients, and provides insight into the overlapping pathology between WHS and RAUST as demonstrated by the similarities in their genomic DNA methylation profiles.Copyright © 2022 McConkey, White-Brown, Kerkhof, Dyment and Sadikovic."
"36656803","Using epigenomics to understand cellular responses to environmental influences in diseases.","PLoS Genet","It is a generally accepted model that environmental influences can exert their effects, at least in part, by changing the molecular regulators of transcription that are described as epigenetic. As there is biochemical evidence that some epigenetic regulators of transcription can maintain their states long term and through cell division, an epigenetic model encompasses the idea of maintenance of the effect of an exposure long after it is no longer present. The evidence supporting this model is mostly from the observation of alterations of molecular regulators of transcription following exposures. With the understanding that the interpretation of these associations is more complex than originally recognised, this model may be oversimplistic; therefore, adopting novel perspectives and experimental approaches when examining how environmental exposures are linked to phenotypes may prove worthwhile. In this review, we have chosen to use the example of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common, complex human disease with strong environmental and genetic influences. We describe how epigenomic approaches combined with emerging functional genetic and single-cell genomic techniques are poised to generate new insights into the pathogenesis of environmentally influenced human disease phenotypes exemplified by NAFLD.Copyright: © 2023 Wattacheril et al.

The BBC encompasses two linked study protocols:The Preterm Birth Studyserves as the baseline recruitment in the BBC. It aims to address fundamental questions about the causes and consequences of PTB. The study oversamples preterm babies using a case/control study design, in which cases are defined as mothers who deliver a preterm and/or low birthweight baby (<2500 grams regardless of gestational age). Controls are enrolled at a 2:1 control/case ratio and matched by maternal age (±5 years), self-reported race and ethnicity, and date of delivery (± 7 days for case delivery). From inception, it was designed as a comprehensive gene-environmental study of PTB. As a natural extension,the Children's Health Study, under a separate but linked IRB protocol, is a longitudinal follow-up study of the participants who were recruited at birth in the Preterm Birth Study and who continue pediatric care at BMC. This linked model allows for investigation of early life origins of pediatric and chronic disease in a prospective cohort design. The BBC is one of the largest and longest NIH-funded prospective birth cohort studies in the US, consisting of 8733 mother-child dyads enrolled in the Preterm Birth Study at birth, and of those, 3,592 children have been enrolled in the Children's Health Study, with a median follow-up of 14.5 years. The BBC mirrors the urban, under-resourced and underrepresented BIPOC population served by BMC. A high proportion of BBC children were born prematurely and had chronic health conditions (e.g., asthma, obesity and elevated blood pressure) in childhood. The BBC's long-term goal has been to build a large, comprehensive database (epidemiological, clinical, multi-omics) and biospecimen repository to elucidate early life origins of pediatric and chronic diseases and identify modifiable upstream factors (e.g., psychosocial, environmental, nutritional) to improve health across the life course for BIPOC mothers and children."
"36609306","Alterations of SOCS1 and SOCS3 transcript levels, but not promoter methylation levels in subcutaneous adipose tissues in obese women.","BMC Endocr Disord","Animal model studies suggest that change in the members of the suppressor of the cytokine signaling (SOCS) family (mainly SOCS1 and SOCS3) is linked to the pathogenesis of obesity-related metabolic disorders. Moreover, epigenetic modification is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the SOCS gene family. Here, we aimed to evaluate the mRNA expression as well as gene promoter methylation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from obese women compared to normal-weight subjects. We also intend to identify the possible association of SOCS1 and SOCS3 transcript levels with metabolic parameters in the context of obesity.This study was conducted on women with obesity (n = 24) [body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2] and women with normal-weight (n = 22) (BMI < 25 kg/m2). Transcript levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were evaluated by real-time PCR in SAT from all participants. After bisulfite treatment of DNA, methylation-specific PCR was used to assess the putative methylation of 10 CpG sites in the promoter of SOCS1 and 13 CpG sites in SOCS3 in SAT from women with obesity and normal weight.It was found that unlike SOCS3, which disclosed an elevating expression pattern, the expression level of SOCS1 was lower in the women with obesity as compared with their non-obese counterparts (P-value = 0.03 for SOCS1 transcript level and P-value = 0.011 for SOCS3 transcript level). As for the analysis of promoter methylation, it was found that SOCS1 and SOCS3 methylation were not significantly different between the individuals with obesity and normal weight (P-value = 0.45 and P-value = 0.89). Correlation analysis indicated that the transcript level of SOCS1 mRNA expression had an inverse correlation with BMI, hs-CRP levels, HOMA-IR, and insulin levels. However, the SOCS3 transcript level showed a positive correlation with BMI, waist-to-height ratio, waist circumference, hip circumference, hs-CRP, HOMA-IR, insulin, fasting blood glucose, and total cholesterol. Interestingly, HOMA-IR is the predictor of the transcript level of SOCS1 (β =  - 0.448, P-value = 0.003) and SOCS3 (β = 0.465, P-value = 0.002) in SAT of all participants.Our findings point to alterations of SOCS1 and SOCS3 transcript levels, but not promoter methylation levels in subcutaneous adipose tissues from women with obesity. Moreover, mRNA expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in SAT was associated with known obesity indices, insulin resistance, and hs-CRP, suggesting the contribution of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in the pathogenesis of obesity-related metabolic abnormalities. However, further studies are required to establish this concept.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36671760","Evaluation of Epigenetic Age Acceleration Scores and Their Associations with CVD-Related Phenotypes in a Population Cohort.","Biology (Basel)","We evaluated associations between nine epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) scores and 18 cardiometabolic phenotypes using an Eastern European ageing population cohort richly annotated for a diverse set of phenotypes (subsample,n= 306; aged 45-69 years). This was implemented by splitting the data into groups with positive and negative EAAs. We observed strong association between all EAA scores and sex, suggesting that any analysis of EAAs should be adjusted by sex. We found that some sex-adjusted EAA scores were significantly associated with several phenotypes such as blood levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase and low-density lipoprotein, smoking status, annual alcohol consumption, multiple carotid plaques, and incident coronary heart disease status (not necessarily the same phenotypes for different EAAs). We demonstrated that even after adjusting EAAs for sex, EAA-phenotype associations remain sex-specific, which should be taken into account in any downstream analysis involving EAAs. The obtained results suggest that in some EAA-phenotype associations, negative EAA scores (i.e., epigenetic age below chronological age) indicated more harmful phenotype values, which is counterintuitive. Among all considered epigenetic clocks, GrimAge was significantly associated with more phenotypes than any other EA scores in this Russian sample."

The associations of the combination of long-term variability in physiological measures with mortality and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) remain largely unknown.We constructed a composite score of physiological variability (0-3) of large variability in BWV, PRV, and BPV (the top tertiles) in 2006/2008-2014/2016 in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and 2011-2015 in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). All-cause mortality was documented through 2018. EAA was calculated using thirteen DNA methylation-based epigenetic clocks among 1047 participants in a substudy of the HRS. We assessed the relation of the composite score to the risk of mortality among 6566 participants in the HRS and 6906 participants in the CHARLS by Cox proportional models and then investigated its association with EAA using linear regression models.A higher score of variability was associated with higher mortality risk in both cohorts (pooled hazard ratio [HR] per one-point increment, 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18, 1.39; P-heterogeneity = 0.344), after adjustment for multiple confounders and baseline physiological measures. Specifically, each SD increment in BWV, PRV, and BPV was related to 21% (95% CI: 15%, 28%), 6% (0%, 13%), and 12% (4%, 19%) higher hazard of mortality, respectively. The composite score was significantly related to EAA in second-generation clocks trained on health outcomes (e.g., standardized coefficient = 0.126 in the Levine clock, 95% CI: 0.055, 0.196) but not in most first-generation clocks trained on chronological age.Larger variability in physiological measures was associated with a higher risk of mortality and faster EAA.© 2023.

"36644152","Premature aging in childhood cancer survivors.","Oncol Lett","Progress in medicine has increased the survival time of children suffering from cancer; >80% of patients survive for at least 5 years from the end of treatment. However, there are late effects of anticancer therapy, which accompany this success. Two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) have at least one late effect (any side effects or complications of anticancer treatment that appear months to years after the completion of treatment), e.g. endocrinopathies, cardiovascular diseases or subsequent cancers, and half of these late effects are serious or life threatening. These late consequences of childhood cancer treatment pose a serious health, social and economic problem. A common mechanism for developing a number of late effects is the onset of premature biological aging, which is associated with the early onset of chronic diseases and death. Cellular senescence in cancer survivors is caused by therapy that can induce chromosomal aberrations, mutations, telomere shortening, epigenetic alterations and mitochondrial dysfunctions. The mechanisms of accelerated aging in cancer survivors have not yet been fully clarified. The measurement of biological age in survivors can help improve the understanding of aging mechanisms and identify risk factors for premature aging. However, to the best of our knowledge, no single marker for the evaluation of biological or functional age is known, so it is therefore necessary to measure the consequences of anticancer treatment using complex assessments. The present review presents an overview of premature aging in CCSs and of the mechanisms involved in its development, focusing on the association of senescence and late effects.Copyright © 2022, Spandidos Publications."
"36611826","A Blood-Based Molecular Clock for Biological Age Estimation.","Cells","In the last decade, extensive efforts have been made to identify biomarkers of biological age. DNA methylation levels of ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2 (ELOVL2) and the signal joint T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (sjTRECs) represent the most promising candidates. Although these two non-redundant biomarkers echo important biological aspects of the ageing process in humans, a well-validated molecular clock exploiting these powerful candidates has not yet been formulated. The present study aimed to develop a more accurate molecular clock in a sample of 194 Italian individuals by re-analyzing the previously obtained EVOLV2 methylation data together with the amount of sjTRECs in the same blood samples. The proposed model showed a high prediction accuracy both in younger individuals with an error of about 2.5 years and in older subjects where a relatively low error was observed if compared with those reported in previously published studies. In conclusion, an easy, cost-effective and reliable model to measure the individual rate and the quality of aging in human population has been proposed. Further studies are required to validate the model and to extend its use in an applicative context."

Using synthetic network structures, we show that the method is capable of identifying aging variables in cohorts as small as 5,000 participants. Applying the methodology to the observational human cohort, we find that interleukin-6, vascular calcification, and red-blood distribution width are strong predictors of baseline fitness. More important, we find that red blood cell counts, kidney function, and phosphate level are directly linked to the Gompertzian aging rate. Our model therefore enables discovery of processes directly linked to the aging rate of our species. We further show that this epidemiological framework can be applied as a causal inference engine to simulate the effects of interventions on physiology and longevity.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"36674935","Recent Advances in the Knowledge of the Mechanisms of Leptin Physiology and Actions in Neurological and Metabolic Pathologies.","Int J Mol Sci","Excess body weight is frequently associated with low-grade inflammation. Evidence indicates a relationship between obesity and cancer, as well as with other diseases, such as diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, in which inflammation and the actions of various adipokines play a role in the pathological mechanisms involved in these disorders. Leptin is mainly produced by adipose tissue in proportion to fat stores, but it is also synthesized in other organs, where leptin receptors are expressed. This hormone performs numerous actions in the brain, mainly related to the control of energy homeostasis. It is also involved in neurogenesis and neuroprotection, and central leptin resistance is related to some neurological disorders, e.g., Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. In peripheral tissues, leptin is implicated in the regulation of metabolism, as well as of bone density and muscle mass. All these actions can be affected by changes in leptin levels and the mechanisms associated with resistance to this hormone. This review will present recent advances in the molecular mechanisms of leptin action and their underlying roles in pathological situations, which may be of interest for revealing new approaches for the treatment of diseases where the actions of this adipokine might be compromised."

Besides the fact that increasing oil content is the most important peanut breeding objective, a proper understanding of its molecular mechanism controlling oil accumulation is still lacking.We investigated this aspect by performing comparative transcriptomics from developing seeds between three wild and five cultivated peanut varieties.The analyses not only showed species-specific grouping transcriptional profiles but also detected two gene clusters with divergent expression patterns between two species enriched in lipid metabolism. Further analysis revealed that expression alteration of lipid metabolic genes with co-expressed transcription factors in wild peanut led to enhanced activity of oil biogenesis and retarded the rate of lipid degradation. In addition, bisulfite sequencing was conducted to characterize the variation of DNA methylation between wild allotetraploid (245, WH 10025) and cultivated allotetraploid (Z16, Zhh 7720) genotypes. CG and CHG context methylation was found to antagonistically correlate with gene expression during seed development. Differentially methylated region analysis and transgenic assay further illustrated that variations of DNA methylation between wild and cultivated peanuts could affect the oil contentviaaltering the expression of peroxisomal acyl transporter protein (Araip.H6S1B).From the results, we deduced that DNA methylation may negatively regulate lipid metabolic genes and transcription factors to subtly affect oil accumulation divergence between wild and cultivated peanuts. Our work provided the first glimpse on the regulatory mechanism of gene expression altering for oil accumulation in wild peanut and gene resources for future breeding applications.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Wu, Pandey, Huang, Luo, Chen, Zhou, Chen, Huai, Yu, Chen, Guo, Lei, Liao, Varshney and Jiang."

Excellent recent reviews address diverse aspects of immunological re-search into cardiovascular diseases. Here, we specifically focus on selected studies taking advantage of advanced state-of-the-art molecular genetic methods ranging from genome-wide epi/transcriptome mapping and variant scanning to optogenetics and chemogenetics. First, we discuss the emerging clinical relevance of advanced diagnostics for cardiovascular diseases, including those associated with COVID-19-with a focus on the role of inflammation in cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias. Second, we consider newly identified immunological interactions at organ and system levels which affect cardiovascular pathogenesis. Thus, studies into immune influences arising from the intestinal system are moving towards therapeutic exploitation. Further, powerful new research tools have enabled novel insight into brain-immune system interactions at unprecedented resolution. This latter line of investigation emphasizes the strength of influence of emotional stress-acting through defined brain regions-upon viral and cardiovascular disorders.

However, numerous previous studies examined the epigenetic age acceleration in SCZ patients and yielded inconclusive results. In this study, we propose to explore the epigenetic age acceleration in drug-naive first-episode SCZ (FSCZ) patients and investigate whether epigenetic age acceleration is associated with antipsychotic treatment, psychotic symptoms, cognition, and subcortical volumes.We assessed the epigenetic age in 38 drug-naive FSCZ patients and 38 healthy controls by using three independent clocks, including Horvath, Hannum and Levine algorithms. The epigenetic age measurements in SCZ patients were repeated after receiving 8 weeks risperidone monotherapy.Our findings showed significantly positive correlations between epigenetic ages assessed by three clocks and chronological age in both FSCZ patients and healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, drug-naive FSCZ patients have a significant epigenetic age deceleration in Horvath clock (p = 0.01), but not in Hannum clock (p = 0.07) and Levine clock (p = 0.43). The epigenetic ages of Hannum clock (p = 0.002) and Levine clock (p = 0.01) were significantly accelerated in SCZ patients after 8-week risperidone treatment. However, no significant associations between epigenetic age acceleration and psychotic symptoms, cognitive function, as well as subcortical volumes were observed in FSCZ patients.These results demonstrate that distinct epigenetic clocks are sensitive to different aspects of aging process.

These include late-onset neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), which represent a challenge for biomedical research and drug development due to the impossibility to access to viable human brain specimens. Advancements in reprogramming technologies have allowed to obtain neurons from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or directly from somatic cells (iNs), leading to the generation of better models to understand the molecular mechanisms and design of new drugs. Nevertheless, iPSC technology faces some limitations due to reprogramming-associated cellular rejuvenation which resets the aging hallmarks of donor cells. Given the prominent role of aging for the development and manifestation of late-onset NDDs, this suggests that this approach is not the most suitable to accurately model age-related diseases. Direct neuronal reprogramming, by which a neuron is formedviadirect conversion from a somatic cell without going through a pluripotent intermediate stage, allows the possibility to generate patient-derived neurons that maintain aging and epigenetic signatures of the donor. This aspect may be advantageous for investigating the role of aging in neurodegeneration and for finely dissecting underlying pathological mechanisms. Here, we will compare iPSC and iN models as regards the aging status and explore how this difference is reported to affect the phenotype of NDDin vitromodels.Copyright © 2022 Aversano, Caiazza and Caiazzo."
"36647013","Gene expressions between obligate bamboo-eating pandas and non-herbivorous mammals reveal converged specialized bamboo diet adaptation.","BMC Genomics","It is inevitable to change the function or expression of genes during the environmental adaption of species. Both the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and red panda (Ailurus fulgens) belong to Carnivora and have developed similar adaptations to the same dietary switch to bamboos at the morphological and genomic levels. However, the genetic adaptation at the gene expression level is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to examine the gene expression patterns of giant and red panda convergent specialized bamboo-diets. We examined differences in liver and pancreas transcriptomes between the two panda species and other non-herbivorous species.The clustering and PCA plots suggested that the specialized bamboo diet may drive similar expression shifts in these two species of pandas. Therefore, we focused on shared liver and pancreas DEGs (differentially expressed genes) in the giant and red panda relative to other non-herbivorous species. Genetic convergence occurred at multiple levels spanning carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, and lysine degradation. The shared adaptive convergence DEGs in both organs probably be an evolutionary response to the high carbohydrate, low lipid and lysine bamboo diet. Convergent expression of those nutrient metabolism-related genes in both pandas was an intricate process and subjected to multi-level regulation, including DNA methylation and transcription factor. A large number of lysine degradation and lipid metabolism related genes were hypermethylated in promoter regions in the red panda. Most genes related to carbohydrate metabolism had reduced DNA methylation with increased mRNA expression in giant pandas. Unlike the red panda, the core gene of the lysine degradation pathway (AASS) doesn't exhibit hypermethylation modification in the giant panda, and dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that transcription factor, NR3C1, functions as a transcriptional activator in AASS transcription through the binding to AASS promoter region.Our results revealed the adaptive expressions and regulations of the metabolism-related genes responding to the unique nutrients in bamboo food and provided data accumulation and research hints for the future revelation of complex mechanism of two pandas underlying convergent adaptation to a specialized bamboo diet.© 2023.

Using EpiTOF profiles of >55,000,000 peripheral mononuclear blood cells from 158 healthy human subjects, we show that neural processes (NP) have significantly higher accuracy than linear regression andk-nearest neighbors models to impute the abundance of an HPTM. Next, we infer the direction of association to show we recapitulate known HPTM associations and identify several previously unidentified ones in healthy individuals. Using this framework in an influenza vaccine cohort, we identify changes in associations between 6 pairs of HPTMs 30 days following vaccination, of which several have been shown to be involved in innate memory. These results demonstrate the utility of our framework in identifying directed interactions between HPTMs.© 2022 The Authors."
"36611870","Advanced Maternal Age Differentially Affects Embryonic Tissues with the Most Severe Impact on the Developing Brain.","Cells","Advanced maternal age (AMA) poses the single greatest risk to a successful pregnancy. Apart from the impact of AMA on oocyte fitness, aged female mice often display defects in normal placentation. Placental defects in turn are tightly correlated with brain and cardiovascular abnormalities. It therefore follows that placenta, brain and heart development may be particularly susceptible to the impact of AMA. In the current study, we compared global transcriptomes of placentas, brains, hearts, and facial prominences from mid-gestation mouse conceptuses developed in young control (7-13 wks) and aging (43-50 wks) females. We find that AMA increases transcriptional heterogeneity in all tissues, but particularly in fetal brain. Importantly, even overtly normally developed embryos from older females display dramatic expression changes in neurodevelopmental genes. These transcriptomic alterations in the brain are likely induced by defects in placental development. Using trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) as a model, we show that exposure to aging uterine stromal cell-conditioned medium interferes with normal TSC proliferation and causes precocious differentiation, recapitulating many of the defects observed in placentas from aged females. These data highlight the increased risk of AMA on reproductive outcome, with neurodevelopment being the most sensitive to such early perturbations and with potential for lifelong impact."

In the present paper, we review several mechanisms of aging and the pre-clinically and clinically studied anti-aging therapies. Variability characterizes biological processes from the genome to cellular organelles, biochemical processes, and whole organs' function. Aging is associated with alterations in the degrees of variability and complexity of systems. The constrained disorder principle defines living organisms based on their inherent disorder within arbitrary boundaries and defines aging as having a lower variability or moving outside the boundaries of variability. We focus on associations between variability and hallmarks of aging and discuss the roles of disorder and variability of systems in the pathogenesis of aging. The paper presents the concept of implementing the constrained disease principle-based second-generation artificial intelligence systems for improving anti-aging modalities. The platform uses constrained noise to enhance systems' efficiency and slow the aging process.

Using logistic regression analysis, we found associations with T2D for theCCL20rs6749704 (OR = 1.68, PFDR= 3.40 × 10-5),CCR5rs333 (OR = 1.99, PFDR= 0.033),ADIPOQrs17366743 (OR = 3.17, PFDR= 2.64 × 10-4), TCF7L2rs114758349 (OR = 1.77, PFDR= 9.37 × 10-5), andCCL2rs1024611 (OR = 1.38, PFDR= 0.033) polymorphisms. We showed that the most informative prognostic model included weighted polygenic scores for these five loci, and non-genetic factors such as age and sex (AUC 85.8%, 95%CI 83.7-87.8%). Compared to the model containing only non-genetic parameters, adding the polygenic score for the five T2D-associated loci showed improved net reclassification (NRI = 37.62%, 1.39 × 10-6). Inclusion of all 13 tested SNPs to the model with age and sex did not improve the predictive ability compared to the model containing five T2D-associated variants (NRI = -17.86,p= 0.093). The five variants associated with T2D in people from the Volga-Ural region are linked to inflammation (CCR5, CCL2, CCL20) and glucose metabolism regulation (TCF7L, ADIPOQ2).

Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the differentially expressed serum proteins were mainly derived from exosomes and the extracellular space, and their molecular functions and biological processes were primarily involved in the activity of transporters and complements and the immune response. In addition, the serum level of Cadherin-5, an identified protein with significant regulation in AAD, was further evaluated by ELISA and the results showed that Cadherin-5 in AAD sera was higher that in AMI and healthy sera. Collectively, these findings reveal the differential serum protein profiles between AAD and AMI, which may reflect the divergent pathophysiological progression between the two cardiovascular diseases."

Incorporating the X and Y chromosomes into the analysis of DNA methylation array data.","Epigenetics Chromatin","Many human disease phenotypes manifest differently by sex, making the development of methods for incorporating X and Y-chromosome data into analyses vital. Unfortunately, X and Y chromosome data are frequently excluded from large-scale analyses of the human genome and epigenome due to analytical complexity associated with sex chromosome dosage differences between XX and XY individuals, and the impact of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) on the epigenome. As such, little attention has been given to considering the methods by which sex chromosome data may be included in analyses of DNA methylation (DNAme) array data.With Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 DNAme array data from 634 placental samples, we investigated the effects of probe filtering, normalization, and batch correction on DNAme data from the X and Y chromosomes. Processing steps were evaluated in both mixed-sex and sex-stratified subsets of the analysis cohort to identify whether including both sexes impacted processing results. We found that identification of probes that have a high detection p-value, or that are non-variable, should be performed in sex-stratified data subsets to avoid over- and under-estimation of the quantity of probes eligible for removal, respectively. All normalization techniques investigated returned X and Y DNAme data that were highly correlated with the raw data from the same samples. We found no difference in batch correction results after application to mixed-sex or sex-stratified cohorts. Additionally, we identify two analytical methods suitable for XY chromosome data, the choice between which should be guided by the research question of interest, and we performed a proof-of-concept analysis studying differential DNAme on the X and Y chromosome in the context of placental acute chorioamnionitis. Finally, we provide an annotation of probe types that may be desirable to filter in X and Y chromosome analyses, including probes in repetitive elements, the X-transposed region, and cancer-testis gene promoters.While there may be no single ""best"" approach for analyzing DNAme array data from the X and Y chromosome, analysts must consider key factors during processing and analysis of sex chromosome data to accommodate the underlying biology of these chromosomes, and the technical limitations of DNA methylation arrays.© 2023.

The molecular mechanism of exercise-mediated anxiolysis, however, remains incomplete. On a chronic restrain stress (CRS) model in adolescent mice, we showed that 14-day treadmill exercise profoundly maintained normal neural activity and axonal myelination in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), in association with the prevention of anxiety-like behaviors. Further interrogation of molecular mechanisms revealed the activation of the mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway within mPFC under exercise training. At the upstream of mTOR, exercise-mediated brain RNA methylation inhibited the expression of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) to activate the mTOR pathway. In summary, treadmill exercise modulates an FMRP-mTOR pathway to maintain cortical neural activity and axonal myelination, contributing to improved stress resilience. These results extended our understanding of the molecular substrate of exercise-mediated anxiolytic effect during adolescent period.© 2023. The Author(s)."

"36658492","DNA methylome and transcriptome identified Key genes and pathways involved in Speckled Eggshell formation in aged laying hens.","BMC Genomics","The quality of poultry eggshells is closely related to the profitability of egg production. Eggshell speckles reflect an important quality trait that influences egg appearance and customer preference. However, the mechanism of speckle formation remains poorly understood. In this study, we systematically compared serum immune and antioxidant indices of hens laying speckled and normal eggs. Transcriptome and methylome analyses were used to elucidate the mechanism of eggshell speckle formation.The results showed that seven differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the normal and speckle groups. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that the expressed genes were mainly enriched in the calcium signaling pathway, focal adhesion, and MAPK signaling pathway. Additionally, 282 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) were detected, of which 15 genes were associated with aging, including ARNTL, CAV1, and GCLC. Pathway analysis showed that the DMGs were associated with T cell-mediated immunity, response to oxidative stress, and cellular response to DNA damage stimulus. Integrative analysis of transcriptome and DNA methylation data identified BFSP2 as the only overlapping gene, which was expressed at low levels and hypomethylated in the speckle group.Overall, these results indicate that aging- and immune-related genes and pathways play a crucial role in the formation of speckled eggshells, providing useful information for improving eggshell quality.© 2023.

"36599988","A DNA methylation atlas of normal human cell types.","Nature","DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mark that governs gene expression and chromatin organization, thus providing a window into cellular identity and developmental processes1. Current datasets typically include only a fraction of methylation sites and are often based either on cell lines that underwent massive changes in culture or on tissues containing unspecified mixtures of cells2-5. Here we describe a human methylome atlas, based on deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, allowing fragment-level analysis across thousands of unique markers for 39 cell types sorted from 205 healthy tissue samples. Replicates of the same cell type are more than 99.5% identical, demonstrating the robustness of cell identity programmes to environmental perturbation. Unsupervised clustering of the atlas recapitulates key elements of tissue ontogeny and identifies methylation patterns retained since embryonic development. Loci uniquely unmethylated in an individual cell type often reside in transcriptional enhancers and contain DNA binding sites for tissue-specific transcriptional regulators. Uniquely hypermethylated loci are rare and are enriched for CpG islands, Polycomb targets and CTCF binding sites, suggesting a new role in shaping cell-type-specific chromatin looping. The atlas provides an essential resource for study of gene regulation and disease-associated genetic variants, and a wealth of potential tissue-specific biomarkers for use in liquid biopsies.© 2023.

"36670122","Integrative genetic analysis illuminates ALS heritability and identifies risk genes.","Nat Commun","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has substantial heritability, in part shared with fronto-temporal dementia (FTD). We show that ALS heritability is enriched in splicing variants and in binding sites of 6 RNA-binding proteins including TDP-43 and FUS. A transcriptome wide association study (TWAS) identified 6 loci associated with ALS, including in NUP50 encoding for the nucleopore basket protein NUP50. Independently, rare variants in NUP50 were associated with ALS risk (P = 3.71.10-03; odds ratio = 3.29; 95%CI, 1.37 to 7.87) in a cohort of 9,390 ALS/FTD patients and 4,594 controls. Cells from one patient carrying a NUP50 frameshift mutation displayed a decreased level of NUP50. Loss of NUP50 leads to death of cultured neurons, and motor defects in Drosophila and zebrafish. Thus, our study identifies alterations in splicing in neurons as critical in ALS and provides genetic evidence linking nuclear pore defects to ALS.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36658113","Large scale phenotype imputation and in vivo functional validation implicate ADAMTS14 as an adiposity gene.","Nat Commun","Obesity remains an unmet global health burden. Detrimental anatomical distribution of body fat is a major driver of obesity-mediated mortality risk and is demonstrably heritable. However, our understanding of the full genetic contribution to human adiposity is incomplete, as few studies measure adiposity directly. To address this, we impute whole-body imaging adiposity phenotypes in UK Biobank from the 4,366 directly measured participants onto the rest of the cohort, greatly increasing our discovery power. Using these imputed phenotypes in 392,535 participants yielded hundreds of genome-wide significant associations, six of which replicate in independent cohorts. The leading causal gene candidate, ADAMTS14, is further investigated in a mouse knockout model. Concordant with the human association data, the Adamts14-/-mice exhibit reduced adiposity and weight-gain under obesogenic conditions, alongside an improved metabolic rate and health. Thus, we show that phenotypic imputation at scale offers deeper biological insights into the genetics of human adiposity that could lead to therapeutic targets.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"36643910","Meta-analysis fine-mapping is often miscalibrated at single-variant resolution.","Cell Genom","Meta-analysis is pervasively used to combine multiple genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Fine-mapping of meta-analysis studies is typically performed as in a single-cohort study. Here, we first demonstrate that heterogeneity (e.g., of sample size, phenotyping, imputation) hurts calibration of meta-analysis fine-mapping. We propose a summary statistics-based quality-control (QC) method, suspicious loci analysis of meta-analysis summary statistics (SLALOM), that identifies suspicious loci for meta-analysis fine-mapping by detecting outliers in association statistics. We validate SLALOM in simulations and the GWAS Catalog. Applying SLALOM to 14 meta-analyses from the Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI), we find that 67% of loci show suspicious patterns that call into question fine-mapping accuracy. These predicted suspicious loci are significantly depleted for having nonsynonymous variants as lead variant (2.7×; Fisher's exact p = 7.3 × 10-4). We find limited evidence of fine-mapping improvement in the GBMI meta-analyses compared with individual biobanks. We urge extreme caution when interpreting fine-mapping results from meta-analysis of heterogeneous cohorts."
"36617561","Prenatal social support in low-risk pregnancy shapes placental epigenome.","BMC Med","Poor social support during pregnancy has been linked to inflammation and adverse pregnancy and childhood health outcomes. Placental epigenetic alterations may underlie these links but are still unknown in humans.In a cohort of low-risk pregnant women (n = 301) from diverse ethnic backgrounds, social support was measured using the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory (ESSI) during the first trimester. Placental samples collected at delivery were analyzed for DNA methylation and gene expression using Illumina 450K Beadchip Array and RNA-seq, respectively. We examined association between maternal prenatal social support and DNA methylation in placenta. Associated cytosine-(phosphate)-guanine sites (CpGs) were further assessed for correlation with nearby gene expression in placenta.The mean age (SD) of the women was 27.7 (5.3) years. The median (interquartile range) of ESSI scores was 24 (22-25). Prenatal social support was significantly associated with methylation level at seven CpGs (PFDR < 0.05). The methylation levels at two of the seven CpGs correlated with placental expression of VGF and ILVBL (PFDR < 0.05), genes known to be involved in neurodevelopment and energy metabolism. The genes annotated with the top 100 CpGs were enriched for pathways related to fetal growth, coagulation system, energy metabolism, and neurodevelopment. Sex-stratified analysis identified additional significant associations at nine CpGs in male-bearing pregnancies and 35 CpGs in female-bearing pregnancies.The findings suggest that prenatal social support is linked to placental DNA methylation changes in a low-stress setting, including fetal sex-dependent epigenetic changes. Given the relevance of some of these changes in fetal neurodevelopmental outcomes, the findings signal important methylation targets for future research on molecular mechanisms of effect of the broader social environment on pregnancy and fetal outcomes.NCT00912132 ( ClinicalTrials.gov ).© 2023.

We hypothesized that epigenetic disruptions are associated with symptoms and health status in COPD. We profiled the blood (n= 57) and airways (n= 62) of COPD patients for DNA methylation (n= 55 paired). The patients' health status was assessed using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). We conducted differential methylation analyses and identified pathways characterized by epigenetic disruptions associated with SGRQ scores and its individual domains. 29,211 and 5044 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were associated with total SGRQ scores in blood and airway samples, respectively. The activity, impact, and symptom domains were associated with 9161, 25,689 and 17,293 DMPs in blood, respectively; and 4674, 3730 and 5063 DMPs in airways, respectively. There was a substantial overlap of DMPs between airway and blood. DMPs were enriched for pathways related to common co-morbidities of COPD (e.g., ageing, cancer and neurological) in both tissues. Health status in COPD is associated with airway and systemic epigenetic changes especially in pathways related to co-morbidities of COPD. There are more blood DMPs than in the airways suggesting that blood epigenome is a promising source to discover biomarkers for clinical outcomes in COPD."

However, the utility of artificial intelligence (AI)-predicted age using ECGs remains unclear.Using a single-center database, we developed an AI-enabled ECG using 17 042 sinus rhythm ECGs (SR-ECG) to predict chronological age (CA) with a convolutional neural network that yields AI-predicted age. Using the 5-fold cross validation method, AI-predicted age deriving from the test dataset was yielded for all ECGs. The incidence by AgeDiff and the areas under the curve by receiver operating characteristic curve with AI-predicted age for cardiovascular events were analyzed.During the mean follow-up period of 460.1 days, there were 543 cardiovascular events. The annualized incidence of cardiovascular events was 2.24 %, 2.44 %, and 3.01 %/year for patients with AgeDiff < -6, -6 to ≤6, and >6 years, respectively. The areas under the curve for cardiovascular events with CA and AI-predicted age, respectively, were 0.673 and 0.679 (Delong's test, P = 0.388) for all patients; 0.642 and 0.700 (P = 0.003) for younger patients (CA < 60 years); and 0.584 and 0.570 (P = 0.268) for older patients (CA ≥ 60 years).AI-predicted age using 12-lead ECGs showed superiority in predicting cardiovascular events compared with CA in younger patients, but not in older patients.© 2023 The Author(s)."
"36674940","Molecular Landscape of Tourette's Disorder.","Int J Mol Sci","Tourette's disorder (TD) is a highly heritable childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder and is caused by a complex interplay of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying the disorder remain largely elusive. In this study, we used the available omics data to compile a list of TD candidate genes, and we subsequently conducted tissue/cell type specificity and functional enrichment analyses of this list. Using genomic data, we also investigated genetic sharing between TD and blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) metabolite levels. Lastly, we built a molecular landscape of TD through integrating the results from these analyses with an extensive literature search to identify the interactions between the TD candidate genes/proteins and metabolites. We found evidence for an enriched expression of the TD candidate genes in four brain regions and the pituitary. The functional enrichment analyses implicated two pathways ('cAMP-mediated signaling' and 'Endocannabinoid Neuronal Synapse Pathway') and multiple biological functions related to brain development and synaptic transmission in TD etiology. Furthermore, we found genetic sharing between TD and the blood and CSF levels of 39 metabolites. The landscape of TD not only provides insights into the (altered) molecular processes that underlie the disease but, through the identification of potential drug targets (such as FLT3, NAALAD2, CX3CL1-CX3CR1, OPRM1, and HRH2), it also yields clues for developing novel TD treatments."

We characterize the epigenome of clear cell (ccRCC), papillary (pRCC), and chromophobe RCC (chRCC) by using ChIP-seq, ATAC-Seq, RNA-seq, and SNP arrays. We integrate 153 individual data sets from 42 patients and nominate 50 histology-specific master transcription factors (MTF) to define RCC histologic subtypes, including EPAS1 and ETS-1 in ccRCC, HNF1B in pRCC, and FOXI1 in chRCC. We confirm histology-specific MTFs via immunohistochemistry including a ccRCC-specific TF, BHLHE41. FOXI1 overexpression with knock-down of EPAS1 in the 786-O ccRCC cell line induces transcriptional upregulation of chRCC-specific genes, TFCP2L1, ATP6V0D2, KIT, and INSRR, implicating FOXI1 as a MTF for chRCC. Integrating RCC GWAS risk SNPs with H3K27ac ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data reveals that risk-variants are significantly enriched in allelically-imbalanced peaks.

"36674778","Shifting Paradigm from Gene Expressions to Pathways Reveals Physiological Mechanisms in Blood Pressure Control in Causation.","Int J Mol Sci","Genetics for blood pressure (BP) in human and animals has been partitioned into two separate specialties. However, this divide is mechanistically-misleading. BP physiology is mechanistically participated by products of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The key to unlocking its mechanistic mystery lies in the past with mammalian ancestors before humans existed. By pivoting from effects to causes, physiological mechanisms determining BP by six QTLs have been implicated. Our work relies on congenic knock-in genetics in vivo using rat models, and has reproduced the physiological outcome based on a QTL being molecularly equal to one gene. A gene dose for a QTL is irrelevant to physiological BP controls in causation. Together, QTLs join one another as a group in modularized Mendelian fashion to achieve polygenicity. Mechanistically, QTLs in the same module appear to function in a common pathway. Each is involved in a different step in the pathway toward polygenic hypertension. This work has implicated previously-concealed components of these pathways. This emerging concept is a departure from the human-centric precept that the level of QTL expressions, not physiology, would ultimately determine BP. The modularity/pathway paradigm breaks a unique conceptual ground for unravelling the physiological mechanisms of polygenic and quantitative traits like BP."

However, understanding the processes underlying toxin expression dynamics that determine the venom phenotype remains unresolved. By interspecific comparisons we reveal that toxin expression in sea anemones evolves rapidly and that in each species different toxin family dictates the venom phenotype by massive gene duplication events. In-depth analysis of the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, revealed striking variation of the dominant toxin (Nv1) diploid copy number across populations (1-24 copies) resulting from independent expansion/contraction events, which generate distinct haplotypes. Nv1 copy number correlates with expression at both the transcript and protein levels with one population having a near-complete loss of Nv1 production. Finally, we establish the dominant toxin hypothesis which incorporates observations in other venomous lineages that animals have convergently evolved a similar strategy in shaping their venom.© 2023.

"36624117","Constrained neuro fuzzy inference methodology for explainable personalised modelling with applications on gene expression data.","Sci Rep","Interpretable machine learning models for gene expression datasets are important for understanding the decision-making process of a classifier and gaining insights on the underlying molecular processes of genetic conditions. Interpretable models can potentially support early diagnosis before full disease manifestation. This is particularly important yet, challenging for mental health. We hypothesise this is due to extreme heterogeneity issues which may be overcome and explained by personalised modelling techniques. Thus far, most machine learning methods applied to gene expression datasets, including deep neural networks, lack personalised interpretability. This paper proposes a new methodology named personalised constrained neuro fuzzy inference (PCNFI) for learning personalised rules from high dimensional datasets which are structurally and semantically interpretable. Case studies on two mental health related datasets (schizophrenia and bipolar disorders) have shown that the relatively short and simple personalised fuzzy rules provided enhanced interpretability as well as better classification performance compared to other commonly used machine learning methods. Performance test on a cancer dataset also showed that PCNFI matches previous benchmarks. Insights from our approach also indicated the importance of two genes (ATRX and TSPAN2) as possible biomarkers for early differentiation of ultra-high risk, bipolar and healthy individuals. These genes are linked to cognitive ability and impulsive behaviour. Our findings suggest a significant starting point for further research into the biological role of cognitive and impulsivity-related differences. With potential applications across bio-medical research, the proposed PCNFI method is promising for diagnosis, prognosis, and the design of personalised treatment plans for better outcomes in the future.© 2023.

"36619587","The genetic and epigenetic contributions to the development of nutritional rickets.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","Nutritional rickets is an important disease in global health. Although nutritional rickets commonly manifests as bony deformities, there is an increased risk of life-threatening seizures secondary to hypocalcaemia. Dietary vitamin D deficiency is associated with the development of nutritional rickets among children and infants. This is especially true in populations of darker skinned individuals in high-latitude environments due to decreased ultraviolet light exposure, and in populations in tropical and subtropical climates due to cultural practices. A growing body of evidence has demonstrated that genetic factors might influence the likelihood of developing nutritional rickets by influencing an individual's susceptibility to develop deficiencies in vitamin D and/or calcium. This evidence has been drawn from a variety of different techniques ranging from traditional twin studies to next generation sequencing techniques. Additionally, the role of the epigenome in the development of rickets, although poorly understood, may be related to the effects of DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs on genes involved in bone metabolism. This review aims to provide an overview of the current evidence that investigates the genetic and epigenetic determinants of nutritional rickets.Copyright © 2022 Ogunmwonyi, Adebajo and Wilkinson."

Differentiation of cell cultures varies by line and, in some cases, can result in functional modifications within a population. Although research is increasingly dependent on thesein vitromodel systems, the heterogeneity within cell lines has not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we have leveraged high throughput single-cell assays to investigate the Comma-1D mouse cell line that is known to differentiate in culture. Using scRNASeq and custom single-cell phenotype assays, we resolve the clonal heterogeneity within the referenced cell line on the genomic and functional level. We performed a cohesive analysis of the transcriptome of 5,195 sequenced cells, of which 85.3% of the total reads successfully mapped to the mm10-3.0.0 reference genome. Across multiple gene expression analysis pipelines, both luminal and myoepithelial lineages were observed. Deep differential gene expression analysis revealed eight subclusters identified as luminal progenitor, luminal differentiated, myoepithelial differentiated, and fibroblast subpopulations-suggesting functional clustering within each lineage. Gene expression of published mammary stem cell (MaSC) markers Epcam, Cd49f, and Sca-1 was detected across the population, with 116 (2.23%) sequenced cells expressing all three markers. To gain insight into functional heterogeneity, cells with patterned MaSC marker expression were isolated and phenotypically investigated through a custom single-cell high throughput assay. The comparison of growth kinetics demonstrates functional heterogeneity within each cell cluster while also illustrating significant limitations in current cell isolation methods. We outlined the upstream use of our novel automated cell identification platform-to be used prior to single-cell culture-for reduced cell stress and improved rare cell identification and capture. Through compounding single-cell pipelines, we better reveal the heterogeneity within Comma-1D to identify subpopulations with specific functional characteristics.Copyright © 2022 Dave, Nekritz, Charytonowicz, Beaumont, Smith, Beaumont, Silva and Sebra."

Despite the growing research interest in BC, the molecular mechanisms underlying its carcinogenesis remain poorly understood. The microarray datasets GSE38264 and GSE61615 obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were analyzed and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, which were then verified using a dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). By taking the intersection of the two microarray datasets, the common DEGs were identified and these were selected as candidate genes associated with BC. The DEGs were further subjected to Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, and the protein-protein interaction network was constructed. Further module analysis was performed using STRING and Cytoscape. A total of 362 DEGs were identified, including 13 hub genes, and the GO analysis revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix organization, positive regulation of cell proliferation, angiogenesis and peptidyl-tyrosine phosphorylation. The expression changes of PTPRC, PDGFRA, CASQ2, TGFBI, KLRD1 and MT1X in the different datasets indicated that these genes were involved in the development of BC. Next, the differential expression of these genes was verified in the TCGA dataset, and ultimately, these 13 genes were determined to be related to the occurrence and development of BC. Finally, the cancer tissues and adjacent tissues of patients with BC were collected and subjected to reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, the results of which were consistent with the bioinformatics prediction. The present findings provide several vital genes for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of BC.Copyright: © Liu et al."
"36675240","Epigenetic Modification of Cytosines in Hematopoietic Differentiation and Malignant Transformation.","Int J Mol Sci","The mammalian DNA methylation landscape is established and maintained by the combined activities of the two key epigenetic modifiers, DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and Ten-eleven-translocation (TET) enzymes. Once DNMTs produce 5-methylcytosine (5mC), TET proteins fine-tune the DNA methylation status by consecutively oxidizing 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and further oxidized derivatives. The 5mC and oxidized methylcytosines are essential for the maintenance of cellular identity and function during differentiation. Cytosine modifications with DNMT and TET enzymes exert pleiotropic effects on various aspects of hematopoiesis, including self-renewal of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), lineage determination, differentiation, and function. Under pathological conditions, these enzymes are frequently dysregulated, leading to loss of function. In particular, the loss of DNMT3A and TET2 function is conspicuous in diverse hematological disorders, including myeloid and lymphoid malignancies, and causally related to clonal hematopoiesis and malignant transformation. Here, we update recent advances in understanding how the maintenance of DNA methylation homeostasis by DNMT and TET proteins influences normal hematopoiesis and malignant transformation, highlighting the potential impact of DNMT3A and TET2 dysregulation on clonal dominance and evolution of pre-leukemic stem cells to full-blown malignancies. Clarification of the normal and pathological functions of DNA-modifying epigenetic regulators will be crucial to future innovations in epigenetic therapies for treating hematological disorders."
"36647159","Small molecule modulators of chromatin remodeling: from neurodevelopment to neurodegeneration.","Cell Biosci","The dynamic changes in chromatin conformation alter the organization and structure of the genome and further regulate gene transcription. Basically, the chromatin structure is controlled by reversible, enzyme-catalyzed covalent modifications to chromatin components and by noncovalent ATP-dependent modifications via chromatin remodeling complexes, including switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF), inositol-requiring 80 (INO80), imitation switch (ISWI) and chromodomain-helicase DNA-binding protein (CHD) complexes. Recent studies have shown that chromatin remodeling is essential in different stages of postnatal and adult neurogenesis. Chromatin deregulation, which leads to defects in epigenetic gene regulation and further pathological gene expression programs, often causes a wide range of pathologies. This review first gives an overview of the regulatory mechanisms of chromatin remodeling. We then focus mainly on discussing the physiological functions of chromatin remodeling, particularly histone and DNA modifications and the four classes of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes, in the central and peripheral nervous systems under healthy and pathological conditions, that is, in neurodegenerative disorders. Finally, we provide an update on the development of potent and selective small molecule modulators targeting various chromatin-modifying proteins commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases and their potential clinical applications.© 2023.

It has been implicated in various regulatory mechanisms across the animal kingdom and particularly in vertebrates. We mapped DNA methylation in 580 animal species (535 vertebrates, 45 invertebrates), resulting in 2443 genome-scale DNA methylation profiles of multiple organs. Bioinformatic analysis of this large dataset quantified the association of DNA methylation with the underlying genomic DNA sequence throughout vertebrate evolution. We observed a broadly conserved link with two major transitions-once in the first vertebrates and again with the emergence of reptiles. Cross-species comparisons focusing on individual organs supported a deeply conserved association of DNA methylation with tissue type, and cross-mapping analysis of DNA methylation at gene promoters revealed evolutionary changes for orthologous genes. In summary, this study establishes a large resource of vertebrate and invertebrate DNA methylomes, it showcases the power of reference-free epigenome analysis in species for which no reference genomes are available, and it contributes an epigenetic perspective to the study of vertebrate evolution.© 2023.

"36609400","Targeted systematic evolution of an RNA platform neutralizing DNMT1 function and controlling DNA methylation.","Nat Commun","DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic modification regulating gene expression. Aberrant DNA methylation is the most common molecular lesion in cancer cells. However, medical intervention has been limited to the use of broadly acting, small molecule-based demethylating drugs with significant side-effects and toxicities. To allow for targeted DNA demethylation, we integrated two nucleic acid-based approaches: DNMT1 interacting RNA (DiR) and RNA aptamer strategy. By combining the RNA inherent capabilities of inhibiting DNMT1 with an aptamer platform, we generated a first-in-class DNMT1-targeted approach - aptaDiR. Molecular modelling of RNA-DNMT1 complexes coupled with biochemical and cellular assays enabled the identification and characterization of aptaDiR. This RNA bio-drug is able to block DNA methylation, impair cancer cell viability and inhibit tumour growth in vivo. Collectively, we present an innovative RNA-based approach to modulate DNMT1 activity in cancer or diseases characterized by aberrant DNA methylation and suggest the first alternative strategy to overcome the limitations of currently approved non-specific hypomethylating protocols, which will greatly improve clinical intervention on DNA methylation.© 2023.

Interactions between SREBP and the targets are verified by electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay. RNA-seq shows that SREBP targets, mevalonate kinase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthetase in mevalonate pathway, sterol isomerase and lanosterol 14-demethylase in ergosterol biosynthesis, are significantly upregulated in the SREBP overexpression (OE::SREBP) strain. In addition, 3 targets involved in glycerophospholipid/glycerolipid metabolism are upregulated. Then, the contents of mevalonic acid, lanosterol, ergosterol and 13 different GAs as well as a variety of lipids are significantly increased in this strain. Furthermore, the effects of SREBP overexpression on triterpenoid and lipid metabolisms are recovered when OE::SREBP strain are treated with exogenous fatostatin, a specific inhibitor of SREBP.

As this patient group suffers from considerable mortality and treatment morbidity it is important to improve prognostic strategies in OPSCC. Inflammation plays a key role in cancer and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in blood has been suggested as a prognostic factor for OPSCC. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic impact of NLR on overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in a retrospective cohort of 1370 patients. Included patients had pretreatment neutrophil and lymphocyte counts available, as well as a known HPV status. Patients were treated with curative intent according to Danish national guidelines. We stratified patients in groups by NLR &lt; 2, NLR 2-4, or NLR &gt; 4 and analyzed the influence of the NLR tertile on OS and RFS. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrated survival probability in OS and RFS in the general cohort and were stratified by HPV status. We found that an increasing NLR was associated with inferior OS (HR = 1.5 for NLR &gt; 4) and RFS (HR = 1.6 for NLR 2-4; HR = 1.8 for NLR &gt; 4) in multivariable analysis. The Kaplan-Meier curves displayed inferior OS and RFS with an increasing NLR for both HPV+ and HPV- patients. In conclusion, we showed that an increasing NLR is prognostic for a worse outcome of OPSCC independently of HPV status. There are possible uses of NLR in prognostication and treatment de-escalation although further studies are warranted to determine the clinical utility."

NLR, LMR, and PLR as a Promising Indicator in Colorectal Cancer Prognosis: A Systematic Review.","J Inflamm Res","The link between inflammation and cancer is still an attractive subject of many studies because systemic inflammatory response has been proven to play a pivotal role in cancer progression and metastasis. The strongest relationship between chronic inflammation and cancer development is observed in colorectal cancer (CRC). The evaluation of ratios derived from the routinely performed inflammatory biomarkers shows limited performances and limited clinical utility when individually used as prognostic factors for patients with CRC. In this review, we would like to summarize the latest knowledge about the diagnostic utility of systemic inflammatory ratios: neutrophil/lymphocyte (NLR), lymphocyte/monocyte (LMR), and platelet/lymphocyte (PLR) in CRC. We focused on the papers that assessed the diagnostic utility of blood cell parameters on the basis of the area under the ROC curve published in the recent 6 years. Identification of biomarkers that are significantly associated with prognostic in cancer would help the selection of patients with a high risk of poor outcomes.© 2023 Misiewicz and Dymicka-Piekarska."

This study aimed to evaluate whether neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can predict poor prognosis of critical AMI patients.We designed a retrospective cohort study and extracted AMI patients from the ""Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III"" database. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were 90-day and in-hospital all-cause mortalities, and acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence. The optimal cut-offs of NLR were picked by X-tile software according to the 1-year mortality and patient groups were created: low-NLR (< 4.8), high-NLR (4.8 - 21.1), and very high-NLR (> 21.1). Cox and modified Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the effect of NLR on outcomes in critically AMI patients.Finally, 782 critical AMI patients were enrolled in this study, and the 1-year mortality was 32% (249/782). The high- and very high-NLR groups had a higher incidence of outcomes than the low-NLR group (P< 0.05). The multivariate regression analyses found that the high- and very high-NLR groups had a higher risk of 1-year mortality (Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.12 to 2.24, P = 0.009 and HR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.09 to 2.73, P = 0.020), 90-day mortality (HR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.54, P = 0.011 and HR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.13 to 3.20, P = 0.016), in-hospital mortality (Relative risk (RR) = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.74, P = 0.010 and RR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.23 to 3.58, P = 0.007), and AKI incidence (RR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.95, P = 0.018 and RR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.87 to 2.07, P = 0.180) compared with low-NLR group.

"36662808","Calorie restriction alters the mechanisms of radiation-induced mouse thymic lymphomagenesis.","PLoS One","Calorie restriction (CR) suppresses not only spontaneous but also chemical- and radiation-induced carcinogenesis. Our previous study revealed that the cancer-preventive effect of CR is tissue dependent and that CR does not effectively prevent the development of thymic lymphoma (TL). We investigated the association between CR and the genomic alterations of resulting TLs to clarify the underlying resistance mechanism. TLs were obtained from previous and new experiments, in which B6C3F1 mice were exposed to radiation at 1 week of age and fed with a CR or standard (non-CR) diet from 7 weeks throughout their lifetimes. All available TLs were used for analysis of genomic DNA. In contrast to the TLs of the non-CR group, those of the CR group displayed suppression of copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) involving relevant tumor suppressor genes (Cdkn2a, Ikzf1, Trp53, Pten), an event regarded as cell division-associated. However, CR did not affect interstitial deletions of those genes, which were observed in both groups. In addition, CR affected the mechanism of Ikzf1 inactivation in TLs: the non-CR group exhibited copy-neutral LOH with duplicated inactive alleles, whereas the CR group showed expression of dominant-negative isoforms accompanying a point mutation or an intragenic deletion. These results suggest that, even though CR reduces cell division-related genomic rearrangements by suppressing cell proliferation, tumors arise via diverse carcinogenic pathways including inactivation of tumor suppressors via interstitial deletions and other mutations. These findings provide a molecular basis for improved prevention strategies that overcome the CR resistance of lymphomagenesis.Copyright: © 2023 Nakayama et al.

DNA-methylation is altered by environmental factors, trauma and illnesses. We hypothesised that paediatric critical illness, and the nutritional management in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), affects DNA-methylation changes that underly the developmental processes of childhood ageing.We studied the impact of critical illness, and of the early use of parenteral nutrition (early-PN) versus late-PN, on ""epigenetic age-deviation"" in buccal mucosa of 818 former PICU-patients (406 early-PN, 412 late-PN) who participated in the 2-year follow-up of the multicentre PEPaNIC-RCT (ClinicalTrials.gov-NCT01536275), as compared with 392 matched healthy children, and assessed whether this relates to their impaired growth. The epigenetic age-deviation (difference between PedBE clock-estimated epigenetic age and chronological age) was calculated. Using bootstrapped multivariable linear regression models, we assessed the impact hereon of critical illness, and of early-PN versus late-PN. As compared with healthy children, epigenetic age of patients assessed 2 years after PICU-admission deviated negatively from chronological age (p < 0.05 in 51% of bootstrapped replicates), similarly in early-PN and late-PN groups. Next, we identified vulnerable subgroups for epigenetic age-deviation using interaction analysis. We revealed that DNA-methylation age-deceleration in former PICU-patients was dependent on age at time of illness (p < 0.05 for 83% of bootstrapped replicates), with vulnerability starting from 6 years onwards. Finally, we assessed whether vulnerability to epigenetic age-deviation could be related to impaired growth from PICU-admission to follow-up at 2 and 4 years. Multivariable repeated measures ANOVA showed that former PICU-patients, as compared with healthy children, grew less in height (p = 0.0002) and transiently gained weight (p = 0.0003) over the 4-year time course. Growth in height was more stunted in former PICU-patients aged ≥ 6-years at time of critical illness (p = 0.002) than in the younger patients.As compared with healthy children, former PICU-patients, in particular those aged ≥ 6-years at time of illness, revealed epigenetic age-deceleration, with a physical correlate revealing stunted growth in height. Whether this vulnerability around the age of 6 years for epigenetic age-deceleration and stunted growth years later relates to altered endocrine pathways activated at the time of adrenarche requires further investigation.© 2023.

"36648862","Environmental Adaptation of Genetically Uniform Organisms with the Help of Epigenetic Mechanisms-An Insightful Perspective on Ecoepigenetics.","Epigenomes","Organisms adapt to different environments by selection of the most suitable phenotypes from the standing genetic variation or by phenotypic plasticity, the ability of single genotypes to produce different phenotypes in different environments. Because of near genetic identity, asexually reproducing populations are particularly suitable for the investigation of the potential and molecular underpinning of the latter alternative in depth. Recent analyses on the whole-genome scale of differently adapted clonal animals and plants demonstrated that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs are among the molecular pathways supporting phenotypic plasticity and that epigenetic variation is used to stably adapt to different environments. Case studies revealed habitat-specific epigenetic fingerprints that were maintained over subsequent years pointing at the existence of epigenetic ecotypes. Environmentally induced epimutations and corresponding gene expression changes provide an ideal means for fast and directional adaptation to changing or new conditions, because they can synchronously alter phenotypes in many population members. Because microorganisms inclusive of human pathogens also exploit epigenetically mediated phenotypic variation for environmental adaptation, this phenomenon is considered a universal biological principle. The production of different phenotypes from the same DNA sequence in response to environmental cues by epigenetic mechanisms also provides a mechanistic explanation for the ""general-purpose genotype hypothesis"" and the ""genetic paradox of invasions""."
"36635504","Quantifying propagation of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation with iDEMS.","Nat Cell Biol","DNA methylation is a critical epigenetic mark in mammalian cells. Many aspects of DNA methylation maintenance have been characterized; however, the exact kinetics of post-replicative methylation maintenance remain a subject of debate. Here we develop isolation of DNA by 5-ethynyl-deoxyuridine labelling for mass spectrometry (iDEMS), a highly sensitive, quantitative mass spectrometry-based method for measuring DNA modifications on metabolically labelled DNA. iDEMS reveals an unexpectedly hemi-methylated landscape on nascent DNA. Combining iDEMS with metabolic labelling reveals that methylation maintenance is outpaced by cell division in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our approach shows that hydroxymethylation is perpetually asymmetric between sister strands in favour of the parental, template strand. iDEMS can be coupled with immunoprecipitation of chromatin proteins, revealing features of DNA methylation-histone modification crosstalk and suggesting a model for interplay between methylation and nucleosome assembly. iDEMS therefore elucidates long-standing questions about DNA modification propagation and provides an important orthogonal technology to understanding this process in dynamic cellular contexts.© 2023.

We aimed to investigate the association between DPs extracted using principal component analysis (PCA), partial least-squares (PLS), and reduced-rank regressions (RRR) in identifying DPs associated with T2DM risk. The study was conducted in the context of two cohort studies accomplished in central Iran. Dietary intake data were collected by food frequency questionnaires (FFQs). DPs were derived by using PCA, PLS, and RRR methods considering. The association between DPs with the risk of T2DM was assessed using log-binomial logistic regression test. A total of 8667 participants aged 20-70 years were included in this study. In the multivariate-adjusted models, RRR-DP3 characterized by high intake of fruits, tomatoes, vegetable oils, and refined grains and low intake of processed meats, organ meats, margarine, and hydrogenated fats was significantly associated with a reduced T2DM risk (Q5 vs Q1: RR 0.540, 95% CI 0.33-0.87, P-trend = 0.020). No significant highest-lowest or trend association was observed between DPs derived using PCA or PLS and T2DM.

In addition to chromatin modifying and remodeling enzymes, mutations in histone genes are linked to human cancers. Since the first reports of hotspot missense mutations affecting key residues at histone H3 tail, studies have revealed how these so-called ""oncohistones"" dominantly (H3K27M and H3K36M) or locally (H3.3G34R/W) inhibit corresponding histone methyltransferases and misregulate epigenome and transcriptome to promote tumorigenesis. More recently, widespread mutations in all four core histones are identified in diverse cancer types. Furthermore, an ""oncohistone-like"" protein EZHIP has been implicated in driving childhood ependymomas through a mechanism highly reminiscent of H3K27M mutation. We will review recent progresses on understanding the biochemical, molecular and biological mechanisms underlying the canonical and novel histone mutations. Importantly, these mechanistic insights have identified therapeutic opportunities for oncohistone-driven tumors."
"36634080","Association between child maltreatment and depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood: The mediating and moderating roles of DNA methylation.","PLoS One","Prospective studies suggest that child maltreatment substantially increases the risk for depression in adulthood. However, the mechanisms underlying this association require further elucidation. In recent years, DNA methylation has emerged as a potential mechanism by which maltreatment experiences (a) could partly explain the emergence or aggravation of depressive symptoms (i.e., mediation) and/or (b) could increase (or decrease) the risk for depressive symptoms (i.e., moderation). The present study tested whether the methylation levels of nine candidate genes mediated and/or moderated the association between maltreatment experiences in childhood and depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood. The sample comprised 156 men aged between 18 and 35 years. Maltreatment experiences and depressive symptoms were assessed retrospectively using self-reported questionnaires. Methylation levels of nine candidate genes (COMT, FKBP5, IL6, IL10, MAOA, NR3C1, OXTR, SLC6A3 and SLC6A4), previously reported to be sensitive to early-life stress, were quantified from saliva samples. Maltreatment experiences in childhood were significantly associated with depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood. Both maltreatment experiences and depressive symptoms were associated with the methylation levels of two genomic sites, which cumulatively, but not individually, explained 16% of the association between maltreatment experiences in childhood and depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood. Moreover, maltreatment experiences in childhood interacted with the methylation levels of fourteen genomic sites, which cumulatively, but not individually, modulated the level of depressive symptoms in young male adults who were maltreated as children. However, none of these effects survived multiple testing correction. These findings bring attention to the cumulative effects of DNA methylation measured in several candidate genes on the risk of reporting depressive symptoms following maltreatment experiences in childhood. Nonetheless, future studies need to clarify the robustness of these putative cumulative effects in larger samples and longitudinal cohorts.Copyright: © 2023 Comtois-Cabana et al.

The SLC38 family is evolutionary old, and SLC38A10 is one of the oldest members of the family. It is ubiquitously expressed, and its substrates are glutamine, glutamate, alanine, aspartate, and serine. However, little is known about its biological importance.In the current study, an SLC38A10 knockout mouse was run in the multivariate concentric square fieldTM(MCSF) test. The MCSF test gives the mouse a choice of areas to explore; sheltered areas, elevated and illuminated areas, or open spaces, and a behavioral profile is obtained. The multivariate data obtained were analyzed (i) for each parameter, (ii) parameters grouped into functional categories, and (iii) with a principal component analysis.In the trend analysis, knockout mice had a decreased exploratory behavior compared to controls but did not show a distinct grouping in the principal component analysis.There was not a pronounced difference in the behavioral profile in SLC38A10 knockout mice compared to their wild-type controls, although subtle alterations in zones associated with exploratory behavior and risk assessment in female and male knockout mice, respectively, could be observed. These results imply that a loss of function of the SLC38A10 protein in mice does not drastically alter behavior in the MSCF test.Copyright © 2022 Lindberg, Roman and Fredriksson."
"36613674","The Role of ER Stress in Diabetes: Exploring Pathological Mechanisms Using Wolfram Syndrome.","Int J Mol Sci","The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a cytosolic organelle that plays an essential role in the folding and processing of new secretory proteins, including insulin. The pathogenesis of diabetes, a group of metabolic disorders caused by dysfunctional insulin secretion (Type 1 diabetes, T1DM) or insulin sensitivity (Type 2 diabetes, T2DM), is known to involve the excess accumulation of ""poorly folded proteins"", namely, the induction of pathogenic ER stress in pancreatic β-cells. ER stress is known to contribute to the dysfunction of the insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. T1DM and T2DM are multifactorial diseases, especially T2DM; both environmental and genetic factors are involved in their pathogenesis, making it difficult to create experimental disease models. In recent years, however, the development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and other regenerative technologies has greatly expanded research capabilities, leading to the development of new candidate therapies. In this review, we will discuss the mechanism by which dysregulated ER stress responses contribute to T2DM pathogenesis. Moreover, we describe new treatment methods targeting protein folding and ER stress pathways with a particular focus on pivotal studies of Wolfram syndrome, a monogenic form of syndromic diabetes caused by pathogenic variants in theWFS1gene, which also leads to ER dysfunction."

Here, we perform whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis of tumors from 22 patients with TP53 germline pathogenic variants. We observe somatic mutations affecting Wnt, PI3K/AKT signaling, epigenetic modifiers and homologous recombination genes as well as mutational signatures associated with prior chemotherapy. We identify near-ubiquitous early loss of heterozygosity of TP53, with gain of the mutant allele. This occurs earlier in these tumors compared to tumors with somatic TP53 mutations, suggesting the timing of this mark may distinguish germline from somatic TP53 mutations. Phylogenetic trees of tumor evolution, reconstructed from bulk and multi-region WGS, reveal that LFS tumors exhibit comparatively limited heterogeneity. Overall, our study delineates early copy number gains of mutant TP53 as a characteristic mutational process in LFS tumorigenesis, likely arising years prior to tumor diagnosis.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The development of a human in vitro system that can be patient-specific, induced pluripotent stem cells, iPSC, and the ability to obtain various cell types of interest, have empowered human disease modeling and therapeutic development. Scalable tools have been deployed for gene modulation in these cells and derivatives, including pharmacological means, DNA-based RNA interference and standard RNA interference (shRNA/siRNA).

While phenotypic changes during short-term EMT induction are reversible, long-term EMT induction has been often associated with irreversibility. Here, we show that phenotypic changes seen in MCF10A cells upon long-term EMT induction by TGFβneed not be irreversible, but have relatively longer time scales of reversibility than those seen in short-term induction. Next, using a phenomenological mathematical model to account for the chromatin-mediated epigenetic silencing of the miR-200 family by ZEB family, we highlight how the epigenetic memory gained during long-term EMT induction can slow the recovery to the epithelial state post-TGFβwithdrawal. Our results suggest that epigenetic modifiers can govern the extent and time scale of EMT reversibility and advise caution against labelling phenotypic changes seen in long-term EMT induction as 'irreversible'."
"36590072","Eukaryotic gene regulation at equilibrium, or non?","Curr Opin Syst Biol","Models of transcriptional regulation that assume equilibrium binding of transcription factors have been less successful at predicting gene expression from sequence in eukaryotes than in bacteria. This could be due to the non-equilibrium nature of eukaryotic regulation. Unfortunately, the space of possible non-equilibrium mechanisms is vast and predominantly uninteresting. The key question is therefore how this space can be navigated efficiently, to focus on mechanisms and models that are biologically relevant. In this review, we advocate for the normative role of theory-theory that prescribes rather than just describes-in providing such a focus. Theory should expand its remit beyond inferring mechanistic models from data, towards identifying non-equilibrium gene regulatory schemes that may have been evolutionarily selected, despite their energy consumption, because they are precise, reliable, fast, or otherwise outperform regulation at equilibrium. We illustrate our reasoning by toy examples for which we provide simulation code."

By focusing on the local ancestral structure of coding and regulatory regions using the paired whole-genome sequence and tissue-wide transcriptome datasets from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project, we investigated the impact of genetic variants, in aggregate, on tissue-specific gene expression regulation. Local ancestral origins of the coding region, immediate and distant upstream regions, and distal regulatory region were determined using RFMix with the reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project. For each tissue, inter-individual variation of gene expression levels explained by concordant or discordant local ancestry between coding and regulatory regions was estimated. Compared to European, African descent showed more frequent change in local ancestral structure, with shorter haplotype blocks. The expression level of the Adenosine Deaminase Like (ADAL)gene was significantly associated with admixed ancestral structure in the regulatory region across multiple tissue types.

"36674677","Hooked Up from a Distance: Charting Genome-Wide Long-Range Interaction Maps in Neural Cells Chromatin to Identify Novel Candidate Genes for Neurodevelopmental Disorders.","Int J Mol Sci","DNA sequence variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms or variants, SNPs/SNVs; copy number variants, CNVs) associated to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) and traits often map on putative transcriptional regulatory elements, including, in particular, enhancers. However, the genes controlled by these enhancers remain poorly defined. Traditionally, the activity of a given enhancer, and the effect of its possible alteration associated to the sequence variants, has been thought to influence the nearest gene promoter. However, the obtainment of genome-wide long-range interaction maps in neural cells chromatin challenged this view, showing that a given enhancer is very frequently not connected to the nearest promoter, but to a more distant one, skipping genes in between. In this Perspective, we review some recent papers, who generated long-range interaction maps (by HiC, RNApolII ChIA-PET, Capture-HiC, or PLACseq), and overlapped the identified long-range interacting DNA segments with DNA sequence variants associated to NDD (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism) and traits (intelligence). This strategy allowed to attribute the function of enhancers, hosting the NDD-related sequence variants, to a connected gene promoter lying far away on the linear chromosome map. Some of these enhancer-connected genes had indeed been already identified as contributive to the diseases, by the identification of mutations within the gene's protein-coding regions (exons), validating the approach. Significantly, however, the connected genes also include many genes that were not previously found mutated in their exons, pointing to novel candidate contributors to NDD and traits. Thus, long-range interaction maps, in combination with DNA variants detected in association with NDD, can be used as ""pointers"" to identify novel candidate disease-relevant genes. Functional manipulation of the long-range interaction network involving enhancers and promoters by CRISPR-Cas9-based approaches is beginning to probe for the functional significance of the identified interactions, and the enhancers and the genes involved, improving our understanding of neural development and its pathology."

Known to be genetically determined, pigmentary traits have largely been studied by Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), mostly in Caucasian ancestry cohorts from North Europe, identifying robustly, several loci involved in many of the pigmentary traits. Here, we conduct a detailed analysis by GWAS and Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) of 13 pigmentary-related traits in a South European cohort of Caucasian ancestry (n = 20,000). We observed fair phototype strongly associated with non-melanoma skin cancer and other dermatoses and confirmed by PRS-approach the shared genetic basis with skin and eye diseases, such as melanoma (OR = 0.95), non-melanoma skin cancer (OR = 0.93), basal cell carcinoma (OR = 0.97) and darker phototype with vitiligo (OR = 1.02), cataracts (OR = 1.04). Detailed genetic analyses revealed 37 risk loci associated with 10 out of 13 analyzed traits, and 16 genes significantly associated with at least two pigmentary traits. Some of them have been widely reported, such asMC1R,HERC2,OCA2,TYR,TYRP1,SLC45A2, and some novel candidate genesC1QTNF3,LINC02876, andC1QTNF3-AMACRhave not been reported in the GWAS Catalog, with regulatory potential.

We investigated the genetic overlap and associations between headache and thyroid function traits using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. We found a significant genetic correlation (rg) with headache and hypothyroidism (rg= 0.09,p= 2.00 × 10-4), free thyroxine (fT4) (rg= 0.08,p= 5.50 × 10-3), and hyperthyroidism (rg= -0.14,p= 1.80 × 10-3), a near significant genetic correlation with secondary hypothyroidism (rg= 0.20,p= 5.24 × 10-2), but not with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Pairwise-GWAS analysis revealed six, 14, four and five shared (pleiotropic) loci with headache and hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, secondary hypothyroidism, and fT4, respectively. Cross-trait GWAS meta-analysis identified novel genome-wide significant loci for headache: five with hypothyroidism, three with secondary hypothyroidism, 12 with TSH, and nine with fT4. Of the genes at these loci, six (FAF1,TMX2-CTNND1,AARSD1,PLCD3,ZNF652, andC20orf203; headache-TSH) and six (HMGB1P45,RPL30P1,ZNF462,TMX2-CTNND1,ITPK1,SECISBP2L; headache-fT4) were significant in our gene-based analysis (pFisher's combinedp-value&lt; 2.09 × 10-6). Our causal analysis suggested a positive causal relationship between headache and secondary hypothyroidism (p= 3.64 × 10-4). The results also suggest a positive causal relationship between hypothyroidism and headache (p= 2.45 × 10-3) and a negative causal relationship between hyperthyroidism and headache (p= 1.16 × 10-13). These findings suggest a strong evidence base for a genetic correlation and complex causal relationships between headache and thyroid traits."
"36658108","A comprehensive investigation into the genetic relationship between music engagement and mental health.","Transl Psychiatry","While music engagement is often regarded as beneficial for mental health, some studies report higher risk for depression and anxiety among musicians. This study investigates whether shared underlying genetic influences (genetic pleiotropy) or gene-environment interaction could be at play in the music-mental health association using measured genotypes. In 5,648 Swedish twins with information on music and sport engagement, creative achievements, self-reported mental health and psychiatric diagnoses based on nationwide patient registries, we derived polygenic scores for major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, neuroticism, sensitivity to environmental stress, depressive symptoms and general musicality. In line with phenotypic associations, individuals with higher polygenic scores for major depression and bipolar disorder were more likely to play music, practice more music and reach higher levels of general artistic achievements, while a higher genetic propensity for general musicality was marginally associated with a higher risk for a depression diagnosis. Importantly, polygenic scores for major depression and bipolar remained associated with music engagement when excluding individuals who experienced psychiatric symptoms, just as a genetic propensity for general musicality predicted a depression diagnosis regardless of whether and how much individuals played music. In addition, we found no evidence for gene-environment interaction: the phenotypic association between music engagement and mental health outcomes did not differ for individuals with different genetic vulnerability for mental health problems. Altogether, our findings suggest that mental health problems observed in musically active individuals are partly explained by a pre-existing genetic risk for depression and bipolar disorder and likely reflect horizontal pleiotropy (when one gene influences multiple traits), rather than causal influences of mental health on music engagement, or vice versa (referred to as vertical pleiotropy).© 2023.

To identify protein-inactivating variants that could guide identification of drug target genes for varicose veins and genetic evidence for the disease prevalence difference between the sexes, we conducted a genome-wide association study of varicose veins in Finns using the FinnGen dataset with 17,027 cases and 190,028 controls. We identified 50 associated genetic loci (P < 5.0 × 10-8) of which 29 were novel including one near ERG with female-specificity (rs2836405-G, OR[95% CI] = 1.09[1.05-1.13], P = 3.1 × 10-8). These also include two X-chromosomal (ARHGAP6 and SRPX) and two autosomal novel loci (TGFB2 and GJD3) with protein-coding lead variants enriched above 56-fold in Finns over non-Finnish non-Estonian Europeans. A low-frequency missense variant in GJD3 (p.Pro59Thr) is exclusively associated with a lower risk for varicose veins (OR = 0.62 [0.55-0.70], P = 1.0 × 10-14) in a phenome-wide scan of the FinnGen data. The absence of observed pleiotropy and its membership of the connexin gene family underlines GJD3 as a potential connexin-modulating therapeutic strategy for varicose veins. Our results provide insights into varicose veins etiopathology and highlight the power of isolated populations, including Finns, to discover genetic variants that inform therapeutic development.© 2023.

It typically presents in adulthood and half of the patients have a positive family history. The pathophysiology of otosclerosis is poorly understood. A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a single association locus in an intronic region of RELN. Here, we report a meta-analysis of GWAS studies of otosclerosis in three population-based biobanks comprising 3504 cases and 861,198 controls. We identify 23 novel risk loci (p < 5 × 10-8) and report an association in RELN and three previously reported candidate gene or linkage regions (TGFB1, MEPE, and OTSC7). We demonstrate developmental stage-dependent immunostaining patterns of MEPE and RUNX2 in mouse otic capsules. In most association loci, the nearest protein-coding genes are implicated in bone remodelling, mineralization or severe skeletal disorders. We highlight multiple genes involved in transforming growth factor beta signalling for follow-up studies.© 2023. The Author(s)."

"36624241","Genome-wide association study of school grades identifies genetic overlap between language ability, psychopathology and creativity.","Sci Rep","Cognitive functions of individuals with psychiatric disorders differ from that of the general population. Such cognitive differences often manifest early in life as differential school performance and have a strong genetic basis. Here we measured genetic predictors of school performance in 30,982 individuals in English, Danish and mathematics via a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and studied their relationship with risk for six major psychiatric disorders. When decomposing the school performance into math and language-specific performances, we observed phenotypically and genetically a strong negative correlation between math performance and risk for most psychiatric disorders. But language performance correlated positively with risk for certain disorders, especially schizophrenia, which we replicate in an independent sample (n = 4547). We also found that the genetic variants relating to increased risk for schizophrenia and better language performance are overrepresented in individuals involved in creative professions (n = 2953) compared to the general population (n = 164,622). The findings together suggest that language ability, creativity and psychopathology might stem from overlapping genetic roots.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36595504","Association between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and prostate cancer risk: A Mendelian randomisation study.","PLoS Med","Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the second most prevalent malignancy in men worldwide. Observational studies have linked the use of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) lowering therapies with reduced risk of PrCa, which may potentially be attributable to confounding factors. In this study, we performed a drug target Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis to evaluate the association of genetically proxied inhibition of LDL-c-lowering drug targets on risk of PrCa.Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with LDL-c (P < 5 × 10-8) from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 1,320,016) and located in and around the HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 genes were used to proxy the therapeutic inhibition of these targets. Summary-level data regarding the risk of total, advanced, and early-onset PrCa were obtained from the PRACTICAL consortium. Validation analyses were performed using genetic instruments from an LDL-c GWAS conducted on male UK Biobank participants of European ancestry (N = 201,678), as well as instruments selected based on liver-derived gene expression and circulation plasma levels of targets. We also investigated whether putative mediators may play a role in findings for traits previously implicated in PrCa risk (i.e., lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), body mass index (BMI), and testosterone). Applying two-sample MR using the inverse-variance weighted approach provided strong evidence supporting an effect of genetically proxied inhibition of PCSK9 (equivalent to a standard deviation (SD) reduction in LDL-c) on lower risk of total PrCa (odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.76 to 0.96, P = 9.15 × 10-3) and early-onset PrCa (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.95, P = 0.023). Genetically proxied HMGCR inhibition provided a similar central effect estimate on PrCa risk, although with a wider 95% CI (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.62 to 1.13, P = 0.244), whereas genetically proxied NPC1L1 inhibition had an effect on higher PrCa risk with a 95% CI that likewise included the null (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.87 to 2.04, P = 0.180). Analyses using male-stratified instruments provided consistent results. Secondary MR analyses supported a genetically proxied effect of liver-specific PCSK9 expression (OR = 0.90 per SD reduction in PCSK9 expression, 95% CI = 0.86 to 0.95, P = 5.50 × 10-5) and circulating plasma levels of PCSK9 (OR = 0.93 per SD reduction in PCSK9 protein levels, 95% CI = 0.87 to 0.997, P = 0.04) on PrCa risk. Colocalization analyses identified strong evidence (posterior probability (PPA) = 81.3%) of a shared genetic variant (rs553741) between liver-derived PCSK9 expression and PrCa risk, whereas weak evidence was found for HMGCR (PPA = 0.33%) and NPC1L1 expression (PPA = 0.38%). Moreover, genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition was strongly associated with Lp(a) levels (Beta = -0.08, 95% CI = -0.12 to -0.05, P = 1.00 × 10-5), but not BMI or testosterone, indicating a possible role for Lp(a) in the biological mechanism underlying the association between PCSK9 and PrCa. Notably, we emphasise that our estimates are based on a lifelong exposure that makes direct comparisons with trial results challenging.Our study supports a strong association between genetically proxied inhibition of PCSK9 and a lower risk of total and early-onset PrCa, potentially through an alternative mechanism other than the on-target effect on LDL-c. Further evidence from clinical studies is needed to confirm this finding as well as the putative mediatory role of Lp(a).Copyright: © 2023 Fang et al.

This cross-sectional study included residents who participated as volunteers in a health promotion study. Lifestyle data, blood chemical analysis data, and SLC gene polymorphism information were collected from each participant. Univariate analyses were carried out to determine differences between groups and correlations in SCr. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to confirm the independence of factors that were significantly different in the univariate analyses. In multiple regression analyses, muscle mass, serum cystatin C concentrations, body fat percentage, serum albumin concentrations, and SLC47A2 c.-130G/G had the highest contribution to SCr concentrations, in that order (standardized regression coefficients = .505, .332, -.234, .123, and .084, respectively). The final model explained 72.2% of the variability in SCr concentrations. The SLC47A2 c.-130G > A polymorphism may affect creatinine dynamics in the proximal tubules. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of SLC transporter gene polymorphisms on SCr concentrations in patients with various diseases in real-world clinical settings.© 2023 The Authors.

"36609218","Three-dimensional genome landscape comprehensively reveals patterns of spatial gene regulation in papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancers: a study using representative cell lines for each cancer type.","Cell Mol Biol Lett","Spatial chromatin structure is intricately linked with somatic aberrations, and somatic mutations of various cancer-related genes, termed co-mutations (CoMuts), occur in certain patterns during cancer initiation and progression. The functional mechanisms underlying these genetic events remain largely unclear in thyroid cancer (TC). With discrepant differentiation, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) differ greatly in characteristics and prognosis. We aimed to reveal the spatial gene alterations and regulations between the two TC subtypes.We systematically investigated and compared the spatial co-mutations between ATC (8305C), PTC (BCPAP and TPC-1), and normal thyroid cells (Nthy-ori-3-1). We constructed a framework integrating whole-genome sequencing (WGS), high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and transcriptome sequencing, to systematically detect the associations between the somatic co-mutations of cancer-related genes, structural variations (SVs), copy number variations (CNVs), and high-order chromatin conformation.Spatial co-mutation hotspots were enriched around topologically associating domains (TADs) in TC. A common set of 227 boundaries were identified in both ATC and PTC, with significant overlaps between them. The spatial proximities of the co-mutated gene pairs in the two TC types were significantly greater than in the gene-level and overall backgrounds, and ATC cells had higher TAD contact frequency with CoMuts > 10 compared with PTC cells. Compared with normal thyroid cells, in ATC the number of the created novel three-dimensional chromatin structural domains increased by 10%, and the number of shifted TADs decreased by 7%. We found five TAD blocks with CoMut genes/events specific to ATC with certain mutations in genes including MAST-NSUN4, AM129B/TRUB2, COL5A1/PPP1R26, PPP1R26/GPSM1/CCDC183, and PRAC2/DLX4. For the majority of ATC and PTC cells, the HOXA10 and HIF2α signals close to the transcription start sites of CoMut genes within TADs were significantly stronger than those at the background. CNV breakpoints significantly overlapped with TAD boundaries in both TC subtypes. ATCs had more CNV losses overlapping with TAD boundaries, and noncoding SVs involved in intrachromosomal SVs, amplified inversions, and tandem duplication differed between ATC and PTC. TADs with short range were more abundant in ATC than PTC. More switches of A/B compartment types existed in ATC cells compared with PTC. Gene expression was significantly synchronized, and orchestrated by complex epigenetics and regulatory elements.Chromatin interactions and gene alterations and regulations are largely heterogeneous in TC. CNVs and complex SVs may function in the TC genome by interplaying with TADs, and are largely different between ATC and PTC. Complexity of TC genomes, which are highly organized by 3D genome-wide interactions mediating mutational and structural variations and gene activation, may have been largely underappreciated. Our comprehensive analysis may provide key evidence and targets for more customized diagnosis and treatment of TC.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Acting as the catalytic subunits of human COMPASS-like complexes, KMT2A-D methylate H3K4 at promoters and enhancers. KMT2A-D contain understudied highly conserved triplets and a quartet of plant homeodomains (PHDs). Here, we show that all clustered (multiple) PHDs localize to the well-defined loci of H3K4me3 and H3 acetylation-rich active promoters and enhancers. Surprisingly, we observe little difference in binding pattern between PHDs from promoter-specific KMT2A-B and enhancer-specific KMT2C-D. Fusion of the KMT2A CXXC domain to the PHDs drastically enhances their preference for promoters over enhancers. Hence, the presence of CXXC domains in KMT2A-B, but not KMT2C-D, may explain the promoter/enhancer preferences of the full-length proteins. Importantly, targets of PHDs overlap with KMT2A targets and are enriched in genes involved in the cancer pathways. We also observe that PHDs of KMT2A-D are mutated in cancer, especially within conserved folding motifs (Cys4HisCys2Cys/His). The mutations cause a domain loss-of-function. Taken together, our data suggest that PHDs of KMT2A-D guide the full-length proteins to active promoters and enhancers, and thus play a role in positive transcriptional memory.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The pathogenesis of GDM is not completely clear, but what is clear is that with the development and growth of the placenta, GDM onset and blood glucose is difficult to control, while gestational diabetes patients' blood glucose drops and reaches normal after placenta delivery. This may be associated with placental secretion of insulin-like growth factor, adipokines, tumor necrosis factor-α, cytokines and insulin resistance. Therefore, endocrine secretion of placenta plays a key role in the pathogenesis of GDM. The influence of DNA methylation of these molecules and pathway-related genes on gene expression is also closely related to the pathogenesis of GDM. Here, this review attempts to clarify the pathogenesis of GDM and the related maternal and placental DNA methylation changes and how they affect metabolic pathways."

Atherosclerosis is associated with aging and environmental effects. Thus, promoter methylation profiling may be used as an epigenetic tool to evaluate the impact of aging and the environment on atherosclerosis development. However, gene-specific methylation changes are currently inadequate epigenetic markers for predicting atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease pathogenesis.We profiled and validated changes in gene-specific promoter methylation associated with atherosclerosis using stenosis radiophenotypes of cranial vessels and blood inflammatory cells rather than direct sampling of atherosclerotic plaques. First, we profiled gene-specific promoter methylation changes using digital restriction enzyme analysis of methylation (DREAM) sequencing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from eight samples each of cranial vessels with and without severe-stenosis radiophenotypes. Using DREAM sequencing profiling, 11 tags were detected in the promoter regions of the ACVR1C, ADCK5, EFNA2, ENOSF1, GLS2, KNDC1, MTNR1B, PACSIN3, PAX8-AS1, TLDC1, and ZNF7 genes. Using methylation evaluation, we found that EFNA2, ENOSF1, GLS2, KNDC1, MTNR1B, PAX8-AS1, and TLDC1 showed > 5% promoter methylation in non-plaque intima, atherosclerotic vascular tissues, and buffy coats. Using logistic regression analysis, we identified hypomethylation of MTNR1B as an independent variable for the stenosis radiophenotype prediction model by combining it with traditional atherosclerosis risk factors including age, hypertension history, and increases in creatinine, lipoprotein (a), and homocysteine. We performed fivefold cross-validation of the prediction model using 384 patients with ischemic stroke (50 [13%] no-stenosis and 334 [87%] > 1 stenosis radiophenotype). For the cross-validation, the training dataset included 70% of the dataset. The prediction model showed an accuracy of 0.887, specificity to predict stenosis radiophenotype of 0.940, sensitivity to predict no-stenosis radiophenotype of 0.533, and area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.877 to predict stenosis radiophenotype from the test dataset including 30% of the dataset.We identified and validated MTNR1B hypomethylation as an epigenetic marker to predict cranial vessel atherosclerosis using stenosis radiophenotypes and blood inflammatory cells rather than direct atherosclerotic plaque sampling.© 2023.

"36593969","Role of primary aging hallmarks in Alzheimer´s disease.","Theranostics","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, which severely threatens the health of the elderly and causes significant economic and social burdens. The causes of AD are complex and include heritable but mostly aging-related factors. The primary aging hallmarks include genomic instability, telomere wear, epigenetic changes, and loss of protein stability, which play a dominant role in the aging process. Although AD is closely associated with the aging process, the underlying mechanisms involved in AD pathogenesis have not been well characterized. This review summarizes the available literature about primary aging hallmarks and their roles in AD pathogenesis. By analyzing published literature, we attempted to uncover the possible mechanisms of aberrant epigenetic markers with related enzymes, transcription factors, and loss of proteostasis in AD. In particular, the importance of oxidative stress-induced DNA methylation and DNA methylation-directed histone modifications and proteostasis are highlighted. A molecular network of gene regulatory elements that undergoes a dynamic change with age may underlie age-dependent AD pathogenesis, and can be used as a new drug target to treat AD.© The author(s)."

Multi-omics regulatory networks in patient bulk tumors and single cells can shed light on molecular disease mechanisms. Integration of multi-omics data with large-scale patient electronic medical records (EMRs) can lead to the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this review, multi-omics data harmonization methods were introduced, and common approaches to molecular network inference were summarized. Our Prediction Logic Boolean Implication Networks (PLBINs) have advantages over other methods in constructing genome-scale multi-omics networks in bulk tumors and single cells in terms of computational efficiency, scalability, and accuracy. Based on the constructed multi-modal regulatory networks, graph theory network centrality metrics can be used in the prioritization of candidates for discovering biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Our approach to integrating multi-omics profiles in a patient cohort with large-scale patient EMRs such as the SEER-Medicare cancer registry combined with extensive external validation can identify potential biomarkers applicable in large patient populations. These methodologies form a conceptually innovative framework to analyze various available information from research laboratories and healthcare systems, accelerating the discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets to ultimately improve cancer patient survival outcomes."

COOBoostR leverages regional somatic mutation density information and chromatin mark features to be applied to an extreme gradient boosting-based machine-learning algorithm. COOBoostR ranks chromatin marks from various tissue and cell types, which best explain the somatic mutation density landscape of any sample of interest. A specific tissue or cell type matching the chromatin mark feature with highest explanatory power is designated as a potential tissue- or cell-of-origin. Through integrating either ChIP-seq based chromatin data, along with regional somatic mutation density data derived from normal cells/tissue, precancerous lesions, and cancer types, we show that COOBoostR outperforms existing random forest-based methods in prediction speed, with comparable or better tissue or cell-of-origin prediction performance (prediction accuracy-normal cells/tissue: 76.99%, precancerous lesions: 95.65%, cancer cells: 89.39%). In addition, our results suggest a dynamic somatic mutation accumulation at the normal tissue or cell stage which could be intertwined with the changes in open chromatin marks and enhancer sites. These results further represent chromatin marks shaping the somatic mutation landscape at the early stage of mutation accumulation, possibly even before the initiation of precancerous lesions or neoplasia."
"36596305","Progressive transformation of the HIV-1 reservoir cell profile over two decades of antiviral therapy.","Cell Host Microbe","HIV-1 establishes a life-long reservoir of virally infected cells which cannot be eliminated by antiretroviral therapy (ART). Here, we demonstrate a markedly altered viral reservoir profile of long-term ART-treated individuals, characterized by large clones of intact proviruses preferentially integrated in heterochromatin locations, most prominently in centromeric satellite/micro-satellite DNA. Longitudinal evaluations suggested that this specific reservoir configuration results from selection processes that promote the persistence of intact proviruses in repressive chromatin positions, while proviruses in permissive chromosomal locations are more likely to be eliminated. A bias toward chromosomal integration sites in heterochromatin locations was also observed for intact proviruses in study participants who maintained viral control after discontinuation of antiretroviral therapy. Together, these results raise the possibility that antiviral selection mechanisms during long-term ART may induce an HIV-1 reservoir structure with features of deep latency and, possibly, more limited abilities to drive rebound viremia upon treatment interruptions.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

This review covers the unique properties of these types of 'omics and their roles as causal mediators in cardiovascular disease. Moreover, applications and challenges of integrating multiple types of 'omics data to increase predictive power, improve causal inference, and elucidate biological mechanisms are discussed.Multi-omics approaches are growing in adoption as they provide orthogonal evidence and overcome the limitations of individual types of 'omics data. Studies with multiple types of 'omics data have improved the diagnosis and prediction of disease states and afforded a deeper understanding of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, beyond any single type of 'omics data. For instance, disease-associated loci in the genome can be supplemented with other 'omics to prioritise causal genes and understand the function of non-coding variants. Alternatively, techniques, such as Mendelian randomisation, can leverage genetics to provide evidence supporting a causal role for disease-associated molecules, and elucidate their role in disease pathogenesis. As technologies improve, costs for 'omics studies will continue to fall and datasets will become increasingly accessible to researchers.

"36588793","Predicting gene expression from histone modifications with self-attention based neural networks and transfer learning.","Front Genet","It is well known that histone modifications play an important part in various chromatin-dependent processes such as DNA replication, repair, and transcription. Using computational models to predict gene expression based on histone modifications has been intensively studied. However, the accuracy of the proposed models still has room for improvement, especially in cross-cell lines gene expression prediction. In the work, we proposed a new model TransferChrome to predict gene expression from histone modifications based on deep learning. The model uses a densely connected convolutional network to capture the features of histone modifications data and uses self-attention layers to aggregate global features of the data. For cross-cell lines gene expression prediction, TransferChrome adopts transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy. We trained and tested our model on 56 different cell lines from the REMC database. The experimental results show that our model achieved an average Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 84.79%. Compared to three state-of-the-art models, TransferChrome improves the prediction performance on most cell lines. The experiments of cross-cell lines gene expression prediction show that TransferChrome performs best and is an efficient model for predicting cross-cell lines gene expression.Copyright © 2022 Chen, Xie and Wen."
"36644297","Chronic allergy signaling: is it all stressed-out mitochondria?","Fac Rev","Allergic diseases in general, and chronic allergic inflammation in particular, are on the rise in the United States and other developed countries. The idea of chronic allergic disease as a chronic type 2 immune response has been around for several decades. However, data suggest that other mechanisms may be important in chronic disease. Therefore, we believe it is time for a paradigm shift in understanding the mechanistic causes of disease symptoms in these diseases. In this review, we have avoided the classic canonical pathways and focused on the emerging idea that oxidative stress, changes in immuno-metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic changes (particularly microRNA profile) may be working concurrently or synergistically to potentiate allergic disease symptoms. Furthermore, we have addressed how the epidemic of obesity exacerbates allergic disease via the dysregulation of the aforementioned factors.Copyright: © 2022 Grayson MH et al."
"36674744","Montelukast Increased IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP via Epigenetic Regulation in Airway Epithelial Cells.","Int J Mol Sci","The epithelium-derived cytokines interleukin (IL)-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are important mediators that initiate innate type 2 immune responses in asthma. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are commonly used to prevent asthma exacerbations. However, the effects of LTRAs on epithelium-derived cytokines expression in airway epithelial cells are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of LTRAs on the expression of epithelium-derived cytokines in human airway epithelial cells and to explore possible underlying intracellular processes, including epigenetic regulation. A549 or HBE cells in air-liquid interface conditions were pretreated with different concentrations of LTRAs. The expression of epithelium-derived cytokines and intracellular signaling were investigated by real-time PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot. In addition, epigenetic regulation was investigated using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. The expression of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP was increased under LTRAs treatment and suppressed by inhaled corticosteroid cotreatment. Montelukast-induced IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP expression were mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways and regulated by histone H3 acetylation and H3K36 and H3K79 trimethylation. LTRAs alone might increase inflammation and exacerbate asthma by inducing the production of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP; therefore, LTRA monotherapy may not be an appropriate therapeutic option for asthma."
"36668811","Perinatal Lead Exposure Promotes Sex-Specific Epigenetic Programming of Disease-Relevant Pathways in Mouse Heart.","Toxics","Environmental contaminants such as the metal lead (Pb) are associated with cardiovascular disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In particular, little is known about how exposure to Pb during early development impacts the cardiac epigenome at any point across the life course and potential differences between sexes. In a mouse model of human-relevant perinatal exposures, we utilized RNA-seq and Enhanced Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (ERRBS) to investigate the effects of Pb exposure during gestation and lactation on gene expression and DNA methylation, respectively, in the hearts of male and female mice at weaning. For ERRBS, we identified differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) or differentially methylated 1000 bp regions (DMRs) based on a minimum absolute change in methylation of 10% and an FDR &lt; 0.05. For gene expression data, an FDR &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. No individual genes met the FDR cutoff for gene expression; however, we found that Pb exposure leads to significant changes in the expression of gene pathways relevant to cardiovascular development and disease. We further found that Pb promotes sex-specific changes in DNA methylation at hundreds of gene loci (280 DMCs and 99 DMRs in males, 189 DMCs and 121 DMRs in females), and pathway analysis revealed that these CpGs and regions collectively function in embryonic development. In males, differential methylation also occurred at genes related to immune function and metabolism. We then investigated whether genes exhibiting differential methylation at weaning were also differentially methylated in hearts from a cohort of Pb-exposed mice at adulthood. We found that a single gene, Galnt2, showed differential methylation in both sexes and time points. In a human cohort investigating the influence of prenatal Pb exposure on the epigenome, we also observed an inverse association between first trimester Pb concentrations and adolescent blood leukocyte DNA methylation at a locus in GALNT2, suggesting that this gene may represent a biomarker of Pb exposure across species. Together, these data, across two time points in mice and in a human birth cohort study, collectively demonstrate that Pb exposure promotes sex-specific programming of the cardiac epigenome, and provide potential mechanistic insight into how Pb causes cardiovascular disease."
"36671726","Epigenetic Clock Explains White Matter Hyperintensity Burden Irrespective of Chronological Age.","Biology (Basel)","In this manuscript we studied the relationship between WMH and biological age (B-age) in patients with acute stroke. We included in this study 247 patients with acute stroke recruited at Hospital del Mar having both epigenetic (DNA methylation) and magnetic resonance imaging data. WMH were measured using a semi-automated method. B-age was calculated using two widely used methods: the Hannum and Horvath formulas. We used multiple linear regression models to interrogate the role of B-age on WMH volume after adjusting for chronological age (C-age) and other covariables. Average C-age of the sample was 68.4 (±11.8) and we observed a relatively high median WMH volume (median = 8.8 cm3, Q1-Q3 = 4.05-18.8). After adjusting for potential confounders, we observed a significant effect of B-ageHannumon WMH volume (βHannum= 0.023,p-value = 0.029) independently of C-age, which remained significant (βC-age= 0.021,p-value = 0.036). Finally, we performed a mediation analysis, which allowed us to discover that 42.7% of the effect of C-age on WMH is mediated by B-ageHannum. On the other hand, B-ageHoarvathshowed no significant associations with WMH after being adjusted for C-age. In conclusion, we show for the first time that biological age, measured through DNA methylation, contributes substantially to explain WMH volumetric burden irrespective of chronological age."
"36647002","Placental DNA methylation profile as predicting marker for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).","Mol Med","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs normal brain development and socio-cognitive abilities. The pathogenesis of this condition points out the involvement of genetic and environmental factors during in-utero life. Placenta, as an interface tissue between mother and fetus, provides developing fetus requirements and exposes it to maternal environment as well. Therefore, the alteration of DNA methylation as epigenetic consequence of gene-environmental interaction in the placenta could shed light on ASD pathogenesis. In this study, we reviewed the current findings on placental methylation status and its association with ASD. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in ASD-developing placenta were found to be mainly enriched in ASD gene loci affecting synaptogenesis, microtubule dynamics, neurogenesis and neuritogenesis. In addition, non-genic DMRs in ASD-placenta proposes an alternative contributing mechanism for ASD development. Our study highlights the importance of placental DNA methylation signature as a biomarker for ASD prediction.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36613933","Type IV Collagen and SOX9 Are Molecular Targets of BET Inhibition in Experimental Glomerulosclerosis.","Int J Mol Sci","Progressive glomerulonephritis (GN) is characterized by an excessive accumulation of extracellular (ECM) proteins, mainly type IV collagen (COLIV), in the glomerulus leading to glomerulosclerosis. The current therapeutic approach to GN is suboptimal. Epigenetic drugs could be novel therapeutic options for human disease. Among these drugs, bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) inhibitors (iBETs) have shown beneficial effects in experimental kidney disease and fibrotic disorders. Sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9) is a transcription factor involved in regulating proliferation, migration, and regeneration, but its role in kidney fibrosis is still unclear. We investigated whether iBETs could regulate ECM accumulation in experimental GN and evaluated the role of SOX9 in this process. For this purpose, we tested the iBET JQ1 in mice with anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis induced by nephrotoxic serum (NTS). In NTS-injected mice, JQ1 treatment reduced glomerular ECM deposition, mainly by inhibiting glomerular COLIV accumulation andCol4a3gene overexpression. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that JQ1 inhibited the recruitment and binding of BRD4 to theCol4a3promoter and reduced its transcription. Active SOX9 was found in the nuclei of glomerular cells of NTS-injured kidneys, mainly in COLIV-stained regions. JQ1 treatment blocked SOX9 nuclear translocation in injured kidneys. Moreover, in vitro JQ1 blocked TGF-β1-induced SOX9 activation and ECM production in cultured mesangial cells. Additionally, SOX9 gene silencing inhibited ECM production, including COLIV production. Our results demonstrated that JQ1 inhibited SOX9/COLIV, to reduce experimental glomerulosclerosis, supporting further research of iBET as a potential therapeutic option in progressive glomerulosclerosis."

We sought to identify and characterize differentially expressed genes in early-onset MI in a translational approach. In an observational case-control study, transcriptomes from 112 early-onset MI individuals showed upregulated G protein-coupled receptor 15 (GPR15) expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared to controls (fold change = 1.4,p= 1.87 × 10-7).GPR15expression correlated with intima-media thickness (β = 0.8498,p= 0.111), C-reactive protein (β = 0.2238,p= 0.0052), ejection fraction (β = -0.9991,p= 0.0281) and smoking (β = 0.7259,p= 2.79 × 10-10). The relation between smoking and MI was diminished after the inclusion ofGPR15expression as mediator in mediation analysis (from 1.27 (p= 1.9 × 10-5) to 0.46 (p= 0.21)). The DNA methylation of twoGPR15sites was 1%/5% lower in early-onset MI individuals versus controls (p= 2.37 × 10-6/p= 0.0123), with site CpG3.98251219 significantly predicting risk for incident MI (hazard ratio = 0.992,p= 0.0177). The nucleotide polymorphism rs2230344 (C/T) withinGPR15was associated with early-onset MI (odds ratio = 3.61,p= 0.044). Experimental validation showed 6.3-fold increasedGpr15expression in an ischemic mouse model (p&lt; 0.05) and 4-fold increasedGpr15expression in cardiomyocytes under ischemic stress (p&lt; 0.001). After the induction of MI,Gpr15gfp/gfpmice showed lower survival (p= 0.042) and deregulated gene expression for response to hypoxia and signaling pathways. Using a translational approach, our data provide evidence that GPR15 is linked to cardiovascular diseases, mediating the adverse effects of smoking."
"36648863","Sex-Specific miRNA Differences in Liquid Biopsies from Subjects with Solid Tumors and Healthy Controls.","Epigenomes","Dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms has been recognized to play a crucial role in cancer development, but these mechanisms vary between sexes. Therefore, we focused on sex-specific differences in the context of cancer-based data from a recent study. A total of 12 cell-free DNA methylation targets in CpG-rich promoter regions and 48 miRNAs were analyzed by qPCR in plasma samples from 8 female and 7 male healthy controls as well as 48 female and 80 male subjects with solid tumors of the bladder, brain, colorectal region (CRC), lung, stomach, pancreas, and liver. Due to the small sample size in some groups and/or the non-balanced distribution of men and women, sex-specific differences were evaluated statistically only in healthy subjects, CRC, stomach or pancreas cancer patients, and all cancer subjects combined (nfemale/male-8/7, 14/14, 8/15, 6/6, 48/80, respectively). Several miRNAs with opposing expressions between the sexes were observed for healthy subjects (miR-17-5p, miR-26b-5p); CRC patients (miR-186-5p, miR-22-3p, miR-22-5p, miR-25-3p, miR-92a-3p, miR-16-5p); stomach cancer patients (miR-133a-3p, miR-22-5p); and all cancer patients combined (miR-126-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-183-5p). Moreover, sex-specific correlations that were dependent on cancer stage were observed in women (miR-27a-3p) and men (miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p). Our results indicate the complex and distinct role of epigenetic regulation, particularly miRNAs, depending not only on the health status but also on the sex of the patient. The same miRNAs could have diverse effects in different tissues and opposing effects between the biological sexes, which should be considered in biomarker research."
"36644165","Identification of Smoking-Associated Transcriptome Aberration in Blood with Machine Learning Methods.","Biomed Res Int","Long-term cigarette smoking causes various human diseases, including respiratory disease, cancer, and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Alterations in gene expression and variable splicing processes induced by smoking are associated with the development of diseases. This study applied advanced machine learning methods to identify the isoforms with important roles in distinguishing smokers from former smokers based on the expression profile of isoforms from current and former smokers collected in one previous study. These isoforms were deemed as features, which were first analyzed by the Boruta to select features highly correlated with the target variables. Then, the selected features were evaluated by four feature ranking algorithms, resulting in four feature lists. The incremental feature selection method was applied to each list for obtaining the optimal feature subsets and building high-performance classification models. Furthermore, a series of classification rules were accessed by decision tree with the highest performance. Eventually, the rationality of the mined isoforms (features) and classification rules was verified by reviewing previous research. Features such as isoforms ENST00000464835 (expressed by LRRN3), ENST00000622663 (expressed by SASH1), and ENST00000284311 (expressed by GPR15), and pathways (cytotoxicity mediated by natural killer cell and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction) revealed by the enrichment analysis, were highly relevant to smoking response, suggesting the robustness of our analysis pipeline.Copyright © 2023 FeiMing Huang et al."
"36618899","Cognitive variations following exposure to childhood adversity: Evidence from a pre-registered, longitudinal study.","EClinicalMedicine","Different methodological approaches to studying the effects and timing of childhood adversity have been proposed and tested. While childhood adversity has primarily been operationalized through specificity (effects of individual adversity types) and cumulative risk (sum of all adversities reported by an individual) models, dimensional models (probeable through latent class and other cluster analyses) have recently gained traction given that it can overcome some of the limitations of the specificity and cumulative risk approaches. On the other hand, structured lifecourse modelling is a new statistical approach that examines the effects of the timing of adversity exposure on health outcomes by comparing sensitive periods and accumulation hypotheses. In this study, we apply these sets of methodological approaches and theoretical models to better understand the complex effects of childhood adversity on cognitive outcomes.We analysed data obtained from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children for 2965 participants (Male = 1125; Female = 1840). This included parental report of 11 types of childhood adversity when participants were between 8 months and 8.7 years, and performance on inhibition, working memory and emotion recognition neurocognitive tasks when participants were 24 years of age (April 1, 1992-October 31, 2017). We used latent class analysis to classify the participants into subgroups, while we used Kruskal-Wallis test to examine differences in cognitive performance among the adversity subgroups. Additionally, to test whether sensitive period or accumulation models better explain the effects of childhood adversity on cognitive functioning, we carried out separate analyses using structured lifecourse modelling approaches.Latent class analysis showed evidence of 5 classes, namely: low adversity (71.6%), dysfunctional family (9.58%); parental deprivation (9.65%); family poverty (6.07%) and global adversity (3.1%). We observed group differences in cognitive performance among the adversity classes in an inhibition control task, χ2(4) = 15.624, p = 0.003 and working memory task, χ2(4) = 15.986, p = 0.003. Pairwise comparison tests showed that participants in the family poverty class performed significantly worse than those in the low adversity class, for the inhibition control task (p = 0.007) while participants in the global adversity class significantly performed worse than participants in the low adversity class (p = 0.026) and dysfunctional family class (p = 0.034) on the working memory task. A further analysis revealed that the associations between each individual adversity type and cognitive outcomes were mostly consistent with the observed class performance in which they co-occurred. Follow-up analyses suggested that adversity during specific sensitive periods, namely very early childhood and early childhood, explained more variability in these observed associations, compared to the accumulation of adversities.These findings suggest that dimensional approaches e.g., latent class analysis or cluster analysis could be good alternatives to studying childhood adversity. Using latent class analysis for example, can help reveal the population distribution of co-occurring adversity patterns among participants who may be at the greatest health risk and thus, enable a targeted intervention. In addition, this approach could be used to investigate specific pathways that link adversity classes to different developmental outcomes that could further complement the specificity or cumulative risk approaches to adversity. On the other hand, findings from a separate analysis using structured lifecourse modelling approaches also highlight the vital developmental timeframes in childhood during which the impact of adversity exposure on cognitive outcomes is greatest, suggesting the need to provide comprehensive academic and mental health support to individuals exposed during those specific timeframes.T.N. received funding from Cambridge Trust (University of Cambridge).© 2022 The Author(s)."

A Precise Clinical Description May Be Critical for Genetic Testing Approach and Final Diagnosis.","Genes (Basel)","Pathogenic variants in genes are involved in histone acetylation and deacetylation resulting in congenital anomalies, with most patients displaying a neurodevelopmental disorder and dysmorphism. Arboleda-Tham syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in KAT6A (Lysine Acetyltransferase 6A; OMIM 601408) has been recently described as a new neurodevelopmental disorder. Herein, we describe a patient characterized by complex phenotype subsequently diagnosed using the clinical exome sequencing (CES) with Arboleda-Tham syndrome (ARTHS; OMIM 616268). The analysis revealed the presence of de novo pathogenic variant in KAT6A gene, a nucleotide c.3385C&gt;T substitution that introduces a premature termination codon (p.Arg1129*). The need for straight multidisciplinary collaboration and accurate clinical description findings (bowel obstruction/megacolon/intestinal malrotation) was emphasized, together with the utility of CES in establishing an etiological basis in clinical and genetical heterogeneous conditions. Therefore, considering the phenotypic characteristics, the condition's rarity and the reviewed literature, we propose additional diagnostic criteria that could help in the development of future clinical diagnostic guidelines. This was possible thanks to objective examinations performed during the long follow-up period, which permitted scrupulous registration of phenotypic changes over time to further assess this rare disorder. Finally, given that different genetic syndromes are associated with distinct genomic DNA methylation patterns used for diagnostic testing and/or as biomarker of disease, a specific episignature for ARTHS has been identified."

Fibroblasts play major roles in skin wound healing such as in wound contraction and release of growth factors which are of importance in angiogenesis and tissue remodeling. Abnormal fibroblast phenotypes have been identified in patients with chronic wounds. In this work, we analyzed scRNA-seq datasets of normal and wounded skin from mice at day 4 post-wound to investigate fibroblast heterogeneity during the proliferative phase of wound healing. Compositional analysis revealed a specific subset of fibroblast (cluster 3) that primarily increased in wounded skin (14%) compared to normal skin (3.9%). This subset was characterized by a gene signature marked by the plasma membrane proteins Sfrp2 + Sfrp4 + Sfrp1 + and the transcription factors Ebf1 + Prrx1 + Maged1 + . Differential gene expression and enrichment analysis identified epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis to be upregulated in the emerging subset of fibroblasts of the wounded skin. Using two other datasets for murine wounded skin confirmed the increase in cluster 3-like fibroblasts at days 2, 7 and 14 post-wounding with a peak at day 7. By performing a similarity check between the differential gene expression profile between wounded and normal skin for this emerging fibroblast subset with drug signature from the ConnectivityMap database, we identified drugs capable of mimicking the observed gene expression change in fibroblasts during wound healing. TTNPB, verteprofin and nicotinic acid were identified as candidate drugs capable of inducing fibroblast gene expression profile necessary for wound healing. On the other hand, methocarbamol, ifosfamide and penbutolol were recognized to antagonize the identified fibroblast differential expression profile during wound healing which might cause delay in wound healing. Taken together, analysis of murine transcriptomic skin wound healing datasets suggested a subset of fibroblasts capable of inducing EMT and further inferred drugs that might be tested as potential candidates to induce wound closure.© 2023.

"36646695","Epigenetic and post-translational modifications in autophagy: biological functions and therapeutic targets.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","Autophagy is a conserved lysosomal degradation pathway where cellular components are dynamically degraded and re-processed to maintain physical homeostasis. However, the physiological effect of autophagy appears to be multifaced. On the one hand, autophagy functions as a cytoprotective mechanism, protecting against multiple diseases, especially tumor, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative and infectious disease. Conversely, autophagy may also play a detrimental role via pro-survival effects on cancer cells or cell-killing effects on normal body cells. During disorder onset and progression, the expression levels of autophagy-related regulators and proteins encoded by autophagy-related genes (ATGs) are abnormally regulated, giving rise to imbalanced autophagy flux. However, the detailed mechanisms and molecular events of this process are quite complex. Epigenetic, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and miRNAs, and post-translational modifications, including ubiquitination, phosphorylation and acetylation, precisely manipulate gene expression and protein function, and are strongly correlated with the occurrence and development of multiple diseases. There is substantial evidence that autophagy-relevant regulators and machineries are subjected to epigenetic and post-translational modulation, resulting in alterations in autophagy levels, which subsequently induces disease or affects the therapeutic effectiveness to agents. In this review, we focus on the regulatory mechanisms mediated by epigenetic and post-translational modifications in disease-related autophagy to unveil potential therapeutic targets. In addition, the effect of autophagy on the therapeutic effectiveness of epigenetic drugs or drugs targeting post-translational modification have also been discussed, providing insights into the combination with autophagy activators or inhibitors in the treatment of clinical diseases.© 2023.

It is characterized by a persistent inflammatory state with inflammatory markers overexpressed, which in turn leads to a higher cardiovascular risk. It is well known that physical exercise reduces the inflammatory state in obese children. In the present study, we evaluated various biochemical parameters in obese children performing physical exercise compared to a group of obese sedentary children. Hence, the objective is to identify a panel of biomarkers to prevent numerous obesity-related complications.We examined two populations: 44 sedentary obese children (OSe), recruited on 5 November 2018 from Santobono-Pausilipon Children's Hospital, Naples (Italy) of age = 11 ± 3.3 and 30 obese children who practice sport (OSp) of age = 10 ± 2.5. We observed a significant variation in some biochemical parameters such as white blood cells, C-reactive protein (CRP), glycemia and insulinemia. Moreover, we determined the levels of interleukins, chemokines and defensins by ELISA assay.Our results showed a reduction in serum level of glycemia (p-value &lt; 0.001), neutrophils (p-value &lt; 0.05) and CRP (p-value &lt; 0.05), whereas no relevant variations have been reported in insulin levels. Moreover, we found a decrease in serum levels of PDGF-β (p-value &lt; 0.05), IL-9 (p-value &lt; 0.01), IL-6 (p-value &lt; 0.0001), IL-8 (p-value &lt; 0.0001), IP-10 (p-value &lt; 0.01), Eotaxin (p-value &lt; 0.0001) and GM-CSF (p-value &lt; 0.01) in OSp population in comparison to OSe. At the same time, we did not observe any significant variation in serum levels of IL-1ra and IL-17 between the two populations. On the other hand, we found an increase in HNP-1 (p-value &lt; 0.0001) and HBD1 (p-value &lt; 0.01) in OSp if compared to OSe.This study shed light on the role of physical exercise on CO, demonstrating in our population that an early evaluation of some biochemical parameters could be an assumption to prescribe physical exercise in order to monitor and prevent childhood obesity and related disorders."

Here, we analyze the transcriptomic response ofCaenorhabditis elegansto simulated microgravity and observe the maintained transcriptomic response after returning to ground conditions for four, eight, and twelve days. We show that 75% of the simulated microgravity-induced changes on gene expression persist after returning to ground conditions for four days while most of these changes are reverted after twelve days. Our results from integrative RNA-seq and mass spectrometry analyses suggest that simulated microgravity affects longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling pathways. Finally, we identified 118 genes that are commonly differentially expressed in simulated microgravity- and space-exposed worms. Overall, this work provides insight into the effect of microgravity on biological systems during and after exposure."
"36611835","Human Health during Space Travel: State-of-the-Art Review.","Cells","The field of human space travel is in the midst of a dramatic revolution. Upcoming missions are looking to push the boundaries of space travel, with plans to travel for longer distances and durations than ever before. Both the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and several commercial space companies (e.g., Blue Origin, SpaceX, Virgin Galactic) have already started the process of preparing for long-distance, long-duration space exploration and currently plan to explore inner solar planets (e.g., Mars) by the 2030s. With the emergence of space tourism, space travel has materialized as a potential new, exciting frontier of business, hospitality, medicine, and technology in the coming years. However, current evidence regarding human health in space is very limited, particularly pertaining to short-term and long-term space travel. This review synthesizes developments across the continuum of space health including prior studies and unpublished data from NASA related to each individual organ system, and medical screening prior to space travel. We categorized the extraterrestrial environment into exogenous (e.g., space radiation and microgravity) and endogenous processes (e.g., alteration of humans' natural circadian rhythm and mental health due to confinement, isolation, immobilization, and lack of social interaction) and their various effects on human health. The aim of this review is to explore the potential health challenges associated with space travel and how they may be overcome in order to enable new paradigms for space health, as well as the use of emerging Artificial Intelligence based (AI) technology to propel future space health research."

The molecular nature of the process of aging is unknown but several potential indicators have been used in research. The concept of accelerated aging in schizophrenia took hold in 2008 and its timing, pace, determinants and deterrents have been increasingly examined since. The present overview of the field is brief and selective, based on diverse studies, expert opinions and successive reviews. Current thinking is that the timing of age acceleration in schizophrenia can occur at different time periods of the lifespan in different individuals, and that antipsychotics may be preventive. The majority opinion is that the cognitive decline and premature death often seen in schizophrenia are, in principle, preventable."
"36675239","In Silico Pan-Cancer Analysis Reveals Prognostic Role of the Erythroferrone (ERFE) Gene in Human Malignancies.","Int J Mol Sci","The erythroferrone gene (ERFE), also termedCTRP15, belongs to the C1q tumor necrosis factor-related protein (CTRP) family. Despite multiple reports about the involvement of CTRPs in cancer, the role of ERFE in cancer progression is largely unknown. We previously found thatERFEwas upregulated in erythroid progenitors in myelodysplastic syndromes and strongly predicted overall survival. To understand the potential molecular interactions and identify cues for further functional investigation and the prognostic impact of ERFE in other malignancies, we performed a pan-cancer in silico analysis utilizing the Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Our analysis shows that theERFEmRNA is significantly overexpressed in 22 tumors and affects the prognosis in 11 cancer types. In certain tumors such as breast cancer and adrenocortical carcinoma,ERFEoverexpression has been associated with the presence of oncogenic mutations and a higher tumor mutational burden. The expression ofERFEis co-regulated with the factors and pathways involved in cancer progression and metastasis, including activated pathways of the cell cycle, extracellular matrix/tumor microenvironment, G protein-coupled receptor, NOTCH, WNT, and PI3 kinase-AKT. Moreover,ERFEexpression influences intratumoral immune cell infiltration. Conclusively,ERFEis aberrantly expressed in pan-cancer and can potentially function as a prognostic biomarker based on its putative functions during tumorigenesis and tumor development."
"36671477","Ploidy Status of Ovarian Cancer Cell Lines and Their Association with Gene Expression Profiles.","Biomolecules","As a cancer type potentially dominated by copy number variations, ovarian cancer shows hyperploid karyotypes and large-scale chromosome alterations, which might be promising biomarkers correlated with tumor metastasis and chemoresistance. Experimental studies have provided more information about the roles of aneuploids and polyploids in ovarian cancer. However, ploidy evaluation of ovarian cancer cell lines is still limited, even in some ploidy-related research. Herein, the ploidy landscape of 51 ovarian cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) were analyzed, and the ploidy statuses of 13 human ovarian cancer cell lines and 2 murine cell lines were evaluated using G-banding and flow cytometry. Most human ovarian cancer cell lines were aneuploid, with modal numbers of 52-86 and numerical complexity ranging from 5 to 12. A2780, COV434 and TOV21G were screened as diploid cell lines, with a modal number of 46, a low aneuploid score and a near-diploid ploidy value. Two murine cell lines, both OV2944-HM1 and ID-8, were near-tetraploid. Integrated information on karyotypes, aneuploid score and ploidy value supplied references for a nondiploid model construction and a parallel analysis of diploid versus aneuploid. Moreover, the gene expression profiles were compared between diploid and aneuploid cell lines. The functions of differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in terms of protein function regulation, TGF-β signaling and cell adhesion molecules. Genes downregulated in the aneuploid group were mainly related to metabolism and protein function regulation, and genes upregulated in the aneuploid group were mainly involved in immune regulation. Differentially expressed genes were randomly distributed on all chromosomes, while chromosome 1 alteration might contribute to immune-related alterations in aneuploid cell lines. Chromosome 19 alteration might be potentially significant for aneuploid ovarian cancer cell lines and patients, which needs further verification in ploidy research."

Although antiendocrine therapy is the main treatment for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive BC, the development of resistance is a major clinical complication. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) in ERαsignaling and identify potential targets for endocrine resistance. Public databases were used to analyze USP8 expression, prognosis, clinical characteristics, and immune cell infiltration. Immunohistochemistry and western blot assays were used to detect protein levels and ERαsignaling. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to measure ERαtarget gene expression. The cell counting kit-8, wound-healing, clone formation, and Transwell assays were used to investigate the effects of USP8 depletion or inhibition on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. An immunofluorescence assay was used for localizing USP8 and ERα, and a protein stability assay was performed for detecting the degradation of ERαprotein. The cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed using flow cytometry. USP8 was highly expressed in the luminal subtype of BC and was associated with poor prognosis. The infiltration levels of many immune cells were positively correlated with USP8 expression. Depletion of USP8 dramatically decreased the ERαsignaling activity and weakened the proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities of BC cells. USP8 knockdown markedly induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (G0/G1). Colocalization analysis and protein stability assays indicated a probable mechanism by which USP8 regulates ERα. Our study demonstrates that USP8 might be crucial in BC development and may be considered a potential target for treating ER-positive BC malignancies in vitro.Copyright © 2023 Lewei Zheng et al."
"36634214","Candidate drugs associated with sensitivity of cancer cell lines with DLST amplification or high mRNA levels.","Oncotarget","Overexpression of the dihydrolipoamide S-succinyltransferase (DLST) is associated with poor outcome in neuroblastoma patients and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and specifically with the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway. Inhibitors of OXPHOS were previously suggested as a potential therapeutic strategy for a subset of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Here, we tested if cell lines withDLSTamplifications or high mRNA levels were associated with sensitivity to 250 drugs from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) dataset by comparing them to cell lines without these changes.DLST-altered cell lines were more sensitive to 7 approved drugs, among these obatoclax mesylate, a BCL2 inhibitor that reduces OXPHOS in human leukemia stem cells. Moreover, several protein kinase inhibitors were identified to be efficient in cell lines withDLSTamplifications or high mRNA levels, suggesting a vulnerability ofDLST-altered cell lines for drugs targeting the ERK/MAPK pathway. Furthermore, increasedDLSTexpression in cell lines with driver mutations inKRASsupported this relationship. We therefore conclude that, in addition to OXPHOS, protein kinases could be potential targets of therapy in the presence ofDLSTamplifications or high mRNA levels. The new drug candidates proposed here could serve in experimental testing on drug efficacy in knock-in cell lines andDLST-activated tumors."

The identification of cancer types that show increased sensitivity towards BOLD-100 can lead to improved developmental strategies. Sensitivity profiling can also identify mechanisms of action that are pertinent for the bioactivity of complex therapeutics. Sensitivity to BOLD-100 was measured in a 319-cancer-cell line panel spanning 24 tissues. BOLD-100's sensitivity profile showed variation across the tissue lineages, including increased response in esophageal, bladder, and hematologic cancers. Multiple cancers, including esophageal, bile duct and colon cancer, had higher relative response to BOLD-100 than to cisplatin. Response to BOLD-100 showed only moderate correlation to anticancer compounds in the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database, as well as no clear theme in bioactivity of correlated hits, suggesting that BOLD-100 may have a differentiated therapeutic profile. The genomic modalities of cancer cell lines were modeled against the BOLD-100 sensitivity profile, which revealed that genes related to ribosomal processes were associated with sensitivity to BOLD-100. Machine learning modeling of the sensitivity profile to BOLD-100 and gene expression data provided moderative predictive value. These findings provide further mechanistic understanding around BOLD-100 and support its development for additional cancer types."
"36601633","Clinically relevant fusion oncogenes: detection and practical implications.","Ther Adv Med Oncol","Mechanistically, chimeric genes result from DNA rearrangements and include parts of preexisting normal genes combined at the genomic junction site. Some rearranged genes encode pathological proteins with altered molecular functions. Those which can aberrantly promote carcinogenesis are called fusion oncogenes. Their formation is not a rare event in human cancers, and many of them were documented in numerous study reports and in specific databases. They may have various molecular peculiarities like increased stability of an oncogenic part, self-activation of tyrosine kinase receptor moiety, and altered transcriptional regulation activities. Currently, tens of low molecular mass inhibitors are approved in cancers as the drugs targeting receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) oncogenic fusion proteins, that is, includingALK, ABL, EGFR, FGFR1-3, NTRK1-3, MET, RET, ROS1moieties. Therein, the presence of the respective RTK fusion in the cancer genome is the diagnostic biomarker for drug prescription. However, identification of such fusion oncogenes is challenging as the breakpoint may arise in multiple sites within the gene, and the exact fusion partner is generally unknown. There is no gold standard method for RTK fusion detection, and many alternative experimental techniques are employed nowadays to solve this issue. Among them, RNA-seq-based methods offer an advantage of unbiased high-throughput analysis of only transcribed RTK fusion genes, and of simultaneous finding both fusion partners in a single RNA-seq read. Here we focus on current knowledge of biology and clinical aspects of RTK fusion genes, related databases, and laboratory detection methods.© The Author(s), 2022."

However, systematic investigation into the association ofPLAUexpression with factors that modulate PDAC (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma) progression is lacking, such as those affecting stromal (pancreatic stellate cell, PSC)-cancer cell interactions, tumour immunity, PDAC subtypes and clinical outcomes from potentialPLAUinhibition.This study used an integrated bioinformatics approach to identify prognostic markers correlated with PLAU expression using different transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical data sets. We then determined the association of dysregulatedPLAUand correlated signatures with oncogenic pathways, metastatic phenotypes, stroma, immunosuppressive tumour microenvironment (TME) and clinical outcome. Finally, using anin vivoorthotopic model of pancreatic cancer, we confirmed the predicted effect of inhibiting PLAU on tumour growth and metastasis.Our analyses revealed thatPLAUupregulation is not only associated with numerous other prognostic markers but also associated with the activation of various oncogenic signalling pathways, aggressive phenotypes relevant to PDAC growth and metastasis, such as proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stemness, hypoxia, extracellular cell matrix (ECM) degradation, upregulation of stromal signatures, and immune suppression in the tumour microenvironment (TME). Moreover, the upregulation ofPLAUwas directly connected with signalling pathways known to mediate PSC-cancer cell interactions. Furthermore,PLAUupregulation was associated with the aggressive basal/squamous phenotype of PDAC and significantly reduced overall survival, indicating that this subset of patients may benefit from therapeutic interventions to inhibitPLAUactivity. Our studies with a clinically relevant orthotopic pancreatic model showed that even short-term PLAU inhibition is sufficient to significantly halt tumour growth and, importantly, eliminate visible metastasis.ElevatedPLAUcorrelates with increased aggressive phenotypes, stromal score, and immune suppression in PDAC.PLAUupregulation is also closely associated with the basal subtype type of PDAC; patients with this subtype are at high risk of mortality from the disease and may benefit from therapeutic targeting ofPLAU.Copyright © 2022 Hosen, Uddin, Xu, Buckley, Perera, Pang, Mekapogu, Moni, Notta, Gallinger, Pirola, Wilson, Ranson, Goldstein and Apte."

The relationship between intrauterine environment, fetal nutrition and the onset of IR, type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity and metabolic syndrome later in life has been confirmed in many studies. The intake of carbohydrates, protein, fat and micronutrients during pregnancy seems to damage fetal metabolism programming; indeed, epigenetic mechanisms change glucose-insulin metabolism.

This study aimed to provide a more precise estimation of the relationship between lncRNA H19 polymorphisms and the risk of cancer based on all available published studies. 53 studies encompassing 32,376 cases and 43,659 controls were included in our meta-analysis by searching the Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, WanFang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. Pooled ORs and their 95% CIs were used to estimate the strength between the SNPs in H19 (rs217727, rs2839698, rs2107425, rs3024270, rs2735971, rs3741216, and rs3741219) and cancer susceptibility. The results showed that H19 rs2839698 polymorphism was associated with increased cancer risk in all participants under three genetic models. However, no significant association was identified between the other six SNPs as well as an overall cancer risk. Stratification by ethnicity showed that rs2839698 mutation indicated to be an important hazardous factor for the Asian population. While rs2107425 mutation had a protective effect on the Caucasian population. Stratification by cancer type identified that rs217727 mutation was linked to increased susceptibility to oral squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma; whereas rs2839698 mutation was associated with an elevated risk of hematological tumor and digestive system tumor (p< 0.05). Besides, the rs2735971 mutation was connected with the digestive system tumor.

An earlier clinical trial in type 1 diabetic subjects (T1Ds) found that repeat BCG vaccinations succeeded in lowering HbA1c values over a multi-year course. Here we seek to determine whether BCG therapy for bladder cancer may improve blood sugar levels in patients with comorbid T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We also investigate whether BCG exposure may reduce onset of T1D and T2D by examining country-by-country impact of BCG childhood vaccination policies in relation to disease incidence.We first analyzed three large US patient datasets (Optum Labs data [N = 45 million], Massachusetts General Brigham [N = 6.5 million], and Quest Diagnostics [N = 263 million adults]), by sorting out subjects with documented T1D (N = 19) or T2D (N = 106) undergoing BCG therapy for bladder cancer, and then by retrospectively assessing BCG's subsequent year-by-year impact on blood sugar trends. Additionally, we performed an ecological analysis of global data to assess the country-by-country associations between mandatory neonatal BCG vaccination programs and T1D and T2D incidence. Multi-dose BCG therapy in adults with comorbid diabetes and bladder cancer was associated with multi-year and stable lowering of HbA1c in T1Ds, but not in T2Ds. The lack of a similar benefit in T2D may be due to concurrent administration of the diabetes drug metformin, which inhibits BCG's beneficial effect on glycolysis pathways. Countries with mandatory neonatal BCG vaccination policies had a lower incidence of T1D in two international databases and a lower incidence of T2D in one of the databases.The epidemiological evidence analyzed here suggests that BCG may play a role in the prevention of T1D. It does not support prevention of T2D, most likely because of interference by metformin. Our ecological analysis of global data suggests a role for neonatal BCG in the prevention of T1D and, to a lesser extent, T2D. Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.Copyright: © 2023 Dias et al.

The identification of biological markers may facilitate the diagnostic process, leading to an early and proper treatment. Our aim was to systematically review the available literature about potential biomarkers for SAD. A search in the main online repositories (PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge, PsychInfo, etc.) was performed. Of the 662 records screened, 61 were included. Results concerning cortisol, neuropeptides and inflammatory/immunological/neurotrophic markers remain inconsistent. Preliminary evidence emerged about the role of chromosome 16 and the endomannosidase gene, as well as of epigenetic factors, in increasing vulnerability to SAD. Neuroimaging findings revealed an altered connectivity of different cerebral areas in SAD patients and amygdala activation under social threat. Some parameters such as salivary alpha amylase levels, changes in antioxidant defenses, increased gaze avoidance and QT dispersion seem to be associated with SAD and may represent promising biomarkers of this condition. However, the preliminary positive correlations have been poorly replicated. Further studies on larger samples and investigating the same biomarkers are needed to identify more specific biological markers for SAD."
"36681709","Correspondence analysis for dimension reduction, batch integration, and visualization of single-cell RNA-seq data.","Sci Rep","Effective dimension reduction is essential for single cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used, but requires continuous, normally-distributed data; therefore, it is often coupled with log-transformation in scRNAseq applications, which can distort the data and obscure meaningful variation. We describe correspondence analysis (CA), a count-based alternative to PCA. CA is based on decomposition of a chi-squared residual matrix, avoiding distortive log-transformation. To address overdispersion and high sparsity in scRNAseq data, we propose five adaptations of CA, which are fast, scalable, and outperform standard CA and glmPCA, to compute cell embeddings with more performant or comparable clustering accuracy in 8 out of 9 datasets. In particular, we find that CA with Freeman-Tukey residuals performs especially well across diverse datasets. Other advantages of the CA framework include visualization of associations between genes and cell populations in a ""CA biplot,"" and extension to multi-table analysis; we introduce corralm for integrative multi-table dimension reduction of scRNAseq data. We implement CA for scRNAseq data in corral, an R/Bioconductor package which interfaces directly with single cell classes in Bioconductor. Switching from PCA to CA is achieved through a simple pipeline substitution and improves dimension reduction of scRNAseq datasets.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36681675","Systems level analysis of sex-dependent gene expression changes in Parkinson's disease.","NPJ Parkinsons Dis","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a heterogeneous disorder, and among the factors which influence the symptom profile, biological sex has been reported to play a significant role. While males have a higher age-adjusted disease incidence and are more frequently affected by muscle rigidity, females present more often with disabling tremors. The molecular mechanisms involved in these differences are still largely unknown, and an improved understanding of the relevant factors may open new avenues for pharmacological disease modification. To help address this challenge, we conducted a meta-analysis of disease-associated molecular sex differences in brain transcriptomics data from case/control studies. Both sex-specific (alteration in only one sex) and sex-dimorphic changes (changes in both sexes, but with opposite direction) were identified. Using further systems level pathway and network analyses, coordinated sex-related alterations were studied. These analyses revealed significant disease-associated sex differences in mitochondrial pathways and highlight specific regulatory factors whose activity changes can explain downstream network alterations, propagated through gene regulatory cascades. Single-cell expression data analyses confirmed the main pathway-level changes observed in bulk transcriptomics data. Overall, our analyses revealed significant sex disparities in PD-associated transcriptomic changes, resulting in coordinated modulations of molecular processes. Among the regulatory factors involved, NR4A2 has already been reported to harbor rare mutations in familial PD and its pharmacological activation confers neuroprotective effects in toxin-induced models of Parkinsonism. Our observations suggest that NR4A2 may warrant further research as a potential adjuvant therapeutic target to address a subset of pathological molecular features of PD that display sex-associated profiles.© 2023.

"36631398","A novel Bayesian framework for harmonizing information across tissues and studies to increase cell type deconvolution accuracy.","Brief Bioinform","Computational cell type deconvolution on bulk transcriptomics data can reveal cell type proportion heterogeneity across samples. One critical factor for accurate deconvolution is the reference signature matrix for different cell types. Compared with inferring reference signature matrices from cell lines, rapidly accumulating single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data provide a richer and less biased resource. However, deriving cell type signature from scRNA-seq data is challenging due to high biological and technical noises. In this article, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework, tranSig, to improve signature matrix inference from scRNA-seq by leveraging shared cell type-specific expression patterns across different tissues and studies. Our simulations show that tranSig is robust to the number of signature genes and tissues specified in the model. Applications of tranSig to bulk RNA sequencing data from peripheral blood, bronchoalveolar lavage and aorta demonstrate its accuracy and power to characterize biological heterogeneity across groups. In summary, tranSig offers an accurate and robust approach to defining gene expression signatures of different cell types, facilitating improved in silico cell type deconvolutions.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36646675","HDAC1-mediated regulation of GABA signaling within the lateral septum facilitates long-lasting social fear extinction in male mice.","Transl Psychiatry","Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is caused by traumatic social experiences. It is characterized by intense fear and avoidance of social contexts, which can be robustly mimicked by the social fear conditioning (SFC) paradigm. The extinction phase of the SFC paradigm is akin to exposure therapy for SAD and requires learning to disassociate the trauma with the social context. Learning-induced acetylation of histones is critical for extinction memory formation and its endurance. Although class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) regulate the abovementioned learning process, there is a lack of clarity in isoforms and spatial specificity in HDAC function in social learning. Utilizing the SFC paradigm, we functionally characterized the role of HDAC1, specifically in the lateral septum (LS), in regulating the formation of long-term social fear extinction memory. We measured a local increase in activity-inducing HDAC1 phosphorylation at serine residues of social fear-conditioned (SFC+) mice in response to the extinction of social fear. We also found that LS-HDAC1 function negatively correlates with acute social fear extinction learning using pharmacological and viral approaches. Further, inhibition of LS-HDAC1 enhanced the expression of the GABA-A receptor β1 subunit (Gabrb1) in SFC+mice, and activation of GABA-A receptors facilitated acute extinction learning. Finally, the facilitation of extinction learning by HDAC1 inhibition or GABA-A receptor activation within the LS led to the formation of long-lasting extinction memory, which persisted even 30 days after extinction. Our results show that HDAC1-mediated regulation of GABA signaling in the LS is crucial for the formation of long-lasting social fear extinction memory.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Children in the intervention group (n = 20; 10 boys and 10 girls) followed an aerobic training program (two 60-min sessions per week), whereas children in the control group (n = 20; 10 boys and 10 girls) participated in the usual practice. Body composition characteristics were repeatedly measured by means of bioelectrical impedance method. At 2 years, finally, intervention boys had a smaller rise in BMI (mean difference, MD: -0.97 kg/m2, p < 0.05), BMI z-score (-0.44, p < 0.09), body fat % (BF%) (-6.47%, p < 0.01), and fat mass index (FMI) (-1.32 kg/m2, p < 0.001) than controls. In girls, however, the intervention program induced no significant differences (p > 0.9) in the measured variables compared to controls at the final follow-up (MD: -0.04 kg/m2for BMI and -0.01 for BMI z-score). Changes in BF% and FMI in a positive direction occurred at 18 months (MD: -3.38%, p < 0.05 and -0.99 kg/m2, p < 0.01, respectively), but did not persist over time (p > 0.07). In addition, no significant changes (p > 0.07) in the fat-free mass index were associated with the physical activity intervention in either boys or girls.

Although uterine corpus endometrial cancer (UCEC) has a favorable prognosis if removed early, patients with advanced tumor stages have a low survival rate. These facts highlight the importance of understanding UCEC biology. Computational analysis of RNA-sequencing data from UCEC patients revealed that the molecular motor Myosin Vb (MYO5B) was elevated in the beginning stages of UCEC and occurred in all patients regardless of tumor stage, tumor type, age, menopause status or ethnicity. Although several mutations were identified in the MYO5B gene in UCEC patients, these mutations did not correlate with mRNA expression. Examination of MYO5B methylation revealed that UCEC patients had undermethylated MYO5B and undermethylation was positively correlated with increased mRNA and protein levels. Immunostaining confirmed elevated levels of apical MYO5B in UCEC patients compared to adjacent tissue. UCEC patients with high expressing MYO5B tumors had far worse prognosis than UCEC patients with low expressing MYO5B tumors, as reflected by survival curves. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in metabolism pathways in UCE patients and key metabolism genes were positively correlated with MYO5B mRNA. These data provide the first evidence that MYO5B may participate in UCEC tumor development.Copyright: © 2023 Engevik et al.

In addition to PD-1, new immune checkpoints are constantly excavated to better treat cancer. Recently, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was identified as a new immune checkpoint and played a critical role in the treatment of tumors by inhibiting the proliferation and cytotoxicity of T cells induced by tumor antigen. To explore the targeting role of PTP1B in precision tumor therapy, we deeply analyzed the expression and prognosis of PTP1B in all tumors. Survival analysis results indicated that PTP1B was highly expressed in most tumor tissues and indicated poor prognosis in acute-myeloid-leukemia (LAML), brain-lower-grade-glioma (LGG), kidney-renal clear-cell-carcinoma (KIRC) and uveal-melanoma (UVM). The methylation status of PTP1B in these four tumors exhibited hypomethylation and mutation landscape showed that PTP1B had its specific characteristics in genomic instability and heterogeneity. The homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were positive related to PTP1B expression in liver-hepatocellular-carcinoma (LIHC) and kidney-chromophobe (KICH), while the immunescore and immune infiltration displayed a significant positive correlation with PTP1B expression in LGG and UVM.

We compared 38 DEM pipelines configured to fit circRNA expression data's statistical properties, including bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and metagenomics DEMs. The DEMs performed poorly on data sets of typical size. Widely used DEMs, such as DESeq2, edgeR and Limma-Voom, gave scarce results, unreliable predictions or even contravened the expected behaviour with some parameter configurations. Limma-Voom achieved the most consistent performance throughout different benchmark data sets and, as well as SAMseq, reasonably balanced false discovery rate (FDR) and recall rate. Interestingly, a few scRNA-seq DEMs obtained results comparable with the best-performing bulk RNA-seq tools. Almost all DEMs' performance improved when increasing the number of replicates. CircRNA expression studies require careful design, choice of DEM and DEM configuration. This analysis can guide scientists in selecting the appropriate tools to investigate circRNA differential expression with RNA-seq experiments.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36644193","Expressional and functional characteristics of checkpoint kinase 1 as a prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma.","Transl Cancer Res","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common pathological subtype of liver cancer and is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1), an essential serine/threonine kinase that regulates the cell cycle, is reported to be associated with carcinogenesis. However, the biological role and clinical significance of CHEK1 in HCC are still incompletely known.In this research, CHEK1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in various liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) cohorts from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases were evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier database was applied to identify the correlation between survival time and CHEK1 expression in patients with HCC. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore the potential mechanism of CHEK1 in HCC, and NetworkAnalyst v. 3.0 (https://www.networkanalyst.ca/) was used to construct the regulatory networks of CHEK1 in HCC. Discriminant Regulon Expression Analysis (DoRothEA) was used to detect the activity of transcriptional factors (TFs) in gene-enriched cells (EC) with CHEK1 coexpression.In vitroexperiments were conducted to investigate the effects of CHEK1 on the biological function of HCC cells.The CHEK1 mRNA level was overexpressed in HCC, and increased CHEK1 expression correlated with poor survival outcomes. The homo sapiens-microRNA-195 (hsa-miR-195) may have contributed to the upregulation of CHEK1 in HCC. GSEA and NetworkAnalyst v. 3.0 showed that CHEK1 played a crucial part in tumor proliferation of HCC and may be regulated by TF E2F1. DoRothEA showed increased transcriptional activity of E2F1 in gene-EC with CHEK1 coexpression. Moreover, experiments of cell function showed that the knockdown of CHEK1 weakened the aggressive behavior and proliferation of HCC cells. Overexpression of E2F1 increased the proliferation and invasion of HCC cellsin vitro, while the silencing of CHEK1 dampened cell invasion induced by E2F1 overexpression.These results identified the prognostic significance and expression characteristics of CHEK1 in HCC through bioinformatics analysis and experimental verification. This lays the foundation for further research on the diagnosis and treatment of HCC.2022 Translational Cancer Research. All rights reserved."

Based on public databases such as the cancer genome atlas, we investigated the potential role of PCOLCE expression in 33 different human tumors. PCOLCE expression in 11 tumors was significantly correlated with tumor prognosis and was a prognostic predictor for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, thymoma and CES. We also found that PCOLCE expression correlated with the immune microenvironment of tumors and the level of cancer-associated fibroblast infiltration. PCOLCE is a potential predictor of small molecule targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Finally, we found by enrichment analysis that PCOLCE localizes to extracellular structures and the extracellular matrix and exerts substantial effects on tumors through the PI3K-Akt and AGE-RAGE signaling pathways. We have a preliminary and relatively comprehensive understanding of the role of PCOLCE in various tumors.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."
"36619551","Genetic, epigenetic and enviromental influencing factors on the regulation of precocious and delayed puberty.","Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","The pubertal development onset is controlled by a network of genes that regulate the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsatile release and the subsequent increase of the circulating levels of pituitary gonadotropins that activate the gonadal function. Although the transition from pre-pubertal condition to puberty occurs physiologically in a delimited age-range, the inception of pubertal development can be anticipated or delayed due to genetic and epigenetic changes or environmental conditions. Most of the genetic and epigenetic alterations concern genes which encode for kisspeptin, GnRH, LH, FSH and their receptor, which represent crucial factors of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Recent data indicate a central role of the epigenome in the regulation of genes in the hypothalamus and pituitary that could mediate the flexibility of pubertal timing. Identification of epigenetically regulated genes, such as Makorin ring finger 3 (MKRN3) and Delta-like 1 homologue (DLK1), respectively responsible for the repression and the activation of pubertal development, provides additional evidence of how epigenetic variations affect pubertal timing. This review aims to investigate genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors responsible for the regulation of precocious and delayed puberty.Copyright © 2022 Faienza, Urbano, Moscogiuri, Chiarito, De Santis and Giordano."

Proper patient selection for clinical trials and identifying those in the prodromal stages of the diseases or those at high risk will pave the way for precision medicine approaches and halt neuroinflammation and/or neurodegeneration in early stages where this is possible. Towards this direction, novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker candidates were developed to reflect the diseased organ's pathology better. Μisfolded protein accumulation, microglial activation, synaptic dysfunction, and finally, neuronal death are some of the pathophysiological aspects captured by these biomarkers to support proper diagnosis and screening. We also describe advances in the field of molecular biomarkers, including miRNAs and extracellular nucleic acids known as cell-free DNA and mitochondrial DNA molecules. Here we review the most important of these novel CSF biomarkers of NIDs and NDDs, focusing on their involvement in disease development and emphasizing their ability to define homogeneous disease phenotypes and track potential treatment outcomes that can be mirrored in the CSF compartment."

Understanding the mechanisms through which the placenta influences perinatal and later-life outcomes requires further investigation. We evaluated the relationships between birthweight and adult body mass index (BMI) and genetically-predicted gene expression in human placenta. Birthweight genome-wide association summary statistics were obtained from the Early Growth Genetics Consortium (N = 298,142). Adult BMI summary statistics were obtained from the GIANT consortium (N = 681,275). We used S-PrediXcan to evaluate associations between the outcomes and predicted gene expression in placental tissue and, to identify genes where placental expression was exclusively associated with the outcomes, compared to 48 other tissues (GTEx v7). We identified 24 genes where predicted placental expression was significantly associated with birthweight, 15 of which were not associated with birthweight in any other tissue. One of these genes has been previously linked to birthweight. Analyses identified 182 genes where placental expression was associated with adult BMI, 110 were not associated with BMI in any other tissue. Eleven genes that had placental gene expression levels exclusively associated with BMI have been previously associated with BMI. Expression of a single gene, PAX4, was associated with both outcomes exclusively in the placenta. Inter-individual variation of gene expression in placental tissue may contribute to observed variation in birthweight and adult BMI, supporting developmental origins hypothesis.© 2023.

Individuals with strong positive or negative values of SER require spectacles or other approaches for vision correction. Common genetic risk factors have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but a great part of the refractive error heritability is still missing. Some of this heritability may be explained by rare variants (minor allele frequency [MAF] ≤ 0.01.). We performed multiple gene-based association tests of mean Spherical Equivalent with rare variants in exome array data from the Consortium for Refractive Error and Myopia (CREAM). The dataset consisted of over 27,000 total subjects from five cohorts of Indo-European and Eastern Asian ethnicity. We identified 129 unique genes associated with refractive error, many of which were replicated in multiple cohorts. Our best novel candidates included the retina expressed PDCD6IP, the circadian rhythm gene PER3, and P4HTM, which affects eye morphology. Future work will include functional studies and validation. Identification of genes contributing to refractive error and future understanding of their function may lead to better treatment and prevention of refractive errors, which themselves are important risk factors for various blinding conditions.© 2022.

Emerging evidence has shown that aberrant glycosylation is associated with tumor progression and metastasis. However, the role of glycosylation-related genes in HCC has notbeen reported.Weighted gene coexpression network analysis and non-negative matrix factorization analysis were applied to identify functional modules and molecularm subtypes in HCC. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression was used to construct the glycosylation-related signature. The independent prognostic value of the risk model was confirmed and validated by systematic techniques, including principal component analysis, T-distributed random neighbor embedding analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the ROC curve, multivariate Cox regression, the nomogram, and the calibration curve. The single-sample gene set enrichment analysis, gene set variation analysis, Gene Ontology, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were evaluated by the immune microenvironment and potential biological processes. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analysis were used to verify the expression of five genes.We identified the glycosylation-related genes with bioinformatics analysis to construct and validate a five-gene signature for the prognosis of HCC patients. Patients with HCC in the high-risk group had a worse prognosis. The risk score could be an independent factor and was associated with clinical features, such as the grade and stage. The nomogram exhibited an accurate score that included the risk score and clinical parameters. The infiltration levels of antitumor cells were upregulated in the low-risk group, including B_cells, Mast_cells, neutrophils, NK_cells, and T_helper_cells. Moreover, glycosylation was more sensitive to immunotherapy, and may play a critical role in the metabolic processes of HCC, such as bile acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism. In addition, the five-gene messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression were overexpressed in HCC cells and tissues.The glycosylation-related signature is effective for prognostic recognition, immune efficacy evaluation, and substance metabolism in HCC, providing a novel insight for therapeutic target prediction and clinical decision-making.Copyright © 2022 Shi, Wang, Yang, Zhang, Zhang, Feng, Lv, Niu, Chen, Li and Zhang."

However, cfDNA is the mixture of various cell fragments, and the efficient enrichment of cfDNA fragments with diagnostic value remains a great challenge for application in the clinical setting. Evidence from recent years shows that cfDNA fragmentomics' characteristics differ in normal and diseased individuals without the need to distinguish the source of the cfDNA fragments, which makes it a promising novel biomarker. Moreover, cfDNA fragmentomics can identify tissue origins by inferring epigenetic information. Thus, further insights into the fragmentomics of plasma cfDNA shed light on the origin and fragmentation mechanisms of cfDNA during physiological and pathological processes in diseases and enhance our ability to take the advantage of plasma cfDNA as a molecular diagnostic tool. In this review, we focus on the cfDNA fragment characteristics and its potential application, such as fragment length, end motifs, jagged ends, preferred end coordinates, as well as nucleosome footprints, open chromatin region, and gene expression inferred by the cfDNA fragmentation pattern across the genome. Furthermore, we summarize the methods for deducing the tissue of origin by cfDNA fragmentomics."

Ten formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded conjunctival EMZL and eight healthy conjunctival specimens were analyzed by Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) RNA sequencing. The 3417 upregulated genes in conjunctival EMZL were involved in processes such as B cell proliferation and Rac protein signaling, whereas the 1188 downregulated genes contributed most significantly to oxidative phosphorylation and UV protection. The tumor microenvironment, as determined by deconvolution analysis, was mainly composed of multiple B cell subtypes which reflects the tumor's B cell lineage. However, several T cell types, including T helper 2 cells and regulatory T cells, as well as innate immune cell types, such as anti-inflammatory macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, were also strongly enriched in conjunctival EMZL. A 13-biomarker prognostic panel, includingS100A8andS100A9, classified ocular and extraocular tumor recurrence, exceeded prognostic accuracy of Ann Arbor and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging, and demonstrated prognostic value for patient survival in 21 different cancer types in a database of 12,332 tumor patients.

"36620763","Biological age and environmental risk factors for dementia and stroke: Molecular mechanisms.","Front Aging Neurosci","Since the development of antibiotics and vaccination, as well as major improvements in public hygiene, the main risk factors for morbidity and mortality are age and chronic exposure to environmental factors, both of which can interact with genetic predispositions. As the average age of the population increases, the prevalence and costs of chronic diseases, especially neurological conditions, are rapidly increasing. The deleterious effects of age and environmental risk factors, develop chronically over relatively long periods of time, in contrast to the relatively rapid deleterious effects of infectious diseases or accidents. Of particular interest is the hypothesis that the deleterious effects of environmental factors may be mediated by acceleration of biological age. This hypothesis is supported by evidence that dietary restriction, which universally delays age-related diseases, also ameliorates deleterious effects of environmental factors. Conversely, both age and environmental risk factors are associated with the accumulation of somatic mutations in mitotic cells and epigenetic modifications that are a measure of ""biological age"", a better predictor of age-related morbidity and mortality than chronological age. Here we review evidence that environmental risk factors such as smoking and air pollution may also drive neurological conditions, including Alzheimer's Disease, by the acceleration of biological age, mediated by cumulative and persistent epigenetic effects as well as somatic mutations. Elucidation of such mechanisms could plausibly allow the development of interventions which delay deleterious effects of both aging and environmental risk factors.Copyright © 2022 Knobel, Litke and Mobbs."

"36650542","FASN multi-omic characterization reveals metabolic heterogeneity in pancreatic and prostate adenocarcinoma.","J Transl Med","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and prostate cancer (PCa) are among the most prevalent malignant tumors worldwide. There is now a comprehensive understanding of metabolic reprogramming as a hallmark of cancer. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key regulator of the lipid metabolic network, providing energy to favor tumor proliferation and development. Whereas the biological role of FASN is known, its response and sensitivity to inhibition have not yet been fully established in these two cancer settings.To evaluate the association between FASN expression, methylation, prognosis, and mutational profile in PDAC and PCa, we interrogated public databases and surveyed online platforms using TCGA data. The STRING database was used to investigate FASN interactors, and the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis platform Reactome database was used to perform an enrichment analysis using data from RNA sequencing public databases of PDAC and PCa. In vitro models using PDAC and PCa cell lines were used to corroborate the expression of FASN, as shown by Western blot, and the effects of FASN inhibition on cell proliferation/cell cycle progression and mitochondrial respiration were investigated with MTT, colony formation assay, cell cycle analysis and MitoStress Test.The expression of FASN was not modulated in PDAC compared to normal pancreatic tissues, while it was overexpressed in PCa, which also displayed a different level of promoter methylation. Based on tumor grade, FASN expression decreased in advanced stages of PDAC, but increased in PCa. A low incidence of FASN mutations was found for both tumors. FASN was overexpressed in PCa, despite not reaching statistical significance, and was associated with a worse prognosis than in PDAC. The biological role of FASN interactors correlated with lipid metabolism, and GSEA indicated that lipid-mediated mitochondrial respiration was enriched in PCa. Following validation of FASN overexpression in PCa compared to PDAC in vitro, we tested TVB-2640 as a FASN inhibitor. PCa proliferation arrest was modulated by FASN inhibition in a dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas PDAC proliferation was not altered. In line with this finding, mitochondrial respiration was found to be more affected in PCa than in PDAC. FASN inhibition interfered with metabolic signaling causing lipid accumulation and affecting cell viability with an impact on the replicative processes.FASN exhibited differential expression patterns in PDAC and PCa, suggesting a different evolution during cancer progression. This was corroborated by the fact that both tumors responded differently to FASN inhibition in terms of proliferative potential and mitochondrial respiration, indicating that its use should reflect context specificity.© 2023.

In recent decades, a significant decrease in age-specific PCa mortality has been achieved by increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and improving treatments. Nevertheless, upcoming, augmented recommendations against PSA screening underline an escalating disproportion between the benefit and harm of current diagnosis/prognosis and application of radical treatment standards. Undoubtedly, new potent diagnostic and prognostic tools are urgently needed to alleviate this tensed situation. They should allow a more reliable early assessment of the upcoming threat, in order to enable applying timely adjusted and personalized therapy and monitoring. Here, we present a basic study on an epigenetic screening approach by Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP). We identified genes associated with hypomethylated CpG islands in three PCa sample cohorts. By adjusting our computational biology analyses to focus on single CpG-enriched 60-nucleotide-long DNA probes, we revealed numerous consistently differential methylated DNA segments in PCa. They were associated among other genes withNOTCH3, CDK2AP1, KLK4,andADAM15. These can be used for early discrimination, and might contribute to a new epigenetic tumor classification system of PCa. Our analysis shows that we can dissect short, differential methylated CpG-rich DNA fragments and combinations of them that are consistently present in all tumors.

To dissect the cell-type-specific molecular signatures of insulin resistance, we performed a multiscale gene network analysis of adipose and muscle tissues in African and European ancestry populations. In adipose tissues, a comparative analysis revealed ethnically conserved cell-type signatures and two adipocyte subtype-enriched modules with opposite insulin sensitivity responses. The modules enriched for adipose stem and progenitor cells as well as immune cells showed negative correlations with insulin sensitivity. In muscle tissues, the modules enriched for stem cells and fibro-adipogenic progenitors responded to insulin sensitivity oppositely. The adipocyte and muscle fiber-enriched modules shared cellular-respiration-related genes but had tissue-specific rearrangements of gene regulations in response to insulin sensitivity. Integration of the gene co-expression and causal networks further pinpointed key drivers of insulin resistance. Together, this study revealed the cell-type-specific transcriptomic networks and signaling maps underlying insulin resistance in major glucose-responsive tissues.

Here we introduce low input capture Hi-C (liCHi-C) as a cost-effective, flexible method to map and robustly compare promoter interactomes at high resolution. As proof of its broad applicability, we implement liCHi-C to study normal and malignant human hematopoietic hierarchy in clinical samples. We demonstrate that the dynamic promoter architecture identifies developmental trajectories and orchestrates transcriptional transitions during cell-state commitment. Moreover, liCHi-C enables the identification of disease-relevant cell types, genes and pathways potentially deregulated by non-coding alterations at distal regulatory elements. Finally, we show that liCHi-C can be harnessed to uncover genome-wide structural variants, resolve their breakpoints and infer their pathogenic effects. Collectively, our optimized liCHi-C method expands the study of 3D chromatin organization to unique, low-abundance cell populations, and offers an opportunity to uncover factors and regulatory networks involved in disease pathogenesis.© 2023.

"36609474","A distal super-enhancer activates oncogenic ETS2 via recruiting MECOM in inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.","Cell Death Dis","Abnormal activities of distal cis-regulatory elements (CREs) contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. Gain of super-enhancer (SE), a highly active distal CRE, is essential for the activation of key oncogenes in various cancers. However, the mechanism of action for most tumor-specific SEs still largely remains elusive. Here, we report that a candidate oncogene ETS2 was activated by a distal SE in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). The SE physically interacted with the ETS2 promoter and was required for the transcription activation of ETS2. Strikingly, the ETS2-SE activity was dramatically upregulated in both IBD and CRC tissues when compared to normal colon controls and was strongly correlated with the level of ETS2 expression. The tumor-specific activation of ETS2-SE was further validated by increased enhancer RNA transcription from this region in CRC. Intriguingly, a known IBD-risk SNP resides in the ETS2-SE and the genetic variant modulated the level of ETS2 expression through affecting the binding of an oncogenic transcription factor MECOM. Silencing of MECOM induced significant downregulation of ETS2 in CRC cells, and the level of MECOM and ETS2 correlated well with each other in CRC and IBD samples. Functionally, MECOM and ETS2 were both required for maintaining the colony-formation and sphere-formation capacities of CRC cells and MECOM was crucial for promoting migration. Taken together, we uncovered a novel disease-specific SE that distantly drives oncogenic ETS2 expression in IBD and CRC and delineated a mechanistic link between non-coding genetic variation and epigenetic regulation of gene transcription.© 2023.

To disentangle genetic from correlated genetic-environmental influences, while also probing gene-adversity interactions, we compared adoptees, a group generally exposed to substantial ELA, with children raised by their biological families via genetic risk scores (GRS) from genome-wide association studies. AD and MDD GRSs predicted overlapping and widespread neurodevelopmental alterations associated with superior fluid cognition. Specifically, among adoptees only, greater AD GRS were related to accelerated structural maturation (i.e., cortical thinning) and higher MDD GRS were linked to delayed functional neurodevelopment, as reflected in compensatory brain activation on an inhibitory control task. Our study identifies compensatory mechanisms linked to MDD risk and highlights the potential cognitive benefits of accelerated maturation linked to AD vulnerability in late childhood.© 2023.

LC-MS-based proteomics strategies are carried out according to predesigned workflows that comprise several steps such as sample selection, sample processing including labeling, MS acquisition methods, statistical treatment, and bioinformatics to understand the biological meaning of the findings and set predictive classifiers. As the choice of best options might not be straightforward, we herein review and assess past and current proteomics approaches for the discovery of new cancer biomarkers. Moreover, we review major bioinformatics tools for interpreting and visualizing proteomics results and suggest the most popular machine learning techniques for the selection of predictive biomarkers. Finally, we consider the approximation of proteomics strategies for clinical diagnosis and prognosis by discussing current barriers and proposals to circumvent them."
"36672482","Hepatitis Virus and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Recent Advances.","Cancers (Basel)","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a global health challenge, causing 600,000 deaths each year. Infectious factors, including hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV), have long been considered the major risk factors for the development and progression of HCC. These pathogens induce hepatocyte transformation through a variety of mechanisms, including insertional mutations caused by viral gene integration, epigenetic changes, and the induction of long-term immune dysfunction. The discovery of these mechanisms, while advancing our understanding of the disease, also provides targets for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In addition, the discovery and research of chronic HEV infection over the past decade indicate that this common hepatitis virus also seems to have the potential to induce HCC. In this review, we provide an overview of recent studies on the link between hepatitis virus and HCC, as well as new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to HCC based on these findings. Finally, we also discuss the potential relationship between HEV and HCC. In conclusion, these associations will further optimize the diagnosis and treatment of infection-associated HCC and call for better management policies."

Herein, we conducted a widespread analysis regarding the crosstalk between 5mC and m6A regulators in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).Pan-cancer genomic analysis of the crosstalk between 5mC and m6A regulators was presented at transcriptomic, genomic, epigenetic, and other multi-omics levels. Hub 5mC and m6A regulators were summarized to define an epigenetic and epitranscriptomic module eigengene (EME), which reflected both the pre- and post-transcriptional modifications.5mC and m6A regulators interacted with one another at the multi-omic levels across pan-cancer, including HCC. The EME scoring system enabled to greatly optimize risk stratification and accurately predict HCC patients' clinical outcomes and progression. Additionally, the EME accurately predicted the responses to mainstream therapies (TACE and sorafenib) and immunotherapy as well as hyper-progression. In vitro, 5mC and m6A regulators cooperatively weakened apoptosis and facilitated proliferation, DNA damage repair, G2/M arrest, migration, invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HCC cells. The EME scoring system was remarkably linked to potential extrinsic and intrinsic immune escape mechanisms, and the high EME might contribute to a reduced copy number gain/loss frequency. Finally, we determined potential therapeutic compounds and druggable targets (TUBB1 and P2RY4) for HCC patients with high EME.Our findings suggest that HCC may result from a unique synergistic combination of 5mC-epigenetic mechanism mixed with m6A-epitranscriptomic mechanism, and their crosstalk defines therapeutic response and pharmacogenomic landscape.© 2023.

A targeted approach providing readily access to the rich information from haplotype-resolved genome assemblies will be appealing to groups of basic researchers and medical scientists focused on specific genomic regions. Here, using the 4.5 megabase, notoriously difficult-to-assemble major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region as an example, we demonstrated an approach to construct haplotype-resolved assembly of the targeted genomic region with the CRISPR-based enrichment. Compared to the results from haplotype-resolved genome assembly, our targeted approach achieved comparable completeness and accuracy with reduced computing complexity, sequencing cost, as well as the amount of starting materials. Moreover, using the targeted assembled personal MHC haplotypes as the reference both improves the quantification accuracy for sequencing data and enables allele-specific functional genomics analyses of the MHC region. Given its highly efficient use of resources, our approach can greatly facilitate population genetic studies of targeted regions, and may pave a new way to elucidate the molecular mechanisms in disease etiology.© 2023.

However, to separate the effects of adversity during vulnerable times of the lifetime from those across the entire lifespan, we require deeper phenotyping. Stress is one of the challenges which everyone can face with this issue. It is a type of feeling which contains mental pressure and comes from daily life matters. There are many research and investments regarding this problem to overcome or control this complication. Pregnancy is a susceptible period for the child and the mother taking stress can affect the child's health after birth. The following matter can happen based on natural disasters, war, death or separation of parents, etc. Early Life Stress (ELS) has a connection with psychological development and metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. In the following research, the main focus is on Early Life Stress control during pregnancy of a healthy group of women that are at risk of future disease during their pregnancy. This study looked at the relationship between retrospective recollections of childhood or pregnancy hardship and inflammatory imbalance in a group of 53 low-income, ethnically diverse women who were seeking family-based trauma treatment after experiencing interpersonal violence. Machine learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are applied for stress detection using short-term physiological signals in terms of non-linear and for a short term.

Understanding the risk factors of severe COVID-19 is relevant both in the clinical setting and at the epidemiological level. Here, we provide an overview of host, viral and environmental factors that have been shown or (in some cases) hypothesized to be associated with severe clinical outcomes. The factors considered in detail include the age and frailty, genetic polymorphisms, biological sex (and pregnancy), co- and superinfections, non-communicable comorbidities, immunological history, microbiota, and lifestyle of the patient; viral genetic variation and infecting dose; socioeconomic factors; and air pollution. For each category, we compile (sometimes conflicting) evidence for the association of the factor with COVID-19 outcomes (including the strength of the effect) and outline possible action mechanisms.

"36674414","Mendelian Randomisation Confirms the Role of Y-Chromosome Loss in Alzheimer's Disease Aetiopathogenesis in Men.","Int J Mol Sci","Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (mLOY) is a common ageing-related somatic event and has been previously associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, mLOY estimation from genotype microarray data only reflects the mLOY degree of subjects at the moment of DNA sampling. Therefore, mLOY phenotype associations with AD can be severely age-confounded in the context of genome-wide association studies. Here, we applied Mendelian randomisation to construct an age-independent mLOY polygenic risk score (mloy-PRS) using 114 autosomal variants. The mloy-PRS instrument was associated with an 80% increase in mLOY risk per standard deviation unit (p= 4.22 × 10-20) and was orthogonal with age. We found that a higher genetic risk for mLOY was associated with faster progression to AD in men with mild cognitive impairment (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.23,p= 0.01). Importantly, mloy-PRS had no effect on AD conversion or risk in the female group, suggesting that these associations are caused by the inherent loss of the Y chromosome. Additionally, the blood mLOY phenotype in men was associated with increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of total tau and phosphorylated tau181 in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Our results strongly suggest that mLOY is involved in AD pathogenesis."
"36630509","Convergent genomics of longevity in rockfishes highlights the genetics of human life span variation.","Sci Adv","Longevity is a defining, heritable trait that varies dramatically between species. To resolve the genetic regulation of this trait, we have mined genomic variation in rockfishes, which range in longevity from 11 to over 205 years. Multiple shifts in rockfish longevity have occurred independently and in a short evolutionary time frame, thus empowering convergence analyses. Our analyses reveal a common network of genes under convergent evolution, encompassing established aging regulators such as insulin signaling, yet also identify flavonoid (aryl-hydrocarbon) metabolism as a pathway modulating longevity. The selective pressures on these pathways indicate the ancestral state of rockfishes was long lived and that the changes in short-lived lineages are adaptive. These pathways were also used to explore genome-wide association studies of human longevity, identifying the aryl-hydrocarbon metabolism pathway to be significantly associated with human survival to the 99th percentile. This evolutionary intersection defines and cross-validates a previously unappreciated genetic architecture that associates with the evolution of longevity across vertebrates."
"36651044","Mutations in coral soma and sperm imply lifelong stem cell renewal and cell lineage selection.","Proc Biol Sci","In many animals, the germline differentiates early in embryogenesis, so only mutations that accumulate in germ cells are inherited by offspring. Exceptions to this developmental process may indicate other mechanisms have evolved to limit the effects of deleterious mutation accumulation. Stony corals are animals that can live for hundreds of years and have been thought to produce gametes from somatic tissue. To clarify conflicting evidence about germline-soma distinction in corals, we sequenced high coverage, full genomes with technical replicates for parent coral branches and their sperm pools. We identified post-embryonic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) unique to each parent branch, then checked if each SNV was shared by the respective sperm pool. Twenty-six per cent of post-embryonic SNVs were shared by the sperm and 74% were not. We also identified germline SNVs, those that were present in the sperm but not in the parent. These data suggest that self-renewing stem cells differentiate into germ and soma throughout the adult life of the colony, with SNV rates and patterns differing markedly in stem, soma and germ lineages. In addition to informing the evolution of germlines in metazoans, these insights inform how corals may generate adaptive diversity necessary in the face of global climate change."
"36671664","Spatial Alignment of Organoids Tracking Subclonal Chemotherapy Resistance in Pancreatic and Ampullary Cancer.","Bioengineering (Basel)","Pancreatic and ampullary cancers remain highly morbid diseases for which accurate clinical predictions are needed for precise therapeutic predictions. Patient-derived cancer organoids have been widely adopted; however, prior work has focused on well-level therapeutic sensitivity. To characterize individual oligoclonal units of therapeutic response, we introduce a low-volume screening assay, including an automated alignment algorithm. The oligoclonal growth response was compared against validated markers of response, including well-level viability and markers of single-cell viability. Line-specific sensitivities were compared with clinical outcomes. Automated alignment algorithms were generated to match organoids across time using coordinates across a single projection of Z-stacked images. After screening for baseline size (50 μm) and circularity (&gt;0.4), the match efficiency was found to be optimized by accepting the diffusion thresholded with the root mean standard deviation of 75 μm. Validated well-level viability showed a limited correlation with the mean organoid size (R = 0.408), and a normalized growth assayed by normalized changes in area (R = 0.474) and area (R = 0.486). Subclonal populations were defined by both residual growth and the failure to induce apoptosis and necrosis. For a culture with clinical resistance to gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, while a therapeutic challenge induced a robust effect in inhibiting cell growth (GΔ = 1.53), residual oligoclonal populations were able to limit the effect on the ability to induce apoptosis (GΔ = 0.52) and cell necrosis (GΔ = 1.07). Bioengineered approaches are feasible to capture oligoclonal heterogeneity in organotypic cultures, integrating ongoing efforts for utilizing organoids across cancer types as integral biomarkers and in novel therapeutic development."

We aimed to integrate PDO drug response with multi-omics characterization beyond genomics.We generated 29 PDO lines from 22 advanced CRC patients and provided a morphologic, genomic, and transcriptomic characterization. We performed drug sensitivity assays with a panel of both standard and non-standard agents in five long-term cultures, and integrated drug response with a baseline proteomic and transcriptomic characterization by SWATH-MS and RNA-seq analysis, respectively.PDOs were successfully generated from heavily pre-treated patients, including a paired model of advanced MSI high CRC deriving from pre- and post-chemotherapy liver metastasis. Our PDOs faithfully reproduced genomic and phenotypic features of original tissue. Drug panel testing identified differential response among PDOs, particularly to oxaliplatin and palbociclib. Proteotranscriptomic analyses revealed that oxaliplatin non-responder PDOs present enrichment of the t-RNA aminoacylation process and showed a shift towards oxidative phosphorylation pathway dependence, while an exceptional response to palbociclib was detected in a PDO with activation of MYC and enrichment of chaperonin T-complex protein Ring Complex (TRiC), involved in proteome integrity. Proteotranscriptomic data fusion confirmed these results within a highly integrated network of functional processes involved in differential response to drugs.Our strategy of integrating PDOs drug sensitivity with SWATH-mass spectrometry and RNA-seq allowed us to identify different baseline proteins and gene expression profiles with the potential to predict treatment response/resistance and to help in the development of effective and personalized cancer therapeutics.© 2023.

We identified mrDEGs and constituted a risk score model using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression. The prognostic efficacy of the risk score was validated in GSE65858 and GSE41613. We determined the enrichment of previously defined biological processes of mrDEGs. We separated the HNSCC patients into low-risk and high-risk groups and compared their immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoints' expressions.The risk score model was constituted by nine prognostic mrDEGs, includingLIMD2,SYCP2,EPHX3,UCLH1,STC2,PRAME,SLC7A4,PLOD2, andACADL. The risk score was a significant prognostic factor both in training (P < 0.001) and validation dataset (GSE65858:P = 0.008; GSE41613 = 0.015). The prognostic mrDEGs were enriched in multiple immune-associated pathways. Effector immune cells were increased in low-risk patients, includingCD8+ T cells, activatedCD4+ T cells, and plasma cells, whereas tumor associated M2 macrophages were recruited in the high-risk group. Expressions of immune checkpoints were generally higher in low-risk patients, includingCTLA-4,PD-1andLAG3.The mrDEGs can stratify HNSCC patients' prognosis, which correlates with alterations in tumor immune infiltrations and immune checkpoints.© 2022 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China.

However, the evolution of the genomic landscape of HR+ HER2- BC during adjuvant endocrine therapies (ETs) remains poorly investigated.We performed a genomic characterization of surgically resected HR+ HER2- BC patients relapsing during or at the completion of adjuvant ET. Using a customized panel, we comprehensively evaluated gene mutations and copy number variation (CNV) in paired primary and metastatic specimens. After retrieval and quality/quantity check of tumor specimens from an original cohort of 204 cases, 74 matched tumor samples were successfully evaluated for DNA mutations and CNV analysis. Along with previously reported genomic alterations, including PIK3CA, TP53, CDH1, GATA3 and ESR1 mutations/deletions, we found that ESR1 gene amplification (confirmed by FISH) and MAP3K mutations were enriched in metastatic lesions as compared to matched primary tumors. These alterations were exclusively found in patients treated with adjuvant aromatase inhibitors or LHRH analogs plus tamoxifen, but not in patients treated with tamoxifen alone. Patients with tumors bearing MAP3K mutations in metastatic lesions had significantly worse distant relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 3.4, 95% CI 1.52-7.70, p value 0.003) and worse overall survival (HR 5.2, 95% CI 2.10-12.8, p-value < 0.001) independently of other clinically relevant patient- and tumor-related variables.ESR1 amplification and activating MAP3K mutations are potential drivers of acquired resistance to adjuvant ETs employing estrogen deprivation in HR+ HER2- BC.

The protective effects of diets, at least in part, may be mediated by their beneficial macro- (protein, fat, carbohydrate) and micronutrient (vitamins, minerals) composition.Certain diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, may play a significant role in healthy aging by preventing the onset of certain diseases and by improving the aging process itself. This latter can be strengthened by incorporating fasting elements into the diet. As dietary recommendations change with age, this should be taken into consideration as well, when developing a diet tailored to the needs of elderly individuals.

From an oncological perspective, increased awareness of the molecular pathways underlying this disease is bringing us closer to the development of specific and targeted therapies. Meanwhile, on the surgical side, improved understanding can help to better identify the patients to be treated and the surgical timing. Overall, pathogenesis research is crucial for developing patient-tailored therapies. One of the actual key topics of interest is the link between the VHL/HIF axis and inflammation. The present study aims to outline the fundamental mechanisms that link VHL disease and immune disorders, as well as to explore the details of the overlap between VHL disease and myasthenia gravis (MG) pathogenetic pathways.

Aging is associated with oxidative damage. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infections may increase the production of reactive oxygen species and such infections will disturb the Ca++balance via an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated unfolded protein response. Although vaccine development and anti-inflammation therapy lower the severity of COVID-19, the prevalence and mortality rates are still alarming in some countries worldwide. In this review, we describe the involvement of viral proteins in activating ER stress transducers and their downstream signals and in inducing inflammation and inflammasome formation. Furthermore, we propose the potential of melatonin as an ER stress modulator, owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory effects in viral infections. Considering its strong safety profile, we suggest that additive melatonin supplementation in the elderly could be beneficial in treating COVID-19."

Africa shows one of the lowest COVID-19 fatality rates but very few data on the biochemical markers of COVID-19 in patients and the factors associated with disease severity are available for the continent. In Gabon, the COVID-19 fatality rate is only 0.63% but almost no data on biomarkers in COVID-19 patients have been published. Both the number of COVID-19 cases and the mortality rate reported in Africa in general, and in Gabon in particular, are lower than in non-African countries. As such, understanding the factors associated with disease severity in Gabonese patients is a crucial step to better understand the disease in the African context and prepare for future COVID-19 waves and other epidemics of emerging diseases. Here, we compared biochemical and hematological markers among 753 Gabonese COVID-19 patients with asymptomatic (184/753), mild/moderate (420/753), and severe/critical (149/753) forms of the disease using an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or a Kruskal-Wallis (KW) test.

The task is to embed both datasets into a common space in which the source dataset is informative for training while the divergence between source and target is minimized. The most popular domain adaptation solutions are based on training neural networks that combine classification and adversarial learning modules, frequently making them both data-hungry and difficult to train. We present a method called Domain Adaptation Principal Component Analysis (DAPCA) that identifies a linear reduced data representation useful for solving the domain adaptation task. DAPCA algorithm introduces positive and negative weights between pairs of data points, and generalizes the supervised extension of principal component analysis. DAPCA is an iterative algorithm that solves a simple quadratic optimization problem at each iteration. The convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed, and the number of iterations is small in practice. We validate the suggested algorithm on previously proposed benchmarks for solving the domain adaptation task. We also show the benefit of using DAPCA in analyzing single-cell omics datasets in biomedical applications. Overall, DAPCA can serve as a practical preprocessing step in many machine learning applications leading to reduced dataset representations, taking into account possible divergence between source and target domains."

Puberty also marks a shift in sex differences in susceptibility to asthma. Yet, little is known about the gene expression changes in immune cells that occur during pubertal development. Here we assess pubertal development and leukocyte gene expression in a longitudinal cohort of 251 children with asthma. We identify substantial gene expression changes associated with age and pubertal development. Gene expression changes between pre- and post-menarcheal females suggest a shift from predominantly innate to adaptive immunity. We show that genetic effects on gene expression change dynamically during pubertal development. Gene expression changes during puberty are correlated with gene expression changes associated with asthma and may explain sex differences in prevalence. Our results show that molecular data used to study the genetics of early onset diseases should consider pubertal development as an important factor that modifies the transcriptome.© 2023.

Despite commendable translational values in cancer liquid biopsy, however, the biology of cfDNA, especially the principles of cfDNA fragmentation, remains largely elusive. Through orientation-aware analyses of cfDNA fragmentation patterns against the nucleosome structure and integration with multidimensional functional genomics data, here we report a DNA methylation - nuclease preference - cutting end - size distribution axis, demonstrating the role of DNA methylation as a functional molecular regulator of cfDNA fragmentation. Hence, low-level DNA methylation could increase nucleosome accessibility and alter the cutting activities of nucleases during DNA fragmentation, which further leads to variation in cutting sites and size distribution of cfDNA. We further develop a cfDNA ending preference-based metric for cancer diagnosis, whose performance has been validated by multiple pan-cancer datasets.

Similarly, the top 10 downregulated microRNAs were hsa-let-7d-5p, hsa-let-7c-5p, hsa-miR-215-5p, hsa-miR-143-3p, hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-miR-10a-5p, hsa-miR-142-5p, hsa-miR-148a-3p, hsa-miR-122-5p, and hsa-miR-17-5p. The upregulation of microRNAs in the miR-181 family and the downregulation of those in the let-7 family appear to be mostly involved with non-responsiveness to irinotecan-based treatment."
"36675264","Scd1 Deficiency in Early Embryos Affects Blastocyst ICM Formation through RPs-Mdm2-p53 Pathway.","Int J Mol Sci","Embryos contain a large number of lipid droplets, and lipid metabolism is gradually activated during embryonic development to provide energy. However, the regulatory mechanisms remain to be investigated. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1) is a fatty acid desaturase gene that is mainly involved in intracellular monounsaturated fatty acid production, which takes part in many physiological processes. Analysis of transcripts at key stages of embryo development revealed that Scd1 was important and expressed at an increased level during the cleavage and blastocyst stages. KnockoutScd1gene by CRISPR/Cas9 from zygotes revealed a decrease in lipid droplets (LDs) and damage in the inner cell mass (ICM) formation of blastocyst. Comparative analysis of normal and knockout embryo transcripts showed a suppression of ribosome protein (RPs) genes, leading to the arrest of ribosome biogenesis at the 2-cell stage. Notably, the P53-related pathway was further activated at the blastocyst stage, which eventually caused embryonic development arrest and apoptosis. In summary, Scd1 helps in providing energy for embryonic development by regulating intra-embryonic lipid droplet formation. Moreover, deficiency activates the RPs-Mdm2-P53 pathway due to ribosomal stress and ultimately leads to embryonic development arrest. The present results suggested thatScd1gene is essential to maintain healthy development of embryos by regulating energy support."
"36672861","Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance of Traumatic Experience in Mammals.","Genes (Basel)","In recent years, we have seen an increasing amount of evidence pointing to the existence of a non-genetic heredity of the effects of events such as separation from parents, threat to life, or other traumatising experiences such as famine. This heredity is often mediated by epigenetic regulations of gene expression and may be transferred even across several generations. In this review, we focus on studies which involve transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI), with a short detour to intergenerational studies focused on the inheritance of trauma or stressful experiences. The reviewed studies show a plethora of universal changes which stress exposure initiates on multiple levels of organisation ranging from hormonal production and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis modulation all the way to cognition, behaviour, or propensity to certain psychiatric or metabolic disorders. This review will also provide an overview of relevant methodology and difficulties linked to implementation of epigenetic studies. A better understanding of these processes may help us elucidate the evolutionary pathways which are at work in the course of emergence of the diseases and disorders associated with exposure to trauma, either direct or in a previous generation."

(family Iridaceae) biologically active chemical compounds are quite well documented and they can therefore be used in addition to the conventional pharmacological treatment of depression. This systematic review on antidepressant compounds in saffron crocus and their mechanisms of action and side effects is based on publications released between 1995-2022 and data indexed in 15 databases under the following search terms: antidepressant effect, central nervous system,Crocus sativus, cognitive impairement, crocin, crocetin, depression, dopamine, dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, picrocrocin, phytotherapy, neurotransmitters, safranal, saffron, serotonin, and biologically active compounds. The comparative analysis of the publications was based on 414 original research papers. The investigated literature indicates the effectiveness and safety of aqueous and alcoholic extracts and biologically active chemical compounds (alkaloids, anthocyanins, carotenoids, flavonoid, phenolic, saponins, and terpenoids) isolated from various organs (corms, leaves, flower petal, and stigmas) in adjuvant treatment of depression and anxiety. Monoamine reuptake inhibition,N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-α agonism are the main proposed mechanism of the antidepressant action. The antidepressant and neuroprotective effect of extract components is associated with their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity. The mechanism of their action, interactions with conventional drugs and other herbal preparations and the safety of use are not fully understood; therefore, further detailed research in this field is necessary. The presented results regarding the application ofC. sativusin phytotherapy are promising in terms of the use of herbal preparations to support the treatment of depression. This is particularly important given the steady increase in the incidence of this disease worldwide and social effects."
"36627639","Identification of genetic variants associated with diabetic kidney disease in multiple Korean cohorts via a genome-wide association study mega-analysis.","BMC Med","The pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is complex, involving metabolic and hemodynamic factors. Although DKD has been established as a heritable disorder and several genetic studies have been conducted, the identification of unique genetic variants for DKD is limited by its multiplex classification based on the phenotypes of diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Thus, we aimed to identify the genetic variants related to DKD that differentiate it from type 2 DM and CKD.We conducted a large-scale genome-wide association study mega-analysis, combining Korean multi-cohorts using multinomial logistic regression. A total of 33,879 patients were classified into four groups-normal, DM without CKD, CKD without DM, and DKD-and were further analyzed to identify novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with DKD. Additionally, fine-mapping analysis was conducted to investigate whether the variants of interest contribute to a trait. Conditional analyses adjusting for the effect of type 1 DM (T1D)-associated HLA variants were also performed to remove confounding factors of genetic association with T1D. Moreover, analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) was performed using the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE30529). The significant eQTL DEGs were used to explore the predicted interaction networks using search tools for the retrieval of interacting genes and proteins.We identified three novel SNPs [rs3128852 (P = 8.21×10-25), rs117744700 (P = 8.28×10-10), and rs28366355 (P = 2.04×10-8)] associated with DKD. Moreover, the fine-mapping study validated the causal relationship between rs3128852 and DKD. rs3128852 is an eQTL for TRIM27 in whole blood tissues and HLA-A in adipose-subcutaneous tissues. rs28366355 is an eQTL for HLA-group genes present in most tissues.We successfully identified SNPs (rs3128852, rs117744700, and rs28366355) associated with DKD and verified the causal association between rs3128852 and DKD. According to the in silico analysis, TRIM27 and HLA-A can define DKD pathophysiology and are associated with immune response and autophagy. However, further research is necessary to understand the mechanism of immunity and autophagy in the pathophysiology of DKD and to prevent and treat DKD.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36653824","Effect of common pregnancy and perinatal complications on offspring metabolic traits across the life course: a multi-cohort study.","BMC Med","Common pregnancy and perinatal complications are associated with offspring cardiometabolic risk factors. These complications may influence multiple metabolic traits in the offspring and these associations might differ with offspring age.We used data from eight population-based cohort studies to examine and compare associations of pre-eclampsia (PE), gestational hypertension (GH), gestational diabetes (GD), preterm birth (PTB), small (SGA) and large (LGA) for gestational age (vs. appropriate size for gestational age (AGA)) with up to 167 plasma/serum-based nuclear magnetic resonance-derived metabolic traits encompassing lipids, lipoproteins, fatty acids, amino acids, ketones, glycerides/phospholipids, glycolysis, fluid balance, and inflammation. Confounder-adjusted regression models were used to examine associations (adjusted for maternal education, parity age at pregnancy, ethnicity, pre/early pregnancy body mass index and smoking, and offspring sex and age at metabolic trait assessment), and results were combined using meta-analysis by five age categories representing different periods of the offspring life course: neonates (cord blood), infancy (mean ages: 1.1-1.6 years), childhood (4.2-7.5 years); adolescence (12.0-16.0 years), and adulthood (22.0-67.8 years).Offspring numbers for each age category/analysis varied from 8925 adults (441 PTB) to 1181 infants (135 GD); 48.4% to 60.0% were females. Pregnancy complications (PE, GH, GD) were each associated with up to three metabolic traits in neonates (P≤0.001) with some evidence of persistence to older ages. PTB and SGA were associated with 32 and 12 metabolic traits in neonates respectively, which included an adjusted standardised mean difference of -0.89 standard deviation (SD) units for albumin with PTB (95% CI: -1.10 to -0.69, P=1.3×10-17) and -0.41 SD for total lipids in medium HDL with SGA (95% CI: -0.56 to -0.25, P=2.6×10-7), with some evidence of persistence to older ages. LGA was inversely associated with 19 metabolic traits including lower levels of cholesterol, lipoproteins, fatty acids, and amino acids, with associations emerging in adolescence, (e.g. -0.11 SD total fatty acids, 95% CI: -0.18 to -0.05, P=0.0009), and attenuating with older age across adulthood.These reassuring findings suggest little evidence of wide-spread and long-term impact of common pregnancy and perinatal complications on offspring metabolic traits, with most associations only observed for newborns rather than older ages, and for perinatal rather than pregnancy complications.© 2023.

"36650426","Genomic and immunogenomic analysis of three prognostic signature genes in LUAD.","BMC Bioinformatics","Searching for immunotherapy-related markers is an important research content to screen for target populations suitable for immunotherapy. Prognosis-related genes in early stage lung cancer may also affect the tumor immune microenvironment, which in turn affects immunotherapy.We analyzed the differential genes affecting lung cancer patients receiving immunotherapy through the Cancer Treatment Response gene signature DataBase (CTR-DB), and set a threshold to obtain a total of 176 differential genes between response and non-response to immunotherapy. Functional enrichment analysis found that these differential genes were mainly involved in immune regulation-related pathways. The early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) prognostic model was constructed through the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database, and three target genes (MMP12, NFE2, HOXC8) were screened to calculate the risk score of early-stage LUAD. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve indicated that the model had good prognostic value, and the validation set (GSE50081, GSE11969 and GSE42127) from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) analysis indicated that the model had good stability, and the risk score was correlated with immune infiltrations to varying degrees. Multi-type survival analysis and immune infiltration analysis revealed that the transcriptome, methylation and the copy number variation (CNV) levels of the three genes were correlated with patient prognosis and some tumor microenvironment (TME) components. Drug sensitivity analysis found that the three genes may affect some anti-tumor drugs. The mRNA expression of immune checkpoint-related genes showed significant differences between the high and low group of the three genes, and there may be a mutual regulatory network between immune checkpoint-related genes and target genes. Tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) analysis found that three genes were associated with immunotherapy response and maybe the potential predictors to immunotherapy, consistent with the CTR-DB database analysis.From the perspective of data mining, this study suggests that MMP12, NFE2, and HOXC8 may be involved in tumor immune regulation and affect immunotherapy. They are expected to become markers of immunotherapy and are worthy of further experimental research.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"36621767","Proteomics Investigation of Diverse Serological Patterns in COVID-19.","Mol Cell Proteomics","Serum antibodies IgM and IgG are elevated during COVID-19 to defend against viral attacks. Atypical results such as negative and abnormally high antibody expression were frequently observed whereas the underlying molecular mechanisms are elusive. In our cohort of 144 COVID-19 patients, 3.5% were both IgM and IgG negative whereas 29.2% remained only IgM negative. The remaining patients exhibited positive IgM and IgG expression, with 9.3% of them exhibiting over 20-fold higher titers of IgM than the others at their plateau. IgG titers in all of them were significantly boosted after vaccination in the second year. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we classed the patients into four groups with diverse serological patterns and analyzed their two-year clinical indicators. Additionally, we collected 111 serum samples for TMTpro-based longitudinal proteomic profiling and characterized 1494 proteins in total. We found that the continuously negative IgM and IgG expression during COVID-19 were associated with mild inflammatory reactions and high T cell responses. Low levels of serum IgD, inferior complement 1 activation of complement cascades, and insufficient cellular immune responses might collectively lead to compensatory serological responses, causing overexpression of IgM. Serum CD163 was positively correlated with antibody titers during seroconversion. This study suggests that patients with negative serology still developed cellular immunity for viral defense, and that high titers of IgM might not be favorable to COVID-19 recovery.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

"36605576","A highly efficient protein corona-based proteomic analysis strategy for the discovery of pharmacodynamic biomarkers.","J Pharm Anal","The composition of serum is extremely complex, which complicates the discovery of new pharmacodynamic biomarkers via serum proteome for disease prediction and diagnosis. Recently, nanoparticles have been reported to efficiently reduce the proportion of high-abundance proteins and enrich low-abundance proteins in serum. Here, we synthesized a silica-coated iron oxide nanoparticle and developed a highly efficient and reproducible protein corona (PC)-based proteomic analysis strategy to improve the range of serum proteomic analysis. We identified 1,070 proteins with a median coefficient of variation of 12.56% using PC-based proteomic analysis, which was twice the number of proteins identified by direct digestion. There were also more biological processes enriched with these proteins. We applied this strategy to identify more pharmacodynamic biomarkers on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model treated with methotrexate (MTX). The bioinformatic results indicated that 485 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found in CIA rats, of which 323 DEPs recovered to near normal levels after treatment with MTX. This strategy can not only help enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of disease and drug action through serum proteomics studies, but also provide more pharmacodynamic biomarkers for disease prediction, diagnosis, and treatment.© 2022 The Authors."
"36639774","Radiation-induced senescence: therapeutic opportunities.","Radiat Oncol","The limitation of cancer radiotherapy does not derive from an inability to ablate tumor, but rather to do so without excessively damaging critical tissues and organs and adversely affecting patient's quality of life. Although cellular senescence is a normal consequence of aging, there is increasing evidence showing that the radiation-induced senescence in both tumor and adjacent normal tissues contributes to tumor recurrence, metastasis, and resistance to therapy, while chronic senescent cells in the normal tissue and organ are a source of many late damaging effects. In this review, we discuss how to identify cellular senescence using various bio-markers and the role of the so-called senescence-associated secretory phenotype characteristics on the pathogenesis of the radiation-induced late effects. We also discuss therapeutic options to eliminate cellular senescence using either senolytics and/or senostatics. Finally, a discussion of cellular reprogramming is presented, another promising avenue to improve the therapeutic gain of radiotherapy.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Certain native immune molecules like major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I), paired immunoglobulin receptor B (PirB), toll-like receptor (TLR), cluster of differentiation-3 zeta (CD3ζ), CD4 co-receptor, and T-cell receptor beta (TCR-β) expression in neurons have been extensively documented. In this review, we provide our opinion and discussed the possible roles of T-cell receptor beta subunits in modulating the function of neurons in the central nervous system. Based on the previous findings of Syken and Shatz., 2003; Nishiyori et al., 2004; Rodriguez et., 1993 and Komal et., 2014; we discuss whether restrictive expression of TCR-β subunits in selected brain regions could be involved in the pathology of neurological disorders and whether their aberrant enhancement in expression may be considered as a suitable biomarker for aging or neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease (HD).© 2022 The Authors."

Oxidative stress causes a multitude of damages, severely affecting cell viability, fidelity of genetic information inheritance, and determining profound alterations in gene expression. Epigenetics represents a major form of gene expression modulation, influencing DNA accessibility to transcription factors and the overall nuclear architecture. When assessing the stress-induced epigenome reprogramming, widely diffused biochemical and molecular approaches commonly fail to incorporate analyses such as architectural chromatin alterations and target molecules precise spatial localization. Unveiling the significance of the nuclear response to the oxidative stress, as well as the functional effects over the chromatin organization, may reveal targets and strategies for approaches aiming at limiting the impact on cellular stability. For these reasons, we utilized potassium bromate treatment, a stressor able to induce DNA damages without altering the cellular microenvironment, hence purely modeling nuclear oxidative stress. By means of high-resolution techniques, we described profound alterations in DNA and histone epigenetic modifications and in chromatin organization in response to the reactive oxygen species."

In this study, we have developed cooperative transcription factor by fusing oligomerization domain in mammalian cells. Firstly, we demonstrated that two oligomerized domains (CI434 and CI) successfully improved transcription factor cooperativity in bacterial cells but failed to increase cooperativity in mammalian cells, possibly because the additional mammalian activation domain disrupted their oligomerization capability. Therefore, we chose a different type of oligomerized domain (CarHC), whose ability to oligomerize is not dependent on its C-terminal domains, to fuse with a transcription factor (RpaR) and activation domain (VTR3), forming a potential cooperative transcription activator RpaR-CarH-VTR3 for mammalian regulatory systems. Compared with RpaR-VTR3, the cooperativity of RpaR-CarH-VTR3 was significantly improved with higher Hill coefficient and a narrower input range in the inducible switch system in mammalian cells. Moreover, a mathematical model based on statistical mechanics model was developed and the simulation results supported the hypothesis that the tetramer of the CarH domain in mammalian cells was the reason for the cooperative capacity of RpaR-CarH-VTR3.© 2022 The Authors."

We aimed to explore the relationships among dietary zinc intake, serum zinc concentrations and multimorbidity in a cross-sectional study of 300 employees of Electric Generating Authority of Thailand aged ≥ 60 years. Comprehensive questionnaires were completed, and clinical and laboratory assessments were performed. Factors associated with low serum zinc concentrations were identified using multivariate multinomial logistic regression analyses. The mean serum zinc level was 80.5 (12.8) µg/dL. After adjustment for baseline characteristics, being female and having been in education for ≤12 years were independent risk factors for the lowest tertile (T1) of serum zinc. After additional adjustment for clinical and biochemical parameters, there was a significant association between depression (Thai Geriatric Depression Scale-15 score &gt; 5) and low serum zinc levels (T1 vs. T3, odds ratio (OR): 2.24; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-4.77). Furthermore, as serum albumin increased, serum zinc concentration substantially increased (T1 vs. T3, OR: 0.01; 95% CI: 0.002-0.070). Therefore, the early detection of risk factors and the further management of depression and low serum albumin may assist physicians in preventing low serum concentrations."

Many efforts have been made to improve the depth of its identification, while there is an increasing need to improve the throughput and reproducibility of plasma proteomics analysis in order to adapt to the clinical large-scale sample analysis.We have developed and optimized a robust plasma analysis workflow that combines an automated sample preparation platform with a micro-flow LC-MS-based detection method. The stability and reproducibility of the workflow were systematically evaluated and the workflow was applied to a proof-of-concept plasma proteome study of 30 colon cancer patients from three age groups.This workflow can analyze dozens of samples simultaneously with high reproducibility. Without protein depletion and prefractionation, more than 300 protein groups can be identified in a single analysis with micro-flow LC-MS system on a Orbitrap Exploris 240 mass spectrometer, including quantification of 35 FDA approved disease markers. The quantitative precision of the entire workflow was acceptable with median CV of 9%. The preliminary proteomic analysis of colon cancer plasma from different age groups could be well separated with identification of potential colon cancer-related biomarkers.This workflow is suitable for the analysis of large-scale clinical plasma samples with its simple and time-saving operation, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of discovering significantly changed plasma proteins and distinguishing different patient groups.© 2023.

"36615821","Cardiometabolic Traits in Adult Twins: Heritability and BMI Impact with Age.","Nutrients","The prevalence of obesity and cardiometabolic diseases continues to rise globally and obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases. However, to our knowledge, evidence of the relative roles of genes and the environment underlying obesity and cardiometabolic disease traits and the correlations between them are still lacking, as is how they change with age.Data were obtained from the Chinese National Twin Registry (CNTR). A total of 1421 twin pairs were included. Univariate structural equation models (SEMs) were performed to evaluate the heritability of BMI and cardiometabolic traits, which included blood hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Bivariate SEMs were used to assess the genetic/environmental correlations between them. The study population was divided into three groups for analysis: ≤50, 51-60, and &gt;60 years old to assess the changes in heritability and genetic/environmental correlations with ageing.Univariate SEMs showed a high heritability of BMI (72%) and cardiometabolic traits, which ranged from 30% (HbA1c) to 69% (HDL-C). With age increasing, the heritability of all phenotypes has different degrees of declining trends. Among these, BMI, SBP, and DBP presented significant monotonous declining trends. The bivariate SEMs indicated that BMI correlated with all cardiometabolic traits. The genetic correlations were estimated to range from 0.14 (BMI and LDL-C) to 0.39 (BMI and DBP), while the environmental correlations ranged from 0.13 (BMI and TC/LDL-C) to 0.31 (BMI and TG). The genetic contributions underlying the correlations between BMI and SBP and DBP, TC, TG, and HDL-C showed a progressive decrease as age groups increased. In contrast, environmental correlations displayed a significant increasing trend for HbA1c, SBP, and DBP.The findings suggest that genetic and environmental factors have essential effects on BMI and all cardiometabolic traits. However, as age groups increased, genetic influences presented varying degrees of decrement for BMI and most cardiometabolic traits, suggesting the increasing importance of environments. Genetic factors played a consistently larger role than environmental factors in the phenotypic correlations between BMI and cardiometabolic traits. Nevertheless, the relative magnitudes of genetic and environmental factors may change over time."

Inducing cuproptosis in cancer cells is well anticipated for its curative potential in treating tumor diseases. However, ferredoxin 1 (FDX1), the core regulatory gene in cuproptosis, is rarely studied, and the regulation ofFDX1in tumor biology remains obscure. A comprehensive pan-cancer analysis ofFDX1is needed.Thirty-three types of tumors were included with paired normal tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) datasets. The interaction between transcription, protein, phosphorylation, and promoter methylation levels was analyzed. Survival, immune infiltration, single-cellFDX1expression,FDX1-related tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), stemness, tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE), and immunotherapy-related analyses were performed.FDX1protein expression was assessed by kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) tissue microarray immunohistochemistry. The function ofFDX1in KIRC was further explored by experiments in 786-O cell linesin vitro.FDX1is highly expressed in 15 tumor types and lowly expressed in 11 tumor types. The corresponding changes in protein expression, phosphorylation, and promoter methylation level ofFDX1have been described in several tumors. Survival analysis showed thatFDX1was related to favorable or poor overall survival in eight tumors and progression-free survival in nine tumors. Immune infiltration and single-cell analysis indicated the indispensable role ofFDX1expression in macrophages and monocytes. Multiple established immunotherapy cohorts suggested thatFDX1may be a potential predictor of treatment effects for tumor patients. Tissue microarray analysis showed decreasedFDX1expression in KIRC patients' tumor tissues. Knockdown ofFDX1resulted in the downregulation of cuproptosis in kidney renal clear tumor cells. Mechanistically, theFDX1-associated gene expression signature in KIRC is related to the enrichment of genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, NOTCH pathway, etc. Several NOTCH pathway genes were differentially expressed in the high- and low-FDX1groups in KIRC.Our analysis showed that the central regulatory gene of cuproptosis,FDX1, has differential expression and modification levels in various tumors, which is associated with cellular function, immune modulation, and disease prognosis. Thus,FDX1-dependent cuproptosis may serve as a brand-new target in future therapeutic approaches against tumors.Copyright © 2022 Xu, Hu, Cao, Zhang, Luo, Zhang, Wang, Cheng and Li."

While these models already support experimental design, can they also quantitatively predict tissue behavior? Here, we review the current state of the art of COMs and discuss perspectives for their application."

The combined data included 2304 EL cases and 5879 controls. The analysis identified a locus in CDKN2B-AS1 (rs6475609,p= 7.13 × 10-8) that almost reached genome-wide significance and four additional loci that were suggestively significant. Among these, a novel rare variant (rs145265196) on chromosome 11 had much higher longevity allele frequencies in cases of Ashkenazi Jewish and Southern Italian ancestry compared to cases of other European ancestries. We also correlated EL-associated SNPs with serum proteins to link our findings to potential biological mechanisms that may be related to EL and are under genetic regulation. The findings from the proteomic analyses suggested that longevity-promoting alleles of significant genetic variants either provided EL cases with more youthful molecular profiles compared to controls or provided some form of protection from other illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, and disease progressions."
"36606268","Three Tiers to biological escape velocity: The quest to outwit aging.","Aging Med (Milton)","As longevity companies emerge with new products and the fields of anti-aging research develop new cutting-edge therapies, three distinct classes of longevity methodologies emerge. This discussion finds that there are three clear classes (Tiers) of longevity systems that are currently under development, and all three will be paramount to achieve biological escape velocity (where tissues can be repaired faster than aging can damage them). These classes are referred to as Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 treatments and are described in detail below. These three Tiers are required for easy identification for pharmaceutical companies and research companies to determine the type of therapy they may choose to deliver being noninvasive, invasive, time consuming, or simple end user products. Specific targets and goals need to be defined clearly from an early perspective in the development of these technologies for future precision medicines. This allows consumers of future anti-aging technologies to consider which Tier a particular therapy may be, delivering a more informed choice.© 2022 The Author.

Following its causal implication in age-related decline, autophagy is currently among the most broadly studied and challenged mechanisms within aging research. Thanks to these efforts, new cellular nodes interconnected with this phylogenetically ancestral pathway and unexpected roles of autophagy-associated genetic products are unveiled daily, yet the history of functional adaptations of autophagy along its evolutive trail is poorly understood and documented. Autophagy is traditionally studied in canonical and research-wise convenient model organisms such as yeast and mice. However, unconventional animal models endowed with extended longevity and exemption from age-related diseases offer a privileged perspective to inquire into the role of autophagy in the evolution of longevity.

"36672610","Functional Validation of the Putative Oncogenic Activity of PLAU.","Biomedicines","Plasminogen activator, urokinase (PLAU) is involved in cell migration, proliferation and tissue remodeling.PLAUupregulation is associated with an increase in aggressiveness, metastasis, and invasion of several cancer types, including breast cancer. In patients, this translates into decreased sensitivity to hormonal treatment, and poor prognosis. These clinical findings have led to the examination ofPLAUas a biomarker for predicting breast cancer prognosis and therapy responses. In this study, we investigated the functional ability ofPLAUto act as an oncogene in breast cancers by modulating its expression using CRISPR-deactivated Cas9 (CRISPR-dCas9) tools. Different effector domains (e.g., transcription modulators (VP64, KRAB)) alone or in combination with epigenetic writers (DNMT3A/3L, MSssI) were fused to dCas9 and targeted to thePLAUpromoter. In MDA-MB-231 cells characterized by highPLAUexpression downregulation ofPLAUexpression by CRISPR-dCas9-DNMT3A/3L-KRAB, resulted in decreased cell proliferation. Conversely, CRISPR-dCas9-VP64 inducedPLAUupregulation in lowPLAUexpressing MCF-7 cells and significantly increased aggressiveness and invasion. In conclusion, modulation ofPLAUexpression affected metastatic related properties of breast cancer cells, thus further validating its oncogenic activity in breast cancer cells."

However, few studies have focused on the correlation between ceRNAs and immune cells. Thus, we developed a method based on a ceRNA network and tumor-infiltrating immune cells to elucidate the molecular pathways that may predict prognosis in patients with oral cancer. Download RNAseq expression data of oral cancer and control samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), obtain differentially expressed genes and establish a ceRNA network. The cox analysis and lasso regression analysis were used to screen key RNAs to establish a prognostic risk assessment model, and draw a 1.3.5-year forecast nomogram. Then the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to screen important tumor immune infiltrating cells associated with oral cancer. Another prognostic predictive model related to immune cells was established. Finally, co-expression analysis was applied to explore the relationship between key genes in the ceRNA network and important immune cells. Multiple external data sets are used to test the expression of key biomarkers. We constructed prognostic risk models of ceRNA and immune cells, which included 9 differentially expressed mRNAs and 2 types of immune cells. It was discovered from the co-expression analysis that a pair of important biomarkers were associated with the prognosis of oral cancer. T cells regulatory and CGNL1 (R = 0.39, P < .001) showed a significant positive correlation. External data set validation also supports this result. In this study, we found that some crucial ceRNAs (GGCT, TRPS1, CGNL1, HENMT1, LCE3A, S100A8, ZNF347, TMEM144, TMEM192) and immune cells (T cells regulatory and Eosinophils) may be related to the prognosis of oral cancer.Copyright © 2022 the Author(s).

"36639381","ChIATAC is an efficient strategy for multi-omics mapping of 3D epigenomes from low-cell inputs.","Nat Commun","Connecting genes to their cis-regulatory elements has been enabled by genome-wide mapping of chromatin interactions using proximity ligation in ChIA-PET, Hi-C, and their derivatives. However, these methods require millions of input cells for high-quality data and thus are unsuitable for many studies when only limited cells are available. Conversely, epigenomic profiling via transposase digestion in ATAC-seq requires only hundreds to thousands of cells to robustly map open chromatin associated with transcription activity, but it cannot directly connect active genes to their distal enhancers. Here, we combine proximity ligation in ChIA-PET and transposase accessibility in ATAC-seq into ChIATAC to efficiently map interactions between open chromatin loci in low numbers of input cells. We validate ChIATAC in Drosophila cells and optimize it for mapping 3D epigenomes in human cells robustly. Applying ChIATAC to primary human T cells, we reveal mechanisms that topologically regulate transcriptional programs during T cell activation.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We review how our understanding of the genetic architecture and epigenetic properties of human centromeric DNA have advanced as a result. Preliminary studies of human and nonhuman ape centromeres reveal complex, saltatory mutational changes organized around distinct evolutionary layers. Pockets of regional hypomethylation within higher-order α-satellite DNA, termed centromere dip regions, appear to define the site of kinetochore attachment in all human chromosomes, although such epigenetic features can vary even within the same chromosome. Sequence resolution of satellite DNA is providing new insights into centromeric function with potential implications for improving our understanding of human biology and health."

How centromeric CENP-A position is specified and precisely maintained through DNA replication is not fully understood. The recently released Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) genome assembly containing the first complete human centromere sequences provides a new resource for examining CENP-A position. Mapping CENP-A position in clones of the same cell line to the T2T assembly identified highly similar CENP-A position after multiple cell divisions. In contrast, centromeric CENP-A epialleles were evident at several centromeres of different human cell lines, demonstrating the location of CENP-A enrichment and the site of kinetochore recruitment vary among human cells. Across the cell cycle, CENP-A molecules deposited in G1 phase are maintained in their precise position through DNA replication. Thus, despite CENP-A dilution during DNA replication, CENP-A is precisely reloaded onto the same sequences within the daughter centromeres, maintaining unique centromere identity among human cells.© 2023 Mahlke et al."

Here, we develop a technique for the Purification of x-linked Proteins (PxP), which allows identification and tracking of diverse DPCs in mammalian cells. Using PxP, we investigate DPC repair in cells genetically-engineered to express variants of the SPRTN protease that cause premature ageing and early-onset liver cancer in Ruijs-Aalfs syndrome patients. We find an unexpected role for SPRTN in global-genome DPC repair, that does not rely on replication-coupled detection of the lesion. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that replication-independent DPC cleavage by SPRTN requires SUMO-targeted ubiquitylation of the protein adduct and occurs in addition to proteasomal DPC degradation. Defective ubiquitin binding of SPRTN patient variants compromises global-genome DPC repair and causes synthetic lethality in combination with a reduction in proteasomal DPC repair capacity.© 2023.

"36680195","HIV Infection, Chromosome Instability, and Micronucleus Formation.","Viruses","Genome integrity is critical for proper cell functioning, and chromosome instability can lead to age-related diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Chromosome instability is caused by multiple factors, including replication stress, chromosome missegregation, exposure to pollutants, and viral infections. Although many studies have investigated the effects of environmental or lifestyle genotoxins on chromosomal integrity, information on the effects of viral infections on micronucleus formation and other chromosomal aberrations is still limited. Currently, HIV infection is considered a chronic disease treatable by antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, HIV-infected individuals still face important health problems, such as chronic inflammation and age-related diseases. In this context, this article reviews studies that have evaluated genomic instability using micronucleus assays in the context of HIV infection. In brief, HIV can induce chromosome instability directly through the interaction of HIV proteins with host DNA and indirectly through chronic inflammation or as a result of ART use. Connections between HIV infection, immunosenescence and age-related disease are discussed in this article. The monitoring of HIV-infected individuals should consider the increased risk of chromosome instability, and lifestyle interventions, such as reduced exposure to genotoxins and an antioxidant-rich diet, should be considered. Therapies to reduce chronic inflammation in HIV infection are needed."

Sensitivity to GO of immature, or with different survival strategy, individuals has not been studied so far. Therefore, in the present research, we focused on the GO genotoxic effects, examining selected parameters of DNA damage (total DNA damage, double-strand breaks-DSB, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine-8-OHdG, abasic site-AP sites), DNA damage response parameters, and global methylation in the model organismAcheta domesticus. Special attention was paid to various life stages and lifespans, using wild (H), and selected for longevity (D) strains. DNA damage was significantly affected by stage and/or strain and GO exposure. Larvae and young imago were generally more sensitive than adults, revealing more severe DNA damage. Especially in the earlier life stages, the D strain reacted more intensely/inversely than the H strain. In contrast, DNA damage response parameters were not significantly related to stage and/or strain and GO exposure. Stage-dependent DNA damage, especially DSB and 8-OHdG, with the simultaneous lack or subtle activation of DNA damage response parameters, may result from the general life strategy of insects. Predominantly fast-living and fast-breeding organisms can minimize energy-demanding repair mechanisms."

Maternal stress biomarkers may fill this gap. Steroid hormones and neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone (ALLO) play important roles in stress physiology and pregnancy maintenance and therefore may be promising for preterm birth prediction.We evaluated maternal serum ALLO, progesterone, cortisol, cortisone, pregnanolone, and epipregnanolone twice in gestation to evaluate associations with preterm birth.We performed a nested case-control study using biobanked fasting serum samples from the Healthy Start prebirth cohort. We included healthy women with a singleton pregnancy and matched preterm cases with term controls (1:1; N = 27 per group). We used a new HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry assay to quantify ALLO and five related steroids. We used ANOVA, Fisher exact, χ2,ttest, and linear and logistic regression as statistical tests.Maternal serum ALLO did not associate with preterm birth nor differ between groups. Mean cortisol levels were significantly higher in the preterm group early in pregnancy (13w0d-18w0d;P< 0.05) and higher early pregnancy cortisol associated with increased odds of preterm birth (at 13w0d; odds ratio, 1.007; 95% CI, 1.0002-1.014). Progesterone, cortisone, pregnanolone, and epipregnanolone did not associate with preterm birth.The findings from our pilot study suggest potential utility of cortisol as a maternal serum biomarker for preterm birth risk assessment in early pregnancy.

Two alleles in the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene were associated with chronic kidney disease; these alleles are common in individuals of African ancestry but rare in European descendants. Genomic studies on Afro-Americans have indicated a higher prevalence and severity of chronic kidney disease in people of African ancestry when compared to other ethnic groups. However, estimates in low- and middle-income countries are still limited. Precision medicine approaches could improve clinical outcomes in carriers of risk alleles in the Apolipoprotein L1 gene through early diagnosis and specific therapies. Nevertheless, to enhance the definition of studies on these variants, it would be necessary to include individuals with different ancestry profiles in the sample, such as Latinos, African Americans, and Indigenous peoples. There is evidence that measuring genetic ancestry improves clinical care for admixed people. For chronic kidney disease, this knowledge could help establish public health strategies for monitoring patients and understanding the impact of the Apolipoprotein L1 genetic variants in admixed populations. Therefore, researchers need to develop resources, methodologies, and incentives for vulnerable and disadvantaged communities, to develop and implement precision medicine strategies and contribute to consolidating diversity in science and precision medicine in clinical practice.Copyright © 2022 Giudicelli, De Souza, Veronese, Pereira, Hünemeier and Vianna."

For this purpose, genetically modifiedYarrowia lipolyticayeast strains expressing Aβ42 (the main biomarker of AD), eGFP-Aβ42, Aβ40, and eGFP-Aβ40 were constructed and examined. In contrast to the cells expressing eGFP and eGFP-Aβ40, retaining ""normal"" mitochondrial reticulum, eGFP-Aβ42 cells possessed a disturbed mitochondrial reticulum with fragmented mitochondria; this was partially restored by preincubation with a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQThy. Aβ42 expression also elevated ROS production and cell death; low concentrations of SkQThy mitigated these effects. Aβ42 expression caused mitochondrial dysfunction as inferred from a loose coupling of respiration and phosphorylation, the decreased level of ATP production, and the enhanced rate of hydrogen peroxide formation. Therefore, we have obtained the same results described for other AD models. Based on an analysis of these and earlier data, we suggest that the mitochondrial fragmentation might be a biomarker of the earliest preclinical stage of AD with an effective therapy based on mitochondria- targeted antioxidants. The simple yeast model constructed can be a useful platform for the rapid screening of such compounds."

Mass vaccination with the current gene-based vaccines has helped control the pandemic but unfortunately it has not shown effectiveness in preventing the spread of the virus. In addition, not all individuals respond to these vaccines, while others develop adverse reactions that cannot be neglected. It is also a fact that some individuals are more susceptible to infection while others develop effective immunization post-infection. We note here that the person-to-person and population variations in vaccine efficacy and side effects have been studied in the field of vaccinomics long before the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the field of adversomics examines the mechanisms of individual differences in the side effects of health interventions. In this review, we discuss the potential of a multi-omics approach for comprehensive profiling of the benefit/risk ratios of vaccines. Vaccinomics and adversomics stand to benefit planetary health and contribute to the prevention of future pandemics in the 21st century by offering precision guidance to clinical trials as well as promoting precision use of vaccines in ways that proactively respond to individual and population differences in their efficacy and safety. This vision of pandemic prevention based on personalized instead of mass vaccination also calls for equity in access to precision vaccines and diagnostics that support a vision and practice of vaccinomics and adversomics in planetary health."

This prediction will help the medical society in the selection of patients with the need for these constrained resources. Literature shows that using clinical data in this study is the common trend and molecular data is rarely utilized in this prediction. As molecular data carry more disease related information, in this study, three different types of RNA molecules ( lncRNA, miRNA and mRNA) of SARS-COV-2 patients are used to predict the severity stage and treatment stage of those patients. Using seven different machine learning algorithms along with several feature selection techniques shows that in both phenotypes, feature importance selected features provides the best accuracy along with random forest classifier. Further to this, it shows that in the severity stage prediction miRNA and lncRNA give the best performance, and lncRNA data gives the best in treatment stage prediction.

We identified 499,336 CVD cases in Wuhan's 74 municipal hospitals between 2017 and 2019. A high-resolution PM2.5model and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map were established to estimate individual exposures. The time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were applied to explore the associations between PM2.5and CVDs under different levels of environmental factors. Greenness could alleviate PM2.5-induced hospitalization risks of cardiovascular diseases. Compared with patients in the low-greenness group (ER = 0.99%; 95% CI: 0.71%, 1.28%), patients in the high-greenness group (ER = 0.45%; 95% CI: 0.13%, 0.77%) showed a lower increase in total CVD hospitalizations. After dividing the greenness into quartiles and adding long-term PM2.5exposure as a control factor, no significant PM2.5-associated hospitalization risks of CVD were identified in the greenest areas (quartile 4), whether the long-term PM2.5exposure level was high or low. Intriguingly, in the least green areas (quartile 1), the PM2.5-induced excess risk of CVD hospitalization was 0.58% (95% CI: 0.04%, 1.11%) in the long-term high-level PM2.5exposure group, and increased to 1.61% (95% CI: 0.95%, 2.27%) in the long-term low-level PM2.5exposure group. In the subgroup analysis, males and participants aged 55-64 years showed more significant increases in the PM2.5-induced risk of contracting CVDs with a reduction in greenness and fine particle exposure conditions. High residential greenness can greatly alleviate the PM2.5-induced risk of cardiovascular admission. Living in the areas with long-term low-level PM2.5may make people more sensitive to short-term increases in PM2.5, leading to CVD hospitalization."

It is unknown whether and how perinatal maternal high-fat diets (MHF)-mediated vascular dysfunction occurs via the angiotensin-PKC-L-type-calcium-channels (LTCC) axis. This study determined angiotensin II (AII) roles in the PKC-LTCC axis in controlling calcium influx in the arteries of offspring after perinatal MHF. Mesenteric arteries (MA) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from 5-month-old offspring rats were studied using physiological, ion channel, molecular, and epigenetic analysis. Pressor responses to AII were significantly increased in the free-moving MHF offspring rats. In cell experiments, MA-SMC proliferation was enhanced, and associated with thicker vascular wall in the obese offspring. Imaging analysis showed increase of fluorescence Ca2+intensity in the SMCs of the MHF group. Angiotensin II receptor (AT1R)-mediated PKC-LTCC axis in vasoconstrictions was altered by perinatal MHF via reduced DNA methylation at specific CpG sites ofAgtr1aandPrkcbgene promoters at the transcription level. Accordingly, mRNA and protein expression of AT1R and PKCβ in the offspring MA were increased, contributing to enhanced Ca2+currents and vascular tone. The results showed that DNA methylation resulted in perinatal MHF-induced vascular disorders via altered AT1-PKC-LTCC pathway in resistance arteries of the offspring, providing new insights into the pathogenesis and early prevention/treatments for hypertension in developmental origins."

Through transcriptome analysis of endothelial cells (EC) from the white adipose tissue of male and female mice high-fat-fed for 7 weeks, we found that adipose EC exhibited pronouncedly sex-distinct transcriptomes. Genes upregulated in female adipose EC were associated with proliferation, oxidative phosphorylation, and chromatin remodeling contrasting the dominant enrichment for genes related to inflammation and a senescence-associated secretory of male EC. Similar sex-biased phenotypes of adipose EC were detectable in a dataset of aged EC. The highly proliferative phenotype of female EC was observed also in culture conditions. In turn, male EC displayed greater inflammatory potential than female EC in culture, based on basal and tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated patterns of gene expression.

TETs can be divided mainly into thymomas, thymic carcinomas, and the rarest ad aggressive neuroendocrine forms. Despite the surgical resection is quite resolving, the diagnosis of TETs is complicated by the absence of symptoms and the clinical presentation aggravated by several paraneoplastic disorders, including myasthenia gravis. Thus, the heterogeneity of TETs prompts the search for molecular biomarkers that could be helpful for tumor characterization and clinical outcomes prediction. With these aims, several researchers investigated the epigenetic profiles of TETs. In this manuscript, we narratively review the works investigating the deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms in TETs, highlighting the need for further studies combining genetic, epigenetic, and expression data to better characterize the different molecular subtypes and identify, for each of them, the most relevant epigenetic biomarkers of clinical utility."

Current studies have confirmed that omics data at the host level can reflect the development process and prognosis of the disease. Since early diagnosis and effective treatment of severe COVID-19 patients remains challenging, this research aims to use omics data in different ML models for COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis. We used several ML models on omics data of a large number of individuals to first predict whether patients are COVID-19 positive or negative, followed by the severity of the disease.On the COVID-19 diagnosis task, we got the best AUC of 0.99 with our multilayer perceptron model and the highest F1-score of 0.95 with our logistic regression (LR) model. For the severity prediction task, we achieved the highest accuracy of 0.76 with an LR model. Beyond classification and predictive modeling, our study founds ML models performed better on integrated multi-omics data, rather than single omics. By comparing top features from different omics dataset, we also found the robustness of our model, with a wider range of applicability in diverse dataset related to COVID-19. Additionally, we have found that omics-based models performed better than image or physiological feature-based models, proving the importance of the omics-based dataset for future model development.This study diagnoses COVID-19 positive cases and predicts accurate severity levels. It lowers the dependence on clinical data and professional judgment, by leveraging the utilization of state-of-the-art models. our model showed wider applicability across different omics dataset, which is highly transferable in other respiratory or similar diseases.

Sensitivity analyses incorporating multiple complementary MR methods were applied to evaluate how strong the association was and identify potential pleiotropy.MR analyses utilized 81 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for T1DM. The evidence supports a significant causal relationship between T1DM and increased risk of IgAN [odds ratio (OR): 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.74 for IVW, p < 0.05]. The association still exists after adjusting for triglyceride (TG), fasting insulin (FI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). MVMR analysis indicated that the effect of T1DM on IgAN vanished upon accounting for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c; OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.90-1.05, p > 0.05).This MR study provided evidence that T1DM may be a risk factor for the onset of IgAN, which might be driven by LDL-c. Lipid-lowering strategies targeting LDL-c should be enhanced in patients with T1DM to prevent IgAN.Copyright © 2022 Deng, Li, Yi and Leng."
"36671403","Non-Coding RNAs in the Regulation of Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Potential Treatment Targets for Related Disorders.","Biomolecules","Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including miRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs, and piRNAs, do not encode proteins. Nonetheless, they have critical roles in a variety of cellular activities-such as development, neurogenesis, degeneration, and the response to injury to the nervous system-via protein translation, RNA splicing, gene activation, silencing, modifications, and editing; thus, they may serve as potential targets for disease treatment. The activity of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus critically influences hippocampal function, including learning, memory, and emotion. ncRNAs have been shown to be involved in the regulation of hippocampal neurogenesis, including proliferation, differentiation, and migration of NSCs and synapse formation. The interaction among ncRNAs is complex and diverse and has become a major topic within the life science. This review outlines advances in research on the roles of ncRNAs in modulating NSC bioactivity in the hippocampus and discusses their potential applications in the treatment of illnesses affecting the hippocampus."

ENO1 has been associated with various biological characteristics of CRC. This study aimed to investigate the function of ENO1 in regulating 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance in CRC.ENO1 level in 120 pairs of tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry, and the correlation between ENO1 expression and prognosis was explored by survival analysis. Its role and potential mechanisms in regulating 5-FU resistance in CRC were studied by Western blotting, MTT assay, colony formation assay and transwell invasion assay. Murine xenograft assay was implied to verify the resultsin vivo.Our study indicated that ENO1 was elevated in CRC tissues and was associated with poor patient prognosis. High levels of ENO1 expression were detected as a significant influencing factor for overall survival. Furthermore, ENO1 expression was found to have increased in drug-resistant cells (HCT116/5-FU and SW620/5-FU) constructed by increasing concentrations of 5-FU. Knockdown of ENO1 markedly increased the drug susceptibility and inhibited the proliferation and migration ability of HCT116/5-FU and SW620/5-FU cells. It was found that down-regulation of ENO1 inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) signaling process. Finally, a murine xenograft assay verified that the depletion of ENO1 alleviated 5-FU resistance.This study identified that ENO1 regulated 5-FU resistance via the EMT pathway and may be a novel target in the prevention and treatment of 5-FUresistant CRC.Copyright © 2022 Gu, Zhong, Wang, Ni, Zhao, Wang, Yao, Jiang, Wang and Zhu."

Due to the lack of specific early symptoms, many patients with AAD are often overlooked or misdiagnosed, which is undoubtedly catastrophic for patients. The particular pathogenic mechanism of AAD is yet unknown, which makes clinical pharmacological therapy extremely difficult. Therefore, it is necessary and crucial to find and employ unique biomarkers for Acute aortic dissection (AAD) as soon as possible in clinical practice and research. This will aid in the early detection of AAD and give clear guidelines for the creation of focused treatment agents. This goal has been made attainable over the past 20 years by the quick advancement of omics technologies and the development of high-throughput tissue specimen biomarker screening. The primary histology data support and add to one another to create a more thorough and three-dimensional picture of the disease. Based on the introduction of the main histology technologies, in this review, we summarize the current situation and most recent developments in the application of multi-omics technologies to AAD biomarker discovery and emphasize the significance of concentrating on integration concepts for integrating multi-omics data. In this context, we seek to offer fresh concepts and recommendations for fundamental investigation, perspective innovation, and therapeutic development in AAD.Copyright © 2022 Hao, Cheng, Jiang and Xin."
"36631516","Single-nuclei transcriptomics enable detection of somatic variants in patient brain tissue.","Sci Rep","Somatic variants are a major cause of human disease, including neurological disorders like focal epilepsies, but can be challenging to study due to their mosaicism in bulk tissue biopsies. Coupling single-cell genotype and transcriptomic data has potential to provide insight into the role somatic variants play in disease etiology, such as by determining what cell types are affected or how the mutations affect gene expression. Here, we asked whether commonly used single-nucleus 3'- or 5'-RNA-sequencing assays can be used to derive single-nucleus genotype data for a priori known variants that are located near to either end of a transcript. To that end, we compared performance of commercially available single-nuclei 3'- and 5'- gene expression kits using resected brain samples from three pediatric patients with focal epilepsy. We quantified the ability to detect genetic variants in single-nucleus datasets depending on distance from the transcript end. Finally, we demonstrated the ability to identify affected cell types in a patient with a RHEB somatic variant causing an epilepsy-associated cortical malformation. Our results demonstrate that single-nuclei 3' or 5'-RNA-sequencing data can be used to identify known somatic variants in single-nuclei when they are expressed within proximity to a transcript end.© 2023.

DNA methylation changes occur early in tumorigenesis and are widespread, making cfDNA methylation an attractive cancer biomarker. Already a proven technology for targeted genome sequencing, hybridization probe capture is emerging as a method for high-throughput targeted methylation profiling suitable to liquid biopsy samples. However, to date there are no reports describing the performance of this approach in terms of reproducibility, scalability, and accuracy. In the current study we performed hybridization probe capture using the myBaits®Custom Methyl-seq kit on 172 plasma samples and standards to evaluate its performance on cfDNA methylation analysis. The myBaits®assay showed high target recovery (>90%), demonstrated excellent reproducibility between captures (R2 = 0.92 on average), and was unaffected by increasing the number of targets in a capture. Finally, myBaits®accurately replicated 'gold standard' beta values from WGBS (averageR2 = 0.79). The results of this study show that custom targeted methylation sequencing with myBaits®offers a cost-effective, reliable platform to profile DNA methylation at a set of discrete custom regions, with potential applicability to liquid biopsies for cancer monitoring.© The Author(s) 2022.

Although the onset of psychosis can be related to any medical condition, most cases of psychosis are not fully understood. Psychosis may manifest for the first time during pregnancy, which is detrimental to maternofetal well-being. The impact of having a first episode of psychosis during pregnancy on the placenta has not yet been explored. Oxidative stress is thought to take part in the etiopathogenesis of this complex disorder, and this condition can also affect the placenta as it is highly sensitive to changes in the maternal environment. In this sense, the aim of the present work was to study the gene and protein expression through RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, of oxidative stress markers (NOX-1, NOX-2, iNOS, eNOS and PARP) in the placental tissue of women who underwent a first episode of psychosis during pregnancy (FE-PW) in comparison to healthy pregnant women. Our results showed augmented gene and protein expression of NOX-1, NOX-2, iNOS and PARP in the placental tissue of FE-PW. For the first time, we demonstrated that oxidative stress may have an important pathophysiological role in this tissue, aiding in explaining the impact of psychosis on pregnancy and the need for future studies in this field to guide better clinical management of these patients."

In this study, the differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in neuroblastoma were identified and analyzed using bioinformatics, and their biological functions and related signaling pathways were examined.The neuroblastoma miRNA chip GSE121513 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the data of 95 neuroblastoma samples and normal fetal adrenal neuroblastoma samples were analyzed to screen the differential miRNAs. The target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted using |log fold change (FC)| ≥4. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses were performed to construct a protein-protein interaction network and identify the core target genes.A total of 91 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified (P<0.05, |logFC| ≥1), including 52 upregulated and 39 downregulated miRNAs. The target genes of the differential miRNAs (P<0.05, |logFC| ≥4) were pretested, and 602 target genes were obtained. Functional analysis showed that these genes were mainly located in the extracellular matrix region of proteins, and were involved in the negative regulation of cytoplasmic translation, mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR) binding, and binding to nucleic acid to inhibit the activity of translation factors. They were also involved in RNA degradation, adhesion pathways, and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway.

"36672180","A Multi-Trait Association Analysis of Brain Disorders and Platelet Traits Identifies Novel Susceptibility Loci for Major Depression, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease.","Cells","Among candidate neurodegenerative/neuropsychiatric risk-predictive biomarkers, platelet count, mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width have been associated with the risk of major depressive disorder (MDD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) through epidemiological and genomic studies, suggesting partial co-heritability. We exploited these relationships for a multi-trait association analysis, using publicly available summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of all traits reported above. Gene-based enrichment tests were carried out, as well as a network analysis of significantly enriched genes. We analyzed 4,540,326 single nucleotide polymorphisms shared among the analyzed GWASs, observing 149 genome-wide significant multi-trait LD-independent associations (p&lt; 5 × 10-8) for AD, 70 for PD and 139 for MDD. Among these, 27 novel associations were detected for AD, 34 for PD and 40 for MDD. Out of 18,781 genes with annotated variants within ±10 kb, 62 genes were enriched for associations with AD, 70 with PD and 125 with MDD (p&lt; 2.7 × 10-6). Of these, seven genes were novel susceptibility loci for AD (EPPK1, TTLL1, PACSIN2, TPM4, PIF1, ZNF689, AZGP1P1), two for PD (SLC26A1, EFNA3) and two for MDD (HSPH1,TRMT61A). The resulting network showed a significant excess of interactions (enrichmentp= 1.0 × 10-16). The novel genes that were identified are involved in the organization of cytoskeletal architecture (EPPK1,TTLL1,PACSIN2,TPM4), telomere shortening (PIF1), the regulation of cellular aging (ZNF689,AZGP1P1) and neurodevelopment (EFNA3), thus, providing novel insights into the shared underlying biology of brain disorders and platelet parameters."
"36653562","FinnGen provides genetic insights from a well-phenotyped isolated population.","Nature","Population isolates such as those in Finland benefit genetic research because deleterious alleles are often concentrated on a small number of low-frequency variants (0.1% ≤ minor allele frequency < 5%). These variants survived the founding bottleneck rather than being distributed over a large number of ultrarare variants. Although this effect is well established in Mendelian genetics, its value in common disease genetics is less explored1,2. FinnGen aims to study the genome and national health register data of 500,000 Finnish individuals. Given the relatively high median age of participants (63 years) and the substantial fraction of hospital-based recruitment, FinnGen is enriched for disease end points. Here we analyse data from 224,737 participants from FinnGen and study 15 diseases that have previously been investigated in large genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We also include meta-analyses of biobank data from Estonia and the United Kingdom. We identified 30 new associations, primarily low-frequency variants, enriched in the Finnish population. A GWAS of 1,932 diseases also identified 2,733 genome-wide significant associations (893 phenome-wide significant (PWS), P < 2.6 × 10-11) at 2,496 (771 PWS) independent loci with 807 (247 PWS) end points. Among these, fine-mapping implicated 148 (73 PWS) coding variants associated with 83 (42 PWS) end points. Moreover, 91 (47 PWS) had an allele frequency of <5% in non-Finnish European individuals, of which 62 (32 PWS) were enriched by more than twofold in Finland. These findings demonstrate the power of bottlenecked populations to find entry points into the biology of common diseases through low-frequency, high impact variants.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Growing evidence that SNAIL and ZEB transcription factors, typically portrayed as master regulators of EMT, may be dispensable for this process, led us to re-investigate its mechanistic underpinnings. For this, we used an unbiased computational approach that integrated time-resolved analyses of chromatin structure and differential gene expression, to predict transcriptional regulators of TGFβ1-inducible EMT in the MCF10A mammary epithelial cell line model. Bioinformatic analyses indicated comparatively minor contributions of SNAIL proteins and ZEB1 to TGFβ1-induced EMT, whereas the AP-1 subunit JUNB was anticipated to have a much larger impact. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function studies confirmed that TGFβ1-induced EMT proceeded independently of SNAIL proteins and ZEB1. In contrast, JUNB was necessary and sufficient for EMT in MCF10A cells, but not in A549 lung cancer cells, indicating cell-type-specificity of JUNB EMT-regulatory capacity. Nonetheless, the JUNB-dependence of EMT-associated transcriptional reprogramming in MCF10A cells allowed to define a gene expression signature which was regulated by TGFβ1 in diverse cellular backgrounds, showed positively correlated expression with TGFβ signaling in multiple cancer transcriptomes, and was predictive of patient survival in several cancer types. Altogether, our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the context-dependent control of TGFβ1-driven EMT and thereby may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic options."

In a subgroup of 20 preclinical samples collected five years prior MPM diagnosis, we observed an upregulation of miR-11400 (fold change (FC) = 2.6, adjustedp-value = 0.01), miR-148a-3p (FC = 1.5,p-value = 0.001), and miR-409-3p (FC = 1.5,p-value = 0.04) relative to matched controls. The 3-miRNA panel showed a good classification capacity with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.81 (specificity = 0.75, sensitivity = 0.70). The diagnostic ability of the model was also evaluated in an independent retrospective cohort, yielding a higher predictive power (AUC = 0.86).

The Epigenetics for WomEn (EpiWE) project is a multidisciplinary pilot study that intends to investigate the epigenetic signatures associated with intimate partner and sexual violence-induced stress-related disorders.In 2020, 62 women exposed to violence (13 women suffering from sexual violence and 49 from Intimate Partner Violence, IPV) and 50 women with no history of violence were recruited at the Service for Sexual and Domestic Violence. All women aged 18-65 were monitored for their physical and psychological conditions. Blood samples were collected, and DNAs were extracted and underwent the epigenetic analysis of 10 stress-related genes.PTSD prevalence in victims was assessed at 8.1%. Quantitative methylation evaluation of the ten selected trauma/stress-related genes revealed the differential iper-methylation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, dopamine receptor D2 and insulin-like growth factor 2 genes. These genes are among those related to brain plasticity, learning, and memory pathways.The association of early detection of posttraumatic distress and epigenetic marker identification could represent a new avenue for addressing women survivors toward resilience.

Endoscopy and serological tumor marker testing are currently the main methods of GC screening, and treatment relies on surgical resection or chemotherapy. However, traditional examination and treatment methods are more harmful to patients and less sensitive and accurate. A minimally invasive method to respond to GC early screening, prognosis monitoring, treatment efficacy, and drug resistance situations is urgently needed. As a result, liquid biopsy techniques have received much attention in the clinical application of GC. The non-invasive liquid biopsy technique requires fewer samples, is reproducible, and can guide individualized patient treatment by monitoring patients' molecular-level changes in real-time. In this review, we introduced the clinical applications of circulating tumor cells, circulating free DNA, circulating tumor DNA, non-coding RNAs, exosomes, and proteins, which are the primary markers in liquid biopsy technology in GC.

Thus, targeting epigenetic modifiers to remodel the immune microenvironment holds great potential as an integral part of anticancer regimens. In this review, we summarize the epigenetic profiles and key epigenetic modifiers in individual immune cell types that define the functional coordinates of tumor permissive and non-permissive immune landscapes.

In recent years, numerous geroprotectors, senolytics, and other nutraceuticals have emerged as potential disruptors of aging and may be viable interventions in the immediate state of human longevity science. In this review, we focus on the decrease in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) with age and the supplementation of NAD+ precursors, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or nicotinamide riboside (NR), in combination with other geroprotective compounds, to restore NAD+ levels present in youth. Furthermore, these geroprotectors may enhance the efficacy of NMN supplementation while concurrently providing their own numerous health benefits. By analyzing the prevention of NAD+ degradation through the inhibition of CD38 or supporting protective downstream agents of SIRT1, we provide a potential framework of the CD38/NAD+/SIRT1 axis through which geroprotectors may enhance the efficacy of NAD+ precursor supplementation and reduce the risk of age-related diseases, thereby potentiating healthspan in humans."

Computational analysis of medical images, moreover, can allow the discovery of disease patterns and correlations among cohorts of patients with the same disease, thus suggesting common causes or providing useful information for better therapies and cures. Machine learning and deep learning applied to medical images, in particular, have produced new, unprecedented results that can pave the way to advanced frontiers of medical discoveries. While computational analysis of medical images has become easier, however, the possibility to make mistakes or generate inflated or misleading results has become easier, too, hindering reproducibility and deployment. In this article, we provide ten quick tips to perform computational analysis of medical images avoiding common mistakes and pitfalls that we noticed in multiple studies in the past.

Among 2,297 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), each doubling of serum SLPI was independently associated with incident HF (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.02-3.02; P = 0.04), particularly incident HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; HR 2.44; 95% CI 1.23-4.84; P = 0.01) but not HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.36-2.46; P = 0.91). Previously reported circulating SLPI protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) were not associated with serum SLPI levels or incident HF among MESA participants. In conclusion, baseline serum SLPI levels, but not genetically-determined serum SLPI, were significantly associated with incident HF and HFpEF over long-term follow-up in a multi-ethnic cohort.

We sought to investigate the role of epigenetic modifications beside genetic alterations in the MEFV gene in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). The study comprised 63 FMF patients diagnosed according to the Tel Hashomer criteria: 37 (58.7%) colchicine-responders, 26 (41.3%) non-responders, and 19 matched healthy controls. MEFV mutations were detected using a CE/IVD-labeled 4-230 FMF strip assay. DNA methylation of MEFV gene exon 2 was measured using bisulfite modification and related to pyrin level, phenotypic picture, MEFV mutations, disease severity, serum amyloid A (SAA), CRP, ESR, disease severity, and colchicine response. Our results showed that FMF patients exhibited significantly higher methylation percentage (p&lt; 0.001) and lower pyrin levels (p&lt; 0.001) compared to the control. The MEFV gene M694I mutation was the most commonly reported mutation (p&lt; 0.004). High methylation percentage of the MEFV exon 2 and low pyrin concentration were correlated with disease severity, high SAA, ESR levels, H-pylori, and renal calculi. In conclusion, this study highlights the relation between high methylation percentage, reduced pyrin level, and different biomarkers in FMF, which underscores their role in the pathogenesis of FMF and could be considered as potential therapeutic targets."

"36678154","Revisiting One-Carbon Metabolites in Human Breast Milk: Focus on S-Adenosylmethionine.","Nutrients","Breastfeeding is the gold standard for early nutrition. Metabolites from the one-carbon metabolism pool are crucial for infant development. The aim of this study is to compare the breast-milk one-carbon metabolic profile to other biofluids where these metabolites are present, including cord and adult blood plasma as well as cerebrospinal fluid. Breast milk (n= 142), cord blood plasma (n= 23), maternal plasma (n= 28), aging adult plasma (n= 91), cerebrospinal fluid (n= 92), and infant milk formula (n= 11) samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS to quantify choline, betaine, methionine, S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, total homocysteine, and cystathionine. Differences between groups were visualized by principal component analysis and analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test. Correlation analysis was performed between one-carbon metabolites in human breast milk. Principal component analysis based on these metabolites separated breast milk samples from other biofluids. The S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) concentration was significantly higher in breast milk compared to the other biofluids and was absent in infant milk formulas. Despite many significant correlations between metabolites in one-carbon metabolism, there were no significant correlations between SAM and methionine or total homocysteine. Together, our data indicate a high concentration of SAM in breast milk, which may suggest a strong demand for this metabolite during infant early growth while its absence in infant milk formulas may indicate the inadequacy of this vital metabolic nutrient."
"36589292","Telomere length analysis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using large-scale whole genome sequence data.","Front Cell Neurosci","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to progressive weakness of voluntary muscles, with death following from neuromuscular respiratory failure, typically within 3 to 5 years. There is a strong genetic contribution to ALS risk. In 10% or more, a family history of ALS or frontotemporal dementia is obtained, and the Mendelian genes responsible for ALS in such families have now been identified in about 50% of cases. Only about 14% of apparently sporadic ALS is explained by known genetic variation, suggesting that other forms of genetic variation are important. Telomeres maintain DNA integrity during cellular replication, differ between sexes, and shorten naturally with age. Sex and age are risk factors for ALS and we therefore investigated telomere length in ALS.Samples were from Project MinE, an international ALS whole genome sequencing consortium that includes phenotype data. For validation we used donated brain samples from motor cortex from people with ALS and controls. Ancestry and relatedness were evaluated by principal components analysis and relationship matrices of DNA microarray data. Whole genome sequence data were from Illumina HiSeq platforms and aligned using the Isaac pipeline. TelSeq was used to quantify telomere length using whole genome sequence data. We tested the association of telomere length with ALS and ALS survival using Cox regression.There were 6,580 whole genome sequences, reducing to 6,195 samples (4,315 from people with ALS and 1,880 controls) after quality control, and 159 brain samples (106 ALS, 53 controls). Accounting for age and sex, there was a 20% (95% CI 14%, 25%) increase of telomere length in people with ALS compared to controls (p = 1.1 × 10-12), validated in the brain samples (p = 0.03). Those with shorter telomeres had a 10% increase in median survival (p = 5.0×10-7). Although there was no difference in telomere length between sporadic ALS and familial ALS (p=0.64), telomere length in 334 people with ALS due to expandedC9orf72repeats was shorter than in those without expandedC9orf72repeats (p = 5.0×10-4).Although telomeres shorten with age, longer telomeres are a risk factor for ALS and worsen prognosis. Longer telomeres are associated with ALS.Copyright © 2022 Al Khleifat, Iacoangeli, Jones, van Vugt, Moisse, Shatunov, Zwamborn, van der Spek, Cooper-Knock, Topp, van Rheenen, Kenna, Van Eijk, Kenna, Byrne, López, Opie-Martin, Vural, Campos, Weber, Smith, Fogh, Silani, Morrison, Dobson, van Es, McLaughlin, Vourc’h, Chio, Corcia, de Carvalho, Gotkine, Panades, Mora, Shaw, Landers, Glass, Shaw, Basak, Hardiman, Robberecht, Van Damme, van den Berg, Veldink and Al-Chalabi."
"36590400","Application of data integration for rice bacterial strain selection by combining their osmotic stress response and plant growth-promoting traits.","Front Microbiol","Agricultural application of plant-beneficial bacteria to improve crop yield and alleviate the stress caused by environmental conditions, pests, and pathogens is gaining popularity. However, before using these bacterial strains in plant experiments, their environmental stress responses and plant health improvement potential should be examined. In this study, we explored the applicability of three unsupervised machine learning-based data integration methods, including principal component analysis (PCA) of concatenated data, multiple co-inertia analysis (MCIA), and multiple kernel learning (MKL), to select osmotic stress-tolerant plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacterial strains isolated from the rice phyllosphere. The studied datasets consisted of direct and indirect PGP activity measurements and osmotic stress responses of eight bacterial strains previously isolated from the phyllosphere of drought-tolerant rice cultivar. The production of phytohormones, such as indole-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA), abscisic acid (ABA), and cytokinin, were used as direct PGP traits, whereas the production of hydrogen cyanide and siderophore and antagonistic activity against the foliar pathogensPyricularia oryzaeandHelminthosporium oryzaewere evaluated as measures of indirect PGP activity. The strains were subjected to a range of osmotic stress levels by adding PEG 6000 (0, 11, 21, and 32.6%) to their growth medium. The results of the osmotic stress response experiments showed that all bacterial strains accumulated endogenous proline and glycine betaine (GB) and exhibited an increase in growth, when osmotic stress levels were increased to a specific degree, while the production of IAA and GA considerably decreased. The three applied data integration methods did not provide a similar grouping of the strains. Especially deviant was the ordination of microbial strains based on the PCA of concatenated data. However, all three data integration methods indicated that the strainsBacillus altitudinisPB46 andB.megateriumPB50 shared high similarity in PGP traits and osmotic stress response. Overall, our results indicate that data integration methods complement the single-table data analysis approach and improve the selection process for PGP microbial strains.Copyright © 2022 Devarajan, Truu, Gopalasubramaniam, Muthukrishanan and Truu."
"36675402","Identification of a Novel Non-Canonical Splice-Site Variant in ABCD1.","J Clin Med","Cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) is a fatal genetic disease characterized by rapid, devastating neurological decline, with a narrow curative treatment window in the early stage. Non-canonical splice-site (NCSS) variants can easily be missed during genomic DNA analyses, and only a few of them inABCD1have been explored. Here, we studied a Chinese patient with clinical features similar to those of early-stage CALD but with a negative molecular diagnosis and a sibling who had presumably died of CALD. Trio-based whole-exome sequencing (trio-WES) and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed a novel hemizygote NCSS variant c.901-25_901-9 del inABCD1intron 1, resulting in a complex splicing pattern. The in vitro minigene assay revealed that the c.901-25_901-9 del construct contained two aberrant transcripts that caused skipping of exon 2 and a small 48-bp deletion on left of the same exon. We identified a novel NCSS variant, that extends the spectrum of the knownABCD1variants, and demonstrated the pathogenicity of this gene variant. Our findings highlight the importance of combining RNA-Seq and WES techniques for prompt diagnosis of leukodystrophy with NCSS variants."
"36675087","Minigene Splicing Assays and Long-Read Sequencing to Unravel Pathogenic Deep-Intronic Variants in PAX6 in Congenital Aniridia.","Int J Mol Sci","PAX6haploinsufficiency causes aniridia, a congenital eye disorder that involves the iris, and foveal hypoplasia. Comprehensive screening of thePAX6 locus, including the non-coding regions, by next-generation sequencing revealed four deep-intronic variants with potential effects on pre-RNA splicing. Nevertheless, without a functional analysis, their pathogenicity could not be established. We aimed to decipher their impact on the canonicalPAX6splicing using in vitro minigene splicing assays and nanopore-based long-read sequencing. Two multi-exonicPAX6constructs were generated, and minigene assays were carried out. An aberrant splicing pattern was observed for two variants in intron 6, c.357+136G&gt;A and c.357+334G&gt;A. In both cases, several exonization events, such as pseudoexon inclusions and partial intronic retention, were observed due to the creation or activation of new/cryptic non-canonical splicing sites, including a shared intronic donor site. In contrast, two variants identified in intron 11, c.1032+170A&gt;T and c.1033-275A&gt;C, seemed not to affect splicing processes. We confirmed the high complexity of alternative splicing ofPAX6exon 6, which also involves unreported cryptic intronic sites. Our study highlights the importance of integrating functional studies into diagnostic algorithms to decipher the potential implication of non-coding variants, usually classified as variants of unknown significance, thus allowing variant reclassification to achieve a conclusive genetic diagnosis."
"36673688","Perception of Social and Educational Quality of Life of Minors Diagnosed with Rare Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","This study explores the perception of social and educational quality of life in minors with rare diseases (RDs). Two meta-analyses were performed, applying the random effects model. Results: Regarding the social Quality of Life, the meta-sample consisted of k = 40 samples, with a total population of 1943 children (mean age = 9.42 years), of whom 687 (35.3%) were girls, 615 (31.4%) were boys and 641 (33%) did not report their sex. The effect size was large (mean size = 7.68;p&lt; 0.000; 99% Confidence Interval; lower limit = 7.22; upper limit = 8.14). The results of the meta-regression and model analysis showed the importance of the measurement instrument (Paediatric Quality-of-Life Inventory and Prototypes of the Quality of life) and the dissimilarity of perception among caregivers. The nationality and the type of RD were not relevant. With respect to the educational Quality of Life, the meta-sample consisted of k = 19 samples, with 699 minors (mean age = 10.3 years), of whom 266 (38%) were girls, 242 (34.6%) were boys and 191 (27.4%) did not report their sex. The effect size was large (mean size = 7.15;p&lt; 0.000; 99% CI; lower limit = 6.35; upper limit = 7.94). The meta-regression and comparison of models showed that the type of RD was essential. The measurement instrument was a moderating variable, especially the Parent version Paediatric Quality-of-Life Inventory. This study reveals the need for further research on RDs and their social-educational effects."
"36590101","Integrating nutriepigenomics in Parkinson's disease management: New promising strategy in the omics era.","IBRO Neurosci Rep","Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most prevalent brain motor disorder and is frequently regarded as an idiopathic and sporadic disease due to its unclear etiology. Although the pathological mechanisms of PD have already been investigated at various omics levels, no disease-modifying drugs are currently available. At the moment, treatments can only provide symptomatic relief to control or improve motor symptoms. Parkinson's disease is a multifactorial disease, the development and progression of which are influenced by multiple factors, including the genetic markups and the environment. As an indispensable component of our daily life, nutrition is considered one of the most robust environmental factors affecting our health. Consequently, depending on our dietary habits, nutrition can either induce or reduce our susceptibility to PD. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) activity. Accumulating evidence from nutriepigenomics studies has reported altered epigenetic mechanisms in clinical and pre-clinical PD models, and the potential role of nutrition in modifying the changes. In addition, through nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics studies, the diet-gene, and gene-diet interactions concerning PD development and progression have been investigated. Herein, current findings on the roles of nutrition in epigenetic mechanisms underpinning PD development and progression are discussed. Recent advancements in the multi-omics approach in PD nutrition research are also underlined. The ability of nutrients to influence epigenetic mechanisms and the availability of multi-omics applications compel the immediate use of personalized nutrition as adjuvant therapy for PD.© 2022 The Authors."
"36671395","Encouraging Tactics with Genetically Modified Probiotics to Improve Immunity for the Prevention of Immune-Related Diseases including Cardio-Metabolic Disorders.","Biomolecules","The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway may play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes mellitus, as well as metabolic syndromes, which could also be risk factors for cardio-metabolic disorders. Consistently, it has been shown that beneficial effects may be convoyed by the modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway against the development of these diseases. Importantly, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway can be modulated by probiotics. Probiotics have a variety of beneficial properties, with the potential of treating specific diseases such as immune-related diseases, which are valuable to human health. In addition, an increasing body of work in the literature emphasized the contribution of genetically modified probiotics. There now seems to be a turning point in the research of probiotics. A better understanding of the interactions between microbiota, lifestyle, and host factors such as genetics and/or epigenetics might lead to a novel therapeutic approach with probiotics for these diseases. This study might provide a theoretical reference for the development of genetically modified probiotics in health products and/or in functional foods for the treatment of cardio-metabolic disorders."
"36612091","Potential Impact of Preoperative Circulating Biomarkers on Individual Escalating/de-Escalating Strategies in Early Breast Cancer.","Cancers (Basel)","The research on non-invasive circulating biomarkers to guide clinical decision is in wide expansion, including the earliest disease settings. Several new intensification/de-intensification strategies are approaching clinical practice, personalizing the treatment for each patient. Moreover, liquid biopsy is revealing its potential with multiple techniques and studies available on circulating biomarkers in the preoperative phase. Inflammatory circulating cells, circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell-free DNA (cfDNA), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and other biological biomarkers are improving the armamentarium for treatment selection. Defining the escalation and de-escalation of treatments is a mainstay of personalized medicine in early breast cancer. In this review, we delineate the studies investigating the possible application of these non-invasive tools to give a more enlightened approach to escalating/de-escalating strategies in early breast cancer."

"36614211","Blood Plasma Proteome: A Meta-Analysis of the Results of Protein Quantification in Human Blood by Targeted Mass Spectrometry.","Int J Mol Sci","A meta-analysis of the results of targeted quantitative screening of human blood plasma was performed to generate a reference standard kit that can be used for health analytics. The panel included 53 of the 296 proteins that form a ""stable"" part of the proteome of a healthy individual; these proteins were found in at least 70% of samples and were characterized by an interindividual coefficient of variation &lt;40%. The concentration range of the selected proteins was 10-10-10-3M and enrichment analysis revealed their association with rare familial diseases. The concentration of ceruloplasmin was reduced by approximately three orders of magnitude in patients with neurological disorders compared to healthy volunteers, and those of gelsolin isoform 1 and complement factor H were abruptly reduced in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Absolute quantitative data of the individual proteome of a healthy and diseased individual can be used as the basis for personalized medicine and health monitoring. Storage over time allows us to identify individual biomarkers in the molecular landscape and prevent pathological conditions."
