links between genetic variation and
complex traits",Nat Genet,"Studies of DNA methylation (DNAm) in solid human tissues are relatively scarce; tissue-specific characterization of DNAm is needed to understand its role in gene regulation and its relevance to complex traits. We generated array-based DNAm profiles for 987 human samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, representing 9 tissue types and 424 subjects. We characterized methylome and transcriptome correlations (eQTMs), genetic regulation in cis (mQTLs and eQTLs) across tissues and e/mQTLs links to complex traits. We identified mQTLs for 286,152 CpG sites, many of which (>5%) show tissue specificity, and mQTL colocalizations with 2,254 distinct GWAS hits across 83 traits. For 91% of these loci, a candidate gene link was identified by integration of functional maps, including eQTMs, and/or eQTL colocalization, but only 33% of loci involved an eQTL and mQTL present in the same tissue type. With this DNAm-focused integrative analysis, we contribute to the understanding of molecular regulatory mechanisms in human tissues and their impact on complex traits."
matt,dnam age,36638792,Loss of epigenetic information as a cause of mammalian aging,Cell,"All living things experience an increase in entropy, manifested as a loss of genetic and epigenetic information. In yeast, epigenetic information is lost over time due to the relocalization of chromatin-modifying proteins to DNA breaks, causing cells to lose their identity, a hallmark of yeast aging. Using a system called ""ICE"" (inducible changes to the epigenome), we find that the act of faithful DNA repair advances aging at physiological, cognitive, and molecular levels, including erosion of the epigenetic landscape, cellular exdifferentiation, senescence, and advancement of the DNA methylation clock, which can be reversed by OSK-mediated rejuvenation. These data are consistent with the information theory of aging, which states that a loss of epigenetic information is a reversible cause of aging."
matt,epigenetics,36471057,Deciphering the mechanical code of the genome and epigenome,Nat Struct Mol Biol,"Diverse DNA-deforming processes are impacted by the local mechanical and structural properties of DNA, which in turn depend on local sequence and epigenetic modifications. Deciphering this mechanical code (that is, this dependence) has been challenging due to the lack of high-throughput experimental methods. Here we present a comprehensive characterization of the mechanical code. Utilizing high-throughput measurements of DNA bendability via loop-seq, we quantitatively established how the occurrence and spatial distribution of dinucleotides, tetranucleotides and methylated CpG impact DNA bendability. We used our measurements to develop a physical model for the sequence and methylation dependence of DNA bendability. We validated the model by performing loop-seq on mouse genomic sequences around transcription start sites and CTCF-binding sites. We applied our model to test the predictions of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and to demonstrate that sequence and epigenetic modifications can mechanically encode regulatory information in diverse contexts."
matt,ewas,36719767,Epigenome-wide association study reveals CpG sites associated with thyroid function and regulatory effects on KLF9.,Thyroid,"Thyroid hormones play a key role in differentiation and metabolism, and are known regulators of gene expression through both genomic and epigenetic processes including DNA methylation. The aim of this study was to examine associations between thyroid hormones and DNA methylation.We carried out a fixed-effect meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association study of blood DNA methylation sites from 8 cohorts from the ThyroidOmics Consortium, incorporating up to 7,073 participants of both European and African ancestry, implementing a discovery and replication stage. Statistical analyses were conducted using normalized beta CpG values as dependent and log-transformed thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine levels, respectively, as independent variable in a linear model. The replicated findings were correlated with gene expression levels in whole-blood, and tested for causal influence of TSH and free thyroxine by two-sample Mendelian randomization.Epigenome-wide significant associations (p-value < 1.1E-7) of 3 CpGs for free thyroxine, 5 for free triiodothyronine, and 2 for TSH concentrations were discovered and replicated (combined p-values = 1.5E-9 to 4.3E-28). The associations included CpG sites annotated to KLF9 (cg00049440) and DOT1L (cg04173586) that overlap with all three traits, consistent with hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis physiology. Significant associations were also found for CpGs in FKBP5 for free thyroxine, and at CSNK1D/LINCO1970 and LRRC8D for free triiodothyronine. Mendelian randomization analyses supported a causal effect of thyroid status on DNA methylation of KLF9. DNA methylation of cg00049440 in KLF9 was inversely correlated with KLF9 gene expression in blood. The CpG at CSNK1D/LINC01970 overlapped with thyroid hormone receptor alpha binding peaks in liver cells. The total additive heritability of the methylation levels of the six significant CpG sites was between 25% and 57%. Significant methylation QTLs were identified for CpGs at KLF9, FKBP5, LRRC8D and CSNK1D/LINC01970.We report novel associations between TSH, thyroid hormones and blood-based DNA methylation. This study advances our understanding of thyroid hormone action particularly related to KLF9, and serves as a proof-of-concept that integrations of EWAS with other -omics data can provide a valuable tool for unravelling thyroid hormone signaling in humans by complementing and feeding classical in-vitro and animal studies."
matt,tandem repeats,36577521,Genome-wide evaluation of the effect of short tandem repeat variation on local DNA methylation,Genome Res,"Short tandem repeats (STRs) contribute significantly to genetic diversity in humans, including disease-causing variation. While the effect of STR variation on gene expression has been extensively assessed, their impact on epigenetics has been poorly studied and limited to specific genomic regions. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that some STRs act as independent regulators of local DNA methylation in the human genome, and modify risk of common human traits. To address these questions, we first analyzed two independent datasets comprising PCR-free whole genome sequencing (WGS) and genome-wide DNA methylation levels derived from whole blood samples in 245 (discovery cohort) and 484 individuals (replication cohort). Utilizing genotypes for 131,635 polymorphic STRs derived from WGS using HipSTR, we identified 11,870 STRs that associated with DNA methylation levels (mSTRs) of 11,774 CpGs (Bonferroni p<0.001) in our discovery cohort, with 90% successfully replicating in our second cohort. Subsequently, through fine-mapping using CAVIAR we defined 585 of these mSTRs as the likely causal variants underlying the observed associations (fm-mSTRs), and linked a fraction of these to previously reported genome-wide association study signals, providing insights into the mechanisms underlying complex human traits. Furthermore, by integrating gene expression data, we observed that 12.5% of the tested fm-mSTRs also modulate expression levels of nearby genes, reinforcing their regulatory potential. Overall, our findings expand the catalog of functional sequence variants that affect genome regulation, highlighting the importance of incorporating STRs in future genetic association analysis and epigenetics data for the interpretation of trait-associated variants."

ryan,lung cancer,33122336,"Validation of Lung EpiCheck, a novel methylation-based blood assay, for the detection of lung cancer in European and Chinese high-risk individuals",Eur Respir J,"Aim: Lung cancer screening reduces mortality. We aim to validate the performance of Lung EpiCheck, a six-marker panel methylation-based plasma test, in the detection of lung cancer in European and Chinese samples.

Methods: A case-control European training set (n=102 lung cancer cases, n=265 controls) was used to define the panel and algorithm. Two cut-offs were selected, low cut-off (LCO) for high sensitivity and high cut-off (HCO) for high specificity. The performance was validated in case-control European and Chinese validation sets (cases/controls 179/137 and 30/15, respectively).

Results: The European and Chinese validation sets achieved AUCs of 0.882 and 0.899, respectively. The sensitivities/specificities with LCO were 87.2%/64.2% and 76.7%/93.3%, and with HCO they were 74.3%/90.5% and 56.7%/100.0%, respectively. Stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) sensitivity in European and Chinese samples with LCO was 78.4% and 70.0% and with HCO was 62.2% and 30.0%, respectively. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was represented only in the European set and sensitivities with LCO and HCO were 100.0% and 93.3%, respectively. In multivariable analyses of the European validation set, the assay's ability to predict lung cancer was independent of established risk factors (age, smoking, COPD), and overall AUC was 0.942.

Conclusions: Lung EpiCheck demonstrated strong performance in lung cancer prediction in case-control European and Chinese samples, detecting high proportions of early-stage NSCLC and SCLC and significantly improving predictive accuracy when added to established risk factors. Prospective studies are required to confirm these findings. Utilising such a simple and inexpensive blood test has the potential to improve compliance and broaden access to screening for at-risk populations."

Here, we describe the rationale and design for the Risk Biomarker and Nodule Malignancy projects within INTEGRAL. The overarching goal of these projects is to systematically investigate circulating protein markers to include on a panel for use (i) pre-LDCT, to identify people likely to benefit from screening, and (ii) post-LDCT, to differentiate benign versus malignant nodules. To identify informative proteins, the Risk Biomarker project measured 1161 proteins in a nested-case control study within 2 prospective cohorts (n = 252 lung cancer cases and 252 controls) and replicated associations for a subset of proteins in 4 cohorts (n = 479 cases and 479 controls). Eligible participants had a current or former history of smoking and cases were diagnosed up to 3 years following blood draw. The Nodule Malignancy project measured 1078 proteins among participants with a heavy smoking history within four LDCT screening studies (n = 425 cases diagnosed up to 5 years following blood draw, 430 benign-nodule controls, and 398 nodule-free controls). The INTEGRAL panel will enable absolute quantification of 21 proteins. We will evaluate its performance in the Risk Biomarker project using a case-cohort study including 14 cohorts (n = 1696 cases and 2926 subcohort representatives), and in the Nodule Malignancy project within five LDCT screening studies (n = 675 cases, 680 benign-nodule controls, and 648 nodule-free controls). Future progress to advance lung cancer early detection biomarkers will require carefully designed validation, translational, and comparative studies."

We measured 1,162 proteins in blood samples drawn at most three years before diagnosis in 731 smoking-matched case-control sets nested within six prospective cohorts from the US, Europe, Singapore, and Australia.

We identified 36 proteins with replicable associations with risk of imminent lung cancer diagnosis (all p<4×10-5). These included several documented tumor markers (e.g. CA-125/MUC-16 and CEACAM5/CEA) but most had not been previously reported. The 36 proteins included several growth factors (e.g. HGF, IGFBP-1, IGFP-2), tumor necrosis factor-receptors (e.g. TNFRSF6B, TNFRSF13B), and chemokines and cytokines (e.g. CXL17, GDF-15, SCF). The odds ratio per standard deviation ranged from 1.31 for IGFBP-1 (95% CI: 1.17-1.47) to 2.43 for CEACAM5 (95% CI: 2.04-2.89). We mapped the 36 proteins to the hallmarks of cancer and found that proliferative signaling, tumor-promoting inflammation, and activation of invasion and metastasis were most frequently implicated."

DNA methylation changes occur early in tumorigenesis and are widespread, making cfDNA methylation an attractive cancer biomarker. Already a proven technology for targeted genome sequencing, hybridization probe capture is emerging as a method for high-throughput targeted methylation profiling suitable to liquid biopsy samples. However, to date there are no reports describing the performance of this approach in terms of reproducibility, scalability, and accuracy. In the current study we performed hybridization probe capture using the myBaitsÂ®Custom Methyl-seq kit on 172 plasma samples and standards to evaluate its performance on cfDNA methylation analysis. The myBaitsÂ®assay showed high target recovery (>90%), demonstrated excellent reproducibility between captures (R2Â =Â 0.92 on average), and was unaffected by increasing the number of targets in a capture. Finally, myBaitsÂ®accurately replicated 'gold standard' beta values from WGBS (averageR2Â =Â 0.79). The results of this study show that custom targeted methylation sequencing with myBaitsÂ®offers a cost-effective, reliable platform to profile DNA methylation at a set of discrete custom regions, with potential applicability to liquid biopsies for cancer monitoring.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

sam,ewas,36550108,Epigenome-wide meta-analysis identifies DNA methylation biomarkers associated with diabetic kidney disease,Nat Commun,"Type 1 diabetes affects over nine million individuals globally, with approximately 40% developing diabetic kidney disease. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, are involved in diabetic kidney disease. Here we assess differences in blood-derived genome-wide DNA methylation associated with diabetic kidney disease in 1304 carefully characterised individuals with type 1 diabetes and known renal status from two cohorts in the United Kingdom-Republic of Ireland and Finland. In the meta-analysis, we identify 32 differentially methylated CpGs in diabetic kidney disease in type 1 diabetes, 18 of which are located within genes differentially expressed in kidneys or correlated with pathological traits in diabetic kidney disease. We show that methylation at 21 of the 32 CpGs predict the development of kidney failure, extending the knowledge and potentially identifying individuals at greater risk for diabetic kidney disease in type 1 diabetes."
sam,reference,36599988,A DNA methylation atlas of normal human cell types,Nature,"DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mark that governs gene expression and chromatin organization, thus providing a window into cellular identity and developmental processes1. Current datasets typically include only a fraction of methylation sites and are often based either on cell lines that underwent massive changes in culture or on tissues containing unspecified mixtures of cells2-5. Here we describe a human methylome atlas, based on deep whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, allowing fragment-level analysis across thousands of unique markers for 39 cell types sorted from 205 healthy tissue samples. Replicates of the same cell type are more than 99.5% identical, demonstrating the robustness of cell identity programmes to environmental perturbation. Unsupervised clustering of the atlas recapitulates key elements of tissue ontogeny and identifies methylation patterns retained since embryonic development. Loci uniquely unmethylated in an individual cell type often reside in transcriptional enhancers and contain DNA binding sites for tissue-specific transcriptional regulators. Uniquely hypermethylated loci are rare and are enriched for CpG islands, Polycomb targets and CTCF binding sites, suggesting a new role in shaping cell-type-specific chromatin looping. The atlas provides an essential resource for study of gene regulation and disease-associated genetic variants, and a wealth of potential tissue-specific biomarkers for use in liquid biopsies."
scott,ewas,36708841,Associations of selenium exposure with blood lipids: Exploring mediating DNA methylation sites in general Chinese urban non-smokers.,Sci Total Environ,"Selenium (Se) is widely distributed in the total environment and people are commonly exposed to Se, while the potential effects and mechanisms of Se exposure on blood lipids have not been well established. This study aimed to assess the associations of urinary Se (SeU) with blood lipids and explore the potential mediating DNA methylation sites. We included 2844 non-smoke participants from the second follow-up (2017-2018) of the Wuhan-Zhuhai cohort (WHZH) in this study. SeU and blood lipids [i.e., total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL)] for all participants were determined. The associations of SeU with blood lipids were analyzed by generalized linear models. Then, we conducted the blood lipids related epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) among 221 never smokers, and the mediation analysis was conducted to explore the potential mediating cytosine-phosphoguanine (CpG) sites in the above associations. In this study, the SeU concentration of the participants in this study was 1.40 (0.94, 2.08) Î¼g/mmol Cr. The SeU was positively associated with TC and LDL, and not associated with TG and HDL. We found 131, 3, and 1 new CpG sites related to TC, HDL, and LDL, respectively. Mediation analyses found that the methylation of cg06964030 (within MIR1306) and cg15824094 (within PLCH2) significantly mediated the positive association between SeU and TC. In conclusion, high levels of Se exposure were associated with increased TC and LDL among non-smokers, and the methylation of MIR1306 and PLCH2 partly mediated Se-associated TC increase. These findings provide new insights into the effects and mechanisms of Se exposure on lipids metabolism and highlight the importance of controlling Se exposure and intake for preventing high blood lipids.Copyright Â© 2023.

scott,ml,36609221,Machine learning to analyse omic-data for COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis.,BMC Bioinformatics,"With the global spread of COVID-19, the world has seen many patients, including many severe cases. The rapid development of machine learning (ML) has made significant disease diagnosis and prediction achievements. Current studies have confirmed that omics data at the host level can reflect the development process and prognosis of the disease. Since early diagnosis and effective treatment of severe COVID-19 patients remains challenging, this research aims to use omics data in different ML models for COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis. We used several ML models on omics data of a large number of individuals to first predict whether patients are COVID-19 positive or negative, followed by the severity of the disease.On the COVID-19 diagnosis task, we got the best AUC of 0.99 with our multilayer perceptron model and the highest F1-score of 0.95 with our logistic regression (LR) model. For the severity prediction task, we achieved the highest accuracy of 0.76 with an LR model. Beyond classification and predictive modeling, our study founds ML models performed better on integrated multi-omics data, rather than single omics. By comparing top features from different omics dataset, we also found the robustness of our model, with a wider range of applicability in diverse dataset related to COVID-19. Additionally, we have found that omics-based models performed better than image or physiological feature-based models, proving the importance of the omics-based dataset for future model development.This study diagnoses COVID-19 positive cases and predicts accurate severity levels. It lowers the dependence on clinical data and professional judgment, by leveraging the utilization of state-of-the-art models. our model showed wider applicability across different omics dataset, which is highly transferable in other respiratory or similar diseases. Hospital and public health care mechanisms can optimize the distribution of medical resources and improve the robustness of the medical system.Â© 2023. The Author(s)."
x,dnam age,36711749,Phenome-wide analysis identifies parent-of-origin effects on the human methylome associated with changes in the rate of aging.,bioRxiv,"Variation in the rate at which humans age may be rooted in early life events acting through genomic regions that are influenced by such events and subsequently are related to health phenotypes in later life. The parent-of-origin-effect (POE)-regulated methylome includes regions either enriched for genetically controlled imprinting effects (the typical type of POE) or atypical POE introduced by environmental effects associated with parents. This part of the methylome is heavily influenced by early life events, making it a potential route connecting early environmental exposures, the epigenome and the rate of aging. Here, we aim to test the association of POE-influenced methylation of CpG dinucleotides (POE-CpG sites) with early and later environmental exposures and subsequently with health-related phenotypes and adult aging phenotypes. We do this by performing phenome-wide association analyses of the POE-influenced methylome using a large family-based population cohort (GS:SFHS, Ndiscovery=5,087, Nreplication=4,450). At the single CpG level, 92 associations of POE-CpGs with phenotypic variation were identified and replicated. Most of the associations were contributed by POE-CpGs belonging to the atypical class and the most strongly enriched associations were with aging (DNAmTL acceleration), intelligence and parental (maternal) smoking exposure phenotypes. We further found that a proportion of the atypical-POE-CpGs formed co-methylation networks (modules) which are associated with these phenotypes, with one of the aging-associated modules displaying increased internal module connectivity (strength of methylation correlation across constituent CpGs) with age. Atypical POE-CpGs also displayed high levels of methylation heterogeneity and epigenetic drift (i.e. information loss with age) and a strong correlation with CpGs contained within epigenetic clocks. These results identified associations between the atypical-POE-influenced methylome and aging and provided new evidence for the ""early development of origin"" hypothesis for aging in humans."
x,epigenetics,36656803,Using epigenomics to understand cellular responses to environmental influences in diseases.,PLoS Genet,"It is a generally accepted model that environmental influences can exert their effects, at least in part, by changing the molecular regulators of transcription that are described as epigenetic. As there is biochemical evidence that some epigenetic regulators of transcription can maintain their states long term and through cell division, an epigenetic model encompasses the idea of maintenance of the effect of an exposure long after it is no longer present. The evidence supporting this model is mostly from the observation of alterations of molecular regulators of transcription following exposures. With the understanding that the interpretation of these associations is more complex than originally recognised, this model may be oversimplistic; therefore, adopting novel perspectives and experimental approaches when examining how environmental exposures are linked to phenotypes may prove worthwhile. In this review, we have chosen to use the example of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a common, complex human disease with strong environmental and genetic influences. We describe how epigenomic approaches combined with emerging functional genetic and single-cell genomic techniques are poised to generate new insights into the pathogenesis of environmentally influenced human disease phenotypes exemplified by NAFLD.Copyright: Â© 2023 Wattacheril et al.

x,ewas,36638096,Multi-omic association study identifies DNA methylation-mediated genotype and smoking exposure effects on lung function in children living in urban settings.,PLoS Genet,"Impaired lung function in early life is associated with the subsequent development of chronic respiratory disease. Most genetic associations with lung function have been identified in adults of European descent and therefore may not represent those most relevant to pediatric populations and populations of different ancestries. In this study, we performed genome-wide association analyses of lung function in a multiethnic cohort of children (n = 1,035) living in low-income urban neighborhoods. We identified one novel locus at the TDRD9 gene in chromosome 14q32.33 associated with percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (p = 2.4x10-9; Î²z = -0.31, 95% CI = -0.41- -0.21). Mendelian randomization and mediation analyses revealed that this genetic effect on FEV1 was partially mediated by DNA methylation levels at this locus in airway epithelial cells, which were also associated with environmental tobacco smoke exposure (p = 0.015). Promoter-enhancer interactions in airway epithelial cells revealed chromatin interaction loops between FEV1-associated variants in TDRD9 and the promoter region of the PPP1R13B gene, a stimulator of p53-mediated apoptosis. Expression of PPP1R13B in airway epithelial cells was significantly associated the FEV1 risk alleles (p = 1.3x10-5; Î² = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.06-0.17). These combined results highlight a potential novel mechanism for reduced lung function in urban youth resulting from both genetics and smoking exposure.Copyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

We pooled summary statistics from six trans-ethnic epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) of BMI representing nine cohorts (nÂ = 17,034), replicated these findings in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI, nÂ = 4,822), and developed an epigenetic prediction score of BMI. In the pooled EWASs, 1,265 CpG sites were associated with BMI (pÂ <Â 1E-7) and 1,238 replicated in the WHI (FDRÂ <Â 0.05). We performed several stratified analyses to examine whether these associations differed between individuals of European and African descent, as defined by self-reported race/ethnicity. We found that five CpG sites had a significant interaction with BMI by race/ethnicity. To examine the utility of the significant CpG sites in predicting BMI, we used elastic net regression to predict log-normalized BMI in the WHI (80% training/20% testing). This model found that 397 sites could explain 32% of the variance in BMI in the WHI test set. Individuals whose methylome-predicted BMI overestimated their BMI (high epigenetic BMI) had significantly higher glucose and triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol compared to accurately predicted BMI. Individuals whose methylome-predicted BMI underestimated their BMI (low epigenetic BMI) had significantly higher HDL cholesterol and lower glucose and triglycerides. This study confirmed 553 and identified 685 CpG sites associated with BMI. Participants with high epigenetic BMI had poorer metabolic health, suggesting that the overestimation may be driven in part by cardiometabolic derangements characteristic of metabolic syndrome.Copyright Â© 2022 American Society of Human Genetics.

,asthma,36704932,Global hypomethylation in childhood asthma identified by genome-wide DNA-methylation sequencing preferentially affects enhancer regions.,Allergy,"Childhood asthma is a result of a complex interaction of genetic and environmental components causing epigenetic and immune dysregulation, airway inflammation and impaired lung function. Although different microarray based EWAS studies have been conducted, the impact of epigenetic regulation in asthma development is still widely unknown. We have therefore applied unbiased whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to characterize global DNA-methylation profiles of asthmatic children compared to healthy controls.Peripheral blood samples of 40 asthmatic and 42 control children aged 5-15â€‰years from three birth cohorts were sequenced together with paired cord blood samples. Identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were categorized in genotype-associated, cell-type-dependent, or prenatally-primed. Network analysis and subsequent natural language processing of DMR-associated genes was complemented by targeted analysis of functional translation of epigenetic regulation on the transcriptional and protein level.In total, 158 DMRs were identified in asthmatic children compared to controls of which 37% were related to the eosinophil content. A global hypomethylation was identified affecting predominantly enhancer regions and regulating key immune genes such as IL4, IL5RA, and EPX. These DMRs were confirmed in n=267 samples and could be linked to aberrant gene expression. Out of the 158 DMRs identified in the established phenotype, 56 were perturbed already at birth and linked, at least in part, to prenatal influences such as tobacco smoke exposure or phthalate exposure.This is the first epigenetic study based on whole genome sequencing to identify marked dysregulation of enhancer regions as a hallmark of childhood asthma.This article is protected by copyright.

,cell-free dna,36653380,DNA methylation analysis explores the molecular basis of plasma cell-free DNA fragmentation.,Nat Commun,"Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are small molecules generated through a non-random fragmentation procedure. Despite commendable translational values in cancer liquid biopsy, however, the biology of cfDNA, especially the principles of cfDNA fragmentation, remains largely elusive. Through orientation-aware analyses of cfDNA fragmentation patterns against the nucleosome structure and integration with multidimensional functional genomics data, here we report a DNA methylation - nuclease preference - cutting end - size distribution axis, demonstrating the role of DNA methylation as a functional molecular regulator of cfDNA fragmentation. Hence, low-level DNA methylation could increase nucleosome accessibility and alter the cutting activities of nucleases during DNA fragmentation, which further leads to variation in cutting sites and size distribution of cfDNA. We further develop a cfDNA ending preference-based metric for cancer diagnosis, whose performance has been validated by multiple pan-cancer datasets. Our work sheds light on the molecular basis of cfDNA fragmentation towards broader applications in cancer liquid biopsy.Â© 2023. The Author(s)."
,dnam age,36548410,"Epigenetic clocks, aging, and cancer",Science,"Cancer and aging are accompanied by stereotyped changes to the epigenetic landscape, including progressive loss of DNA methylation over gene-poor genomic regions (1, 2). Global hypomethylation arises in cells that have undergone many divisions, likely owing to imperfect maintenance. Evidence suggests that global hypomethylation represents a “mitotic clock” that counts divisions in somatic cells and functions to restrain aging cells and limit malignant progression. Therapies that modulate the pace of methylation loss or eliminate hypomethylated cells could alleviate agingassociated diseases or cancers."
,dnam age,36671726,Epigenetic Clock Explains White Matter Hyperintensity Burden Irrespective of Chronological Age.,Biology (Basel),"In this manuscript we studied the relationship between WMH and biological age (B-age) in patients with acute stroke. We included in this study 247 patients with acute stroke recruited at Hospital del Mar having both epigenetic (DNA methylation) and magnetic resonance imaging data. WMH were measured using a semi-automated method. B-age was calculated using two widely used methods: the Hannum and Horvath formulas. We used multiple linear regression models to interrogate the role of B-age on WMH volume after adjusting for chronological age (C-age) and other covariables. Average C-age of the sample was 68.4 (Â±11.8) and we observed a relatively high median WMH volume (median = 8.8 cm3, Q1-Q3 = 4.05-18.8). After adjusting for potential confounders, we observed a significant effect of B-ageHannumon WMH volume (Î²Hannum= 0.023,p-value = 0.029) independently of C-age, which remained significant (Î²C-age= 0.021,p-value = 0.036). Finally, we performed a mediation analysis, which allowed us to discover that 42.7% of the effect of C-age on WMH is mediated by B-ageHannum. On the other hand, B-ageHoarvathshowed no significant associations with WMH after being adjusted for C-age.

Despite the overall promise of early approaches, however, these drugs have been plagued by poor pharmacokinetic and safety/tolerability profiles due in large part to off-target effects and a lack of specificity.Recently, there has been marked progress in the field on a new generation of epigenomic therapies which address these challenges directly by targeting defined loci with highly precise, durable, and tunable approaches. Here, we review the promise and pitfalls of epigenetic drug development to date and provide an outlook on recent advances and their promise for future therapeutic applications.Novel therapeutic modalities leveraging epigenetics and epigenomics with increased precision are well positioned to advance the field and treat patients across disease areas in the coming years.Â© 2023.

,ewas,36600305,Methylation in MAD1L1 is associated with the severity of suicide attempt and phenotypes of depression.,Clin Epigenetics,"Depression is a multifactorial disorder representing a significant public health burden. Previous studies have linked multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms with depressive phenotypes and suicidal behavior. MAD1L1 is a mitosis metaphase checkpoint protein that has been linked to depression in GWAS. Using a longitudinal EWAS approach in an adolescent cohort at two time points (nâ€‰=â€‰216 and nâ€‰=â€‰154), we identified differentially methylated sites that were associated with depression-related genetic variants in MAD1L1. Three methylation loci (cg02825527, cg18302629, and cg19624444) were consistently hypomethylated in the minor allele carriers, being cross-dependent on several SNPs. We further investigated whether DNA methylation at these CpGs is associated with depressive psychiatric phenotypes in independent cohorts. The first site (cg02825527) was hypomethylated in blood (exp(Î²)â€‰=â€‰84.521, p valueâ€‰~â€‰0.003) in participants with severe suicide attempts (nâ€‰=â€‰88). The same locus showed increased methylation in glial cells (exp(Î²)â€‰=â€‰0.041, p valueâ€‰~â€‰0.004) in the validation cohort, involving 29 depressed patients and 29 controls, and showed a trend for association with suicide (nâ€‰=â€‰40, p valueâ€‰~â€‰0.089) and trend for association with depression treatment (nâ€‰=â€‰377, p valueâ€‰~â€‰0.075). The second CpG (cg18302629) was significantly hypomethylated in depressed participants (exp(Î²)â€‰=â€‰56.374, p valueâ€‰~â€‰0.023) in glial cells, but did not show associations in the discovery cohorts. The last methylation site (cg19624444) was hypomethylated in the whole blood of severe suicide attempters; however, this association was at the borderline for statistical significance (p valueâ€‰~â€‰0.061). This locus, however, showed a strong association with depression treatment in the validation cohort (exp(Î²)â€‰=â€‰2.237, p valueâ€‰~â€‰0.003) with 377 participants. The direction of associations between psychiatric phenotypes appeared to be different in the whole blood in comparison with brain samples for cg02825527 and cg19624444. The association analysis between methylation at cg18302629 and cg19624444 and MAD1L1 transcript levels in CD14+cells shows a potential link between methylation at these CpGs and MAD1L1 expression. This study suggests evidence that methylation at MAD1L1 is important for psychiatric health as supported by several independent cohorts.Â© 2023. The Author(s)."
,ewas,36609850,Genetic and epigenetic signatures associated with plasma oxytocin levels in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder.,Autism Res,"Oxytocin (OT), the brain's most abundant neuropeptide, plays an important role in social salience and motivation. Clinical trials of the efficacy of OT in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have reported mixed results due in part to ASD's complex etiology. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic variation contribute to variable endogenous OT levels that modulate sensitivity to OT therapy. To carry out this analysis, we integrated genome-wide profiles of DNA-methylation, transcriptional activity, and genetic variation with plasma OT levels in 290 participants with ASD enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of OT. Our analysis identified genetic variants with novel association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known ASD risk genes. We also show subtle but statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with peripheral transcriptional activity and DNA-methylation profiles across several annotated gene sets. These findings broaden our understanding of the effects of the peripheral oxytocin system and provide novel genetic candidates for future studies to decode the complex etiology of ASD and its interaction with OT signaling and OT-based interventions. LAY SUMMARY: Oxytocin (OT) is an abundant chemical produced by neurons that plays an important role in social interaction and motivation. We investigated whether genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to variable OT levels in the blood. To this, we integrated genetic, gene expression, and non-DNA regulated (epigenetic) signatures with blood OT levels in 290 participants with autism enrolled in an OT clinical trial. We identified genetic association with plasma OT, several of which reside in known autism risk genes. We also show statistically significant association of plasma OT levels with gene expression and epigenetic across several gene pathways. These findings broaden our understanding of the factors that influence OT levels in the blood for future studies to decode the complex presentation of autism and its interaction with OT and OT-based treatment.Â© 2023 The Authors.

,ewas,36612042,"A Race-Specific, DNA Methylation Analysis of Aging in Normal Rectum: Implications for the Biology of Aging and Its Relationship to Rectal Cancer.",Cancers (Basel),"Approximately 90% of colorectal cancer (CRC) develop over the age of 50, highlighting the important role of aging in CRC risk. African Americans (AAs) shoulder a greater CRC burden than European Americans (EA) and are more likely to develop CRC at a younger age. The effects of aging in AA and EA normal rectal tissue have yet to be defined. Here, we performed epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis in the first, large-scale biracial cohort of normal rectum (n= 140 samples). We identified increased epigenetic age acceleration in EA than AA rectum (p= 3.91 Ã— 10-4) using linear regression. We also identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with chronological aging in AA and EA, separately using DMRcate. Next, a consensus set of regions associated with cancer was identified through DMR analysis of two rectal cancer cohorts. The vast majority of AA DMRs were present in our analysis of aging in rectum of EA subjects, though rates of epigenetic drift were significantly greater in AA (p= 1.94 Ã— 10-45). However, 3.66-fold more DMRs were associated with aging in rectum of EA subjects, many of which were also associated with rectal cancer. Our findings reveal a novel relationship between race, age, DNA methylation and rectal cancer risk that warrants further investigation."
,ewas,36617561,Prenatal social support in low-risk pregnancy shapes placental epigenome.,BMC Med,"Poor social support during pregnancy has been linked to inflammation and adverse pregnancy and childhood health outcomes. Placental epigenetic alterations may underlie these links but are still unknown in humans.In a cohort of low-risk pregnant women (nâ€‰=â€‰301) from diverse ethnic backgrounds, social support was measured using the ENRICHD Social Support Inventory (ESSI) during the first trimester. Placental samples collected at delivery were analyzed for DNA methylation and gene expression using Illumina 450K Beadchip Array and RNA-seq, respectively. We examined association between maternal prenatal social support and DNA methylation in placenta. Associated cytosine-(phosphate)-guanine sites (CpGs) were further assessed for correlation with nearby gene expression in placenta.The mean age (SD) of the women was 27.7 (5.3) years. The median (interquartile range) of ESSI scores was 24 (22-25). Prenatal social support was significantly associated with methylation level at seven CpGs (PFDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05). The methylation levels at two of the seven CpGs correlated with placental expression of VGF and ILVBL (PFDRâ€‰<â€‰0.05), genes known to be involved in neurodevelopment and energy metabolism. The genes annotated with the top 100 CpGs were enriched for pathways related to fetal growth, coagulation system, energy metabolism, and neurodevelopment. Sex-stratified analysis identified additional significant associations at nine CpGs in male-bearing pregnancies and 35 CpGs in female-bearing pregnancies.The findings suggest that prenatal social support is linked to placental DNA methylation changes in a low-stress setting, including fetal sex-dependent epigenetic changes. Given the relevance of some of these changes in fetal neurodevelopmental outcomes, the findings signal important methylation targets for future research on molecular mechanisms of effect of the broader social environment on pregnancy and fetal outcomes.NCT00912132 ( ClinicalTrials.gov ).Â© 2023.

,ewas,36627699,Cord blood epigenome-wide meta-analysis in six European-based child cohorts identifies signatures linked to rapid weight growth.,BMC Med,"Rapid postnatal growth may result from exposure in utero or early life to adverse conditions and has been associated with diseases later in life and, in particular, with childhood obesity. DNA methylation, interfacing early-life exposures and subsequent diseases, is a possible mechanism underlying early-life programming.Here, a meta-analysis of Illumina HumanMethylation 450K/EPIC-array associations of cord blood DNA methylation at single CpG sites and CpG genomic regions with rapid weight growth at 1 year of age (defined with reference to WHO growth charts) was conducted in six European-based child cohorts (ALSPAC, ENVIRONAGE, Generation XXI, INMA, PiccolipiÃ¹, and RHEA, N = 2003). The association of gestational age acceleration (calculated using the Bohlin epigenetic clock) with rapid weight growth was also explored via meta-analysis. Follow-up analyses of identified DNA methylation signals included prediction of rapid weight growth, mediation of the effect of conventional risk factors on rapid weight growth, integration with transcriptomics and metabolomics, association with overweight in childhood (between 4 and 8 years), and comparison with previous findings.Forty-seven CpGs were associated with rapid weight growth at suggestive p-value <1e-05 and, among them, three CpGs (cg14459032, cg25953130 annotated to ARID5B, and cg00049440 annotated to KLF9) passed the genome-wide significance level (p-value <1.25e-07). Sixteen differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified as associated with rapid weight growth at false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted/Siddak p-values < 0.01. Gestational age acceleration was associated with decreasing risk of rapid weight growth (p-value = 9.75e-04). Identified DNA methylation signals slightly increased the prediction of rapid weight growth in addition to conventional risk factors. Among the identified signals, three CpGs partially mediated the effect of gestational age on rapid weight growth. Both CpGs (N=3) and DMRs (N=3) were associated with differential expression of transcripts (N=10 and 7, respectively), including long non-coding RNAs. An AURKC DMR was associated with childhood overweight. We observed enrichment of CpGs previously reported associated with birthweight.Our findings provide evidence of the association between cord blood DNA methylation and rapid weight growth and suggest links with prenatal exposures and association with childhood obesity providing opportunities for early prevention.Â© 2023.

,ewas,36633903,Reduced methylation corresponds with diabetic nephropathy risk in type 1 diabetes.,J Clin Invest,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a polygenic disorder with few risk variants showing robust replication in large-scale genome-wide association studies. To understand the role of DNA methylation, it is important to have the prevailing genomic view to distinguish key sequence elements that influence gene expression. This is particularly challenging for DN because genome wide methylation patterns are poorly defined. While methylation is known to alter gene expression the importance of this causal relationship is obscured by array-based technologies since coverage outside promoter regions is low. To overcome these challenges, we performed methylation sequencing using leukocytes derived from participants of the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy (FinnDiane) type 1 diabetes (T1D) study (n=39) that was subsequently replicated in a larger validation cohort (n=296). Gene body related regions made up >60% of the methylation differences and emphasised the importance of methylation sequencing. We observe differentially methylated genes associated with DN (DDN) in three independent T1D registries originating from Denmark (n=445), Hong Kong (n=107) and Thailand (n=130). Reduced DNA methylation at CTCF and Pol2B sites were tightly connected with DN pathways that include insulin signalling, lipid metabolism and fibrosis. To define the pathophysiological significance of these population findings, methylation indices were assessed in human renal cells such as podocytes and proximal convoluted tubules. The expression of core genes was associated with reduced methylation, elevated CTCF and Pol2B binding and the activation of insulin signalling phosphoproteins in hyperglycaemic cells. These experimental observations also closely parallel methylation-mediated regulation in human macrophage and vascular endothelial cells."
,ewas,36640455,Effect of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy initiation on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns.,EBioMedicine,"Previous epigenome-wide association studies have shown that HIV infection can disrupt the host DNA methylation landscape. However, it remains unclear how antiretroviral therapy (ART) affects the HIV-induced epigenetic modifications.184 individuals with HIV from the NEAT001/ANRS143 clinical trial (with pre-ART and post-ART samples [96 weeks of follow-up]) and 44 age-and-sex matched individuals without HIV were included. We compared genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in whole blood between groups adjusting for age, sex, batch effects, and DNA methylation-based estimates of leucocyte composition.We identified 430 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between HIV+Â pre-ART individuals and HIV-uninfected controls. In participants with HIV, ART initiation modified the DNA methylation levels at 845 CpG positions and restored 49.3% of the changes found between HIV+Â pre-ART and HIV-uninfected individuals. We only found 15 DMPs when comparing DNA methylation profiles between HIV+Â post-ART individuals and participants without HIV. The Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of DMPs associated with untreated HIV infection revealed an enrichment in biological processes regulating the immune system and antiviral responses. In participants with untreated HIV infection, DNA methylation levels at top HIV-related DMPs were associated with CD4/CD8 ratios and viral loads. Changes in DNA methylation levels after ART initiation were weakly correlated with changes in CD4+ cell counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio.Control of HIV viraemia after 96 weeks of ART initiation partly restores the host DNA methylation changes that occurred before antiretroviral treatment of HIV infection.NEAT-ID Foundation and Instituto de Salud Carlos III, co-funded by European Union.Copyright Â© 2022 Fundacion Investigacion Biomedica del Hospital La Paz.

,ewas,36700736,Opioid medication use and blood DNA methylation: epigenome-wide association meta-analysis.,Epigenomics,"Aim:To identify differential methylation related to prescribed opioid use.Methods:This study examined whether blood DNA methylation, measured using Illumina arrays, differs by recent opioid medication use in four population-based cohorts. We meta-analyzed results (282 users; 10,560 nonusers) using inverse-variance weighting.Results:Differential methylation (false discovery rate <0.05) was observed at six CpGs annotated to the following genes:KIAA0226,CPLX2,TDRP,RNF38,TTC23andGPR179. Integrative epigenomic analyses linked implicated loci to regulatory elements in blood and/or brain. Additionally, 74 CpGs were differentially methylated in males or females. Methylation at significant CpGs correlated with gene expression in blood and/or brain.Conclusion:This study identified DNA methylation related to opioid medication use in general populations. The results could inform the development of blood methylation biomarkers of opioid use."
,methods,36601577,MC profiling: a novel approach to analyze DNA methylation heterogeneity in genome-wide bisulfite sequencing data.,NAR Genom Bioinform,"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark implicated in crucial biological processes. Most of the knowledge about DNA methylation is based on bulk experiments, in which DNA methylation of genomic regions is reported as average methylation. However, average methylation does not inform on how methylated cytosines are distributed in each single DNA molecule. Here, we propose Methylation Class (MC) profiling as a genome-wide approach to the study of DNA methylation heterogeneity from bulk bisulfite sequencing experiments. The proposed approach is built on the concept of MCs, groups of DNA molecules sharing the same number of methylated cytosines. The relative abundances of MCs from sequencing reads incorporates the information on the average methylation, and directly informs on the methylation level of each molecule. By applying our approach to publicly available bisulfite-sequencing datasets, we individuated cell-to-cell differences as the prevalent contributor to methylation heterogeneity. Moreover, we individuated signatures of loci undergoing imprinting and X-inactivation, and highlighted differences between the two processes. When applying MC profiling to compare different conditions, we identified methylation changes occurring in regions with almost constant average methylation. Altogether, our results indicate that MC profiling can provide useful insights on the epigenetic status and its evolution at multiple genomic regions.Â© The Author(s) 2022.

,methods,36609459,Who's afraid of the X? Incorporating the X and Y chromosomes into the analysis of DNA methylation array data.,Epigenetics Chromatin,"Many human disease phenotypes manifest differently by sex, making the development of methods for incorporating X and Y-chromosome data into analyses vital. Unfortunately, X and Y chromosome data are frequently excluded from large-scale analyses of the human genome and epigenome due to analytical complexity associated with sex chromosome dosage differences between XX and XY individuals, and the impact of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) on the epigenome. As such, little attention has been given to considering the methods by which sex chromosome data may be included in analyses of DNA methylation (DNAme) array data.With Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 DNAme array data from 634 placental samples, we investigated the effects of probe filtering, normalization, and batch correction on DNAme data from the X and Y chromosomes. Processing steps were evaluated in both mixed-sex and sex-stratified subsets of the analysis cohort to identify whether including both sexes impacted processing results. We found that identification of probes that have a high detection p-value, or that are non-variable, should be performed in sex-stratified data subsets to avoid over- and under-estimation of the quantity of probes eligible for removal, respectively. All normalization techniques investigated returned X and Y DNAme data that were highly correlated with the raw data from the same samples. We found no difference in batch correction results after application to mixed-sex or sex-stratified cohorts. Additionally, we identify two analytical methods suitable for XY chromosome data, the choice between which should be guided by the research question of interest, and we performed a proof-of-concept analysis studying differential DNAme on the X and Y chromosome in the context of placental acute chorioamnionitis. Finally, we provide an annotation of probe types that may be desirable to filter in X and Y chromosome analyses, including probes in repetitive elements, the X-transposed region, and cancer-testis gene promoters.While there may be no single ""best"" approach for analyzing DNAme array data from the X and Y chromosome, analysts must consider key factors during processing and analysis of sex chromosome data to accommodate the underlying biology of these chromosomes, and the technical limitations of DNA methylation arrays.Â© 2023.

,methods,36624346,SPICEMIX enables integrative single-cell spatial modeling of cell identity.,Nat Genet,"Spatial transcriptomics can reveal spatially resolved gene expression of diverse cells in complex tissues. However, the development of computational methods that can use the unique properties of spatial transcriptome data to unveil cell identities remains a challenge. Here we introduce SPICEMIX, an interpretable method based on probabilistic, latent variable modeling for joint analysis of spatial information and gene expression from spatial transcriptome data. Both simulation and real data evaluations demonstrate that SPICEMIX markedly improves on the inference of cell types and their spatial patterns compared with existing approaches. By applying to spatial transcriptome data of brain regions in human and mouse acquired by seqFISH+, STARmap and Visium, we show that SPICEMIX can enhance the inference of complex cell identities, reveal interpretable spatial metagenes and uncover differentiation trajectories. SPICEMIX is a generalizable analysis framework for spatial transcriptome data to investigate cell-type composition and spatial organization of cells in complex tissues.Â© 2023.

,methods,36711917,EpiMix: an integrative tool for epigenomic subtyping using DNA methylation.,bioRxiv,"DNA methylation (DNAme) is a major epigenetic factor influencing gene expression with alterations leading to cancer, immunological, and cardiovascular diseases. Recent technological advances enable genome-wide quantification of DNAme in large human cohorts. So far, existing methods have not been evaluated to identify differential DNAme present in large and heterogeneous patient cohorts. We developed an end-to-end analytical framework named ""EpiMix"" for population-level analysis of DNAme and gene expression. Compared to existing methods, EpiMix showed higher sensitivity in detecting abnormal DNAme that was present in only small patient subsets. We extended the model-based analyses of EpiMix to cis-regulatory elements within protein-coding genes, distal enhancers, and genes encoding microRNAs and lncRNAs. Using cell-type specific data from two separate studies, we discovered novel epigenetic mechanisms underlying childhood food allergy and survival-associated, methylation-driven non-coding RNAs in non-small cell lung cancer."
,ml,36602952,Ten quick tips for computational analysis of medical images.,PLoS Comput Biol,"Medical imaging is a great asset for modern medicine, since it allows physicians to spatially interrogate a disease site, resulting in precise intervention for diagnosis and treatment, and to observe particular aspect of patients' conditions that otherwise would not be noticeable. Computational analysis of medical images, moreover, can allow the discovery of disease patterns and correlations among cohorts of patients with the same disease, thus suggesting common causes or providing useful information for better therapies and cures. Machine learning and deep learning applied to medical images, in particular, have produced new, unprecedented results that can pave the way to advanced frontiers of medical discoveries. While computational analysis of medical images has become easier, however, the possibility to make mistakes or generate inflated or misleading results has become easier, too, hindering reproducibility and deployment. In this article, we provide ten quick tips to perform computational analysis of medical images avoiding common mistakes and pitfalls that we noticed in multiple studies in the past. We believe our ten guidelines, if taken into practice, can help the computational-medical imaging community to perform better scientific research that eventually can have a positive impact on the lives of patients worldwide.Copyright: Â© 2023 Chicco, Shiradkar.

,mqtl,36631879,Systemic interindividual epigenetic variation in humans is associated with transposable elements and under strong genetic control,Genome Biol,"Background: Genetic variants can modulate phenotypic outcomes via epigenetic intermediates, for example at methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL). We present the first large-scale assessment of mQTL at human genomic regions selected for interindividual variation in CpG methylation, which we call correlated regions of systemic interindividual variation (CoRSIVs). These can be assayed in blood DNA and do not reflect interindividual variation in cellular composition.

Results: We use target-capture bisulfite sequencing to assess DNA methylation at 4086 CoRSIVs in multiple tissues from each of 188 donors in the NIH Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program. At CoRSIVs, DNA methylation in peripheral blood correlates with methylation and gene expression in internal organs. We also discover unprecedented mQTL at these regions. Genetic influences on CoRSIV methylation are extremely strong (median R2=0.76), cumulatively comprising over 70-fold more human mQTL than detected in the most powerful previous study. Moreover, mQTL beta coefficients at CoRSIVs are highly skewed (i.e., the major allele predicts higher methylation). Both surprising findings are independently validated in a cohort of 47 non-GTEx individuals. Genomic regions flanking CoRSIVs show long-range enrichments for LINE-1 and LTR transposable elements; the skewed beta coefficients may therefore reflect evolutionary selection of genetic variants that promote their methylation and silencing. Analyses of GWAS summary statistics show that mQTL polymorphisms at CoRSIVs are associated with metabolic and other classes of disease.

Conclusions: A focus on systemic interindividual epigenetic variants, clearly enhanced in mQTL content, should likewise benefit studies attempting to link human epigenetic variation to the risk of disease."
,reference,36646694,"Comparative analysis of genome-scale, base-resolution DNA methylation profiles across 580 animal species.",Nat Commun,"Methylation of cytosines is a prototypic epigenetic modification of the DNA. It has been implicated in various regulatory mechanisms across the animal kingdom and particularly in vertebrates. We mapped DNA methylation in 580 animal species (535 vertebrates, 45 invertebrates), resulting in 2443 genome-scale DNA methylation profiles of multiple organs. Bioinformatic analysis of this large dataset quantified the association of DNA methylation with the underlying genomic DNA sequence throughout vertebrate evolution. We observed a broadly conserved link with two major transitions-once in the first vertebrates and again with the emergence of reptiles. Cross-species comparisons focusing on individual organs supported a deeply conserved association of DNA methylation with tissue type, and cross-mapping analysis of DNA methylation at gene promoters revealed evolutionary changes for orthologous genes. In summary, this study establishes a large resource of vertebrate and invertebrate DNA methylomes, it showcases the power of reference-free epigenome analysis in species for which no reference genomes are available, and it contributes an epigenetic perspective to the study of vertebrate evolution.Â© 2023.
