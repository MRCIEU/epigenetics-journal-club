"37131654","Single-cell DNA Methylome and 3D Multi-omic Atlas of the Adult Mouse Brain.","bioRxiv","Cytosine DNA methylation is essential in brain development and has been implicated in various neurological disorders. A comprehensive understanding of DNA methylation diversity across the entire brain in the context of the brain's 3D spatial organization is essential for building a complete molecular atlas of brain cell types and understanding their gene regulatory landscapes. To this end, we employed optimized single-nucleus methylome (snmC-seq3) and multi-omic (snm3C-seq1) sequencing technologies to generate 301,626 methylomes and 176,003 chromatin conformation/methylome joint profiles from 117 dissected regions throughout the adult mouse brain. Using iterative clustering and integrating with companion whole-brain transcriptome and chromatin accessibility datasets, we constructed a methylation-based cell type taxonomy that contains 4,673 cell groups and 261 cross-modality-annotated subclasses. We identified millions of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across the genome, representing potential gene regulation elements. Notably, we observed spatial cytosine methylation patterns on both genes and regulatory elements in cell types within and across brain regions. Brain-wide multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH2) data validated the association of this spatial epigenetic diversity with transcription and allowed the mapping of the DNA methylation and topology information into anatomical structures more precisely than our dissections. Furthermore, multi-scale chromatin conformation diversities occur in important neuronal genes, highly associated with DNA methylation and transcription changes. Brain-wide cell type comparison allowed us to build a regulatory model for each gene, linking transcription factors, DMRs, chromatin contacts, and downstream genes to establish regulatory networks. Finally, intragenic DNA methylation and chromatin conformation patterns predicted alternative gene isoform expression observed in a companion whole-brain SMART-seq3dataset. Our study establishes the first brain-wide, single-cell resolution DNA methylome and 3D multi-omic atlas, providing an unparalleled resource for comprehending the mouse brain's cellular-spatial and regulatory genome diversity."
"37130759",NA,NA,"Only a small number of risk factors for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has been established. Several studies identified a role of epigenetics and of deregulation of DNA methylation. DNA methylation is variable across a lifetime and in different tissues; nevertheless, its levels can be regulated by genetic variants like methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), which can be used as a surrogate.We scanned the whole genome for mQTLs and performed an association study in 14 705 PDAC cases and 246 921 controls. The methylation data were obtained from whole blood and pancreatic cancer tissue through online databases. We used the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium and the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium genome-wide association study (GWAS) data as discovery phase and the Pancreatic Disease Research consortium, the FinnGen project and the Japan Pancreatic Cancer Research consortium GWAS as replication phase.The C allele of 15q26.1-rs12905855 showed an association with a decreased risk of PDAC (OR=0.90, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.94, p=4.93×10-8in the overall meta-analysis), reaching genome-level statistical significance. 15q26.1-rs12905855 decreases the methylation of a 'C-phosphate-G' (CpG) site located in the promoter region of theRCCD1antisense (RCCD1-AS1) gene which, when expressed, decreases the expression of the RCC1 domain-containing (RCCD1) gene (part of a histone demethylase complex). Thus, it is possible that the rs12905855 C-allele has a protective role in PDAC development through an increase ofRCCD1gene expression, made possible by the inactivity ofRCCD1-AS1.We identified a novel PDAC risk locus which modulates cancer risk by controlling gene expression through DNA methylation.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

Plant-specific TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) transcription factors play important roles in various plant developmental processes. However, the roles of C. roseus TCPs (CrTCPs) in terpenoid indole alkaloid (TIA) biosynthesis are largely unknown.Here, a total of 15 CrTCP genes were identified in the newly updated C. roseus genome and were grouped into three major classes (P-type, C-type and CYC/TB1).Gene structure and protein motif analyses showed that CrTCPs have diverse intron-exon patterns and protein motif distributions. A number of stress responsive cis-elements were identified in promoter regions of CrTCPs. Expression analysis showed that three CrTCP genes (CrTCP2, CrTCP4, and CrTCP7) were expressed specifically in leaves and four CrTCP genes (CrTCP13, CrTCP8, CrTCP6, and CrTCP10) were expressed specifically in flowers. HPLC analysis showed that the contents of three classic TIAs, vindoline, catharanthine and ajmalicine, were significantly increased by ultraviolet-B (UV-B) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) in leaves. By analyzing the expression patterns under UV-B radiation and MeJA application with qRT-PCR, a number of CrTCP and TIA biosynthesis-related genes were identified to be responsive to UV-B and MeJA treatments. Interestingly, two TCP binding elements (GGNCCCAC and GTGGNCCC) were identified in several TIA biosynthesis-related genes, suggesting that they were potential target genes of CrTCPs.These results suggest that CrTCPs are involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of TIAs, and provide a basis for further functional identification of CrTCPs.Copyright © 2023 Hao, Zheng, Han, Zhang, Hou, Liang, Chen, Wang, Qian, Lin, Wang, Zeng and Shen."
"37123549","The role of DNA methylation in ovarian cancer chemoresistance: A narrative review.","Health Sci Rep","Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecological cancer. In 2018, it was responsible for over 180,000 deaths worldwide. The high mortality rate is the culmination of a lack of early diagnosis and high rates of chemotherapy resistance, which is synonymous with disease recurrence. Over the last two decades, an increasingly significant role of epigenetic mechanisms, in particular DNA methylation, has emerged. This review will discuss several of the most significant genes whose hypo/hypermethylation profiles are associated with chemoresistance. Aside from functionally elucidating and evaluating these epimutations, this review will discuss recent trials of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi). Finally, we will propose future directions that could enhance the feasibility of utilizing these candidate epimutations as clinical biomarkers.To perform this review, a comprehensive literature search based on our keywords was conducted across the online databases PubMed and Google Scholar for identifying relevant studies published up until August 2022.Epimutations affecting MLH1, MSH2, and Ras-association domain family 1 isoform A (DNA damage repair and apoptosis); ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 and methylation-controlled J (drug export); secreted frizzled-related proteins (Wnt/β-catenin signaling), neurocalcin delta (calcium and G protein-coupled receptor signaling), and zinc finger protein 671 all have potential as biomarkers for chemoresistance. However, specific uncertainties relating to these epimutations include histotype-specific differences, intrinsic versus acquired chemoresistance, and the interplay with complete surgical debulking. DNMTi for chemoresistant OC patients has shown some promise; however, issues surrounding their efficacy and dose-limiting toxicities remain; a personalized approach is required to maximize their effectiveness.Establishing a panel of aberrantly methylated chemoresistance-related genes to predict chemoresponsiveness and patients' suitability to DNMTi could significantly reduce OC recurrence, while improving DNMTi therapy viability. To achieve this, a large-scale prospective genome-wide DNA methylation profile study that spans different histotypes, includes paired samples (before and after chemotherapy), and integrates transcriptomic and methylomic analysis, is warranted.© 2023 The Authors.

"37123087","Epigenetic biomarkers for smoking cessation.","Addict Neurosci","Cigarette smoking has been associated with epigenetic alterations that may be reversible upon cessation. As the most-studied epigenetic modification, DNA methylation is strongly associated with smoking exposure, providing a potential mechanism that links smoking to adverse health outcomes. Here, we reviewed the reversibility of DNA methylation in accessible peripheral tissues, mainly blood, in relation to cigarette smoking cessation and the utility of DNA methylation as a biomarker signature to differentiate current, former, and never smokers and to quantify time since cessation. We summarized thousands of differentially methylated Cytosine-Guanine (CpG) dinucleotides and regions associated with smoking cessation from candidate gene and epigenome-wide association studies, as well as the prediction accuracy of the multi-CpG predictors for smoking status. Overall, there is robust evidence for DNA methylation signature of cigarette smoking cessation. However, there are still gaps to fill, including (1) cell-type heterogeneity in measuring blood DNA methylation; (2) underrepresentation of non-European ancestry populations; (3) limited longitudinal data to quantitatively measure DNA methylation after smoking cessation over time; and (4) limited data to study the impact of smoking cessation on other epigenetic features, noncoding RNAs, and histone modifications. Epigenetic machinery provides promising biomarkers that can improve success in smoking cessation in the clinical setting. To achieve this goal, larger and more-diverse samples with longitudinal measures of a broader spectrum of epigenetic marks will be essential to developing a robust DNA methylation biomarker assay, followed by meeting validation requirements for the assay before being implemented as a clinically useful tool."

In comparisons with paired normal lung tissues, dipeptidyl peptidase-like 6 (DPP6) has been identified as the most significantly hypermethylated CGI in LADC.DPP6is a protein that modulates A-type potassium channels in the somatodendritic compartments of neurons, which play a role in synaptic plasticity. Previous studies have showed thatDPP6is downregulated in cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia and melanoma, but upregulated in colon cancer, which is attributed to hyper- and hypomethylation, respectively. The present study investigated the methylation and expression levels ofDPP6and its prognostic value in patients with LADC. The DNA methylation and mRNA expression levels ofDPP6in surgically resected LADC tissues were examined by bisulfite pyrosequencing and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, respectively. The DNA methylation and mRNA expression levels ofDPP6were both significantly higher in LADC tissues compared with in normal lung tissues (n=25; P<0.0001). Overall and disease-free survival rates were significantly higher in LADC with high mRNA expression levels compared with those with low levels. In conclusion, epigenetic alterations inDPP6were significantly higher in LADC tissues compared with in normal lung tissues, which may contribute to the malignant features and worse prognosis of these patients.Copyright: © Munkhjargal et al."
"37122620","Brain region-specific genome-wide deoxyribonucleic acid methylation analysis in patients with Alzheimer's disease.","Front Mol Neurosci","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuropathology and cognitive decline and associated with age. The comprehensive deoxyribonucleic acid methylation (DNAm)-transcriptome profile association analysis conducted in this study aimed to establish whole-genome DNAm profiles and explore DNAm-related genes and their potential functions. More appropriate biomarkers were expected to be identified in terms of AD.Illumina 450KGSE59685 dataset AD (n= 54) and HC (n= 21) and ribonucleic-acid-sequencing data GSE118553 dataset AD patients (n= 21) and HCs (n= 13) were obtained from the gene expression omnibus database before a comprehensive DNAm-transcriptome profile association analysis, and we performed functional enrichment analysis by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses (KEGG). Three transgenic mice and three wild-type mice were used to validate the hub genes.A total of 18,104 DNAm sites in healthy controls (n= 21) and AD patients (n= 54) were surveyed across three brain regions (superior temporal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). With the addition of the transcriptome analysis, eight hypomethylated-related highly expressed genes and 61 hypermethylated-related lowly expressed genes were identified. Based on 69 shared differentially methylated genes (DMGs), the function enrichment analysis indicated Guanosine triphosphate enzymes (GTPase) regulator activity, a synaptic vesicle cycle, and tight junction functioning. Following this, mice-based models of AD were constructed, and five hub DMGs were verified, which represented a powerful, disease-specific DNAm signature for AD.The results revealed that the cross-brain region DNAm was altered in those with AD. The alterations in DNAm affected the target gene expression and participated in the key biological processes of AD. The study provides a valuable epigenetic resource for identifying DNAm-based diagnostic biomarkers, developing effective drugs, and studying AD pathogenesis.Copyright © 2023 Ren, Song, Zhang, Liu, Lv, Wang, Zhao and Li."
"37121742","Oxidative stress-induced TET1 upregulation mediates active DNA demethylation in human gastric epithelial cells.","J Toxicol Sci","The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is more vulnerable to effects by the outside environment, and experiences oxidative stress. A wide diversity of GI disorders can be partially attributed to oxidative stress. However, the mechanism of oxidative stress-caused GI pathological changes is not clear. In the present study, human gastric epithelial cells (hGECs) were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and oxidative stress was determined. The effect of oxidative stress on the levels of some antioxidative enzymes, proliferation, nuclear DNA damage, apoptosis, expression of ten-eleven translocation (TET), and level of DNA methylation was determined in these cells. The results showed that H2O2treatment caused oxidative stress, increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA), decreased the level of glutathione (GSH), inhibited proliferation, caused nuclear DNA damage and apoptosis, upregulated the expression of TET1 gene, and ultimately led to active DNA demethylation in hGECs. The present study presents a mechanism by which oxidative stress induces active DNA demethylation in hGECs. We propose that TET inhibitors can be used to restore the oxidative stress-induced DNA demethylation, and thus inhibit possible malignant transformation of GI cells."

"37119802","Tissue-specific chromatin binding patterns of C. elegans heterochromatin proteins HPL-1 and HPL-2 reveal differential roles in the regulation of gene expression.","Genetics","Heterochromatin is characterized by an enrichment of repetitive elements and low gene density and is often maintained in a repressed state across cell division and differentiation. The silencing is mainly regulated by repressive histone marks, such as H3K9 and H3K27 methylated forms and the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) family. Here, we analyzed in a tissue-specific manner the binding profile of the two HP1 homologs in Caenorhabditis elegans, HPL-1 and HPL-2, at the L4 developmental stage. We identified the genome-wide binding profile of intestinal and hypodermal HPL-2 and intestinal HPL-1 and compared them to heterochromatin marks and other features. HPL-2 associated preferentially to the distal arms of autosomes and correlated positively with methylated forms of H3K9 and H3K27. HPL-1 was also enriched in regions containing H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 but exhibited a more even distribution between autosome arms and centers. HPL-2 showed a differential tissue-specific enrichment for repetitive elements, conversely with HPL-1 that exhibited a poor association. Finally, we found a significant intersection of genomic regions bound by the BLMP-1/PRDM1 transcription factor and intestinal HPL-1, suggesting a co-repression role during cell differentiation. Our study uncovers both shared and singular properties of conserved HP1 proteins, providing information about genomic binding preferences in relation to their role as heterochromatic markers.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37116939","The histone H4K20 methyltransferase SUV4-20H1/KMT5B is required for multiciliated cell differentiation in Xenopus.","Life Sci Alliance","H4 lysine 20 dimethylation (H4K20me2) is the most abundant histone modification in vertebrate chromatin. It arises from sequential methylation of unmodified histone H4 proteins by the mono-methylating enzyme PR-SET7/KMT5A, followed by conversion to the dimethylated state by SUV4-20H (KMT5B/C) enzymes. We have blocked the deposition of this mark by depleting Xenopus embryos of SUV4-20H1/H2 methyltransferases. In the larval epidermis, this results in a severe loss of cilia in multiciliated cells (MCC), a key component of mucociliary epithelia. MCC precursor cells are correctly specified, amplify centrioles, but ultimately fail in ciliogenesis because of the perturbation of cytoplasmic processes. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling reveals that SUV4-20H1/H2-depleted ectodermal explants preferentially down-regulate the expression of several hundred ciliogenic genes. Further analysis demonstrated that knockdown of SUV4-20H1 alone is sufficient to generate the MCC phenotype and that its catalytic activity is needed for axoneme formation. Overexpression of the H4K20me1-specific histone demethylase PHF8/KDM7B also rescues the ciliogenic defect in a significant manner. Taken together, this indicates that the conversion of H4K20me1 to H4K20me2 by SUV4-20H1 is critical for the formation of cilia tufts.© 2023 Angerilli et al."
"37115492","Genome-wide DNA methylation landscape of four Chinese populations and epigenetic variation linked to Tibetan high-altitude adaptation.","Sci China Life Sci","DNA methylation (DNAm) is one of the major epigenetic mechanisms in humans and is important in diverse cellular processes. The variation of DNAm in the human population is related to both genetic and environmental factors. However, the DNAm profiles have not been investigated in the Chinese population of diverse ethnicities. Here, we performed double-strand bisulfite sequencing (DSBS) for 32 Chinese individuals representing four major ethnic groups including Han Chinese, Tibetan, Zhuang, and Mongolian. We identified a total of 604,649 SNPs and quantified DNAm at more than 14 million CpGs in the population. We found global DNAm-based epigenetic structure is different from the genetic structure of the population, and ethnic difference only partially explains the variation of DNAm. Surprisingly, non-ethnic-specific DNAm variations showed stronger correlation with the global genetic divergence than these ethnic-specific DNAm. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among these ethnic groups were found around genes in diverse biological processes. Especially, these DMR-genes between Tibetan and non-Tibetans were enriched around high-altitude genes including EPAS1 and EGLN1, suggesting DNAm alteration plays an important role in high-altitude adaptation. Our results provide the first batch of epigenetic maps for Chinese populations and the first evidence of the association of epigenetic changes with Tibetans' high-altitude adaptation.© 2023.

They have been identified and functionally characterized in a number of plant species, but very little is known inNeolamarckia cadamba, a 'miracle tree' for its fast growth and potential medicinal resource in Southeast Asia. In this study, a total of 85WRKYgenes were identified in the genome ofN. cadamba. They were divided into three groups according to their phylogenetic features, with the support of the characteristics of gene structures and conserved motifs of protein. TheNcWRKYgenes were unevenly distributed on 22 chromosomes, and there were two pairs of segmentally duplicated events. In addition, a number of putative cis-elements were identified in the promoter regions, of which hormone- and stress-related elements were shared in manyNcWRKYs. The transcript levels ofNcWRKYwere analyzed using the RNA-seq data, revealing distinct expression patterns in various tissues and at different stages of vascular development. Furthermore, 16 and 12NcWRKYgenes were confirmed to respond to various hormone treatments and two different abiotic stress treatments, respectively. Moreover, the content of cadambine, the active metabolite used for the various pharmacological activities found inN. cadamba,significantly increased after Methyl jasmonate treatment. In addition, expression ofNcWRKY64/74was obviously upregulated, suggesting that they may have a potential function of regulating the biosynthesis of cadambine in response to MeJA. Taken together, this study provides clues into the regulatory roles of theWRKYgene family inN. cadamba."
"37107631","An Update of Epigenetic Drugs for the Treatment of Cancers and Brain Diseases: A Comprehensive Review.","Genes (Basel)","Epigenetics has long been recognized as a significant field in biology and is defined as the investigation of any alteration in gene expression patterns that is not attributed to changes in the DNA sequences. Epigenetic marks, including histone modifications, non-coding RNAs, and DNA methylation, play crucial roles in gene regulation. Numerous studies in humans have been carried out on single-nucleotide resolution of DNA methylation, the CpG island, new histone modifications, and genome-wide nucleosome positioning. These studies indicate that epigenetic mutations and aberrant placement of these epigenetic marks play a critical role in causing the disease. Consequently, significant development has occurred in biomedical research in identifying epigenetic mechanisms, their interactions, and changes in health and disease conditions. The purpose of this review article is to provide comprehensive information about the different types of diseases caused by alterations in epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation or methylation. Recent studies reported that epigenetics could influence the evolution of human cancer via aberrant methylation of gene promoter regions, which is associated with reduced gene function. Furthermore, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the DNA methylation process as well as histone acetyltransferases (HATs)/histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone methyltransferases (HMTs)/demethylases (HDMs) in histone modifications play important roles both in the catalysis and inhibition of target gene transcription and in many other DNA processes such as repair, replication, and recombination. Dysfunction in these enzymes leads to epigenetic disorders and, as a result, various diseases such as cancers and brain diseases. Consequently, the knowledge of how to modify aberrant DNA methylation as well as aberrant histone acetylation or methylation via inhibitors by using epigenetic drugs can be a suitable therapeutic approach for a number of diseases. Using the synergistic effects of DNA methylation and histone modification inhibitors, it is hoped that many epigenetic defects will be treated in the future. Numerous studies have demonstrated a link between epigenetic marks and their effects on brain and cancer diseases. Designing appropriate drugs could provide novel strategies for the management of these diseases in the near future."

However, the genome-wide discovery ofSRSfamily genes and their involvement in abiotic stress-related activities in cassava have not been documented. A genome-wide search strategy was used to identify eight family members of theSRSgene family in cassava (Manihot esculentaCrantz). Based on their evolutionary linkages, allMeSRSgenes featured homologous RING-like zinc finger and IXGH domains. Genetic architecture and conserved motif analysis validated the categorization ofMeSRSgenes into four groups. Eight pairs of segmental duplications were detected, resulting in an increase in the number ofMeSRSgenes. Orthologous studies ofSRSgenes among cassava and three different plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana,Oryza sativa, andPopulus trichocarpa) provided important insights into the probable history of theMeSRSgene family. The functionality ofMeSRSgenes was elucidated through the prediction of protein-protein interaction networks andcis-acting domains. RNA-seq data demonstrated tissue/organ expression selectivity and preference of theMeSRSgenes. Furthermore, qRT-PCR investigation ofMeSRSgene expression after exposure to salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) hormone treatments, as well as salt (NaCl) and osmotic (polyethylene glycol, PEG) stresses, showed their stress-responsive patterns. This genome-wide characterization and identification of the evolutionary relationships and expression profiles of the cassavaMeSRSfamily genes will be helpful for further research into this gene family and its function in stress response. It may also assist future agricultural efforts to increase the stress tolerance of cassava."

We performed cell-type specific methylome-wide association study of neonatal blood (N = 333) from individuals who later in life developed schizophrenia and controls. Suggestively significant associations (P < 1.0 × 10-6) were detected in all cell-types and in whole blood with methylome-wide significant associations in monocytes (P = 2.85 × 10-9-4.87 × 10-9), natural killer cells (P = 1.72 × 10-9-7.82 × 10-9) and B cells (P = 3.8 × 10-9). Validation of methylation findings in post-mortem brains (N = 596) from independent schizophrenia cases and controls showed significant enrichment of transcriptional differences (enrichment ratio = 1.98-3.23, P = 2.3 × 10-3-1.0 × 10-5), with specific highly significant differential expression for, for example, BDNF (t = -6.11, P = 1.90 × 10-9). In addition, expression difference in brain significantly predicted schizophrenia (multiple correlation = 0.15-0.22, P = 3.6 × 10-4-4.5 × 10-8). In summary, using a unique design combining pre-disease onset (neonatal) blood methylomic data and post-disease onset (post-mortem) brain transcriptional data, we have identified genes of likely functional relevance that are associated with schizophrenia susceptibility, rather than confounding disease associated artifacts. The identified loci may be of clinical value as a methylation-based biomarker for early detection of increased schizophrenia susceptibility.© 2023.

"37106015","The genome-wide mutational consequences of DNA hypomethylation.","Sci Rep","DNA methylation is important for establishing and maintaining cell identity and for genomic stability. This is achieved by regulating the accessibility of regulatory and transcriptional elements and the compaction of subtelomeric, centromeric, and other inactive genomic regions. Carcinogenesis is accompanied by a global loss in DNA methylation, which facilitates the transformation of cells. Cancer hypomethylation may also cause genomic instability, for example through interference with the protective function of telomeres and centromeres. However, understanding the role(s) of hypomethylation in tumor evolution is incomplete because the precise mutational consequences of global hypomethylation have thus far not been systematically assessed. Here we made genome-wide inventories of all possible genetic variation that accumulates in single cells upon the long-term global hypomethylation by CRISPR interference-mediated conditional knockdown of DNMT1. Depletion of DNMT1 resulted in a genomewide reduction in DNA methylation. The degree of DNA methylation loss was similar to that observed in many cancer types. Hypomethylated cells showed reduced proliferation rates, increased transcription of genes, reactivation of the inactive X-chromosome and abnormal nuclear morphologies. Prolonged hypomethylation was accompanied by increased chromosomal instability. However, there was no increase in mutational burden, enrichment for certain mutational signatures or accumulation of structural variation to the genome. In conclusion, the primary consequence of hypomethylation is genomic instability, which in cancer leads to increased tumor heterogeneity and thereby fuels cancer evolution.© 2023. The Author(s)."

"37101297","ADHD genetic burden associates with older epigenetic age: mediating roles of education, behavioral and sociodemographic factors among older adults.","Clin Epigenetics","Shortened lifespans are associated with having Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which is likely mediated by related behavioral and sociodemographic factors that are also associated with accelerated physiological aging. Such factors include exhibiting more depressive symptoms, more cigarette smoking, higher body mass index, lower educational attainment, lower income in adulthood, and more challenges with cognitive processes compared to the general population. A higher polygenic score for ADHD (ADHD-PGS) is associated with having more characteristic features of ADHD. The degree to which (1) the ADHD-PGS associates with an epigenetic biomarker developed to predict accelerated aging and earlier mortality is unknown, as are whether (2) an association would be mediated by behavioral and sociodemographic correlates of ADHD, or (3) an association would be mediated first by educational attainment, then by behavioral and sociodemographic correlates. We evaluated these relationships in a population-based sample from the US Health and Retirement Study, among N = 2311 adults age 50 and older, of European-ancestry, with blood-based epigenetic and genetic data. The ADHD-PGS was calculated from a prior genomewide meta-analysis. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation levels that index biological aging and earlier age of mortality were quantified by a blood-based biomarker called GrimAge. We used a structural equation modeling approach to test associations with single and multi-mediation effects of behavioral and contextual indicators on GrimAge, adjusted for covariates.The ADHD-PGS was significantly and directly associated with GrimAge when adjusting for covariates. In single mediation models, the effect of the ADHD-PGS on GrimAge was partially mediated via smoking, depressive symptoms, and education. In multi-mediation models, the effect of the ADHD-PGS on GrimAge was mediated first through education, then smoking, depressive symptoms, BMI, and income.Findings have implications for geroscience research in elucidating lifecourse pathways through which ADHD genetic burden and symptoms can alter risks for accelerated aging and shortened lifespans, when indexed by an epigenetic biomarker. More education appears to play a central role in attenuating negative effects on epigenetic aging from behavioral and sociodemographic risk factors related to ADHD. We discuss implications for the potential behavioral and sociodemographic mediators that may attenuate negative biological system effects.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37101286","Epigenetic modifier alpha-ketoglutarate modulates aberrant gene body methylation and hydroxymethylation marks in diabetic heart.","Epigenetics Chromatin","Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of death in diabetic patients. Hyperglycemic myocardial microenvironment significantly alters chromatin architecture and the transcriptome, resulting in aberrant activation of signaling pathways in a diabetic heart. Epigenetic marks play vital roles in transcriptional reprogramming during the development of DCM. The current study is aimed to profile genome-wide DNA (hydroxy)methylation patterns in the hearts of control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats and decipher the effect of modulation of DNA methylation by alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG), a TET enzyme cofactor, on the progression of DCM.Diabetes was induced in male adult Wistar rats with an intraperitoneal injection of STZ. Diabetic and vehicle control animals were randomly divided into groups with/without AKG treatment. Cardiac function was monitored by performing cardiac catheterization. Global methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) patterns were mapped in the Left ventricular tissue of control and diabetic rats with the help of an enrichment-based (h)MEDIP-sequencing technique by using antibodies specific for 5mC and 5hmC. Sequencing data were validated by performing (h)MEDIP-qPCR analysis at the gene-specific level, and gene expression was analyzed by qPCR. The mRNA and protein expression of enzymes involved in the DNA methylation and demethylation cycle were analyzed by qPCR and western blotting. Global 5mC and 5hmC levels were also assessed in high glucose-treated DNMT3B knockdown H9c2 cells.We found the increased expression of DNMT3B, MBD2, and MeCP2 with a concomitant accumulation of 5mC and 5hmC, specifically in gene body regions of diabetic rat hearts compared to the control. Calcium signaling was the most significantly affected pathway by cytosine modifications in the diabetic heart. Additionally, hypermethylated gene body regions were associated with Rap1, apelin, and phosphatidyl inositol signaling, while metabolic pathways were most affected by hyperhydroxymethylation. AKG supplementation in diabetic rats reversed aberrant methylation patterns and restored cardiac function. Hyperglycemia also increased 5mC and 5hmC levels in H9c2 cells, which was normalized by DNMT3B knockdown or AKG supplementation.This study demonstrates that reverting hyperglycemic damage to cardiac tissue might be possible by erasing adverse epigenetic signatures by supplementing epigenetic modulators such as AKG along with an existing antidiabetic treatment regimen.© 2023.

"37101222","An epigenome-wide analysis of socioeconomic position and tumor DNA methylation in breast cancer patients.","Clin Epigenetics","Disadvantaged socioeconomic position (SEP), including lower educational attainment and household income, may influence cancer risk and outcomes. We hypothesized that DNA methylation could function as an intermediary epigenetic mechanism that internalizes and reflects the biological impact of SEP.Based on tumor DNA methylation data from the Illumina 450 K array from 694 breast cancer patients in the Women's Circle of Health Study, we conducted an epigenome-wide analysis in relation to educational attainment and household income. Functional impact of the identified CpG sites was explored in silico using data from publicly available databases.We identified 25 CpG sites associated with household income at an array-wide significance level, but none with educational attainment. Two of the top CpG sites, cg00452016 and cg01667837, were in promoter regions of NNT and GPR37, respectively, with multiple epigenetic regulatory features identified in each region. NNT is involved in β-adrenergic stress signaling and inflammatory responses, whereas GPR37 is involved in neurological and immune responses. For both loci, gene expression was inversely correlated to the levels of DNA methylation. The associations were consistent between Black and White women and did not differ by tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status.In a large breast cancer patient population, we discovered evidence of the significant biological impact of household income on the tumor DNA methylome, including genes in the β-adrenergic stress and immune response pathways. Our findings support biological effects of socioeconomic status on tumor tissues, which might be relevant to cancer development and progression.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37100093","Intestinal epigenotype of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) associates with tenacibaculosis and gut microbiota composition.","Genomics","It remains a challenge to obtain the desired phenotypic traits in aquacultural production of Atlantic salmon, and part of the challenge might come from the effect that host-associated microorganisms have on the fish phenotype. To manipulate the microbiota towards the desired host traits, it is critical to understand the factors that shape it. The bacterial gut microbiota composition can vary greatly among fish, even when reared in the same closed system. While such microbiota differences can be linked to diseases, the molecular effect of disease on host-microbiota interactions and the potential involvement of epigenetic factors remain largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the DNA methylation differences associated with a tenacibaculosis outbreak and microbiota displacement in the gut of Atlantic salmon. Using Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) of distal gut tissue from 20 salmon, we compared the genome-wide DNA methylation levels between uninfected individuals and sick fish suffering from tenacibaculosis and microbiota displacement. We discovered >19,000 differentially methylated cytosine sites, often located in differentially methylated regions, and aggregated around genes. The 68 genes connected to the most significant regions had functions related to the ulcerous disease such as epor and slc48a1a but also included prkcda and LOC106590732 whose orthologs are linked to microbiota changes in other species. Although the expression level was not analysed, our epigenetic analysis suggests specific genes potentially involved in host-microbiota interactions and more broadly it highlights the value of considering epigenetic factors in efforts to manipulate the microbiota of farmed fish.Copyright © 2023 The Authors.

So far, there have been only a very limited number of studies assessing the epigenetics component contributing to the pathophysiology of these disorders, but not a single study assessing this at a genome-wide level. Here, we implemented a generic high throughput epigenomics approach, using methylated DNA sequencing (MeD-seq) of LpnPI digested fragments to identify potential epigenomic targets associated with MDS subtypes. Our results highlighted that PCDHG and ZNF gene families harbor potential epigenomic targets, which have been shown to be differentially methylated in a variety of comparisons between different MDS subtypes. Specifically, CpG islands, transcription start sites and post-transcriptional start sites within ZNF124, ZNF497 and PCDHG family are differentially methylated with fold change above 3,5. Overall, these findings highlight important aspects of the epigenomic component of MDS syndromes pathogenesis and the pharmacoepigenomic basis to the hypomethylating agents drug treatment response, while this generic high throughput whole epigenome sequencing approach could be readily implemented to other genetic diseases with a strong epigenetic component.© 2023.

In this study, we developed an iGEM (iPS cell-based global epigenetic modulation) detection assay using human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells that express a fluorescently labeled methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD), which enables a high-throughput screening of epigenetic teratogens/mutagens. 135 chemicals with known cardiotoxicity and carcinogenicity were categorized according to the MBD signal intensity, which reflects the degree of nuclear spatial distribution/concentration of DNA methylation. Further biological characterization through machine-learning analysis that integrated genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression profiling, and knowledge-based pathway analysis revealed that chemicals with hyperactive MBD signals strongly associated their effects on DNA methylation and expression of genes involved in cell cycle and development. These results demonstrated that our MBD-based integrated analytical system is a powerful framework for detecting epigenetic compounds and providing mechanism insights of pharmaceutical development for sustainable human health.© 2023.

Foetal DNA methylation changes could underlie these associations. Within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics Consortium, we meta-analysed epigenome-wide associations of circulating vitamin B12 concentrations in mothers during pregnancy (n = 2,420) or cord blood (n = 1,029), with cord blood DNA methylation. Maternal and newborn vitamin B12 concentrations were associated with DNA methylation at 109 and 7 CpGs, respectively (False Discovery RateP-value <0.05). Persistent associations with DNA methylation in the peripheral blood of up to 482 children aged 4-10 y were observed for 40.7% of CpGs associated with maternal vitamin B12 and 57.1% of CpGs associated with newborn vitamin B12. Of the CpGs identified in the maternal meta-analyses, 4.6% were associated with either birth weight or gestational age in a previous work. For the newborn meta-analysis, this was the case for 14.3% of the identified CpGs. Also, of the CpGs identified in the newborn meta-analysis, 14.3% and 28.6%, respectively, were associated with childhood cognitive skills and nonverbal IQ. Of the 109 CpGs associated with maternal vitamin B12, 18.3% were associated with nearby gene expression. In this study, we showed that maternal and newborn vitamin B12 concentrations are associated with DNA methylation at multiple CpGs in offspring blood (PFDR<0.05). Whether this differential DNA methylation underlies associations of vitamin B12 concentrations with child health outcomes, such as birth weight, gestational age, and childhood cognition, should be further examined in future studies."
"37090651","SMYD2 Regulates Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Phenotypic Switching and Intimal Hyperplasia via Interaction with Myocardin.","Res Sq","The SET and MYND domain-containing protein 2 (SMYD2) is a histone lysine methyltransferase that has been reported to regulate carcinogenesis and inflammation. However, its role in vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) homeostasis and vascular diseases has not been determined. Here, we investigated the role of SMYD2 in VSMC phenotypic modulation and vascular intimal hyperplasia and elucidated the underlying mechanism. We observed that SMYD2 expression was downregulated in injured carotid arteries in mice and phenotypically modulated VSMCs in vitro. Using a SMC-specific Smyd2 knockout mouse model, we found that Smyd2 ablation in VSMCs exacerbates neointima formation after vascular injury in vivo. Conversely, Smyd2 overexpression inhibits VSMC proliferation and migration in vitro and attenuates arterial narrowing in injured vessels in mice. Smyd2 downregulation promotes VSMC phenotypic switching accompanied with enhanced proliferation and migration. Mechanistically, genome-wide transcriptome analysis and loss/gain-of-function studies revealed that SMYD2 up-regulates VSMC contractile gene expression and suppresses VSMC proliferation and migration, in part, by promoting expression and transactivation of the master transcription cofactor myocardin. In addition, myocardin directly interacts with SMYD2, thereby facilitating SMYD2 recruitment to the CArG regions of SMC contractile gene promoters and leading to an open chromatin status around SMC contractile gene promoters via SMYD2-mediated H3K4 methylation. Hence, we conclude that SMYD2 is a novel regulator of VSMC contractile phenotype and intimal hyperplasia via a myocardin-dependent epigenetic regulatory mechanism and may be a potential therapeutic target for occlusive vascular diseases."
"37088033","Umbilical cord DNA methylation is associated with body mass index trajectories from birth to adolescence.","EBioMedicine","DNA methylation (DNAm) in cord blood has been associated with various prenatal factors and birth outcomes. This study sought to fill an important knowledge gap: the link of cord DNAm with child postnatal growth trajectories from birth to age 18 years (y).Using data from a US predominantly urban, low-income, multi-ethnic birth cohort (N = 831), we first applied non-parametric methods to identify body-mass-index percentile (BMIPCT) trajectories from birth to age 18 y (the outcome); then, conducted epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of the outcome, interrogating over 700,000 CpG sites profiled by the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Multivariate linear regression models and likelihood ratio tests (LRT) were applied to examine the DNAm-outcome association in the overall sample and sex strata.We identified four distinct patterns of BMIPCT trajectories: normal weight (NW), Early overweight or obesity (OWO), Late OWO, and normal to very late OWO. DNAm at CpG18582997 annotated to TPGS1, CpG15241084 of TLR7, and cg24350936 of RAB31 were associated with BMIPCT at birth-to-3 y, 10 y, and 14 y, respectively (LRT FDR < 0.05 for all).In this prospective birth cohort study, we identified 4 distinct and robust patterns of growth trajectories from birth to 18 y, which were associated with variations in cord blood DNAm at genes implicated in inflammation induction pathways. These findings, if further replicated, raise the possibility that these DNAm markers along with early assessment of BMIPCT trajectories may help identify young children at high-risk for obesity later in life.Detailed in the Acknowledgements section.Copyright © 2023.

"37085889","The X-factor in ART: does the use of assisted reproductive technologies influence DNA methylation on the X chromosome?","Hum Genomics","Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) may perturb DNA methylation (DNAm) in early embryonic development. Although a handful of epigenome-wide association studies of ART have been published, none have investigated CpGs on the X chromosome. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged one of the largest collections of mother-father-newborn trios of ART and non-ART (natural) conceptions to date to investigate sex-specific DNAm differences on the X chromosome. The discovery cohort consisted of 982 ART and 963 non-ART trios from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). To verify our results from the MoBa cohort, we used an external cohort of 149 ART and 58 non-ART neonates from the Australian 'Clinical review of the Health of adults conceived following Assisted Reproductive Technologies' (CHART) study. The Illumina EPIC array was used to measure DNAm in both datasets. In the MoBa cohort, we performed a set of X-chromosome-wide association studies ('XWASs' hereafter) to search for sex-specific DNAm differences between ART and non-ART newborns. We tested several models to investigate the influence of various confounders, including parental DNAm. We also searched for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and regions of co-methylation flanking the most significant CpGs. Additionally, we ran an analogous model to our main model on the external CHART dataset.In the MoBa cohort, we found more differentially methylated CpGs and DMRs in girls than boys. Most of the associations persisted after controlling for parental DNAm and other confounders. Many of the significant CpGs and DMRs were in gene-promoter regions, and several of the genes linked to these CpGs are expressed in tissues relevant for both ART and sex (testis, placenta, and fallopian tube). We found no support for parental DNAm-dependent features as an explanation for the observed associations in the newborns. The most significant CpG in the boys-only analysis was in UBE2DNL, which is expressed in testes but with unknown function. The most significant CpGs in the girls-only analysis were in EIF2S3 and AMOT. These three loci also displayed differential DNAm in the CHART cohort.Genes that co-localized with the significant CpGs and DMRs associated with ART are implicated in several key biological processes (e.g., neurodevelopment) and disorders (e.g., intellectual disability and autism). These connections are particularly compelling in light of previous findings indicating that neurodevelopmental outcomes differ in ART-conceived children compared to those naturally conceived.© 2023.

"37085539","3D genome mapping identifies subgroup-specific chromosome conformations and tumor-dependency genes in ependymoma.","Nat Commun","Ependymoma is a tumor of the brain or spinal cord. The two most common and aggressive molecular groups of ependymoma are the supratentorial ZFTA-fusion associated and the posterior fossa ependymoma group A. In both groups, tumors occur mainly in young children and frequently recur after treatment. Although molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases have recently been uncovered, they remain difficult to target and innovative therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Here, we use genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), complemented with CTCF and H3K27ac ChIP-seq, as well as gene expression and DNA methylation analysis in primary and relapsed ependymoma tumors, to identify chromosomal conformations and regulatory mechanisms associated with aberrant gene expression. In particular, we observe the formation of new topologically associating domains ('neo-TADs') caused by structural variants, group-specific 3D chromatin loops, and the replacement of CTCF insulators by DNA hyper-methylation. Through inhibition experiments, we validate that genes implicated by these 3D genome conformations are essential for the survival of patient-derived ependymoma models in a group-specific manner. Thus, this study extends our ability to reveal tumor-dependency genes by 3D genome conformations even in tumors that lack targetable genetic alterations.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37085538","Role of DNA methylation in the relationship between glioma risk factors and glioma incidence: a two-step Mendelian randomization study.","Sci Rep","Genetic evidence suggests glioma risk is altered by leukocyte telomere length, allergic disease (asthma, hay fever or eczema), alcohol consumption, childhood obesity, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and triglyceride levels. DNA methylation (DNAm) variation influences many of these glioma-related traits and is an established feature of glioma. Yet the causal relationship between DNAm variation with both glioma incidence and glioma risk factors is unknown. We applied a two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) approach and several sensitivity analyses (including colocalization and Steiger filtering) to assess the association of DNAm with glioma risk factors and glioma incidence. We used data from a recently published catalogue of germline genetic variants robustly associated with DNAm variation in blood (32,851 participants) and data from a genome-wide association study of glioma risk (12,488 cases and 18,169 controls, sub-divided into 6191 glioblastoma cases and 6305 non-glioblastoma cases). MR evidence indicated that DNAm at 3 CpG sites (cg01561092, cg05926943, cg01584448) in one genomic region (HEATR3) had a putative association with glioma and glioblastoma risk (False discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). Steiger filtering provided evidence against reverse causation. Colocalization presented evidence against genetic confounding and suggested that differential DNAm at the 3 CpG sites and glioma were driven by the same genetic variant. MR provided little evidence to suggest that DNAm acts as a mediator on the causal pathway between risk factors previously examined and glioma onset. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use MR to appraise the causal link of DNAm with glioma risk factors and glioma onset. Subsequent analyses are required to improve the robustness of our results and rule out horizontal pleiotropy.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37081121","Ecological insights into soil health according to the genomic traits and environment-wide associations of bacteria in agricultural soils.","ISME Commun","Soil microbiomes are sensitive to current and previous soil conditions, and bacterial 'bioindicators' of biological, physical, and chemical soil properties have considerable potential for soil health assessment. However, the lack of ecological or physiological information for most soil microorganisms limits our ability to interpret the associations of bioindicators and, thus, their utility for guiding management. We identified bioindicators of tillage intensity and twelve soil properties used to rate soil health using a 16S rRNA gene-based survey of farmland across North America. We then inferred the genomic traits of bioindicators and evaluated their environment-wide associations (EWAS) with respect to agricultural management practice, disturbance, and plant associations with 89 studies from agroecosystems. Most bioindicators were either positively correlated with biological properties (e.g., organic matter) or negatively correlated with physical and chemical properties. Higher soil health ratings corresponded with smaller genome size and higher coding density, while lower ratings corresponded with larger genomes and higher rrn copy number. Community-weighted genome size explained most variation in health ratings. EWAS linked prominent bioindicators with the impacts of environmental disturbances. Our findings provide ecological insights into bioindicators of soil properties relevant to soil health management, illustrating the tight coupling of microbiome and soil function.© 2023.

DNA samples collected and stored in clinical biobanks over the past years are an important source for future epigenetic studies. Isolated gDNA is considered stable when stored at low temperatures for several years. However, the effect of multiple use and the associated repeated thawing of long-term stored DNA samples on DNA methylation patterns has not yet been investigated. In this study, we examined the influence of up to 10 freeze and thaw cycles on global DNA methylation by comparing genome-wide methylation profiles. DNA samples from 19 healthy volunteers were either frozen at -80°C or subjected to up to 10 freeze and thaw cycles. Genome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed after 0, 1, 3, 5, or 10 thaw cycles using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Evaluation of the global DNA methylation profile by beta-value density plots and multidimensional scaling plots revealed an expected clear participant-dependent variability, but a very low variability depending on the freeze and thaw cycles. In accordance, no significant difference in any of the methylated cytosine/guanine sites studied could be detected in the performed statistical analyses. Our results suggest that long-term frozen DNA samples are still suitable for epigenetic studies after multiple thaw cycles."

However, the role of histone H3K36 methylation in retinal development is not clear. We examined the role of H3K36 methylation by loss-of-function analysis of H3K36me1/2 demethylases, Fbxl10, and Fbxl11. We analyzed the effect of knockout of these genes in the developing and mature retina on retinal development. Knockout of Fbxl10 specifically in the developing retina did not result in gross developmental abnormalities. Although adult rod photoreceptor-specific knockout of Fbxl11 in mature retinas did not result in morphological abnormalities, Fbxl11 knockout in developing retinas increased apoptosis, suppressed the proliferation of retinal progenitor cells, and resulted in microphthalmia. Morphological analysis revealed perturbed differentiation of rod photoreceptor and bipolar cells. RNA-seq of retinas at P7 showed markedly decreased expression of genes characterizing rod photoreceptor and bipolar cells in Fbxl11-knockout retinas. In addition, perturbation of alternative splicing increased intron retention in Fbxl11-knockout retinas. Genome-wide evaluation of the H3K36 methylation status revealed that Fbxl11 knockout altered the distribution of H3K36me2/3 in genes important for rod photoreceptor development. Taken together, we show that Fbxl11 plays pivotal roles in the development of retinal late-born cell types and may contribute to tight control of H3K36 methylation during retinal development.© 2023 Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd."
"37043855","An analysis of differentially expressed and differentially m6A-modified transcripts in soybean roots treated with lead.","J Hazard Mater","Lead is one of the most common toxic heavy metal pollutants in nature, and exposure to lead can cause serious toxicity to many organisms. In this study, we collected root growth data from soybean plants exposed to lead for seven days and confirmed that lead significantly inhibited root growth. We performed a transcriptome-wide m6A methylation analysis to study the response of soybean RNA methylation groups to lead. The m6A modified regions were enriched near the 3'UTR region and stop codon, and m6A methylation was positively correlated with transcript abundance. In the presence of lead, the transcriptome range of m6A RNA methylation peaks increased, and we identified 1144 m6A modification peaks and 1094 differentially expressed genes. The integration of m6A methylation and transcriptomic results enabled us to identify 16 candidate genes whose transcripts were differentially methylated and differentially expressed under lead stress. Annotation results suggest that these genes may promote abiotic stress tolerance by impacting lead uptake, transport, and accumulation through ROS pathways, enzymes, transporters, and hormones. These results provide candidate genes for future studies of lead stress tolerance mechanisms in soybean roots and provide genetic resources for studying plant heavy metal stress in soybean breeding.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Although recent studies have suggested that 6mA is present in multiple model organisms and is dynamically regulated during development, the genomic features of 6mA in avian species have yet to be elucidated. 6mA immunoprecipitation sequencing approach was used to analysis the distribution and function of 6mA in the muscle genomic DNA during embryonic chicken development. 6mA immunoprecipitation sequencing was combined with transcriptomic sequencing to reveal the role of 6mA in the regulation of gene expression and to explore possible pathways by which 6mA is involved in muscle development. We here provide evidence that 6mA modification exists widely throughout the chicken genome, and show preliminary data regarding genome-wide distribution of this epigenetic mark. Gene expression was shown to be inhibited by 6mA modification in promoter regions. In addition, the promoters of some genes related to development were modified by 6mA, indicating that 6mA may be involved in embryonic chicken development. Furthermore, 6mA may participate in muscle development and immune function by regulating HSPB8 and OASL expression. Our study improves our understanding of the distribution and function of 6mA modification in higher organisms and provide new information about differences between mammals and other vertebrates. These findings demonstrate an epigenetic role for 6mA in gene expression and potential involvement in chicken muscle development. Furthermore, the results suggest a potential epigenetic role for 6mA in avian embryonic development.Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Autism etiology is complex, and heritability is not explained by genetics alone. Understanding paternal gametic epigenetic contributions to autism could help fill this knowledge gap. In the present study, we explored whether paternal autistic traits, and the sperm epigenome, were associated with autistic traits in children at 36 months enrolled in the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) cohort. EARLI is a pregnancy cohort that recruited and enrolled pregnant women in the first half of pregnancy who already had a child with ASD. After maternal enrollment, EARLI fathers were approached and asked to provide a semen specimen. Participants were included in the present study if they had genotyping, sperm methylation data, and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) score data available. Using the CHARM array, we performed genome-scale methylation analyses on DNA from semen samples contributed by EARLI fathers. The SRS-a 65-item questionnaire measuring social communication deficits on a quantitative scale-was used to evaluate autistic traits in EARLI fathers (n = 45) and children (n = 31). We identified 94 significant child SRS-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs), and 14 significant paternal SRS-associated DMRs (fwer p < 0.05). Many child SRS-associated DMRs were annotated to genes implicated in ASD and neurodevelopment. Six DMRs overlapped across the two outcomes (fwer p < 0.1), and, 16 DMRs overlapped with previous child autistic trait findings at 12 months of age (fwer p < 0.05). Child SRS-associated DMRs contained CpG sites independently found to be differentially methylated in postmortem brains of individuals with and without autism. These findings suggest paternal germline methylation is associated with autistic traits in 3-year-old offspring. These prospective results for autism-associated traits, in a cohort with a family history of ASD, highlight the potential importance of sperm epigenetic mechanisms in autism.© 2023.

"37107654","Epigenetic Alterations of Brain Non-Neuronal Cells in Major Mental Diseases.","Genes (Basel)","The tissue-specific expression and epigenetic dysregulation of many genes in cells derived from the postmortem brains of patients have been reported to provide a fundamental biological framework for major mental diseases such as autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. However, until recently, the impact of non-neuronal brain cells, which arises due to cell-type-specific alterations, has not been adequately scrutinized; this is because of the absence of techniques that directly evaluate their functionality. With the emergence of single-cell technologies, such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and other novel techniques, various studies have now started to uncover the cell-type-specific expression and DNA methylation regulation of many genes (e.g.,TREM2,MECP2,SLC1A2,TGFB2,NTRK2,S100B,KCNJ10,andHMGB1, and several complement genes such asC1q,C3,C3R, andC4) in the non-neuronal brain cells involved in the pathogenesis of mental diseases. Additionally, several lines of experimental evidence indicate that inflammation and inflammation-induced oxidative stress, as well as many insidious/latent infectious elements including the gut microbiome, alter the expression status and the epigenetic landscapes of brain non-neuronal cells. Here, we present supporting evidence highlighting the importance of the contribution of the brain's non-neuronal cells (in particular, microglia and different types of astrocytes) in the pathogenesis of mental diseases. Furthermore, we also address the potential impacts of the gut microbiome in the dysfunction of enteric and brain glia, as well as astrocytes, which, in turn, may affect neuronal functions in mental disorders. Finally, we present evidence that supports that microbiota transplantations from the affected individuals or mice provoke the corresponding disease-like behavior in the recipient mice, while specific bacterial species may have beneficial effects."
"37130894","Associations of stress and stress-related psychiatric disorders with GrimAge acceleration: review and suggestions for future work.","Transl Psychiatry","The notion of ""biological aging"" as distinct from chronological aging has been of increasing interest in psychiatry, and many studies have explored associations of stress and psychiatric illness with accelerated biological aging. The ""epigenetic clocks"" are one avenue of this research, wherein ""biological age"" is estimated using DNA methylation data from specific CpG dinucleotide sites within the human genome. Many iterations of the epigenetic clocks have been developed, but the GrimAge clock continues to stand out for its ability to predict morbidity and mortality. Several studies have now explored associations of stress, PTSD, and MDD with GrimAge acceleration (GrimAA). While stress, PTSD, and MDD are distinct psychiatric entities, they may share common mechanisms underlying accelerated biological aging. Yet, no one has offered a review of the evidence on associations of stress and stress-related psychopathology with GrimAA. In this review, we identify nine publications on associations of stress, PTSD, and MDD with GrimAA. We find that results are mixed both within and across each of these exposures. However, we also find that analytic methods - and specifically, the choice of covariates - vary widely between studies. To address this, we draw upon popular methods from the field of clinical epidemiology to offer (1) a systematic framework for covariate selection, and (2) an approach to results reporting that facilitates analytic consensus. Although covariate selection will differ by the research question, we encourage researchers to consider adjustment for tobacco, alcohol use, physical activity, race, sex, adult socioeconomic status, medical comorbidity, and blood cell composition.© 2023.

Using 18 age-associated clinical biomarkers, we computed three BA measures (Klemera-Doubal method [KDM], PhenoAge, homeostatic dysregulation [HD]) and assessed their associations with incidence of any cancer and five common cancers (breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, and melanoma) using Cox proportional-hazards models.A total of 35,426 incident cancers were documented during a median follow-up of 10.9 years. Adjusting for common cancer risk factors, 1-standard deviation (SD) increment in the age-adjusted KDM (hazard ratio = 1.04, 95% confidence interval = 1.03-1.05), age-adjusted PhenoAge (1.09, 1.07-1.10), and HD (1.02, 1.01-1.03) was significantly associated with a higher risk of any cancer. All BA measures were also associated with increased risks of lung and colorectal cancers, but only PhenoAge was associated with breast cancer risk. Furthermore, we observed an inverse association between BA measures and prostate cancer, although it was attenuated after removing glycated hemoglobin and serum glucose from the BA algorithms.Advanced BA quantified by clinical biomarkers is associated with increased risks of any cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer.© 2023.

"37118759","Associations of socioeconomic disparities with buccal DNA-methylation measures of biological aging.","Clin Epigenetics","Individuals who are socioeconomically disadvantaged are at increased risk for aging-related diseases and perform less well on tests of cognitive function. The weathering hypothesis proposes that these disparities in physical and cognitive health arise from an acceleration of biological processes of aging. Theories of how life adversity is biologically embedded identify epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation (DNAm), as a mechanistic interface between the environment and health. Consistent with the weathering hypothesis and theories of biological embedding, recently developed DNAm algorithms have revealed profiles reflective of more advanced aging and lower cognitive function among socioeconomically-at-risk groups. These DNAm algorithms were developed using blood-DNA, but social and behavioral science research commonly collect saliva or cheek-swab DNA. This discrepancy is a potential barrier to research to elucidate mechanisms through which socioeconomic disadvantage affects aging and cognition. We therefore tested if social gradients observed in blood DNAm measures could be reproduced using buccal-cell DNA obtained from cheek swabs.We analyzed three DNAm measures of biological aging and one DNAm measure of cognitive performance, all of which showed socioeconomic gradients in previous studies: the PhenoAge and GrimAge DNAm clocks, DunedinPACE, and Epigenetic-g. We first computed blood-buccal cross-tissue correlations in n = 21 adults (GEO111165). Cross-tissue correlations were low-to-moderate (r = .25 to r = .48). We next conducted analyses of socioeconomic gradients using buccal DNAm data from SOEP-G (n = 1128, 57% female; age mean = 42 yrs, SD = 21.56, range 0-72). Associations of socioeconomic status with DNAm measures of aging were in the expected direction, but were smaller as compared to reports from blood DNAm datasets (r = - .08 to r = - .13).Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with DNAm indicators of worse physical health. However, relatively low cross-tissue correlations and attenuated effect sizes for socioeconomic gradients in buccal DNAm compared with reports from analysis of blood DNAm suggest that in order to take full advantage of buccal DNA samples, DNAm algorithms customized to buccal DNAm are needed.© 2023.

"37118425","Effect of long-term caloric restriction on DNA methylation measures of biological aging in healthy adults from the CALERIE trial.","Nat Aging","The geroscience hypothesis proposes that therapy to slow or reverse molecular changes that occur with aging can delay or prevent multiple chronic diseases and extend healthy lifespan1-3. Caloric restriction (CR), defined as lessening caloric intake without depriving essential nutrients4, results in changes in molecular processes that have been associated with aging, including DNA methylation (DNAm)5-7, and is established to increase healthy lifespan in multiple species8,9. Here we report the results of a post hoc analysis of the influence of CR on DNAm measures of aging in blood samples from the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE) trial, a randomized controlled trial in which n = 220 adults without obesity were randomized to 25% CR or ad libitum control diet for 2 yr (ref.10). We found that CALERIE intervention slowed the pace of aging, as measured by the DunedinPACE DNAm algorithm, but did not lead to significant changes in biological age estimates measured by various DNAm clocks including PhenoAge and GrimAge. Treatment effect sizes were small. Nevertheless, modest slowing of the pace of aging can have profound effects on population health11-13. The finding that CR modified DunedinPACE in a randomized controlled trial supports the geroscience hypothesis, building on evidence from small and uncontrolled studies14-16and contrasting with reports that biological aging may not be modifiable17. Ultimately, a conclusive test of the geroscience hypothesis will require trials with long-term follow-up to establish effects of intervention on primary healthy-aging endpoints, including incidence of chronic disease and mortality18-20.© 2023.

"37115548","Epigenetic Age in Peripheral Blood Among Children, Adolescent, and Adult Survivors of Childhood Cancer.","JAMA Netw Open","Certain cancer therapies are risk factors for epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) among survivors of childhood cancer, and EAA is associated with chronic health conditions (CHCs). However, small numbers of younger survivors (aged <20 years) previously evaluated have limited the ability to calculate EAA among this age group.To evaluate the change rate of epigenetic age (EA) and EAA in younger compared with older survivors and the possible association of EAA with early-onset obesity (aged <20 years), severity/burden of CHCs, and late mortality (>5 years from cancer diagnosis).Study participants were from the St Jude Lifetime Cohort, initiated in 2007 with ongoing follow-up. The present study was conducted from April 17, 2022, to March 23, 2023. Survivors in this cohort of European ancestry with DNA methylation data were included. Cross-sectional annual changes in EA and EAA were compared across 5 different chronologic age groups: age 0 to 9 (children), 10 to 19 (adolescents), 20 to 34 (younger adults), 35 to 49 (middle-aged adults), and greater than or equal to 50 (older adults) years. Logistic regression evaluated the association between EAA and early-onset obesity or severity/burden of CHCs. Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between EAA and late mortality.Early-onset obesity, severity/burden of CHCs (graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (grade 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe/disabling; 4, life-threatening) and were combined into high vs low severity/burden based on frequency and grade), and late mortality were the outcomes based on follow-up until April 2020. Expanded DNA methylation profiling increased the number of survivors younger than 20 years (n = 690). Epigenetic age was calculated primarily using the Levine clock, and EAA was derived from least squares regression of EA against chronologic age and was standardized to a z score (Levine EEA).Among 2846 participants (median age, 30.3 [IQR, 9.3-41.5] years; 53% males), the cross-sectional annual change in EA_Levine was higher in children (1.63 years) and adolescents (1.14 years), and the adjusted least-squares mean of Levine EEA was lower in children (-0.22 years) and older adults (-1.70 years). Each 1-SD increase in Levine EEA was associated with increased risk of developing early-onset obesity (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.19-1.78), high severity/burden of CHCs (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24), and late mortality (hazard ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.35-2.26).The findings of this study suggest that EAA measured in children and adolescent survivors of childhood cancer is associated with early-onset obesity, severity/burden of all CHCs, and late mortality. Evaluating EAA may help identify survivors of childhood cancer at increased risk for early-onset obesity, morbidity in general, and mortality."

This cortical clock (CC) dramatically outperformed extant blood-based epigenetic clocks in predicting brain age and neurological degeneration. Unfortunately, measures that require brain tissue are of limited utility to investigators striving to identify everyday risk factors for dementia. The present study investigated the utility of using the CpG sites included in the CC to formulate a peripheral blood-based cortical measure of brain age (CC-Bd). To establish the utility of CC-Bd, we used growth curves with individually varying time points and longitudinal data from a sample of 694 aging African Americans. We examined whether three risk factors that have been linked to cognitive decline-loneliness, depression, and BDNFm-predicted CC-Bd after controlling for several factors, including three new-generation epigenetic clocks. Our findings showed that two clocks-DunedinPACE and PoAm-predicted CC-BD, but that increases in loneliness and BDNFm continued to be robust predictors of accelerated CC-Bd even after taking these effects into account. This suggests that CC-Bd is assessing something more than the pan-tissue epigenetic clocks but that, at least in part, brain health is also associated with the general aging of the organism."

In this study, we present clear evidence that the aquatic vertebrate speciesXenopus tropicalisdisplays patterns of age-associated changes in DNA methylation. We have generated whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) profiles from skin samples of nine frogs representing young, mature, and old adults and characterized the gene- and chromosome-scale DNA methylation changes with age. Many of the methylation features and changes we observe are consistent with what is known in mammalian species, suggesting that the mechanism of age-related changes is conserved. Moreover, we selected a few thousand age-associated CpG sites to build an assay based on targeted DNA methylation analysis (TBSseq) to expand our findings in future studies involving larger cohorts of individuals. Preliminary results of a pilot TBSeq experiment recapitulate the findings obtained with WGBS setting the basis for the development of an epigenetic clock assay.

Although a broad spectrum of aging biomarkers has been developed, their potential uses and limitations remain poorly characterized. An immediate goal of biomarkers is to help us answer the following three fundamental questions in aging research: How old are we? Why do we get old? And how can we age slower? This review aims to address this need. Here, we summarize our current knowledge of biomarkers developed for cellular, organ, and organismal levels of aging, comprising six pillars: physiological characteristics, medical imaging, histological features, cellular alterations, molecular changes, and secretory factors. To fulfill all these requisites, we propose that aging biomarkers should qualify for being specific, systemic, and clinically relevant.© 2023. Science China Press."

Accordingly, the increasing population of monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) in Europe may pose a threat because we have little knowledge of the viruses they can transmit to native naïve species. In this study, we describe a new dependoparvovirus detected by metagenomic analysis of cloacal samples from 28 apparently healthy individuals captured in urban areas of Madrid, Spain. The genomic characterization revealed that the genome encoded the NS and VP proteins typical of parvoviruses and was flanked by inverted terminal repeats. No recombination signal was detected. The phylogenetic analysis showed that it was closely related to a parvovirus isolated in a wild psittacid in China. Both viruses share 80% Rep protein sequence identity and only 64% with other dependoparvoviruses identified in Passeriformes, Anseriformes, and Piciformes and are included in a highly supported clade, which could be considered a new species. The prevalence was very low, and none of the additional 73 individuals tested positive by PCR. These results highlight the importance of exploring the viral genome in invasive species to prevent the emergence of novel viral pathogenic species."

In this study, we induced autotetraploid water spinach by colchicine. Furthermore, DNA methylation and transcriptome of tetraploid and diploid were compared using Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) and RNA-sequencing techniques. Autotetraploid water spinach was created for the first time. Compared with the diploid parent, autotetraploid water spinach had wider leaves, thicker petioles and stems, thicker and shorter adventitious roots, longer stomas, and larger parenchyma cells. The whole genome methylation level of the autotetraploid was slightly higher than that of the diploid. Compared with the diploid, 12281 Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs)were found in the autotetraploid, including 2356 hypermethylated and 1310 hypomethylated genes, mainly enriched in 'Arginine and Proline metabolism', 'beta - Alanine metabolism', 'Plant homone signal translation', 'Ribome', and 'Plant - pathgen interaction' pathways. Correlation analysis of transcriptome and DNA methylation data showed that 121 differentially expressed genes undergone differential methylation, related to four pathways 'Other types of O-glycan biosynthesis', 'Terpenoid backbone biosynthesis', 'Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites', and 'Metabolic paths'.

"37106037","Characterizing expression changes in noncoding RNAs during aging and heterochronic parabiosis across mouse tissues.","Nat Biotechnol","Molecular mechanisms of organismal and cell aging remain incompletely understood. We, therefore, generated a body-wide map of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) expression in aging (16 organs at ten timepoints from 1 to 27 months) and rejuvenated mice. We found molecular aging trajectories are largely tissue-specific except for eight broadly deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs). Their individual abundance mirrors their presence in circulating plasma and extracellular vesicles (EVs) whereas tissue-specific ncRNAs were less present. For miR-29c-3p, we observe the largest correlation with aging in solid organs, plasma and EVs. In mice rejuvenated by heterochronic parabiosis, miR-29c-3p was the most prominent miRNA restored to similar levels found in young liver. miR-29c-3p targets the extracellular matrix and secretion pathways, known to be implicated in aging. We provide a map of organism-wide expression of ncRNAs with aging and rejuvenation and identify a set of broadly deregulated miRNAs, which may function as systemic regulators of aging via plasma and EVs.© 2023.

Experimental rodent models can help to identify the underlying mechanisms, yet very few studies address the long-term consequences of social stress on aging. We conducted a randomized study involving more than 300 male mice of commonly used laboratory strains (C57BL/6J, CD1, and Sv129Ev) chosen for the spontaneous aggression gradient and stress-vulnerability. Mice were exposed to a lifelong chronic psychosocial stress protocol to model social gradients in aging and disease vulnerability. Low social rank, inferred based on a discretized aggression index, was found to negatively impact lifespan in our study population. However, social rank interacted with genetic background in that low-ranking C57BL/6J, high-ranking Sv129Ev, and middle-ranking CD1 mice had lower survival, respectively, implying a cost of maintaining a given social rank that varies across strains. Machine learning linear discriminant analysis identified baseline fat-free mass as the most important predictor of mouse genetic background and social rank in the present dataset. Finally, strain and social rank differences were significantly associated with epigenetic changes, most significantly in Sv129Ev mice and in high-ranking compared to lower ranking subjects. Overall, we identified genetic background and social rank as critical contextual modifiers of aging and lifespan in an ethologically relevant rodent model of social stress, thereby providing a preclinical experimental paradigm to study the impact of social determinants of health disparities and accelerated aging."
"37118755","Partial erosion on under-methylated regions and chromatin reprogramming contribute to oncogene activation in IDH mutant gliomas.","Epigenetics Chromatin","IDH1/2 hotspot mutations are well known to drive oncogenic mutations in gliomas and are well-defined in the WHO 2021 classification of central nervous system tumors. Specifically, IDH mutations lead to aberrant hypermethylation of under-methylated regions (UMRs) in normal tissues through the disruption of TET enzymes. However, the chromatin reprogramming and transcriptional changes induced by IDH-related hypermethylation in gliomas remain unclear.Here, we have developed a precise computational framework based on Hidden Markov Model to identify altered methylation states of UMRs at single-base resolution. By applying this framework to whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from 75 normal brain tissues and 15 IDH mutant glioma tissues, we identified two distinct types of hypermethylated UMRs in IDH mutant gliomas. We named them partially hypermethylated UMRs (phUMRs) and fully hypermethylated UMRs (fhUMRs), respectively. We found that the phUMRs and fhUMRs exhibit distinct genomic features and chromatin states. Genes related to fhUMRs were more likely to be repressed in IDH mutant gliomas. In contrast, genes related to phUMRs were prone to be up-regulated in IDH mutant gliomas. Such activation of phUMR genes is associated with the accumulation of active H3K4me3 and the loss of H3K27me3, as well as H3K36me3 accumulation in gene bodies to maintain gene expression stability. In summary, partial erosion on UMRs was accompanied by locus-specific changes in key chromatin marks, which may contribute to oncogene activation.Our study provides a computational strategy for precise decoding of methylation encroachment patterns in IDH mutant gliomas, revealing potential mechanistic insights into chromatin reprogramming that contribute to oncogenesis.© 2023.

"37092005","Inheritance of social dominance is associated with global sperm DNA methylation in inbred male mice.","Curr Zool","Dominance relationships between males and their associated traits are usually heritable and have implications for sexual selection in animals. In particular, social dominance and its related male pheromones are heritable in inbred mice; thus, we wondered whether epigenetic changes due to altered levels of DNA methylation determine inheritance. Here, we used C57BL/6 male mice to establish a social dominance-subordination relationship through chronic dyadic encounters, and this relationship and pheromone covariation occurred in their offspring, indicative of heritability. Through transcriptome sequencing and whole-genome DNA methylation profiling of the sperm of both generations, we found that differential methylation of many genes was induced by social dominance-subordination in sires and could be passed on to the offspring. These methylated genes were mainly related to growth and development processes, neurodevelopment, and cellular transportation. The expression of the genes with similar functions in whole-genome methylation/bisulfite sequencing was also differentiated by social dominance-subordination, as revealed by RNA-seq. In particular, the geneDennd1a, which regulates neural signaling, was differentially methylated and expressed in the sperm and medial prefrontal cortex in paired males before and after dominance-subordination establishment, suggesting the potential epigenetic control and inheritance of social dominance-related aggression. We suggest that social dominance might be passed on to male offspring through sperm DNA methylation and that the differences could potentially affect male competition in offspring by affecting the development of the nervous system.© The Author(s) 2022.

Manipulating peripheral T cell immune response has been shown to impact AD, but the relationship between T cell aging and AD remains poorly understood. Given the limited success of targeting amyloid beta (Aβ) and the growing evidence of T cells' involvement in non-lymphoid organ aging, a deeper understanding of the relationship between T cells and AD in the context of aging is crucial for advancing therapeutic progress. In this review, we comprehensively examine existing studies on T cells and AD and offer an integrated perspective on their interconnections in the context of aging.

We performed Mendelian randomization for 1,827 immune system- and blood-brain barrier-related biomarkers and identified 127 potential causal risk factors for dementia-causing diseases. Pathway analyses linked these biomarkers to amyloid-β, tau and α-synuclein pathways and to autoimmunity-related processes. A phenome-wide analysis using Mendelian randomization-based polygenic risk score in the FinnGen study (n = 339,233) for the biomarkers indicated shared genetic background for dementias and autoimmune diseases. This association was further supported by human leukocyte antigen analyses. In inverse-probability-weighted analyses that simulate randomized controlled drug trials in observational data, anti-inflammatory methotrexate treatment reduced the incidence of Alzheimer's disease in high-risk individuals (hazard ratio compared with no treatment, 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.88, P = 0.005).

When the studied risk factors are independent of time, including both pre- and post-inclusion events in the analyses, generally referred to as relying on an ambispective design, increases the statistical power but may lead to a selection bias. In the field of venous thromboembolism (VT), ABO blood groups have been the subject of extensive research due to their substantial effect on VT risk. However, few studies have investigated their effect on the risk of VT recurrence. Motivated by the study of the association of genetically determined ABO blood groups with VT recurrence, we propose a methodology to include pre-inclusion events in the analysis of ambispective studies while avoiding the selection bias due to mortality.This work relies on two independent cohorts of VT patients, the French MARTHA study built on an ambispective design and the Dutch MEGA study built on a standard prospective design. For the analysis of the MARTHA study, a weighted Cox model was developed where weights were defined by the inverse of the survival probability at the time of data collection about the events. Thanks to the collection of information on the vital status of patients, we could estimate the survival probabilities using a delayed-entry Cox model on the death risk. Finally, results obtained in both studies were then meta-analysed.In the combined sample totalling 2,752 patients including 993 recurrences, the A1 blood group has an increased risk (Hazard Ratio (HR) of 1.18, p = 4.2 × 10-3) compared with the O1 group, homogeneously in MARTHA and in MEGA. The same trend (HR = 1.19, p = 0.06) was observed for the less frequent A2 group.The proposed methodology increases the power of studies relying on an ambispective design which is frequent in epidemiologic studies about recurrent events. This approach allowed to clarify the association of ABO blood groups with the risk of VT recurrence. Besides, this methodology has an immediate field of application in the context of genome wide association studies.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Temporally stable differences among subjects tend to dominate over differences attributable to disease conditions or medication use. Unsupervised principal variation analysis of personal immune states and machine learning classification distinguishing between healthy controls and patients converge to a metric of immune health (IHM). The IHM discriminates healthy from multiple polygenic autoimmune and inflammatory disease states in independent cohorts, marks healthy aging, and is a pre-vaccination predictor of antibody responses to influenza vaccination in the elderly. We identified easy-to-measure circulating protein biomarker surrogates of the IHM that capture immune health variations beyond age.

All HCC samples harbor at least one silenced TSG, suggesting that combining a specific panel of genomic targets could maximize efficacy, and potentially improve outcomes as a personalized treatment strategy for HCC patients. Unlike epigenetic modifying drugs lacking locus selectivity, CRISPRa systems enable potent and precise reactivation of at least 4 TSGs tailored to representative HCC lines. Concerted reactivation of HHIP, MT1M, PZP, and TTC36 in Hep3B cells inhibits multiple facets of HCC pathogenesis, such as cell viability, proliferation, and migration.By combining multiple effector domains, we demonstrate the utility of a CRISPRa toolbox of epigenetic effectors and gRNAs for patient-specific treatment of aggressive HCC.© 2023.

The identification of G-rich sequence motifs potential to form G-quadruplexes is correlated with functionally important genomic regions. Herein, biophysical and biochemical techniques are employed to investigate the structural polymorphism along with the effect of cytosine methylation on a 26-nt G-rich sequence present in the promoter region of theDAT1gene. The gel electrophoresis, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and UV-thermal melting data are well correlated and conclude the formation of a parallel (bimolecular), as well as antiparallel (tetramolecular) G-quadruplex in Na+solution. Interestingly, the existence of uni-, bi-, tri-, and tetramolecular quadruplex structures in K+solution exhibited only the parallel type G-quadruplex. The results demonstrate that in presence of either cation (Na+or K+) the cytosine methylation reserved the structural topologies unaltered. However, methylation lowers the thermal stability of G-quadruplexes and the duplex structures, as well. These findings provide insights to understand the regulatory mechanisms underlying the formation of the G-quadruplex structure induced by DNA methylation.©2023PublishedbyElsevierB.V."

Increasingly, research now utilises DNA methylation measures at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) to detect disease and estimate biological traits such as aging. Given the challenge of high dimensionality of DNA methylation data, feature-selection techniques are commonly employed to reduce dimensionality and identify the most important subset of features. In this study, our aim was to test and compare a range of feature-selection methods and ML algorithms in the development of a novel DNA methylation-based telomere length (TL) estimator. We utilised both nested cross-validation and two independent test sets for the comparisons.We found that principal component analysis in advance of elastic net regression led to the overall best performing estimator when evaluated using a nested cross-validation analysis and two independent test cohorts. This approach achieved a correlation between estimated and actual TL of 0.295 (83.4% CI [0.201, 0.384]) on the EXTEND test data set. Contrastingly, the baseline model of elastic net regression with no prior feature reduction stage performed less well in general-suggesting a prior feature-selection stage may have important utility. A previously developed TL estimator, DNAmTL, achieved a correlation of 0.216 (83.4% CI [0.118, 0.310]) on the EXTEND data. Additionally, we observed that different DNA methylation-based TL estimators, which have few common CpGs, are associated with many of the same biological entities.The variance in performance across tested approaches shows that estimators are sensitive to data set heterogeneity and the development of an optimal DNA methylation-based estimator should benefit from the robust methodological approach used in this study. Moreover, our methodology which utilises a range of feature-selection approaches and ML algorithms could be applied to other biological markers and disease phenotypes, to examine their relationship with DNA methylation and predictive value.© 2023.

Due to a mosaic of aetiologies involved in developing depression, such as somatic, neurobiological, (epi-)genetic factors, or adverse life events, patients often experience recurrent depressive episodes. About 20-30% of these patients develop difficult-to-treat depression. Here, we describe the design of the GEParD (Genetics and Epigenetics of Pharmaco- and Psychotherapy in acute and recurrent Depression) cohort and the DaCFail (Depression-associated Cardiac Failure) case-control protocol. Both protocols intended to investigate the incremental utility of multimodal biomarkers including cardiovascular and (epi-)genetic markers, functional brain and heart imaging when evaluating the response to antidepressive therapy using comprehensive psychometry. From 2012 to 2020, 346 depressed patients (mean age 45 years) were recruited to the prospective, observational GEParD cohort protocol. Between 2016 and 2020, the DaCFail case-control protocol was initiated integrating four study subgroups to focus on heart-brain interactions and stress systems in patients > 50 years with depression and heart failure, respectively. For DaCFail, 120 depressed patients (mean age 60 years, group 1 + 2), of which 115 also completed GEParD, and 95 non-depressed controls (mean age 66 years) were recruited. The latter comprised 47 patients with heart failure (group 3) and 48 healthy subjects (group 4) of a population-based control group derived from the Characteristics and Course of Heart Failure Stages A-B and Determinants of Progression (STAAB) cohort study. Our hypothesis-driven, exploratory study design may serve as an exemplary roadmap for a standardized, reproducible investigation of personalized antidepressant therapy in an inpatient setting with focus on heart comorbidities in future multicentre studies.© 2023.

"37076677","Assessment of Brown and Beige Adipose Tissue Activation in Mice Using PET/CT Imaging.","Methods Mol Biol","In response to cold induction, brown adipose tissues (BAT) and emerged brown-like adipocytes (beige adipocytes) in subcutaneous white adipose tissues (WAT browning/beiging) are activated. Thermogenesis is increased during glucose and fatty acid uptake and metabolism in adult humans and mice. This activation of BAT or WAT beiging to generate heat helps to counteract diet-induced obesity. This protocol applies the glucose analog radiotracer18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), coupled with positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning to evaluate cold-induced thermogenesis in the active BAT (interscapular region) and browned/beiged WAT (subcutaneous adipose region) in mice. The PET/CT scanning technique not only can quantify cold-induced glucose uptake in well-known BAT and beige-fat depots but also helps to visualize the anatomical location of novel uncharacterized mouse BAT and beige fat where cold-induced glucose uptake is high. Histological analysis is further employed to validate signals of delineated anatomical regions in PET/CT images as bona fide mouse BAT or beiged WAT fat depots.© 2023.

"37120575","Prenatal phthalate exposure and cord blood DNA methylation.","Sci Rep","Exposure to phthalates has been shown to impede the human endocrine system, resulting in deleterious effects on pregnant women and their children. Phthalates modify DNA methylation patterns in infant cord blood. We examined the association between prenatal phthalate exposure and DNA methylation patterns in cord blood in a Korean birth cohort. Phthalate levels were measured in 274 maternal urine samples obtained during late pregnancy and 102 neonatal urine samples obtained at birth, and DNA methylation levels were measured in cord blood samples. For each infant in the cohort, associations between CpG methylation and both maternal and neonate phthalate levels were analyzed using linear mixed models. The results were combined with those from a meta-analysis of the levels of phthalates in maternal and neonatal urine samples, which were also analyzed for MEOHP, MEHHP, MnBP, and DEHP. This meta-analysis revealed significant associations between the methylation levels of CpG sites near the CHN2 and CUL3 genes, which were also associated with MEOHP and MnBP in neonatal urine. When the data were stratified by the sex of the infant, MnBP concentration was found to be associated with one CpG site near the OR2A2 and MEGF11 genes in female infants. In contrast, the concentrations of the three maternal phthalates showed no significant association with CpG site methylation. Furthermore, the data identified distinct differentially methylated regions in maternal and neonatal urine samples following exposure to phthalates. The CpGs with methylation levels that were positively associated with phthalate levels (particularly MEOHP and MnBP) were found to be enriched genes and related pathways. These results indicate that prenatal phthalate exposure is significantly associated with DNA methylation at multiple CpG sites. These alterations in DNA methylation may serve as biomarkers of maternal exposure to phthalates in infants and are potential candidates for investigating the mechanisms by which phthalates impact maternal and neonatal health.© 2023.

As a large portion of the global population is aging, there is an urgent need for therapeutics that can stop disease progression and eliminate symptoms. In this study, we create an open framework and resource for evidence based identification of therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disease. We use Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization to identify genetic targets for drug discovery and repurposing. In parallel, we provide mechanistic insights into disease processes and potential network-level consequences of gene-based therapeutics. We identified 116 Alzheimer's disease, 3 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 5 Lewy body dementia, 46 Parkinson's disease, and 9 Progressive supranuclear palsy target genes passing multiple test corrections (pSMR_multi< 2.95E-06 and pHEIDI> 0.01). We created a therapeutic scheme to classify our identified target genes into strata based on druggability and approved therapeutics - classifying 41noveltargets, 3knowntargets, and 115difficulttargets. Ournovelclass of genes provides a springboard for new opportunities in drug discovery, development and repurposing in the pre-competitive space.

By integrative multi-omics analysis, here we show that astrocytic and microglial proteins are increased in TauP301Ssynapse fractions with age and in a C1q-dependent manner. In addition to microglia, we identified that astrocytes contribute substantially to synapse elimination in TauP301Shippocampi. Notably, we found relatively more excitatory synapse marker proteins in astrocytic lysosomes, whereas microglial lysosomes contained more inhibitory synapse material. C1q deletion reduced astrocyte-synapse association and decreased astrocytic and microglial synapses engulfment in TauP301Smice and rescued synapse density. Finally, in an AD mouse model that combines β-amyloid and Tau pathologies, deletion of the AD risk gene Trem2 impaired microglial phagocytosis of synapses, whereas astrocytes engulfed more inhibitory synapses around plaques. Together, our data reveal that astrocytes contact and eliminate synapses in a C1q-dependent manner and thereby contribute to pathological synapse loss and that astrocytic phagocytosis can compensate for microglial dysfunction.© 2022.

While methods have been proposed to characterize pleiotropic components across groups of phenotypes, scaling these approaches to ultra large-scale biobanks has been challenging. Here, we propose FactorGo, a scalable variational factor analysis model to identify and characterize pleiotropic components using biobank GWAS summary data. In extensive simulations, we observe that FactorGo outperforms the state-of-the-art (model-free) approach tSVD in capturing latent pleiotropic factors across phenotypes, while maintaining a similar computational cost. We apply FactorGo to estimate 100 latent pleiotropic factors from GWAS summary data of 2,483 phenotypes measured in European-ancestry Pan-UK BioBank individuals (N=420,531). Next, we find that factors from FactorGo are more enriched with relevant tissue-specific annotations than those identified by tSVD (P=2.58E-10), and validate our approach by recapitulating brain-specific enrichment for BMI and the height-related connection between reproductive system and muscular-skeletal growth. Finally, our analyses suggest novel shared etiologies between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal condition, in addition to alkaline phosphatase as a candidate prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer. Overall, FactorGo improves our biological understanding of shared etiologies across thousands of GWAS."

Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified many genomic regions associated with ischemic stroke (IS), the genes underlying risk and their regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we integrate a large-scale GWAS (N=1,296,908) for IS together with mRNA, splicing, enhancer RNA (eRNA) and protein expression data (N=11,588) from 50 tissues. We identify 136 genes/eRNA/proteins associated with IS risk across 54 independent genomic regions and find IS risk is most enriched for eQTLs in arterial and brain-related tissues. Focusing on IS-relevant tissues, we prioritize 9 genes/proteins using probabilistic fine-mapping TWAS analyses. In addition, we discover that blood cell traits, particularly reticulocyte cells, have shared genetic contributions with IS using TWAS-based pheWAS and genetic correlation analysis. Lastly, we integrate our findings with a large-scale pharmacological database and identify a secondary bile acid, deoxycholic acid, as a potential therapeutic component. Our work highlights IS risk genes/splicing-sites/enhancer activity/proteins with their phenotypic consequences using relevant tissues as well as identify potential therapeutic candidates for IS."
"36993466","Non-additive effects of schizophrenia risk genes reflect convergent downstream function.","medRxiv","Genetic studies of schizophrenia (SCZ) reveal a complex polygenic risk architecture comprised of hundreds of risk variants, the majority of which are common in the population at-large and confer only modest increases in disorder risk. Precisely how genetic variants with individually small predicted effects on gene expression combine to yield substantial clinical impacts in aggregate is unclear. Towards this, we previously reported that the combinatorial perturbation of four SCZ risk genes (""eGenes"", whose expression is regulated by common variants) resulted in gene expression changes that were not predicted by individual perturbations, being most non-additive among genes associated with synaptic function and SCZ risk. Now, across fifteen SCZ eGenes, we demonstrate that non-additive effects are greatest within groups of functionally similar eGenes. Individual eGene perturbations reveal common downstream transcriptomic effects (""convergence""), while combinatorial eGene perturbations result in changes that are smaller than predicted by summing individual eGene effects (""sub-additive effects""). Unexpectedly, these convergent and sub-additive downstream transcriptomic effects overlap and constitute a large proportion of the genome-wide polygenic risk score, suggesting that functional redundancy of eGenes may be a major mechanism underlying non-additivity. Single eGene perturbations likewise fail to predict the magnitude or directionality of cellular phenotypes resulting from combinatorial perturbations. Overall, our results indicate that polygenic risk cannot be extrapolated from experiments testing one risk gene at a time and must instead be empirically measured. By unravelling the interactions between complex risk variants, it may be possible to improve the clinical utility of polygenic risk scores through more powerful prediction of symptom onset, clinical trajectory, and treatment response, or to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention."

However, global [Formula: see text] analyses show minimal [Formula: see text] among neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Importantly, local [Formula: see text] s can exist in the absence of global relationships. To investigate this possibility, we applied LAVA, a tool for local [Formula: see text] analysis, to genome-wide association studies of 3 neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease) and 3 neuropsychiatric disorders (bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and schizophrenia). We identified several local [Formula: see text] s missed in global analyses, including between (i) all 3 neurodegenerative diseases and schizophrenia and (ii) Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. For those local [Formula: see text] s identified in genomic regions containing disease-implicated genes, such as SNCA, CLU and APOE, incorporation of expression quantitative trait loci identified genes that may drive genetic overlaps between diseases. Collectively, we demonstrate that complex genetic relationships exist among neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, highlighting putative pleiotropic genomic regions and genes.

"36993331","An Ensemble Penalized Regression Method for Multi-ancestry Polygenic Risk Prediction.","bioRxiv","Great efforts are being made to develop advanced polygenic risk scores (PRS) to improve the prediction of complex traits and diseases. However, most existing PRS are primarily trained on European ancestry populations, limiting their transferability to non-European populations. In this article, we propose a novel method for generating multi-ancestry Polygenic Risk scOres based on enSemble of PEnalized Regression models (PROSPER). PROSPER integrates genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics from diverse populations to develop ancestry-specific PRS with improved predictive power for minority populations. The method uses a combination of ℒ1(lasso) and ℒ2(ridge) penalty functions, a parsimonious specification of the penalty parameters across populations, and an ensemble step to combine PRS generated across different penalty parameters. We evaluate the performance of PROSPER and other existing methods on large-scale simulated and real datasets, including those from 23andMe Inc., the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, and All of Us. Results show that PROSPER can substantially improve multi-ancestry polygenic prediction compared to alternative methods across a wide variety of genetic architectures. In real data analyses, for example, PROSPER increased out-of-sample prediction R2for continuous traits by an average of 70% compared to a state-of-the-art Bayesian method (PRS-CSx) in the African ancestry population. Further, PROSPER is computationally highly scalable for the analysis of large SNP contents and many diverse populations."

Our aim was to explore the connections between environmental exposures during gestation with DNA methylation of placental cells, maternal and neonatal buccal cells by applying artificial neural networks (ANNs). A total of 28 mother-infant pairs were enrolled. Data on gestational exposure to adverse environmental factors and on mother health status were collected through the administration of a questionnaire. DNA methylation analyses at both gene-specific and global level were analyzed in placentas, maternal and neonatal buccal cells. In the placenta, the concentrations of various metals and dioxins were also analyzed. Analysis of ANNs revealed that suboptimal birth weight is associated with placentalH19methylation, maternal stress during pregnancy with methylation levels ofNR3C1andBDNFin placentas and mother's buccal DNA, respectively, and exposure to air pollutants with maternalMGMTmethylation. Associations were also observed between placental concentrations of lead, chromium, cadmium and mercury with methylation levels ofOXTRin placentas,HSD11B2in maternal buccal cells and placentas,MECP2in neonatal buccal cells, andMTHFRin maternal buccal cells. Furthermore, dioxin concentrations were associated with placentalRELN, neonatalHSD11B2and maternalH19gene methylation levels. Current results suggest that exposure of pregnant women to environmental stressors during pregnancy could induce aberrant methylation levels in genes linked to several pathways important for embryogenesis in both the placenta, potentially affecting foetal development, and in the peripheral tissues of mothers and infants, potentially providing peripheral biomarkers of environmental exposure."
"37076473","Multi-omic underpinnings of epigenetic aging and human longevity.","Nat Commun","Biological aging is accompanied by increasing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs; however, its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we use multi-omic methods to integrate genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data and identify biological associations with four measures of epigenetic age acceleration and a human longevity phenotype comprising healthspan, lifespan, and exceptional longevity (multivariate longevity). Using transcriptomic imputation, fine-mapping, and conditional analysis, we identify 22 high confidence associations with epigenetic age acceleration and seven with multivariate longevity. FLOT1, KPNA4, and TMX2 are novel, high confidence genes associated with epigenetic age acceleration. In parallel, cis-instrument Mendelian randomization of the druggable genome associates TPMT and NHLRC1 with epigenetic aging, supporting transcriptomic imputation findings. Metabolomics Mendelian randomization identifies a negative effect of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and associated lipoproteins on multivariate longevity, but not epigenetic age acceleration. Finally, cell-type enrichment analysis implicates immune cells and precursors in epigenetic age acceleration and, more modestly, multivariate longevity. Follow-up Mendelian randomization of immune cell traits suggests lymphocyte subpopulations and lymphocytic surface molecules affect multivariate longevity and epigenetic age acceleration. Our results highlight druggable targets and biological pathways involved in aging and facilitate multi-omic comparisons of epigenetic clocks and human longevity.© 2023.

"37074468","Explaining Residential Clustering of Large Families.","Eur J Popul","Numerous studies have shown that fertility behavior is spatially clustered. In addition to pure contextual effects, two causal mechanisms could drive this pattern. First, neighbors may influence each other's fertility and second, family size may influence decisions about where to live. In this study we examine these two potential causal mechanisms empirically, using the sex composition of the two eldest children and twin births as instrumental variables (IVs) for having a third child. We estimate how having a third child affects three separate outcomes: the fertility of neighbors; the propensity to move houses; and the likelihood of living in a family-friendly neighborhood with many children. We draw residential and childbearing histories (2000-2018) from Norwegian administrative registers (N ~ 167,000 women). Individuals' neighborhoods are defined using time-varying geocoordinates for place of residence. We identify selective moves as one plausible causal driver of residential clustering of large families. This study contributes to the understanding of fertility and relocation, and to the literature on the social interaction effects of fertility, by testing the relevance of yet another network: that of neighbors.© 2023.

However, the relationship between the functional imaging characteristics of Nac subregions and anhedonia remains unclear. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the role of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the Nac subregions between MDD and anhedonia.We performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the rsFC of Nac subregions in 55 MDD patients and 30 healthy controls (HCs). A two-sample t test was performed to determine the brain regions with varying rsFC among Nac subregions between groups. Then, correlation analyses were carried out to investigate the relationships between the aberrant rsFC of Nac subregions and the severity of anhedonia. Furthermore, we constructed a mediation model to explain the role of the aberrant rsFC of Nac subregions between MDD and the severity of anhedonia.Compared with the HC group, decreased rsFC of Nac subregions with regions of the prefrontal cortex, insula, lingual gyrus, and visual association cortex was observed in MDD patients. In the MDD group, the rsFC of the right Nac shell-like subregions with the middle frontal gyrus (MFG)/superior frontal gyrus (SFG) was correlated with consummatory anhedonia, and the rsFC of the Nac core-like subdivisions with the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)/insula and lingual gyrus/visual association cortex was correlated with anticipatory anhedonia. More importantly, the functional alterations in the Nac subregions mediated the association between anhedonia and depression.The present findings suggest that the functional alteration of the Nac subregions mediates the association between MDD and anhedonia, which provides evidence for the hypothesis that MDD patients have neurobiological underpinnings of reward systems that differ from those of HCs.© 2023.

In addition to neuroanatomical and circuit-level disturbances, dysregulation of the brain transcriptome is a key phenotypic signature of MDD. Postmortem brain gene expression data are uniquely valuable resources for identifying this signature and key genomic drivers in human depression; however, the scarcity of brain tissue limits our capacity to observe the dynamic transcriptional landscape of MDD. It is therefore crucial to explore and integrate depression and stress transcriptomic data from numerous, complementary perspectives to construct a richer understanding of the pathophysiology of depression. In this review, we discuss multiple approaches for exploring the brain transcriptome reflecting dynamic stages of MDD: predisposition, onset, and illness.

However, this field faces major challenges in both methodology and interpretation with regard to disentangling confounded social and biological aspects of race and ethnicity. To address these challenges, we discuss how these constructs have been approached in the past and how to move forward in studying DNA methylation (DNAm), one of the best-characterized epigenetic marks in humans, in a responsible and appropriately nuanced manner. We highlight self-reported racial and ethnic identity as the primary measure in this field, and discuss its implications in DNAm research. Racial and ethnic identity reflects the biological embedding of an individual's sociocultural experience and environmental exposures in combination with the underlying genetic architecture of the human population (i.e., genetic ancestry). Our integrative framework demonstrates how to examine DNAm in the context of race and ethnicity, while considering both intrinsic factors-including genetic ancestry-and extrinsic factors-including structural and sociocultural environment and developmental niches-when focusing on early-life experience. We reviewed DNAm research in relation to health disparities given its relevance to race and ethnicity as social constructs. Here, we provide recommendations for the study of DNAm addressing racial and ethnic differences, such as explicitly acknowledging the self-reported nature of racial and ethnic identity, empirically examining the effects of genetic variants and accounting for genetic ancestry, and investigating race-related and culturally regulated environmental exposures and experiences.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s44155-023-00039-z.© The Author(s) 2023."

The inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) analysis was performed as the primary analysis, followed by some sensitivity analyses to explore the stability of the results.Six putatively causal IgG N-glycans for T2D and four for hypertension were identified in the IVW method. Genetically predicted T2D increased the risk of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 1.177, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.037-1.338, P = 0.012) and vice versa (OR = 1.391, 95% CI = 1.081-1.790, P = 0.010). Multivariable MR showed that T2D remained at risk effect with hypertension ([OR] = 1.229, 95% CI = 1.140-1.325, P = 7.817 × 10-8) after conditioning on T2D-related IgG-glycans.

This burden can be overcome by enrolling larger cohorts or alleviated by using prior biological knowledge to favor some hypotheses over others. Here we compare these two methods in terms of their abilities to boost the power of hypothesis testing.We provide a quantitative estimate for progress in cohort sizes and present a theoretical analysis of the power of oracular hard priors: priors that select a subset of hypotheses for testing, with an oracular guarantee that all true positives are within the tested subset. This theory demonstrates that for GWAS, strong priors that limit testing to 100-1000 genes provide less power than typical annual 20-40% increases in cohort sizes. Furthermore, non-oracular priors that exclude even a small fraction of true positives from the tested set can perform worse than not using a prior at all.Our results provide a theoretical explanation for the continued dominance of simple, unbiased univariate hypothesis tests for GWAS: if a statistical question can be answered by larger cohort sizes, it should be answered by larger cohort sizes rather than by more complicated biased methods involving priors. We suggest that priors are better suited for non-statistical aspects of biology, such as pathway structure and causality, that are not yet easily captured by standard hypothesis tests.© 2023.

Using dual luciferase reporter assay, we identified that SCZ-associated SNP rs35874192, an eQTL SNP forPCCB, showed differential allelic effects on transcriptional activities.PCCBknockdown in human forebrain organoids (hFOs) followed by RNA-seq revealed dysregulation of genes enriched with multiple neuronal functions including gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic synapse, as well as genes dysregulated in postmortem brains of SCZ patients or in cerebral organoids derived from SCZ patients. The metabolomic and mitochondrial function analyses confirmed the deceased GABA levels resulted from reduced tricarboxylic acid cycle inPCCBknockdown hFOs. Multielectrode array recording analysis showed thatPCCBknockdown in hFOs resulted into SCZ-related phenotypes including hyper-neuroactivities and decreased synchronization of neural network. In summary, this study utilized hFOs-based multi-omics data and revealed thatPCCBdownregulation may contribute to SCZ risk through regulating GABAergic system, highlighting the mitochondrial function in SCZ."
"37017084","FHL5 Controls Vascular Disease-Associated Gene Programs in Smooth Muscle Cells.","Circ Res","Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of loci associated with common vascular diseases, such as coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and hypertension. However, the lack of mechanistic insights for many GWAS loci limits their translation into the clinic. Among these loci with unknown functions isUFL1-four-and-a-half LIM (LIN-11, Isl-1, MEC-3) domain 5 (FHL5; chr6q16.1), which reached genome-wide significance in a recent coronary artery disease/ myocardial infarction GWAS meta-analysis.UFL1-FHL5is also associated with several vascular diseases, consistent with the widespread pleiotropy observed for GWAS loci.We apply a multimodal approach leveraging statistical fine-mapping, epigenomic profiling, and ex vivo analysis of human coronary artery tissues to implicateFHL5as the top candidate causal gene. We unravel the molecular mechanisms of the cross-phenotype genetic associations through in vitro functional analyses and epigenomic profiling experiments in coronary artery smooth muscle cells.We prioritizedFHL5as the top candidate causal gene at theUFL1-FHL5locus through expression quantitative trait locus colocalization methods.FHL5gene expression was enriched in the smooth muscle cells and pericyte population in human artery tissues with coexpression network analyses supporting a functional role in regulating smooth muscle cell contraction. Unexpectedly, under procalcifying conditions, FHL5 overexpression promoted vascular calcification and dysregulated processes related to extracellular matrix organization and calcium handling. Lastly, by mapping FHL5 binding sites and inferring FHL5 target gene function using artery tissue gene regulatory network analyses, we highlight regulatory interactions between FHL5 and downstream coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction loci, such asFOXL1andFN1that have roles in vascular remodeling.Taken together, these studies provide mechanistic insights into the pleiotropic genetic associations ofUFL1-FHL5.We show that FHL5 mediates vascular disease risk through transcriptional regulation of downstream vascular remodeling gene programs. These transacting mechanisms may explain a portion of the heritable risk for complex vascular diseases."

Core symptoms of ADHD, such as impulsivity, are caused by an interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Epigenetic modifications of DNA, such as DNA methylation, are thought to mediate the interplay of these factors. Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) is the rate-limiting enzyme in brain serotonin synthesis. The TPH2 gene has frequently been investigated in relation to ADHD, e.g., showing that TPH2 G-703T (rs4570625) polymorphism influences response control and prefrontal signaling in ADHD patients. In this (epi)genetic imaging study we examined 144 children and adolescents (74 patients, 14 females) using fMRI at rest and during performing a waiting impulsivity (WI) paradigm. Both, TPH2 G-703T (rs4570625) genotype and DNA methylation in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of TPH2 were associated with wavelet variance in fronto-parietal regions and behavioral performance, taking TPH2 genotype into account. In detail, comparisons between genotypes of patients and controls revealed highest wavelet variance and longest reaction times in patients carrying the T allele [indicative for a gene-dosage effect, i.e., the WI phenotype is a direct result of the cumulative effect of ADHD and TPH2 variation]. Regressions revealed a significant effect on one specific DNA methylation site in ADHD patients but not controls, in terms of a significant prediction of wavelet variance in fronto-parietal regions as well as premature responses. By the example of the TPH2 G-703T (rs4570625) polymorphism, we provide insight into how interactive genetic and DNA methylation affect the ADHD and/or impulsive endophenotype.Copyright: © 2023 Akhrif et al.

Here we identify RNA helicase DDX43 as an essential regulator of the chromatin remodeling process during spermiogenesis. Testis-specific Ddx43 knockout mice show male infertility with defective histone-to-protamine replacement and post-meiotic chromatin condensation defects. The loss of its ATP hydrolysis activity by a missense mutation replicates the infertility phenotype in global Ddx43 knockout mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of germ cells depleted of Ddx43 or expressing the Ddx43 ATPase-dead mutant reveals that DDX43 regulates dynamic RNA regulatory processes that underlie spermatid chromatin remodeling and differentiation. Transcriptomic profiling focusing on early-stage spermatids combined with enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation and sequencing further identifies Elfn2 as DDX43-targeted hub gene. These findings illustrate an essential role for DDX43 in spermiogenesis and highlight the single-cell-based strategy to dissect cell-state-specific regulation of male germline development.© 2023.

Despite vast therapies being available, the survival rate is low (5 year survival rate is 15%) making it essential to comprehend the mechanism for NSCLC cell survival and progression. The plethora of evidences suggests that the Post Translational Modification (PTM) such as phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation are involved in various types of cancer progression and metastasis including NSCLC. Indeed, an in-depth understanding of PTM associated with NSCLC biology will provide novel therapeutic targets and insight into the current sophisticated therapeutic paradigm. Herein, we reviewed the key PTMs, epigenetic modulation, PTMs crosstalk along with proteogenomics to analyze PTMs in NSCLC and also, highlighted how epi‑miRNA, miRNA and PTM inhibitors are key modulators and serve as promising therapeutics.Copyright © 2023.

While standard risk factors have shown good predictive performance, we show that the use of blood-based DNA methylation information leads to a significant improvement in the prediction of 10-year T2D incidence risk. Previous studies have been largely constrained by linear assumptions, the use of cytosine-guanine pairs one-at-a-time and binary outcomes. We present a flexible approach (via an R package, MethylPipeR) based on a range of linear and tree-ensemble models that incorporate time-to-event data for prediction. Using the Generation Scotland cohort (training set ncases = 374, ncontrols = 9,461; test set ncases = 252, ncontrols = 4,526) our best-performing model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.872, area under the precision-recall curve (PRAUC) = 0.302) showed notable improvement in 10-year onset prediction beyond standard risk factors (AUC = 0.839, precision-recall AUC = 0.227).

"37117649","Reshaping the tumour immune microenvironment in solid tumours via tumour cell and immune cell DNA methylation: from mechanisms to therapeutics.","Br J Cancer","In recent years, the tumour microenvironment (TME) of solid tumours has attracted more and more attention from researchers, especially those non-tumour components such as immune cells. Infiltration of various immune cells causes tumour immune microenvironment (TIME) heterogeneity, and results in different therapeutic effects. Accumulating evidence showed that DNA methylation plays a crucial role in remodelling TIME and is associated with the response towards immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). During carcinogenesis, DNA methylation profoundly changes, specifically, there is a global loss of DNA methylation and increased DNA methylation at the promoters of suppressor genes. Immune cell differentiation is disturbed, and exclusion of immune cells from the TME occurs at least in part due to DNA methylation reprogramming. Therefore, pharmaceutical interventions targeting DNA methylation are promising. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) enhance antitumor immunity by inducing transcription of transposable elements and consequent viral mimicry. DNMTis upregulate the expression of tumour antigens, mediate immune cells recruitment and reactivate exhausted immune cells. In preclinical studies, DNMTis have shown synergistic effect when combined with immunotherapies, suggesting new strategies to treat refractory solid tumours.© 2023.

"37108466","Altered Brain Expression of DNA Methylation and Hydroxymethylation Epigenetic Enzymes in a Rat Model of Neuropathic Pain.","Int J Mol Sci","The role of epigenetics in chronic pain at the supraspinal level is yet to be fully characterized. DNA histone methylation is crucially regulated by de novo methyltransferases (DNMT1-3) and ten-eleven translocation dioxygenases (TET1-3). Evidence has shown that methylation markers are altered in different CNS regions related to nociception, namely the dorsal root ganglia, the spinal cord, and different brain areas. Decreased global methylation was found in the DRG, the prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala, which was associated with decreased DNMT1/3a expression. In contrast, increased methylation levels and mRNA levels of TET1 and TET3 were linked to augmented pain hypersensitivity and allodynia in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. Since epigenetic mechanisms may be responsible for the regulation and coordination of various transcriptional modifications described in chronic pain states, with this study, we aimed to evaluate the functional role of TET1-3 and DNMT1/3a genes in neuropathic pain in several brain areas. In a spared nerve injury rat model of neuropathic pain, 21 days after surgery, we found increased TET1 expression in the medial prefrontal cortex and decreased expression in the caudate-putamen and the amygdala; TET2 was upregulated in the medial thalamus; TET3 mRNA levels were reduced in the medial prefrontal cortex and the caudate-putamen; and DNMT1 was downregulated in the caudate-putamen and the medial thalamus. No statistically significant changes in expression were observed with DNMT3a. Our results suggest a complex functional role for these genes in different brain areas in the context of neuropathic pain. The notion of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation being cell-type specific and not tissue specific, as well as the possibility of chronologically differential gene expression after the establishment of neuropathic or inflammatory pain models, ought to be addressed in future studies."
"37108738","Prognostic and Predictive Biomarkers in the Era of Immunotherapy for Lung Cancer.","Int J Mol Sci","The therapeutic algorithm of lung cancer has recently been revolutionized by the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, an objective and durable response rate remains low with those recent therapies and some patients even experience severe adverse events. Prognostic and predictive biomarkers are therefore needed in order to select patients who will respond. Nowadays, the only validated biomarker is the PD-L1 expression, but its predictive value remains imperfect, and it does not offer any certainty of a sustained response to treatment. With recent progresses in molecular biology, genome sequencing techniques, and the understanding of the immune microenvironment of the tumor and its host, new molecular features have been highlighted. There are evidence in favor of the positive predictive value of the tumor mutational burden, as an example. From the expression of molecular interactions within tumor cells to biomarkers circulating in peripheral blood, many markers have been identified as associated with the response to immunotherapy. In this review, we would like to summarize the latest knowledge about predictive and prognostic biomarkers of immune checkpoint inhibitors efficacy in order to go further in the field of precision immuno-oncology."
"37108262","COVID-19 Biomarkers at the Crossroad between Patient Stratification and Targeted Therapy: The Role of Validated and Proposed Parameters.","Int J Mol Sci","Clinical knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and COVID-19 pathophysiology have enormously increased during the pandemic. Nevertheless, because of the great heterogeneity of disease manifestations, a precise patient stratification at admission is still difficult, thus rendering a rational allocation of limited medical resources as well as a tailored therapeutic approach challenging. To date, many hematologic biomarkers have been validated to support the early triage of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients and to monitor their disease progression. Among them, some indices have proven to be not only predictive parameters, but also direct or indirect pharmacological targets, thus allowing for a more tailored approach to single-patient symptoms, especially in those with severe progressive disease. While many blood test-derived parameters quickly entered routine clinical practice, other circulating biomarkers have been proposed by several researchers who have investigated their reliability in specific patient cohorts. Despite their usefulness in specific contexts as well as their potential interest as therapeutic targets, such experimental markers have not been implemented in routine clinical practice, mainly due to their higher costs and low availability in general hospital settings. This narrative review will present an overview of the most commonly adopted biomarkers in clinical practice and of the most promising ones emerging from specific population studies. Considering that each of the validated markers reflects a specific aspect of COVID-19 evolution, embedding new highly informative markers into routine clinical testing could help not only in early patient stratification, but also in guiding a timely and tailored method of therapeutic intervention."

It is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular (CV) disease, and increased all-cause mortality. Metformin is used frequently in HS treatment and is effective for some patients. The mechanism of action of metformin in HS is unknown. A case-control study of 40 patients with HS (20 on metformin and 20 controls) was conducted to assess differences in metabolic markers, inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP], serum adipokines, and CV risk biomarkers), and serum immune mediators. Body mass index (BMI), insulin resistance (77%), and metabolic syndrome (44%) were high overall, but not significantly different between the groups. This highlights the need for co-morbidity screening and management. A significant reduction in fasting insulin and a trend towards a reduction in insulin resistance were identified in the metformin group compared with pre-treatment levels. CV risk biomarkers were significantly favourable in the metformin group (lymphocytes, monocyte-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet-lymphocyte ratio). CRP was lower in the metformin group but was not statistically significant. Adipokines were dysregulated overall but were not different between the two groups. Serum IFN-γ, IL-8, TNF-α, and CXCL1 trended lower in the metformin group but did not reach significance. These results suggest that metformin improves CV risk biomarkers and insulin resistance in patients with HS. When the results of this study are considered alongside other studies in HS and related conditions, it is likely that metformin also has beneficial effects on metabolic markers and systemic inflammation in HS (CRP, serum adipokines, and immune mediators), warranting further research."
"37117791","Spurious intragenic transcription is a feature of mammalian cellular senescence and tissue aging.","Nat Aging","Mammalian aging is characterized by the progressive loss of tissue function and increased risk for disease. Accumulation of senescent cells in aging tissues partly contributes to this decline, and targeted depletion of senescent cells in vivo ameliorates many age-related phenotypes. The fundamental molecular mechanisms responsible for the decline of cellular health and fitness during senescence and aging are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated whether chromatin-mediated loss of transcriptional fidelity, known to contribute to fitness and survival in yeast and worms, also occurs during human cellular senescence and mouse aging. Our findings reveal aberrant transcription initiation inside genes during senescence and aging that co-occurs with changes in the chromatin landscape. Interventions that alter these spurious transcripts have profound consequences on cellular health, primarily affecting intracellular signal transduction pathways. We propose that age-related spurious transcription promotes a noisy transcriptome and degradation of coherent transcriptional networks.© 2023.

Diabetes and hypertension increase the risk of frailty and cognitive impairment. Metformin has been employed in post-menopausal women and some reports have shown encouraging effects in terms of attenuated frailty. However, the impact on cognitive performance of a recently introduced extended-release formulation of metformin has never been explored.We studied consecutive frail hypertensive and diabetic older women presenting at the ASL (local health authority of the Italian Ministry of Health) Avellino, Italy, from June 2021 to August 2022, who were treated or not with extended-release metformin. We included a control group of frail older males with diabetes and hypertension treated with extended-release metformin and a control group of frail older women with diabetes and hypertension treated with regular metformin.A total of 145 patients successfully completed the study. At the end of the 6-month follow-up, we observed a significantly different cognitive performance compared to baseline in the group of frail women treated with extended-release metformin (p: 0.007). Then, we compared the follow-up groups and we observed significant differences between frail women treated vs. untreated (p: 0.041), between treated frail women and treated frail men (p: 0.016), and between women treated with extended-release metformin vs. women treated with regular metformin (p: 0.048). We confirmed the crucial role of extended-release metformin applying a multivariable logistic analysis to adjust for potential confounders.We evidenced, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the favorable effects on cognitive impairment of extended-release metformin in frail women with diabetes and hypertension.© 2023.

"37053179","Differential methylation pattern in pubertal girls associated with biochemical premature adrenarche.","Epigenetics","Biochemical premature adrenarche is defined by elevated serum DHEAS [≥40 μg/dL] before age 8 y in girls. This condition is receiving more attention due to its association with obesity, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Nevertheless, the link between early androgen excess and these risk factors remains unknown. Epigenetic modifications, and specifically DNA methylation, have been associated with the initiation and progression of numerous disorders, including obesity and insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to determine if prepubertal androgen exposure is associated with a different methylation profile in pubertal girls. Eighty-six healthy girls were studied. At age 7 y, anthropometric measurements were begun and DHEAS levels were determined. Girls were classified into Low DHEAS (LD) [<42 μg/dL] and High DHEAS (HD) [≥42 μg/dL] groups. At Tanner stages 2 and 4 a DNA methylation microarray was performed to identify differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs) between HD and LD groups. We observed a differential methylation pattern between pubertal girls with and without biochemical PA. Moreover, a set of DNA methylation markers, selected by the LASSO method, successfully distinguished between HD and LD girls regardless of Tanner stage. Additionally, a subset of these markers were significantly associated with glucose-related measures such as insulin level, HOMA-IR, and glycaemia. This pilot study provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that high DHEAS concentration, or its hormonally active metabolites, may induce a unique blood methylation signature in pubertal girls, and that this methylation pattern is associated with altered glucose metabolism."
"37131074","Step by step: towards a better understanding of the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease.","Mol Psychiatry","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered to have a large genetic component. Our knowledge of this component has progressed over the last 10 years, thanks notably to the advent of genome-wide association studies and the establishment of large consortia that make it possible to analyze hundreds of thousands of cases and controls. The characterization of dozens of chromosomal regions associated with the risk of developing AD and (in some loci) the causal genes responsible for the observed disease signal has confirmed the involvement of major pathophysiological pathways (such as amyloid precursor protein metabolism) and opened up new perspectives (such as the central role of microglia and inflammation). Furthermore, large-scale sequencing projects are starting to reveal the major impact of rare variants - even in genes like APOE - on the AD risk. This increasingly comprehensive knowledge is now being disseminated through translational research; in particular, the development of genetic risk/polygenic risk scores is helping to identify the subpopulations more at risk or less at risk of developing AD. Although it is difficult to assess the efforts still needed to comprehensively characterize the genetic component of AD, several lines of research can be improved or initiated. Ultimately, genetics (in combination with other biomarkers) might help to redefine the boundaries and relationships between various neurodegenerative diseases.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37117740","The burden of rare protein-truncating genetic variants on human lifespan.","Nat Aging","Genetic predisposition has been shown to contribute substantially to the age at which we die. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have linked more than 20 loci to phenotypes related to human lifespan1. However, little is known about how lifespan is impacted by gene loss of function. Through whole-exome sequencing of 352,338 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry, we assessed the relevance of protein-truncating variant (PTV) gene burden on individual and parental survival. We identified four exome-wide significant (P < 4.2 × 10-7) human lifespan genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM and TET2. Gene and gene-set, PTV-burden, phenome-wide association studies support known roles of these genes in cancer to impact lifespan at the population level. The TET2 PTV burden was associated with a lifespan through somatic mutation events presumably due to clonal hematopoiesis. The overlap between PTV burden and common variant-based lifespan GWASs was modest, underscoring the value of exome sequencing in well-powered biobank cohorts to complement GWASs for identifying genes underlying complex traits.© 2022.

These oncogenic mutations in histones, now termed ""oncohistones"", were discovered through genome-wide sequencing of pediatric diffuse high-grade glioma. Up to 80% of diffuse midline glioma (DMG), including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and diffuse glioma arising in other midline structures including thalamus or spinal cord, contain histone H3 lysine 27 to methionine (K27M) mutations or, rarely, other alterations that result in a depletion of H3K27me3 similar to that induced by H3 K27M. This subgroup of glioma is now defined as diffuse midline glioma, H3K27-altered. In contrast, histone H3 Gly34Arg/Val (G34R/V) mutations are found in approximately 30% of diffuse glioma arising in the cerebral hemispheres of older adolescents and young adults, now classified as diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3G34-mutant. Here, we review how oncohistones modulate the epigenome and discuss the mutational landscape and invasive properties of histone mutant HGGs of childhood. The distinct mechanisms through which oncohistones and other mutations rewrite the epigenetic landscape provide novel insights into development and tumorigenesis and may present unique vulnerabilities for pHGGs. Lessons learned from these rare incurable brain tumors of childhood may have broader implications for cancer, as additional high- and low-frequency oncohistone mutations have been identified in other tumor types.© 2023.

Most of the available research indicate that executive impairment has a certain genetic predisposition. Shared neuropathological characteristics of patients with SCZ and their siblings may reveal intermediate behavioral phenotypes that can be used to further characterize the illness.Our study involved 32 SCZ patients, 32 unaffected siblings (US), and 33 persons as healthy controls (HCS). These three groups underwent a computerized version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and a battery of cognitive neuropsychological assessments. These tests also evaluate executive function and several cognitive domains.The performed study on SCZ patients and their unaffected siblings showed an inferior WCST performance to the HCS subjects, further indicating that unaffected siblings have a functional impairment, and they also performed poorly on the neuropsychological assessment compared with the HCS.This result supports the claim that the development of functional impairment is not limited to SCZ patients and unaffected siblings may also have a certain level of abnormal brain function.

"37066144","Tree-based QTL mapping with expected local genetic relatedness matrices.","bioRxiv","Understanding the genetic basis of complex phenotypes is a central pursuit of genetics. Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) are a powerful way to find genetic loci associated with phenotypes. GWAS are widely and successfully used, but they face challenges related to the fact that variants are tested for association with a phenotype independently, whereas in reality variants at different sites are correlated because of their shared evolutionary history. One way to model this shared history is through the ancestral recombination graph (ARG), which encodes a series of local coalescent trees. Recent computational and methodological breakthroughs have made it feasible to estimate approximate ARGs from large-scale samples. Here, we explore the potential of an ARG-based approach to quantitative-trait locus (QTL) mapping, echoing existing variance-components approaches. We propose a framework that relies on the conditional expectation of a local genetic relatedness matrix given the ARG (local eGRM). Simulations show that our method is especially beneficial for finding QTLs in the presence of allelic heterogeneity. By framing QTL mapping in terms of the estimated ARG, we can also facilitate the detection of QTLs in understudied populations. We use local eGRM to identify a large-effect BMI locus, theCREBRFgene, in a sample of Native Hawaiians in which it was not previously detectable by GWAS because of a lack of population-specific imputation resources. Our investigations can provide intuition about the benefits of using estimated ARGs in population- and statistical-genetic methods in general."

Although inflammatory mechanisms are hypothesized to underlie this cluster, epigenetic contributions are unknown.This study's purpose was to evaluate associations between the occurrence of a psychological symptom cluster and levels of DNA methylation for inflammatory genes in a heterogeneous sample of patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy.Prior to their second or third cycle of chemotherapy, 1,071 patients reported the occurrence of 38 symptoms using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. A psychological cluster was identified using exploratory factor analysis. Differential methylation analyses were performed in two independent samples using Illumina Infinium 450K and EPIC microarrays. Expression-associated CpG (eCpG) loci in the promoter region of 114 inflammatory genes on the 450K and 112 genes on the EPIC microarray were evaluated for associations with the psychological cluster. Robust rank aggregation was used to identify differentially methylated genes across both samples. Significance was assessed using a false discovery rate of 0.05 under the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.Cluster of differentiation 40 ( CD40 ) was differentially methylated across both samples. All six promoter eCpGs for CD40 that were identified across both samples were hypomethylated in the psychological cluster group.This study is the first to suggest associations between a psychological symptom cluster and differential DNA methylation of a gene involved in tissue inflammation and cell-mediated immunity. Our findings suggest that increased CD40 expression through hypomethylation of promoter eCpG loci is involved in the occurrence of a psychological symptom cluster in patients receiving chemotherapy.

Immune cell phenotyping using DNAm markers, termed immunomethylomics or methylation cytometry, offers a solution for determining the body's immune cell landscape that does not require fresh blood and is scalable to large sample sizes. Despite significant advances in DNAm-based deconvolution, references at the population level are needed for clinical and research interpretation of these additional immune layers. Here we aim to provide some references for immune populations in a group of multi-ethnic post-menopausal American women.We applied DNAm-based deconvolution to a large sample of post-menopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative (baseline, N = 58) or the ancillary Long Life Study (WHI-LLS, N = 1237) to determine the reference ranges of 58 immune parameters, including proportions and absolute counts for 19 leukocyte subsets and 20 derived cell ratios. Participants were 50-94 years old at the time of blood draw, and N = 898 (69.3%) self-identified as White. Using linear regression models, we observed significant associations between age at blood draw and absolute counts and proportions of naïve B, memory CD4+, naïve CD4+, naïve CD8+, memory CD8+ memory, neutrophils, and natural killer cells. We also assessed the same immune profiles in a subset of paired longitudinal samples collected 14-18 years apart across N = 52 participants. Our results demonstrate high inter-individual variability in rates of change of leukocyte subsets over this time. And, when conducting paired t tests to test the difference in counts and proportions between the baseline visit and LLS visit, there were significant changes in naïve B, memory CD4+, naïve CD4+, naïve CD8+, memory CD8+ cells and neutrophils, similar to the results seen when analyzing the association with age in the entire cohort.Here, we show that derived cell counts largely reflect the immune profile associated with proportions and that these novel methods replicate the known immune profiles associated with age. Further, we demonstrate the value this methylation cytometry approach can add as a potential application in epidemiological studies.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37110199","Identification of Genetic Markers Linked to The Activity of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase and Kidney Function.","Metabolites","Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a tryptophan-degrading enzyme belonging to the kynurenine pathway. IDO activity has been suggested as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to perform coincident association analysis to gain genetic insights into the correlation between IDO activity and CKD. This study evaluated the association between IDO activity and CKD using the Korea Association REsource (KARE) cohort. Logistic and linear regression were used to analyze CKD and quantitative phenotypes such as IDO and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Our results identified 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were coincidently associated with both IDO and CKD (p< 0.001). Among them, rs6550842, rs77624055, and rs35651150 were selected as potential candidates after excluding SNPs with insufficient evidence for having an association with IDO or CKD. Further expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis for variants at selected loci showed that rs6550842 and rs35651150 significantly affected the expression ofNKIRAS1andSH2D4Agenes in human tissues, respectively. Additionally, we highlighted that theNKIRAS1andBMP6genes were correlated with IDO activity and CKD through signaling pathways associated with inflammation. Our data suggest thatNKIRAS1,SH2D4A, andBMP6were potential causative genes affecting IDO activity and CKD through integrated analysis. Identifying these genes could aid in early detection and treatment by predicting the risk of CKD associated with IDO activity."

Here we explored the plasma lipidome (783 lipid species) in 765 children (485 diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) within the Australian Autism Biobank. We identified lipids associated with ASD diagnosis (n = 8), sleep disturbances (n = 20) and cognitive function (n = 8) and found that long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids may causally contribute to sleep disturbances mediated by the FADS gene cluster. We explored the interplay of environmental factors with neurodevelopment and the lipidome, finding that sleep disturbances and unhealthy diet have a convergent lipidome profile (with potential mediation by the microbiome) that is also independently associated with poorer adaptive function. In contrast, ASD lipidome differences were accounted for by dietary differences and sleep disturbances. We identified a large chr19p13.2 copy number variant genetic deletion spanning the LDLR gene and two high-confidence ASD genes (ELAVL3 and SMARCA4) in one child with an ASD diagnosis and widespread low-density lipoprotein-related lipidome derangements. Lipidomics captures the complexity of neurodevelopment, as well as the biological effects of conditions that commonly affect quality of life among autistic people.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37066281","StocSum: stochastic summary statistics for whole genome sequencing studies.","bioRxiv","Genomic summary statistics, usually defined as single-variant test results from genome-wide association studies, have been widely used to advance the genetics field in a wide range of applications. Applications that involve multiple genetic variants also require their correlations or linkage disequilibrium (LD) information, often obtained from an external reference panel. In practice, it is usually difficult to find suitable external reference panels that represent the LD structure for underrepresented and admixed populations, or rare genetic variants from whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies, limiting the scope of applications for genomic summary statistics. Here we introduce StocSum, a novel reference-panel-free statistical framework for generating, managing, and analyzing stochastic summary statistics using random vectors. We develop various downstream applications using StocSum including single-variant tests, conditional association tests, gene-environment interaction tests, variant set tests, as well as meta-analysis and LD score regression tools. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of StocSum using two cohorts from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine Program. StocSum will facilitate sharing and utilization of genomic summary statistics from WGS studies, especially for underrepresented and admixed populations."

However, our limited understanding of the biological basis of depression has hindered the development of novel treatments and interventions.To identify new candidate genes for therapeutic development, we examined single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snucRNAseq) data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (N=424) in relation to ante-mortem depressive symptoms. To complement these direct analyses, we also used genome- wide association study (GWAS) results for depression (N=500,199) along with genetic tools for inferring the expression of 22,159 genes in 7 cell types and 55 cell subtypes to perform transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) of depression followed by Mendelian randomization (MR).Our single-nucleus TWAS analysis identified 71 causal genes in depression that have a role in specific neocortical cell subtypes; 59 of 71 genes were novel compared to previous studies. Depression TWAS genes showed a cell type specific pattern, with the greatest enrichment being in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as astrocytes. Gene expression in different neuron subtypes have different directions of effect on depression risk. Compared to lower genetically correlated traits (e.g. body mass index) with depression, higher correlated traits (e.g., neuroticism) have more common TWAS genes with depression. In parallel, we performed differential gene expression analysis in relation to depression in 55 cortical cell subtypes, and we found that genes such asANKRD36,MADD,TAOK3,SCAIandCHUKare associated with depression in specific cell subtypes.These two sets of analyses illustrate the utility of large snucRNAseq data to uncover both genes whose expression is altered in specific cell subtypes in the context of depression and to enhance the interpretation of well-powered GWAS so that we can prioritize specific susceptibility genes for further analysis and therapeutic development."

Only 10.4% of caQTL are shared between neurons and glia, supporting the cell type specificity of genetic regulation of the brain regulome. Incorporating allele specific chromatin accessibility improves statistical fine-mapping and refines molecular mechanisms underlying disease risk.

Despite showing substantial heritability and being partly determined by a genetic component, the genetic underpinnings explaining the high rates of comorbidity remain largely unclear and there are no conclusive data on the temporal relationship between them. Exploring the overlapping genetic architecture between IBS and mental conditions may help to identify novel genetic loci and biological mechanisms underlying IBS and causal relationships between them.We quantified the genetic overlap between IBS, neuroticism, depression and anxiety, conducted a multi-trait genome-wide association study (GWAS) considering these traits and investigated causal relationships between them by using the largest GWAS to date.IBS showed to be a highly polygenic disorder with extensive genetic sharing with mental conditions. Multi-trait analysis of IBS and neuroticism, depression and anxiety identified 42 genome-wide significant variants for IBS, of which 38 are novel. Fine-mapping risk loci highlighted 289 genes enriched in genes upregulated during early embryonic brain development and gene-sets related with psychiatric, digestive and autoimmune disorders. IBS-associated genes were enriched for target genes of anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs, anesthetics and opioid dependence pharmacological treatment. Mendelian-randomization analysis accounting for correlated pleiotropy identified bidirectional causal effects between IBS and neuroticism and depression and causal effects of the genetic liability of IBS on anxiety.These findings provide evidence of the polygenic architecture of IBS, identify novel genome-wide significant variants for IBS and extend previous knowledge on the genetic overlap and relationship between gastrointestinal and mental disorders.© 2023.

Venous thromboembolism and COVID-19 may share a common genetic architecture, which has not been clarified. To fill this gap, we leverage summary-level genetic data from the latest COVID-19 host genetics consortium and UK Biobank and examine the shared genetic etiology and causal relationship between COVID-19 and venous thromboembolism. The cross-trait and co-localization analyses identify 2, 3, and 4 shared loci between venous thromboembolism and severe COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization, SARS-CoV-2 infection respectively, which are mapped to ABO, ADAMTS13, FUT2 genes involved in coagulation functions. Enrichment analysis supports shared biological processes between COVID-19 and venous thromboembolism related to coagulation and immunity. Bi-directional Mendelian randomization suggests that venous thromboembolism was associated with higher risk of three COVID-19 traits, and SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a higher risk of venous thromboembolism. Our study provides timely evidence for the genetic etiology between COVID-19 and venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Efforts to maximize their accuracy are ongoing. Using 240 glomerular (GLOM) and 311 tubulointerstitial (TUBE) micro-dissected samples from human kidney biopsies, we discovered 5371 GLOM and 9787 TUBE genes with at least one variant significantly associated with expression (eGene) by incorporating kidney single-nucleus open chromatin data and transcription start site distance as an ""integrative prior"" for Bayesian statistical fine-mapping. The use of an integrative prior resulted in higher resolution eQTLs illustrated by (1) smaller numbers of variants in credible sets with greater confidence, (2) increased enrichment of partitioned heritability for GWAS of two kidney traits, (3) an increased number of variants colocalized with the GWAS loci, and (4) enrichment of computationally predicted functional regulatory variants. A subset of variants and genes were validated experimentally in vitro and using a Drosophila nephrocyte model.

"37034649",NA,NA,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease that develops through diverse pathophysiological processes. To characterise the genetic contribution to these processes across ancestry groups, we aggregate genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from 2,535,601 individuals (39.7% non-European ancestry), including 428,452 T2D cases. We identify 1,289 independent association signals at genome-wide significance (P<5×10-8) that map to 611 loci, of which 145 loci are previously unreported. We define eight non-overlapping clusters of T2D signals characterised by distinct profiles of cardiometabolic trait associations. These clusters are differentially enriched for cell-type specific regions of open chromatin, including pancreatic islets, adipocytes, endothelial, and enteroendocrine cells. We build cluster-specific partitioned genetic risk scores (GRS) in an additional 137,559 individuals of diverse ancestry, including 10,159 T2D cases, and test their association with T2D-related vascular outcomes. Cluster-specific partitioned GRS are more strongly associated with coronary artery disease and end-stage diabetic nephropathy than an overall T2D GRS across ancestry groups, highlighting the importance of obesity-related processes in the development of vascular outcomes. Our findings demonstrate the value of integrating multi-ancestry GWAS with single-cell epigenomics to disentangle the aetiological heterogeneity driving the development and progression of T2D, which may offer a route to optimise global access to genetically-informed diabetes care."
"37108631","Gene Therapy Based on Mesenchymal Stem Cells Derived from Adipose Tissue for the Treatment of Obesity and Its Metabolic Complications.","Int J Mol Sci","Obesity is a highly prevalent condition often associated with dysfunctional adipose tissue. Stem cell-based therapies have become a promising tool for therapeutic intervention in the context of regenerative medicine. Among all stem cells, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) are the most easily obtained, have immunomodulatory properties, show great ex vivo expansion capacity and differentiation to other cell types, and release a wide variety of angiogenic factors and bioactive molecules, such as growth factors and adipokines. However, despite the positive results obtained in some pre-clinical studies, the actual clinical efficacy of ADMSCs still remains controversial. Transplanted ADMSCs present a meager rate of survival and proliferation, possibly because of the damaged microenvironment of the affected tissues. Therefore, there is a need for novel approaches to generate more functional ADMSCs with enhanced therapeutic potential. In this context, genetic manipulation has emerged as a promising strategy. In the current review, we aim to summarize several adipose-focused treatments of obesity, including cell therapy and gene therapy. Particular emphasis will be given to the continuum from obesity to metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and underlying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Furthermore, we will provide insights into the potential shared adipocentric mechanisms involved in these pathophysiological processes and their remediation using ADMSCs."

Previous studies identified candidate CREs (cCREs) using epigenetic features in one species, making comparisons difficult across species. In contrast, we conducted a cross-species study defining epigenetic states and identifying cCREs in blood cell types to generate regulatory maps that are comparable across species. This study used integrative modeling of eight epigenetic features jointly in human and mouse in ourValidatedSystematicIntegration(VISION) Project. The contribution of each epigenetic state in cCREs to gene regulation was estimated from a multivariate regression against gene expression across cell types. We used these values to estimate epigenetic state Regulatory Potential (esRP) scores for each cCRE in each cell type, which are useful for visualizing and categorizing dynamic changes in cCREs. Groups of cCREs displaying similar patterns of regulatory activity in human and mouse cell types, obtained by joint clustering on esRP scores, harbored distinctive transcription factor binding motifs that were similar across species. Genetic variants associated with blood cell phenotypes were highly and specifically enriched in the catalog of human VISION cCREs, supporting its utility for understanding impacts of noncoding genetic variants on blood cell-related traits. A cross-species comparison of cCREs, based on the joint modeling, revealed both conserved and lineage-specific patterns of epigenetic evolution, even in the absence of genomic sequence alignment.

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a risk locus in the HLA Class II region and three additional independent risk loci. But the genetic architecture of pSSNS, and its genetically driven pathobiology, is largely unknown. Here, we conduct a multi-population GWAS meta-analysis in 38,463 participants (2440 cases). We then conduct conditional analyses and population specific GWAS. We discover twelve significant associations-eight from the multi-population meta-analysis (four novel), two from the multi-population conditional analysis (one novel), and two additional novel loci from the European meta-analysis. Fine-mapping implicates specific amino acid haplotypes in HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 driving the HLA Class II risk locus. Non-HLA loci colocalize with eQTLs of monocytes and numerous T-cell subsets in independent datasets. Colocalization with kidney eQTLs is lacking but overlap with kidney cell open chromatin suggests an uncharacterized disease mechanism in kidney cells. A polygenic risk score (PRS) associates with earlier disease onset. Altogether, these discoveries expand our knowledge of pSSNS genetic architecture across populations and provide cell-specific insights into its molecular drivers. Evaluating these associations in additional cohorts will refine our understanding of population specificity, heterogeneity, and clinical and molecular associations.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Comparing the output from weighted genome-wide association analyses (neffective = 94,643 to 102,215) with that from standard genome-wide association analyses (n = 263,464 to 283,749), we found that increasing representativeness led to changes in SNP effect sizes and identified novel SNP associations for 12 traits. While heritability estimates were less impacted by weighting (maximum change in h2, 5%), we found substantial discrepancies for genetic correlations (maximum change in rg, 0.31) and Mendelian randomization estimates (maximum change in βSTD, 0.15) for socio-behavioural traits.

Most research on meat quality has focused on marbling, a key characteristic related to meat eating quality. However, other important traits such as meat texture, tenderness, and color have not much studied in cattle. Among these traits, meat tenderness and texture of cattle are among the most important factors affecting quality evaluation of consumers. Collagen is the main component of connective tissues.It greatly affects meat tenderness. The objective of this study was to determine significant variants and candidate genes associated with collagen contents trait (total collagen) through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Phenotypic and genomic data from 135 Hanwoo were used. The BLUPF90 family program and GRAMMAR method for GWAS were applied in this study. A total of 73 potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed significant associations with collagen content. They were located in or near 108 candidate genes. TMEM135 and ME3 genes were identified to have the most significant SNPs associated with collagen contents trait. Data indicated that these genes were related to collagen. Biological processes and pathways for the prediction of biological functions of candidate genes were confirmed. We found that candidate genes were involved in positive regulation of CREB transcription factor activity and actin cytoskeleton related to tenderness and texture of beef. Three genes (CRTC3, MYO1C and MYLK4) belonging to these biological functions were related to tenderness. These results provide a basis for improving genomic characteristics of Hanwoo for the production of tender beef.

ME-Bayes SL conducts Bayesian hierarchical modeling under a multivariate spike-and-slab model for effect-size distribution and incorporates an ensemble learning step to combine information across different tuning parameter settings and ancestry groups. In our simulation studies and data analyses of 16 traits across four distinct studies, totaling 5.7 million participants with a substantial ancestral diversity, ME-Bayes SL shows promising performance compared to alternatives. The method, for example, has an average gain in prediction R2across 11 continuous traits of 40.2% and 49.3% compared to PRS- CSx and CT-SLEB, respectively, in the African Ancestry population.

Greater T1 time was associated with diabetes mellitus, renal disease, aortic stenosis, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, conduction disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Genome-wide association analysis identified 11 independent loci associated with T1 time. The identified loci implicated genes involved in glucose transport (SLC2A12), iron homeostasis (HFE, TMPRSS6), tissue repair (ADAMTSL1, VEGFC), oxidative stress (SOD2), cardiac hypertrophy (MYH7B) and calcium signaling (CAMK2D). Using a transforming growth factor β1-mediated cardiac fibroblast activation assay, we found that 9 of the 11 loci consisted of genes that exhibited temporal changes in expression or open chromatin conformation supporting their biological relevance to myofibroblast cell state acquisition.

Principal components analysis based on RNA-sequencing data was used to summarise gene expression profile in lung adenocarcinoma cases from TCGA (N=343).Although there was no genome-wide genetic correlation between LTL and lung cancer risk, longer LTL conferred an increased risk of lung cancer regardless of smoking status in the MR analyses, particularly for lung adenocarcinoma. Of the 144 LTL genetic instruments, 12 colocalised with lung adenocarcinoma risk and revealed novel susceptibility loci, includingMPHOSPH6,PRPF6, andPOLI. The polygenic risk score for LTL was associated with a specific gene expression profile (PC2) in lung adenocarcinoma tumours. The aspect of PC2 associated with longer LTL was also associated with being female, never smokers, and earlier tumour stages.

To validate the effect of the risk allele, qPCR and Western blotting experiments were used to investigate possible changes in gene expression. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was employed to implicate pathogenic mechanisms, and a polygenic risk score (PRS) for PE risk prediction was generated.After meta-analysis of the discovery dataset (622 cases, 8853 controls) and replication dataset (646 cases, 8810 controls), GWAS identified 3 independent loci associated with PE, including the reported loci FGG rs2066865 (p-value = 3.81 × 10-14), ABO rs582094 (p-value = 1.16 × 10-10) and newly reported locus FABP2 rs1799883 (p-value = 7.59 × 10-17). Previously reported 10 variants were successfully replicated in our cohort. Functional experiments confirmed that FABP2-A163G(rs1799883) promoted the transcription and protein expression of FABP2. Meanwhile, MR analysis revealed that high LDL-C and TC levels were associated with an increased risk of PE. Individuals with the top 10% of PRS had over a fivefold increased risk for PE compared to the general population.We identified FABP2, related to the transport of long-chain fatty acids, contributing to the risk of PE and provided more evidence for the essential role of metabolic pathways in PE development.© 2023.

Importantly, African genomes are heterogeneous: They contain mixtures of multiple ancestries, each of which have experienced different evolutionary histories. In this review, we view population genetics through the lens of admixture, highlighting how multiple demographic events have shaped African genomes. Each of these historical vignettes paints a recurring picture of population divergence followed by secondary contact. First, we give a brief overview of genetic variation in Africa and examine deep population structure within Africa, including the evidence of ancient introgression from archaic ""ghost"" populations. Second, we describe the genetic legacies of admixture events that have occurred during the past 10,000 years. This includes gene flow between different click-speaking Khoe-San populations, the stepwise spread of pastoralism from eastern to southern Africa, multiple migrations of Bantu speakers across the continent, as well as admixture from the Middle East and Europe into the Sahel region and North Africa. Furthermore, the genomic signatures of more recent admixture can be found in the Cape Peninsula and throughout the African diaspora. Third, we highlight how natural selection has shaped patterns of genetic variation across the continent, noting that gene flow provides a potent source of adaptive variation and that selective pressures vary across Africa. Finally, we explore the biomedical implications of population structure in Africa on health and disease and call for more ethically conducted studies of genetic variation in Africa.© The Author(s) 2023.

We compute heritability a) for all SNPs, b) excluding APOE region, c) excluding both APOE and genome-wide association study hit regions, and d) SNPs overlapping a microglia gene-set.SNP-based heritability of late onset Alzheimer's disease is between 38 and 66% when age and genetic disease architecture are correctly accounted for. The heritability estimates decrease by 12% [SD = 8%] on average when the APOE region is excluded and an additional 1% [SD = 3%] when genome-wide significant regions were removed. A microglia gene-set explains 69-84% of our estimates of SNP-based heritability using only 3% of total SNPs in all cohorts.The heritability of neurodegenerative disorders cannot be represented as a single number, because it is dependent on the ages of cases and controls. Genome-wide association studies pick up a large proportion of total AD heritability when age and genetic architecture are correctly accounted for. Around 13% of SNP-based heritability can be explained by known genetic loci and the remaining heritability likely resides around microglial related genes.Copyright: © 2023 Baker et al.

"37107557","Gene-by-Sex Interactions: Genome-Wide Association Study Reveals Five SNPs Associated with Obesity and Overweight in a Male Population.","Genes (Basel)","Obesity is a chronic health problem associated with severe complications and with an increasing prevalence in the Western world. Body-fat composition and distribution are closely associated with obesity, but the human body's composition is a sexually dimorphic trait, as differences between the two sexes are evident even from fetal life. The effect of sex hormones contributes to this phenomenon. However, studies investigating gene-by-sex interactions for obesity are limited. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with obesity and overweight in a male population. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) that included 104 control, 125 overweight, and 61 obese subjects revealed four SNPs associated with overweight (rs7818910, rs7863750, rs1554116, and rs7500401) and one SNP (rs114252547) associated with obesity in males. An in silico functional annotation was subsequently used to further investigate their role. Most of the SNPs were found in genes regulating energy metabolism and homeostasis, and some of them were expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). These findings contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-related traits, especially in males, and pave the road for future research toward the improvement of the diagnosis and therapy of obese individuals."

Different tools have been developed to extract differentially methylated regions (DMRs), often built upon assumptions from mammalian data. Here, we present MethylScore, a pipeline to analyse WGBS data and to account for the substantially more complex and variable nature of plant DNA methylation. MethylScore uses an unsupervised machine learning approach to segment the genome by classification into states of high and low methylation. It processes data from genomic alignments to DMR output and is designed to be usable by novice and expert users alike. We show how MethylScore can identify DMRs from hundreds of samples and how its data-driven approach can stratify associated samples without prior information. We identify DMRs in theA. thaliana1,001 Genomes dataset to unveil known and unknown genotype-epigenotype associations .© The Author(s) 2022."

The incidence of IBD is particularly high among Ashkenazi Jews. Here, we identify 8 novel and plausible IBD-causing genes from the exomes of 4453 genetically identified Ashkenazi Jewish IBD cases (1734) and controls (2719). Various biological pathway analyses are performed, along with bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, to demonstrate the likely physiological relatedness of the novel genes to IBD. Importantly, we demonstrate that the rare and high impact genetic architecture of Ashkenazi Jewish adult IBD displays significant overlap with very early onset-IBD genetics. Moreover, by performing biobank phenome-wide analyses, we find that IBD genes have pleiotropic effects that involve other immune responses. Finally, we show that polygenic risk score analyses based on genome-wide high impact variants have high power to predict IBD susceptibility.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37028392","Evidence of epistasis in regions of long-range linkage disequilibrium across five complex diseases in the UK Biobank and eMERGE datasets.","Am J Hum Genet","Leveraging linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns as representative of population substructure enables the discovery of additive association signals in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Standard GWASs are well-powered to interrogate additive models; however, new approaches are required for invesigating other modes of inheritance such as dominance and epistasis. Epistasis, or non-additive interaction between genes, exists across the genome but often goes undetected because of a lack of statistical power. Furthermore, the adoption of LD pruning as customary in standard GWASs excludes detection of sites that are in LD but might underlie the genetic architecture of complex traits. We hypothesize that uncovering long-range interactions between loci with strong LD due to epistatic selection can elucidate genetic mechanisms underlying common diseases. To investigate this hypothesis, we tested for associations between 23 common diseases and 5,625,845 epistatic SNP-SNP pairs (determined by Ohta's D statistics) in long-range LD (>0.25 cM). Across five disease phenotypes, we identified one significant and four near-significant associations that replicated in two large genotype-phenotype datasets (UK Biobank and eMERGE). The genes that were most likely involved in the replicated associations were (1) members of highly conserved gene families with complex roles in multiple pathways, (2) essential genes, and/or (3) genes that were associated in the literature with complex traits that display variable expressivity. These results support the highly pleiotropic and conserved nature of variants in long-range LD under epistatic selection. Our work supports the hypothesis that epistatic interactions regulate diverse clinical mechanisms and might especially be driving factors in conditions with a wide range of phenotypic outcomes.Copyright © 2023 American Society of Human Genetics.

"37127596",NA,NA,"Recently, deep neural networks have been successfully applied in many biological fields. In 2020, a deep learning model AlphaFold won the protein folding competition with predicted structures within the error tolerance of experimental methods. However, this solution to the most prominent bioinformatic challenge of the past 50 years has been possible only thanks to a carefully curated benchmark of experimentally predicted protein structures. In Genomics, we have similar challenges (annotation of genomes and identification of functional elements) but currently, we lack benchmarks similar to protein folding competition.Here we present a collection of curated and easily accessible sequence classification datasets in the field of genomics. The proposed collection is based on a combination of novel datasets constructed from the mining of publicly available databases and existing datasets obtained from published articles. The collection currently contains nine datasets that focus on regulatory elements (promoters, enhancers, open chromatin region) from three model organisms: human, mouse, and roundworm. A simple convolution neural network is also included in a repository and can be used as a baseline model. Benchmarks and the baseline model are distributed as the Python package 'genomic-benchmarks', and the code is available at https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/genomic_benchmarks .Deep learning techniques revolutionized many biological fields but mainly thanks to the carefully curated benchmarks. For the field of Genomics, we propose a collection of benchmark datasets for the classification of genomic sequences with an interface for the most commonly used deep learning libraries, implementation of the simple neural network and a training framework that can be used as a starting point for future research. The main aim of this effort is to create a repository for shared datasets that will make machine learning for genomics more comparable and reproducible while reducing the overhead of researchers who want to enter the field, leading to healthy competition and new discoveries.© 2023.

Differences in the size of the viral reservoir may relate to differences in plasma protein concentrations. We tested whether plasma protein expression levels are associated with levels of cell-associated (CA) HIV-1 DNA and RNA in 211 virally suppressed people living with HIV (PLHIV). Plasma concentrations of FOLR1, IL1R1, MICA, and FETUB showed a positive association with CA HIV-1 RNA and DNA. Moreover, SNPs in close proximity toIL1R1andMICAgenes were found to influence the levels of CA HIV-1 RNA and DNA. We found a difference in mRNA expression of theMICAgene in homozygotes carrying the rs9348866-A allele compared to the ones carrying the G allele (p < 0.005). Overall, our findings pinpoint plasma proteins that could serve as potential targets for therapeutic interventions to lower or even eradicate cells containing CA HIV-1 RNA and DNA in PLHIV.© 2023 The Authors."

Here, using a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) of 209,440 sequences, we examine all possible pair and triplet combinations, permutations and orientations of eighteen liver-associated transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). We find that TFBS orientation and order have a major effect on gene regulatory activity. Corroborating these results with genomic analyses, we find clear human promoter TFBS orientation biases and similar TFBS orientation and order transcriptional effects in an MPRA that tested 164,307 liver candidate regulatory elements. Additionally, by adding TFBS orientation to a model that predicts expression from sequence we improve performance by 7.7%. Collectively, our results show that TFBS orientation and order have a significant effect on gene regulatory activity and need to be considered when analyzing the functional effect of variants on the activity of these sequences.© 2023.

Despite technological advances in diagnosing and treating gastric cancer, GC still has high incidence and mortality rates. Therefore, continuous research is needed to overcome GC. In various studies, cell lines are used to find and verify the cause of specific diseases. Large-scale genomic studies such as ENCODE and Roadmap epigenomic projects provide multiomics data from various organisms and samples. However, few multi-omics data for gastric tissues and cell lines have been generated. Therefore, we performed RNA-seq, Exome-seq, and ChIP-seq with several gastric cell lines to generate a multi-omics data set in gastric cancer.Multiomic data, such as RNA-seq, Exome-seq, and ChIP-seq, were produced in gastric cancer and normal cell lines. RNA-seq data were generated from nine GC and one normal gastric cell line, mapped to a human reference genome (hg38) using the STAR alignment tool, and quantified with HTseq. Exome sequence data were produced in nine GC and two normal gastric lines. Sequenced reads were mapped and processed using BWA-MEM and GATK, variants were called by stralka2, and annotation was performed using ANNOVAR. Finally, for the ChIP-seq, nine GC cell lines and four GC cell lines were used in two experimental sets; chip-seq was performed to confirm changes in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. Data was mapped to human reference hg38 with BWA-MEM, and peak calling and annotation were performed using the Homer tool. Since these data provide multi-omics data for GC cell lines, it will be useful for researchers who use the GC cell lines to study.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Recent work has identified prominent pathogenic cell states in inflamed RA synovial tissue, such as T peripheral helper cells; however, the epigenetic regulation of these states has yet to be defined. We measured genome-wide open chromatin at single cell resolution from 30 synovial tissue samples, including 12 samples with transcriptional data in multimodal experiments. We identified 24 chromatin classes and predicted their associated transcription factors, including aCD8+GZMK+ class associated with EOMES and a lining fibroblast class associated with AP-1. By integrating an RA tissue transcriptional atlas, we found that the chromatin classes represented 'superstates' corresponding to multiple transcriptional cell states.

Here, we show that plasma NSV sequences are comprised primarily of large clones without evidence of viral evolution over time. We defined proviruses that contribute to plasma viremia as ""producer"", and those that did not as ""non-producer"". Compared to ART-suppressed individuals, NSV participants had a significantly larger producer reservoir. Producer proviruses were enriched in chromosome 19 and in proximity to the activating H3K36me3 epigenetic mark. CD4+cells from NSV participants demonstrated upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes and downregulation of pro-apoptotic and type I/II interferon-related pathways. Furthermore, NSV participants showed no elevation in HIV-specific CD8+cell responses and producer proviruses were enriched for HLA escape mutations. We identified critical host and viral mediators of NSV that represent potential targets to disrupt HIV persistence and promote viral silencing."

Much remains unknown about the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex disorder. Sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) is expressed at high levels in the central nervous system. Increasing evidence has demonstrated a close association between the Sig-1R and depression. Recently, research has suggested that the gut microbiota may play a crucial role in the development of depression.Male Sig-1R knockout (Sig-1R KO) and wild-type (WT) mice were used for this study. All transgenic mice were of a pure C57BL/6J background. Mice received a daily gavage of vancomycin (100 mg/kg), neomycin sulfate (200 mg/kg), metronidazole (200 mg/kg), and ampicillin (200 mg/kg) for one week to deplete gut microbiota. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was conducted to assess the effects of gut microbiota. Depression-like behaviors was evaluated by tail suspension test (TST), forced swimming test (FST) and sucrose preference test (SPT). Gut microbiota was analyzed by 16s rRNA and hippocampal transcriptome changes were assessed by RNA-seq.We found that Sig-1R knockout induced depression-like behaviors in mice, including a significant reduction in immobility time and an increase in latency to immobility in the FST and TST, which was reversed upon clearance of gut microbiota with antibiotic treatment. Sig-1R knockout significantly altered the composition of the gut microbiota. At the genus level, the abundance of Alistipes, Alloprevotella, and Lleibacterium decreased significantly. Gut microbiota dysfunction and depression-like phenotypes in Sig-1R knockout mice could be reproduced through FMT experiments. Additionally, hippocampal RNA sequencing identified multiple KEGG pathways that are associated with depression. We also discovered that the cAMP/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway is inhibited in the Sig-1R KO group along with lower expression of neurotrophic factors including CTNF, TGF-α and NGF. Fecal bacteria transplantation from Sig-1R KO mice also inhibited cAMP/CREB/BDNF signaling pathway.In our study, we found that the gut-brain axis may be a potential mechanism through which Sig-1R regulates depression-like behaviors. Our study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which Sig-1R regulates depression and further supports the concept of the gut-brain axis.Copyright © 2023 Li, Liu, Li, Liu, Yang, Chen, Zhang, Xie and Wang."
"37082508","Multi-omic integration via similarity network fusion to detect molecular subtypes of ageing.","Brain Commun","Molecular subtyping of brain tissue provides insights into the heterogeneity of common neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, existing subtyping studies have mostly focused on single data modalities and only those individuals with severe cognitive impairment. To address these gaps, we applied similarity network fusion, a method capable of integrating multiple high-dimensional multi-omic data modalities simultaneously, to an elderly sample spanning the full spectrum of cognitive ageing trajectories. We analyzed human frontal cortex brain samples characterized by five omic modalities: bulk RNA sequencing (18 629 genes), DNA methylation (53 932 CpG sites), histone acetylation (26 384 peaks), proteomics (7737 proteins) and metabolomics (654 metabolites). Similarity network fusion followed by spectral clustering was used for subtype detection, and subtype numbers were determined by Eigen-gap and rotation cost statistics. Normalized mutual information determined the relative contribution of each modality to the fused network. Subtypes were characterized by associations with 13 age-related neuropathologies and cognitive decline. Fusion of all five data modalities (n= 111) yielded two subtypes (nS1= 53,nS2= 58), which were nominally associated with diffuse amyloid plaques; however, this effect was not significant after correction for multiple testing. Histone acetylation (normalized mutual information = 0.38), DNA methylation (normalized mutual information = 0.18) and RNA abundance (normalized mutual information = 0.15) contributed most strongly to this network. Secondary analysis integrating only these three modalities in a larger subsample (n= 513) indicated support for both three- and five-subtype solutions, which had significant overlap, but showed varying degrees of internal stability and external validity. One subtype showed marked cognitive decline, which remained significant even after correcting for tests across both three- and five-subtype solutions (pBonf= 5.9 × 10-3). Comparison to single-modality subtypes demonstrated that the three-modal subtypes were able to uniquely capture cognitive variability. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses explored influences of sample size and cluster number parameters. We identified highly integrative molecular subtypes of ageing derived from multiple high dimensional, multi-omic data modalities simultaneously. Fusing RNA abundance, DNA methylation, and histone acetylation measures generated subtypes that were associated with cognitive decline.

"37111140","The Effect of Maternal Dietary Patterns on Birth Weight for Gestational Age: Findings from the MAMI-MED Cohort.","Nutrients","Limited evidence exists on the effects of maternal dietary patterns on birth weight, and most studies conducted so far did not adjust their findings for gestational age and sex, leading to potentially biased conclusions. In the present study, we applied a novel method, namely the clustering on principal components, to derive dietary patterns among 667 pregnant women from Catania (Italy) and to evaluate the associations with birth weight for gestational age. We identified two clusters reflecting distinct dietary patterns: the first one was mainly characterized by plant-based foods (e.g., potatoes, cooked and raw vegetables, legumes, soup, fruits, nuts, rice, wholemeal bread), fish and white meat, eggs, butter and margarine, coffee and tea; the second one consisted mainly of junk foods (sweets, dips, salty snacks, and fries), pasta, white bread, milk, vegetable and olive oils. Regarding small gestational age births, the main predictors were employment status and primiparity, but not the adherence to dietary patterns. By contrast, women belonging to cluster 2 had higher odds of large for gestational age (LGA) births than those belonging to cluster 1 (OR = 2.213; 95%CI = 1.047-4.679;p= 0.038). Moreover, the odds of LGA increased by nearly 11% for each one-unit increase in pregestational BMI (OR = 1.107; 95%CI = 1.053-1.163;p< 0.001). To our knowledge, the present study is the first to highlight a relationship between adherence to an unhealthy dietary pattern and the likelihood of giving birth to a LGA newborn. This evidence adds to the current knowledge about the effects of diet on birth weight, which, however, remains limited and controversial."

REs may cause these phenotypes via DNA damage, protein sequestration, insertional mutagenesis, and inflammation. We discuss several TE families, including gypsy, HERV-K, and HERV-W, and how TEs interact with various factors, including transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) and the siRNA and piwi-interacting (pi)RNA systems.

The Evolutionary Model proposes that PCOS arises from a collection of inherited polymorphisms that have been consistently demonstrated in a variety of ethnic groups and races. In utero developmental programming of susceptible genomic variants are thought to predispose the offspring to develop PCOS. Postnatal exposure to lifestyle and environmental risk factors results in epigenetic activation of developmentally programmed genes and disturbance of the hallmarks of health. The resulting pathophysiological changes represent the consequences of poor-quality diet, sedentary behaviour, endocrine disrupting chemicals, stress, circadian disruption, and other lifestyle factors. Emerging evidence suggests that lifestyle-induced gastrointestinal dysbiosis plays a central role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Lifestyle and environmental exposures initiate changes that result in disturbance of the gastrointestinal microbiome (dysbiosis), immune dysregulation (chronic inflammation), altered metabolism (insulin resistance), endocrine and reproductive imbalance (hyperandrogenism), and central nervous system dysfunction (neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system). PCOS can be a progressive metabolic condition that leads to obesity, gestational diabetes, type two diabetes, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. This review explores the mechanisms that underpin the evolutionary mismatch between ancient survival pathways and contemporary lifestyle factors involved in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of PCOS."

In traditional Chinese medicine, mulberry leaf is used to treat inflammation, colds, and antiviral illnesses. Mulberry leaves are one of the herbs with many medicinal applications, and as mulberry leaf study grows, there is mounting evidence that these leaves also have potent anti-diabetic properties. The direct role of mulberry leaf as a natural remedy in the treatment of diabetes has been proven in several studies and clinical trials. However, because mulberry leaf is a more potent remedy for diabetes, a deeper understanding of how it works is required. The bioactive compounds flavonoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, polyphenols, volatile oils, sterols, amino acids, and a variety of inorganic trace elements and vitamins, among others, have been found to be abundant in mulberry leaves. Among these compounds, flavonoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, and polyphenols have a stronger link to diabetes. Of course, trace minerals and vitamins also contribute to blood sugar regulation. Inhibiting alpha glucosidase activity in the intestine, regulating lipid metabolism in the body, protecting pancreatic -cells, lowering insulin resistance, accelerating glucose uptake by target tissues, and improving oxidative stress levels in the body are some of the main therapeutic properties mentioned above. These mechanisms can effectively regulate blood glucose levels. The therapeutic effects of the bioactive compounds found in mulberry leaves on diabetes mellitus and their associated molecular mechanisms are the main topics of this paper's overview of the state of the art in mulberry leaf research for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.Copyright © 2023 Chen, Xi, Gao, Li, Dong, Geng, Liu, Huang, Wang, Li, Wei and Miao."

Such missions will require humans to live for prolonged periods beyond low earth orbit where astronauts will be continuously exposed to high energy galactic cosmic rays (GCRs). A major unknown is the potential impact of GCRs on the risks of developing degenerative cardiovascular disease, which is a concern to NASA. A ground-based rat model has been used to provide a detailed characterization of the risk of long-term cardiovascular disease from components of GCRs at radiation doses relevant to future human missions beyond low earth orbit. Six month old male WAG/RijCmcr rats were irradiated at a ground-based charged particle accelerator facility with high energy ion beams broadly representative of GCRs: protons, silicon and iron. Irradiation was given either as a single ion beam or as a combination of three ion beams. For the doses used, the single ion beam studies did not show any significant changes in the known cardiac risk factors and no evidence of cardiovascular disease could be demonstrated. In the three ion beam study, the total cholesterol levels in the circulation increased modestly over the 270 day follow up period, and inflammatory cytokines were also increased, transiently, 30 days after irradiation. Perivascular cardiac collagen content, systolic blood pressure and the number of macrophages found in the kidney and in the heart were each increased 270 days after irradiation with 1.5 Gy of the three ion beam grouping. These findings provide evidence for a cardiac vascular pathology and indicate a possible threshold dose for perivascular cardiac fibrosis and increased systemic systolic blood pressure for complex radiation fields during the 9 month follow up period. The development of perivascular cardiac fibrosis and increased systemic systolic blood pressure occurred at a physical dose of the three ion beam grouping (1.5 Gy) that was much lower than that required to show similar outcomes in earlier studies with the same rat strain exposed to photons. Further studies with longer follow up periods may help determine whether humans exposed to lower, mission-relevant doses of GCRs will develop radiation-induced heart disease.Copyright: © 2023 Lenarczyk et al.

In response, team researchers have begun to focus more on teams whose work revolves around mitigating risks in these dynamic environments. Some highly insightful contributions to team research and organizational studies have originated from investigating teams that face unconventional or extreme events. Despite this increased attention to extreme teams, however, a comprehensive theoretical framework is missing. We introduce such a framework that envisionsteam extremenessas a continuous, multidimensional variable consisting ofenvironmental extremeness(i.e., external team context) andtask extremeness(i.e., internal team context). The proposed framework allows every team to be placed on the team extremeness continuum, bridging the gap between literature on extreme and more traditional teams. Furthermore, we present six propositions addressing how team extremeness may interact with team processes, emergent states, and outcomes using core variables for team effectiveness and the well-established input-mediator-output-input model to structure our theorizing. Finally, we outline some potential directions for future research by elaborating on temporal considerations (i.e., patterns and trajectories), measurement approaches, and consideration of multilevel relationships involving team extremeness. We hope that our theoretical framework and theorizing can create a path forward, stimulating future research within the organizational team literature to further examine the impact of team extremeness on team dynamics and effectiveness.© The Author(s) 2023."

It is essential that they accurately recapitulate the disease state of interest to generate results that will translate in the clinic. Prior studies have demonstrated that preclinical models do not recapitulate all biological aspects of human tissues, particularly with respect to the tissue of origin gene expression signatures. Therefore, it is critical to assess how well preclinical model gene expression profiles correlate with human cancer tissues to inform preclinical model selection and data analysis decisions. Here we evaluated how well preclinical models recapitulate human cancer and non-diseased tissue gene expression patterns with respect to the most variable genes, tumor purity, and tissue specificity by using publicly available gene expression profiles across multiple sources. We found that using the full gene set improves correlations between preclinical model and tissue global gene expression profiles, confirmed that GBM PDX global gene expression correlation to GBM tumor global gene expression outperforms GBM cell line to GBM tumor global gene expression correlations, and demonstrated that preclinical models in our study often failed to reproduce tissue-specific expression. While including additional genes for global gene expression comparison between cell lines and tissues decreases the overall correlation, it improves the relative rank between a cell line and its tissue of origin compared to other tissues. Our findings underscore the importance of using the full gene expression set measured when comparing preclinical models and tissues and confirm that tissue-specific patterns are better preserved in GBM PDX models than in GBM cell lines. Future studies can build on these findings to determine the specific pathways and gene sets recapitulated by particular preclinical models to facilitate model selection for a given study design or goal."
"37081465","Basement membrane-related regulators for prediction of prognoses and responses to diverse therapies in hepatocellular carcinoma.","BMC Med Genomics","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a global health threat. Finding a novel biomarker for assessing the prognosis and new therapeutic targets is vital to treating this patient population. Our study aimed to explore the contribution of basement membrane-related regulators (BMR) to prognostic assessment and therapeutic response prediction in HCC.The RNA sequencing and clinical information of HCC were downloaded from TCGA-LIHC, ICGC-JP, GSE14520, GSE104580, and CCLE datasets. The BMR signature was created by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm and used to separate HCC patients into low- and high-risk groups. We conducted analyses using various R 4.1.3 software packages to compare prognoses and responses to immunotherapy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and chemotherapeutic drugs between the groups. Additionally, stemness indices, molecular functions, and somatic mutation analyses were further explored in these subgroups.The BMR signature included 3 basement membrane-related genes (CTSA, P3H1, and ADAM9). We revealed that BMR signature was an independent risk contributor to poor prognosis in HCC, and high-risk group patients presented shorter overall survival. We discovered that patients in the high-risk group might be responsive to immunotherapy, while patients in the low-risk group may be susceptible to TACE therapy. Over 300 agents were screened to identify effective drugs for the two subgroups.Overall, basement membrane-related regulators represent novel biomarkers in HCC for assessing prognosis, response to immunotherapy, the effectiveness of TACE therapy, and drug susceptibility.© 2023.

"37120552","Extensive intratumor regional epigenetic heterogeneity in clear cell renal cell carcinoma targets kidney enhancers and is associated with poor outcome.","Clin Epigenetics","Clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC), the 8th leading cause of cancer-related death in the US, is challenging to treat due to high level intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and the paucity of druggable driver mutations. CcRCC is unusual for its high frequency of epigenetic regulator mutations, such as the SETD2 histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylase (H3K36me3), and low frequency of traditional cancer driver mutations. In this work, we examined epigenetic level ITH and defined its relationships with pathologic features, aspects of tumor biology, and SETD2 mutations.A multi-region sampling approach coupled with EPIC DNA methylation arrays was conducted on a cohort of normal kidney and ccRCC. ITH was assessed using DNA methylation (5mC) and CNV-based entropy and Euclidian distances. We found elevated 5mC heterogeneity and entropy in ccRCC relative to normal kidney. Variable CpGs are highly enriched in enhancer regions. Using intra-class correlation coefficient analysis, we identified CpGs that segregate tumor regions according to clinical phenotypes related to tumor aggressiveness. SETD2 wild-type tumors overall possess greater 5mC and copy number ITH than SETD2 mutant tumor regions, suggesting SETD2 loss contributes to a distinct epigenome. Finally, coupling our regional data with TCGA, we identified a 5mC signature that links regions within a primary tumor with metastatic potential.Taken together, our results reveal marked levels of epigenetic ITH in ccRCC that are linked to clinically relevant tumor phenotypes and could translate into novel epigenetic biomarkers.© 2023.

"37125033","A discriminant analysis of plasma metabolomics for the assessment of metabolic responsiveness to red raspberry consumption.","Front Nutr","Many studies show that the intake of raspberries is beneficial to immune-metabolic health, but the responses of individuals are heterogeneous and not fully understood.In a two-arm parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial, immune-metabolic outcomes and plasma metabolite levels were analyzed before and after an 8-week red raspberry consumption. Based on partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) on plasma xenobiotic levels, adherence to the intervention was first evaluated. A second PLS-DA followed by hierarchical clustering was used to classify individuals into response subgroups. Clinical immune and metabolic outcomes, including insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and sensitivity (Matsuda, QUICKI) indices, during the intervention were assessed and compared between response subgroups.Two subgroups of participants, type 1 responders (n = 17) and type 2 responders (n = 5), were identified based on plasma metabolite levels measured during the intervention. Type 1 responders showed neutral to negative effects on immune-metabolic clinical parameters after raspberry consumption, and type 2 responders showed positive effects on the same parameters. Changes in waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, fasting plasma apolipoprotein B, C-reactive protein and insulin levels as well as Matsuda, HOMA-IR and QUICKI were significantly different between the two response subgroups. A deleterious effect of two carotenoid metabolites was also observed in type 1 responders but these variables were significantly associated with beneficial changes in the QUICKI index and in fasting insulin levels in type 2 responders. Increased 3-ureidopropionate levels were associated with a decrease in the Matsuda index in type 2 responders, suggesting that this metabolite is associated with a decrease in insulin sensitivity for those subjects, whereas the opposite was observed for type 1 responders.The beneficial effects associated with red raspberry consumption are subject to inter-individual variability. Metabolomics-based clustering appears to be an effective way to assess adherence to a nutritional intervention and to classify individuals according to their immune-metabolic responsiveness to the intervention. This approach may be replicated in future studies to provide a better understanding of how interindividual variability impacts the effects of nutritional interventions on immune-metabolic health.Copyright © 2023 Barbe, de Toro-Martín, San-Cristobal, Garneau, Pilon, Couture, Roy, Couillard, Marette and Vohl."
"37117197","A unified model of the biology of peripartum depression.","Transl Psychiatry","Peripartum depression (PPD) is a prevalent and debilitating disorder that adversely affects the development of mothers and infants. Recently, there has been a plea for increased mental health screening during the peripartum period; however, currently, there is no accurate screening tool to identify women at risk of PPD. In addition, some women do not respond to current treatment schemes and develop treatment-resistant depression. The current perspective aims to propose a unified understanding of the biological underpinnings of PPD (UmPPD) that considers the heterogeneity in the onset, symptoms cluster, and severity of PPD. Such a model could promote basic and applied research on PPD and suggest new treatment avenues. The central hub of the model is the kynurenine pathway (KP) and the KP-serotonin ratio. The forces and specific processes at play that cause an imbalance within the KP and between KP and serotonin are inflammation, stress, reproductive hormones (especially estradiol and progesterone), and oxytocin. UmPPD predicts that the most severe PPD would comprise prolonged inflammation, ongoing or multiple stressors, excessive estrogen, progesterone resistance, and avoidance of breastfeeding, skin-to-skin contact, and social proximity. These factors would be associated with a higher likelihood of developing PPD, early onset, and more significant symptom severity. In addition, subtypes of PPD would consist of different compositions and expressions of these components, with one central common factor. UmPPD could aid in directing future research and possibly detecting critical processes that could help discover, develop, and utilize novel treatments for PPD.© 2023. The Author(s)."

"37120608","Reconstruction of the cell pseudo-space from single-cell RNA sequencing data with scSpace.","Nat Commun","Tissues are highly complicated with spatial heterogeneity in gene expression. However, the cutting-edge single-cell RNA-seq technology eliminates the spatial information of individual cells, which contributes to the characterization of cell identities. Herein, we propose single-cell spatial position associated co-embeddings (scSpace), an integrative method to identify spatially variable cell subpopulations by reconstructing cells onto a pseudo-space with spatial transcriptome references (Visium, STARmap, Slide-seq, etc.). We benchmark scSpace with both simulated and biological datasets, and demonstrate that scSpace can accurately and robustly identify spatially variated cell subpopulations. When employed to reconstruct the spatial architectures of complex tissue such as the brain cortex, the small intestinal villus, the liver lobule, the kidney, the embryonic heart, and others, scSpace shows promising performance on revealing the pairwise cellular spatial association within single-cell data. The application of scSpace in melanoma and COVID-19 exhibits a broad prospect in the discovery of spatial therapeutic markers.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37090237","CLCLSA: Cross-omics Linked embedding with Contrastive Learning and Self Attention for multi-omics integration with incomplete multi-omics data.","ArXiv","Integration of heterogeneous and high-dimensional multi-omics data is becoming increasingly important in understanding genetic data. Each omics technique only provides a limited view of the underlying biological process and integrating heterogeneous omics layers simultaneously would lead to a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of diseases and phenotypes. However, one obstacle faced when performing multi-omics data integration is the existence of unpaired multi-omics data due to instrument sensitivity and cost. Studies may fail if certain aspects of the subjects are missing or incomplete. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method for multi-omics integration with incomplete data by Cross-omics Linked unified embedding with Contrastive Learning and Self Attention (CLCLSA). Utilizing complete multi-omics data as supervision, the model employs cross-omics autoencoders to learn the feature representation across different types of biological data. The multi-omics contrastive learning, which is used to maximize the mutual information between different types of omics, is employed before latent feature concatenation. In addition, the feature-level self-attention and omics-level self-attention are employed to dynamically identify the most informative features for multi-omics data integration. Extensive experiments were conducted on four public multi-omics datasets. The experimental results indicated that the proposed CLCLSA outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches for multi-omics data classification using incomplete multi-omics data."
"37066415","Evolution of neuronal cell classes and types in the vertebrate retina.","bioRxiv","The basic plan of the retina is conserved across vertebrates, yet species differ profoundly in their visual needs (Baden et al., 2020). One might expect that retinal cell types evolved to accommodate these varied needs, but this has not been systematically studied. Here, we generated and integrated single-cell transcriptomic atlases of the retina from 17 species: humans, two non-human primates, four rodents, three ungulates, opossum, ferret, tree shrew, a teleost fish, a bird, a reptile and a lamprey. Molecular conservation of the six retinal cell classes (photoreceptors, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, retinal ganglion cells [RGCs] and Müller glia) is striking, with transcriptomic differences across species correlated with evolutionary distance. Major subclasses are also conserved, whereas variation among types within classes or subclasses is more pronounced. However, an integrative analysis revealed that numerous types are shared across species based on conserved gene expression programs that likely trace back to the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. The degree of variation among types increases from the outer retina (photoreceptors) to the inner retina (RGCs), suggesting that evolution acts preferentially to shape the retinal output. Finally, we identified mammalian orthologs of midget RGCs, which comprise >80% of RGCs in the human retina, subserve high-acuity vision, and were believed to be primate-specific (Berson, 2008); in contrast, the mouse orthologs comprise <2% of mouse RGCs. Projections both primate and mouse orthologous types are overrepresented in the thalamus, which supplies the primary visual cortex. We suggest that midget RGCs are not primate innovations, but descendants of evolutionarily ancient types that decreased in size and increased in number as primates evolved, thereby facilitating high visual acuity and increased cortical processing of visual information."

As there are no approved drugs that target sarcopenia, it has become increasingly urgent to identify promising pharmacological interventions. In this study, we conducted an integrative drug repurposing analysis utilizing three distinct approaches. Firstly, we analyzed skeletal muscle transcriptomic sequencing data in humans and mice using gene differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis. Subsequently, we employed gene expression profile similarity assessment, hub gene expression reversal, and disease-related pathway enrichment to identify and repurpose candidate drugs, followed by the integration of findings with rank aggregation algorithms. Vorinostat, the top-ranking drug, was also validated in an in vitro study, which demonstrated its efficacy in promoting muscle fiber formation. Although still requiring further validation in animal models and human clinical trials, these results suggest a promising drug repurposing prospect in the treatment and prevention of sarcopenia."

This study reports on one-year changes in blood markers of metabolic health and thyroid hormones in women with BN or BED attending two different treatments.These are secondary analyses from a randomized controlled trial of 16-week group treatment of either physical exercise and dietary therapy (PED-t) or cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Blood samples collected at pre-treatment, week eight, post-treatment, and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups were analyzed for glucose, lipids (triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-c), HDL cholesterol (HDL-c), apolipoprotein A (ApoA) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) lipoproteins), and thyroid hormones (thyroxine (T4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroperoxidase antibodies).The average levels of blood glucose, lipids and thyroid hormones were within the recommended range, but clinical levels of TC and LDL-c were detected in 32.5% and 39.1%, respectively. More women with BED compared with BN had low HDL-c, and a larger increase over time in TC and TSH. No significant differences occurred between PED-t and CBT at any measurement. Exploratory moderator analyses indicated a more unfavorable metabolic response at follow-up among treatment non-responders.The proportion of women with impaired lipid profiles and unfavorable lipid changes, suggests active monitoring with necessary management of the metabolic health of women with BN or BED, as recommended by metabolic health guidelines.Level I: Evidence obtained from a randomized, experimental trial.This trial was prospectively registered in the Norwegian Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics on December 16, 2013, with the identifier number 2013/1871, and in Clinical Trials on February 17, 2014, with the identifier number NCT02079935.© 2023.

TSEN54 encodes a protein constituting a subunit of the tRNA splicing endonuclease heterotetramer. Previous researches concentrated on the contribution of TSEN54 in pontocerebellar hypoplasia, but no studies have yet reported its role in HCC.TIMER, HCCDB, GEPIA, HPA, UALCAN, MEXPRESS, SMART, TargetScan, RNAinter, miRNet, starBase, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, cBioPortal, LinkedOmics, GSEA, TISCH, TISIDB, GeneMANIA, PDB, GSCALite were applied in this research.We identified the upregulation of TSEN54 expression in HCC and related it to multiple clinicopathological features. Hypomethylation of TSEN54 was closely associated with its high expression. HCC sufferers who held high TSEN54 expression typically had shorter survival expectations. Enrichment analysis showed the involvement of TSEN54 in the cell cycle and metabolic processes. Afterward, we observed that TSEN54 expression level had a positive relationship to the infiltration level of multiple immune cells and the expression of several chemokines. We additionally identified that TSEN54 was related to the expression level of several immune checkpoints and TSEN54 was linked to several m6A-related regulators.TSEN54 is a prognostic marker of HCC.

"37059586","Biological function analysis of ARHGAP39 as an independent prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma.","Aging (Albany NY)","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common subtype of liver cancer, with a high morbidity and low survival rate. Rho GTPase activating protein 39 (ARHGAP39) is a crucial activating protein of Rho GTPases, a novel target in cancer therapy, and it was identified as a hub gene for gastric cancer. However, the expression and role of ARHGAP39 in hepatocellular carcinoma remain unclear. Accordingly, the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data were used to analyze the expression and clinical value of ARHGAP39 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Further, the LinkedOmics tool suggested functional enrichment pathways for ARHGAP39. To investigate in depth the possible role of ARHGAP39 on immune infiltration, we analyzed the relationship between ARHGAP39 and chemokines in HCCLM3 cells. Finally, the GSCA website was used to explore drug resistance in patients with high ARHGAP39 expression. Studies have shown that ARHGAP39 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and relevant to clinicopathological features. In addition, the overexpression of ARHGAP39 leads to a poor prognosis. Besides, co-expressed genes and enrichment analysis showed a correlation with the cell cycle. Notably, ARHGAP39 may worsen the survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients by increasing the level of immune infiltration through chemokines. Moreover, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification-related factors and drug sensitivity were also found to be associated with ARHGAP39. In brief, ARHGAP39 is a promising prognostic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma patients that is closely related to cell cycle, immune infiltration, m6A modification, and drug resistance."

Because the incidence rate of Alzheimer disease (AD) increases exponentially with age, investigating the association between AD and the accumulation of somatic mutation can help understand the etiology of AD.We designed a somatic mutation detection workflow by contrasting genotypes derived from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data with genotypes derived from scRNA-seq data and applied this workflow to 76 participants from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort. We focused only on excitatory neurons, the dominant cell type in the scRNA-seq data.We identified 196 sites that harbored at least 1 individual with an excitatory neuron-specific somatic mutation (ENSM), and these 196 sites were mapped to 127 genes. The single base substitution (SBS) pattern of the putative ENSMs was best explained by signature SBS5 from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) mutational signatures, a clock-like pattern correlating with the age of the individual. The count of ENSMs per individual also showed an increasing trend with age. Among the mutated sites, we found 2 sites tend to have more mutations in older individuals (16:6899517 [RBFOX1],p= 0.04; 4:21788463 [KCNIP4],p< 0.05). In addition, 2 sites were found to have a higher odds ratio to detect a somatic mutation in AD samples (6:73374221 [KCNQ5],p= 0.01 and 13:36667102 [DCLK1],p= 0.02). Thirty-two genes that harbor somatic mutations unique to AD and theKCNQ5andDCLK1genes were used for gene ontology (GO)-term enrichment analysis. We found the AD-specific ENSMs enriched in the GO-term ""vocalization behavior"" and ""intraspecies interaction between organisms."" Of interest we observed both age-specific and AD-specific ENSMs enriched in the K+channel-associated genes.Our results show that combining scRNA-seq and WGS data can successfully detect putative somatic mutations.

Although the current consumer genetic testing regime relies on the reporting of individual variants of interest to consumers, there has recently been interest in the possibility of integrating polygenic scores (PGS), which aggregate genetic liability for disease across the entire genome. While PGS have thus far been extensively explored as clinical and public health tools, the use of PGS in consumer genetic testing has not yet received systematic attention, even though they are already in use for some consumer genetic tests. In this narrative review, we highlight the ethical, legal, and social implications of the use of PGS in DTC genetic tests and synthesize existing solutions to these concerns. We organize these concerns into three domains: (1) industry variation; (2) privacy and commercialization; and (3) patient safety and risk. While previously expressed concerns in these domains will remain relevant, the emergence of PGS-based DTC genetic tests raises challenges that will require novel approaches."

The functions of the placenta are controlled by its dynamic gene expression during gestation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the equine placental DNA methylome as one of the fundamental mechanisms that controls the gene expression dynamic. Chorioallantois samples from four (4M), six (6M), and ten (10M) months of gestation were used to map the methylation pattern of the placenta. Globally, methylation levels increased toward the end of gestation. We identified 921 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between 4M and 6M, 1225 DMRs between 4M and 10M, and 1026 DMRs between 6M and 10M. A total of 817 genes carried DMRs comparing 4M and 6M, 978 comparing 4M and 10M, and 804 comparing 6M and 10M. We compared the transcriptomes between the samples and found 1381 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when comparing 4M and 6M, 1428 DEGs between 4M and 10M, and 741 DEGs between 6M and 10M. Finally, we overlapped the DEGs and genes carrying DMRs (DMRs-DEGs). Genes exhibiting (a) higher expression, low methylation and (b) low expression, high methylation at different time points were identified. The majority of these DMRs-DEGs were located in introns (48.4%), promoters (25.8%), and exons (17.7%) and were involved in changes in the extracellular matrix; regulation of epithelial cell migration; vascularization; and regulation of minerals, glucose, and metabolites, among other factors. Overall, this is the first report highlighting the dynamics in the equine placenta methylome during normal pregnancy. The findings presented serve as a foundation for future studies on the impact of abnormal methylation on the outcomes of equine pregnancies."

Tissue kallikrein-related peptidase 8 (KLK8), a trypsin-like serine protease, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several psychiatric disorders. The present study aimed to explore the potential function of KLK8 in hippocampal neuronal cell apoptosis associated with depressive disorders in rodent models of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression. It was found that depression-like behavior in CUMS-induced mice was associated with hippocampal KLK8 upregulation. Transgenic overexpression of KLK8 exacerbated, whereas KLK8 deficiency attenuated CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors and hippocampal neuronal apoptosis. In HT22 murine hippocampal neuronal cells and primary hippocampal neurons, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of KLK8 (Ad-KLK8) was sufficient to induce neuron apoptosis. Mechanistically, it was identified that the neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) may associate with KLK8 in hippocampal neurons as KLK8 proteolytically cleaved the NCAM1 extracellular domain. Immunofluorescent staining exhibited decreased NCAM1 in hippocampal sections obtained from mice or rats exposed to CUMS. Transgenic overexpression of KLK8 exacerbated, whereas KLK8 deficiency largely prevented CUMS-induced loss of NCAM1 in the hippocampus. Both adenovirus-mediated overexpression of NCAM1 and NCAM1 mimetic peptide rescued KLK8-overexpressed neuron cells from apoptosis. Collectively, this study identified a new pro-apoptotic mechanism in the hippocampus during the pathogenesis of CUMS-induced depression via the upregulation of KLK8, and raised the possibility of KLK8 as a potential therapeutic target for depression.© 2023.

Non-etheless, classification of gastric cancer based upon DNA damage repair is still lacking. Here, we defined DNA damage repair-based subtypes across gastric cancer and identified clinicopathological, tumor microenvironment and pharmacogenomic features.Methods:Unsupervised clustering analysis was executed in the TCGA-STAD cohort based upon the transcriptional expression profiling of DNA damage repair genes. LASSO computational approach was adopted for generating a DNA damage repair-relevant gene signature. The identified subtypes or signature were externally verified in the GSE84426 or GSE84433 cohort. The transcriptional levels of immunomodulators, abundance of immune cells and somatic mutations were measured, respectively. Immunotherapeutic response, and drug sensitivity were investigated. The DNA damage repair-relevant genes were further experimentally verified.Results:Two DNA damage repair-based subtypes were identified, with the notable heterogeneity in prognostic stratification, tumor microenvironment and somatic mutations. The gene signature was generated for risk stratification and prognostic prediction, which was in relation to immunomodulators and immune cells. High-risk cases were more likely to respond to immunotherapy, with distinct pharmacogenomic landscapes between low- and high-risk groups. Higher levels of PAPPA2, MPO, MAGEA11, DEPP1, CPZ, and COLEC12 and lower level of CYTL1 were proven in gastric cancer cellsversuscontrols. Silencing CYTL1 facilitated intracellular ROS accumulation and suppressed migration in gastric cancer cells.Conclusion:Collectively, the DNA damage repair-based classification is a suitable complement to existing molecular classification system, and the quantitative gene signature provides a robust tool in selecting specific therapeutic options.Copyright © 2023 Kong, Wang and Wang."

A nomogram exhibited high prognostic prediction accuracy, with a concordance index of 0.785. The therapeutic effect of chemotherapeutic agents and antibody-drug conjugates was significantly different between RMS-low and -high groups. The combination of the RMS model and conventional characteristics (TMB, TNB and PD-L1) achieved an optimal AUC value of 0.828 in differentiating responders from non-responders to immunotherapy.Conclusion:We conferred the first landscape of five forms of RNA modifications in BCa and emphasized the excellent power of an RNA modifications-related model in evaluating BCa prognosis and immune landscape.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Chen and Yun."

The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were filtered and analyzed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). MCODE module was constructed. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to obtain the core gene modules. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was applied to identify key genes. ROC curves were employed to explore their diagnostic accuracy. Transcription factor prediction of the key biomarkers was performed using the Cytoscape plugin IRegulon. The analysis of the infiltration of 28 immune cells and their correlation with the key biomarkers were performed.A total of 1474 DEGs were identified. Their functions were mostly related to immune-related diseases and signaling pathways. MCODE identified five modules. The turquoise module of WGCNA had significant relevance to the glomerulus in FSGS. TGFB1 and NOTCH1 were identified as potential key glomerular biomarkers in FSGS. Eighteen transcription factors were obtained from the two hub genes. Immune infiltration showed significant correlations with T cells. The results of immune cell infiltration and their relationship with key biomarkers implied that NOTCH1 and TGFB1 were enhanced in immune-related pathways.TGFB1 and NOTCH1 may be strongly correlated with the pathogenesis of the glomerulus in FSGS and are new candidate key biomarkers. T-cell infiltration plays an essential role in the FSGS lesion process."
"37114094","Oocyte aging in comparison to stem cells in mice.","Front Aging","To maintain homeostasis, many tissues contain stem cells that can self-renew and differentiate. Based on these functions, stem cells can reconstitute the tissue even after injury. In reproductive organs, testes have spermatogonial stem cells that generate sperm in men throughout their lifetime. However, in the ovary, oocytes enter meiosis at the embryonic stage and maintain sustainable oogenesis in the absence of stem cells. After birth, oocytes are maintained in a dormant state in the primordial follicle, which is the most premature follicle in the ovary, and some are activated to form mature oocytes. Thus, regulation of dormancy and activation of primordial follicles is critical for a sustainable ovulatory cycle and is directly related to the female reproductive cycle. However, oocyte storage is insufficient to maintain a lifelong ovulation cycle. Therefore, the ovary is one of the earliest organs to be involved in aging. Although stem cells are capable of proliferation, they typically exhibit slow cycling or dormancy. Therefore, there are some supposed similarities with oocytes in primordial follicles, not only in their steady state but also during aging. This review aims to summarise the sustainability of oogenesis and aging phenotypes compared to tissue stem cells. Finally, it focuses on the recent breakthroughsin vitroculture and discusses future prospects.Copyright © 2023 Nagamatsu."
"37066341","Systematic visualisation of molecular QTLs reveals variant mechanisms at GWAS loci.","bioRxiv","Splicing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been implicated as a common mechanism underlying complex trait associations. However, utilising splicing QTLs in target discovery and prioritisation has been challenging due to extensive data normalisation which often renders the direction of the genetic effect as well as its magnitude difficult to interpret. This is further complicated by the fact that strong expression QTLs often manifest as weak splicing QTLs and vice versa, making it difficult to uniquely identify the underlying molecular mechanism at each locus. We find that these ambiguities can be mitigated by visualising the association between the genotype and average RNA sequencing read coverage in the region. Here, we generate these QTL coverage plots for 1.7 million molecular QTL associations in the eQTL Catalogue identified with five quantification methods. We illustrate the utility of these QTL coverage plots by performing colocalisation between vitamin D levels in the UK Biobank and all molecular QTLs in the eQTL Catalogue. We find that while visually confirmed splicing QTLs explain just 6/53 of the colocalising signals, they are significantly less pleiotropic than eQTLs and identify a prioritised causal gene in 4/6 cases. All our association summary statistics and QTL coverage plots are freely available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl/ ."

We undertook VDR proteogenomic analyses in European American (EA) and AA prostate cell lines and four clinical cohorts. Rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous protein (RIME) analyses revealed that nonmalignant AA RC43N prostate cells displayed the greatest dynamic protein content in the VDR complex. Likewise, in AA cells, Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing established greater 1α,25(OH)2D3-regulated chromatin accessibility, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed significant enhancer-enriched VDR cistrome, and RNA sequencing identified the largest 1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent transcriptome. These VDR functions were significantly corrupted in the isogenic AA RC43T prostate cancer cells, and significantly distinct from EA cell models. We identified reduced expression of the chromatin remodeler, BAZ1A, in three AA prostate cancer cohorts as well as RC43T compared with RC43N. Restored BAZ1A expression significantly increased 1α,25(OH)2D3-regulated VDR-dependent gene expression in RC43T, but not HPr1AR or LNCaP cells. The clinical impact of VDR cistrome-transcriptome relationships were tested in three different clinical prostate cancer cohorts. Strikingly, only in AA patients with prostate cancer, the genes bound by VDR and/or associated with 1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent open chromatin (i) predicted progression from high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to prostate cancer; (ii) responded to vitamin D3 supplementation in prostate cancer tumors; (iii) differentially responded to 25(OH)D3 serum levels. Finally, partial correlation analyses established that BAZ1A and components of the VDR complex identified by RIME significantly strengthened the correlation between VDR and target genes in AA prostate cancer only. Therefore, VDR transcriptional control is most potent in AA prostate cells and distorted through a BAZ1A-dependent control of VDR function.Our study identified that genomic ancestry drives the VDR complex composition, genomic distribution, and transcriptional function, and is disrupted by BAZ1A and illustrates a novel driver for AA prostate cancer.© 2023 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research."

Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, may act as mediators of persistent metabolic memory in endothelial cells (ECs) exposed to hyperglycaemia, even after glucose normalization. Therefore, we investigated alterations in global DNA methylation and epigenetic modifier expression (DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, HDAC1, and HDAC2) in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) from the umbilical cords of mothers with GDM (n = 8) and T2D (n = 3) compared to that of healthy mothers (n = 6). Global DNA alteration was measured using a 5-methylation cytosine colorimetric assay, followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to measure DNA methyltransferase and histone acetylase transcript expression. We revealed that DNA hypermethylation occurs in both GDM- and T2D-HUVECs compared to that in Control-HUVECs. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in HDAC2 mRNA levels in GDM-HUVECs and increase in DNMT3b mRNA levels in T2D-HUVECs. Overall, our results suggest that GDM and T2D are associated with global DNA hypermethylation in foetal endothelial cells under normoglycemic conditions and the aberrant mRNA expression of HDAC2 and DNMT3b could play a role in this dysregulation."

"37066212","Genetic associations among internalizing and externalizing traits with polysubstance use among young adults.","medRxiv","Though most genetic studies of substance use focus on specific substances in isolation or generalized vulnerability across multiple substances, few studies to date focus on the concurrent use of two or more substances within a specified time frame (i.e., polysubstance use; PSU). We evaluated whether distinct genetic factors underlying internalizing and externalizing traits were associated with past 30-day PSU above variance shared across general psychopathology and substance use (SU). Using Genomic Structural Equation Modeling, we constructed theory-driven, multivariate genetic factors of 16 internalizing, externalizing, and SU traits using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics. Next, we fit a model with a higher order SU-related psychopathology factor as well as genetic variance specific to externalizing and internalizing (i.e., residual genetic variance not explained by SU or general psychopathology). GWAS-by-subtraction was used to obtain single nucleotide polymorphism effects on each of these factors. Polygenic scores (PGS) were then created in an independent target sample with data on PSU, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. To evaluate the effect of genetic variance due to internalizing and externalizing traits independent of variance related to SU, we regressed PSU on the PGSs, controlling for sex, age, and genetic principal components. PGSs for SU-related psychopathology and non-SU externalizing traits were associated with higher PSU factor scores, while the non-SU internalizing PGS was not significantly associated with PSU. In total, the three PGSs accounted for an additional 4% of the variance in PSU above and beyond a null model with only age, sex, and genetic principal components as predictors. These findings suggest that there may be unique genetic variance in externalizing traits contributing to liability for PSU that is independent of the genetic variance shared with SU."

ER is vital for therapeutic targets in ER-positive breast cancer. Here, we review and report the different regulatory features present on ER with the objective to delineate potential mechanisms which may contribute to development of resistance. The UCSC Genome Browser, data mining, and bioinformatics tools were used to review enhancers, transcription factors (TFs), histone marks, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and variants residing in the non-coding region of the ER gene. We report 7 enhancers, 3 of which were rich in TF-binding sites and histone marks in a cell line-specific manner. Furthermore, some enhancers contain estrogen resistance variants and sites for lncRNA. Our review speculates putative models suggesting potential aberrations in gene regulation and expression if these regulatory landscapes and assemblies are altered.

The origin and development of CNO involve many complex immune processes, resulting in delayed diagnosis and a lack of effective treatment. Although bioinformatics analysis has been utilized to seek key genes and pathways in CNO, only a few bioinformatics studies that focus on CNO pathogenesis and mechanisms have been reported. This study aimed to identify key biomarkers that could serve as early diagnostic or therapeutic markers for CNO. Two RNA-seq datasets (GSE133378 and GSE187429) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis were conducted to identify the genes associated with CNO. Then, the autoinflammatory genes most associated with CNO were identified based on the GeneCards database and a CNO prediction model, which was created by the LASSO machine learning algorithm. The accuracy of the model and effects of the autoinflammatory genes according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were verified in external datasets (GSE7014). Finally, we performed clustering analysis with ConsensusClusterPlus. In total, eighty CNO-related genes were identified and were significantly enriched in the biological processes regulation of actin filament organization, cell-cell junction organization and gamma-catenin binding. The main enriched pathways were adherens junctions, viral carcinogenesis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Two autoinflammatory genes with high expression in CNO samples were identified by combining an optimal machine learning algorithm (LASSO) with the GeneCards database. An external validation dataset (GSE187429) was utilized for ROC analysis of the prediction model and two genes, and the results indicated good efficiency. Then, based on consensus clustering analysis, we found that the expression of UTS2 and MPO differed between clusters. Finally, the ceRNA network of lncRNAs and the small molecule compounds targeting the two autoinflammatory genes were predicted. The identification of two autoinflammatory genes, the HCG18/has-mir-147a/UTS2/MPO axis and signalling pathways in this study can help us understand the molecular mechanism of CNO formation and provides candidate targets for the diagnosis and treatment of CNO.© 2023.

Cancer metastasis generates the conundrum of the unknown origin of migrated tumor cells. Tracing tissue of origin and tumor type in primary and metastasized cancer is vital for clinical significance. DNA methylation alterations play a crucial role in carcinogenesis and mark cell fate differentiation, thus can be used to trace tumor tissue of origin. In this study, we employed a novel tumor-type-specific hierarchical model using genome-scale DNA methylation data to develop a multilayer perceptron model, HiTAIC, to trace tissue of origin and tumor type in 27 cancers from 23 tissue sites in data from 7735 tumors with high resolution, accuracy, and specificity. In tracing primary cancer origin, HiTAIC accuracy was 99% in the test set and 93% in the external validation data set. Metastatic cancers were identified with a 96% accuracy in the external data set. HiTAIC is a user-friendly web-based application through https://sites.dartmouth.edu/salaslabhitaic/. In conclusion, we developed HiTAIC, a DNA methylation-based algorithm, to trace tumor tissue of origin in primary and metastasized cancers. The high accuracy and resolution of tumor tracing using HiTAIC holds promise for clinical assistance in identifying cancer of unknown origin.© The Author(s) 2023.

In simulation studies with up to 100 quantitative traits, iterative hard thresholding exhibits similar true positive rates, smaller false positive rates, and faster execution times than GEMMA's linear mixed models and mv-PLINK's canonical correlation analysis.

Increasing age is a major risk factor for AF; however, the mechanisms of how aging contributes to the occurrence and progression of AF remain unclear. This study conducted weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify key modules and hub genes and determine their potential associations with aging-related AF.WGCNA was performed using the AF dataset GSE2240 obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus, which contained data from atrial myocardium in cardiac patients with permanent AF or sinus rhythm (SR). Hub genes were identified in clinical samples. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were also performed.Green and pink were the most critical modules associated with AF, from which nine hub genes,PTGDS, COLQ, ASTN2, VASH1, RCAN1, AMIGO2, RBP1, MFAP4,andALDH1A1, were hypothesized to play key roles in the AF pathophysiology in elderly and seven of them have high diagnostic value. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that the green module was associated with the calcium, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling pathways, and the pink module may be associated with the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway in myocardial fibrosis.We identified nine genes that may play crucial roles in the pathophysiological mechanism of aging-related AF, among which six genes were associated with AF for the first time.

"36973004","Race and Ethnicity in Pulmonary Function Test Interpretation: An Official American Thoracic Society Statement.","Am J Respir Crit Care Med","Current American Thoracic Society (ATS) standards promote the use of race and ethnicity-specific reference equations for pulmonary function test (PFT) interpretation. There is rising concern that the use of race and ethnicity in PFT interpretation contributes to a false view of fixed differences between races and may mask the effects of differential exposures. This use of race and ethnicity may contribute to health disparities by norming differences in pulmonary function. In the United States and globally, race serves as a social construct that is based on appearance and reflects social values, structures, and practices. Classification of people into racial and ethnic groups differs geographically and temporally. These considerations challenge the notion that racial and ethnic categories have biological meaning and question the use of race in PFT interpretation. The ATS convened a diverse group of clinicians and investigators for a workshop in 2021 to evaluate the use of race and ethnicity in PFT interpretation. Review of evidence published since then that challenges current practice and continued discussion concluded with a recommendation to replace race and ethnicity-specific equations with race-neutral average reference equations, which must be accompanied with a broader re-evaluation of how PFTs are used to make clinical, employment, and insurance decisions. There was also a call to engage key stakeholders not represented in this workshop and a statement of caution regarding the uncertain effects and potential harms of this change. Other recommendations include continued research and education to understand the impact of the change, to improve the evidence for the use of PFTs in general, and to identify modifiable risk factors for reduced pulmonary function."

Because women have a higher prevalence of AD than men, sex differences are of great interest. Using cross-sectional and longitudinal data, we showed sex-dependent metabolic dysregulations in the brains of AD patients. Cohort 1 (South Korean, n = 181) underwent Pittsburgh compound B-PET, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood biomarker (plasma tau and beta-amyloid 42 and 40) measurements at baseline and two-year follow-ups. Transcriptome analysis of data from Cohorts 2 and 3 (European, n = 78; Singaporean, n = 18) revealed sex differences in AD-related alterations in brain metabolism. In women (but not in men), all imaging indicators displayed consistent correlation curves with AD progression. At the two-year follow-up, clear brain metabolic impairment was revealed only in women, and the plasma beta-amyloid 42/40 ratio was a possible biomarker for brain metabolism in women. Furthermore, our transcriptome analysis revealed sex differences in transcriptomes and metabolism in the brains of AD patients as well as a molecular network of 25 female-specific glucose metabolic genes (FGGs). We discovered four key-attractor FGG genes (ALDOA, ENO2, PRKACB, and PPP2R5D) that were associated with amyloid/tau-related genes (APP, MAPT, BACE1, and BACE2). Furthermore, these genes successfully distinguished amyloid positivity in women.

At the same time, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous common variants associated with brain structure. In this study, we integrate these findings, aiming to identify proteins, metabolites, or microbes that have a putative causal association with subcortical brain structure volumes via a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach. This method uses genetic variants as instrument variables to identify potentially causal associations between an exposure and an outcome. The exposure data that we analyzed comprised genetic associations for 2,994 plasma proteins, 237 metabolites, and 103 microbial genera. The outcome data included GWAS data for seven subcortical brain structure volumes including accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, and thalamus. Eleven proteins and six metabolites were found to have a significant association with subcortical structure volumes. We found causal associations between amygdala volume and granzyme A as well as association between accumbens volume and plasma protease c1 inhibitor. Among metabolites, urate had the strongest association with thalamic volume. No significant associations were detected between the microbial genera and subcortical brain structure volumes. We also observed significant enrichment for biological processes such as proteolysis, regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum apoptotic signaling pathway, and negative regulation of DNA binding. Our findings provide insights to the mechanisms through which brain volumes may be affected in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders and point to potential treatment targets for disorders that are associated with subcortical brain structure volumes."

BRCA1 alterations can lead to impaired homologous recombination repair (HRR) of double-stranded DNA breaks, a process which involves the RING, BRCT and coiled-coil domains of the BRCA1 protein. In addition, the BRCA1 protein is involved in transcriptional activation (TA) of several genes through its C-terminal BRCT domain.In this study, we have investigated the effect on HRR and TA of 11 rare BRCA1 missense variants classified as variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS), located within or in close proximity to the BRCT domain, with the aim of generating additional knowledge to guide the correct classification of these variants. The variants were selected from our previous study ""BRCA1 Norway"", which is a collection of all BRCA1 variants detected at the four medical genetic departments in Norway.All variants, except one, showed a significantly reduced HRR activity compared to the wild type (WT) protein. Two of the variants (p.Ala1708Val and p.Trp1718Ser) also exhibited low TA activity similar to the pathogenic controls. The variant p.Trp1718Ser could be reclassified to likely pathogenic. However, for ten of the variants, the total strength of pathogenic evidence was not sufficient for reclassification according to the CanVIG-UK BRCA1/BRCA2 gene-specific guidelines for variant interpretation.When including the newly achieved functional evidence with other available information, one VUS was reclassified to likely pathogenic. Eight of the investigated variants affected only one of the assessed activities of BRCA1, highlighting the importance of comparing results obtained from several functional assays to better understand the consequences of BRCA1 variants on protein function.

"37066303","Defining the molecular identity and morphology of glia limitans superficialis astrocytes in mouse and human.","bioRxiv","Astrocytes are a highly abundant glial cell type that perform critical homeostatic functions in the central nervous system. Like neurons, astrocytes have many discrete heterogenous subtypes. The subtype identity and functions are, at least in part, associated with their anatomical location and can be highly restricted to strategically important anatomical domains. Here, we report that astrocytes forming theglia limitans superficialis, the outermost border of brain and spinal cord, are a highly specialized astrocyte subtype and can be identified by a single marker: Myocilin (Myoc). We show thatMyoc+ astrocytes cover the entire brain and spinal cord surface, exhibit an atypical morphology, and are evolutionarily conserved from rodents to humans. Identification of this highly specialized astrocyte subtype will advance our understanding of CNS homeostasis and potentially be targeted for therapeutic intervention to combat peripheral inflammatory effects on the CNS."

This study aimed to evaluate COVID-19 infections, adverse events, and humoral response after vaccination in a sample of LTCF residents. A total of 3259 LTCF residents (71% females; mean age: 83.4 ± 9.2 years) were enrolled in the Italian-based multicenter GeroCovid Vax study. We recorded the adverse effects occurring during the 7 days after vaccine doses and COVID-19 cases over 12 months post-vaccination. In a subsample of 524 residents (69% females), pre- and post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S immunoglobulin G (Anti-S-IgG) were measured through chemiluminescent assays at different time points. Only 12.1% of vaccinated residents got COVID-19 during the follow-up, without any sex differences. Female residents were more likely to have local adverse effects after the first dose (13.3% vs. 10.2%, p = 0.018). No other sex differences in systemic adverse effects and for the following doses were recorded, as well as in anti-S-IgG titer over time. Among the factors modifying the 12-month anti-S-IgG titers, mobility limitations and depressive disorder were more likely to be associated with higher and lower levels in the antibody response, respectively; a significantly lower antibody titer was observed in males with cardiovascular diseases and in females with diabetes or cognitive disorders. The study suggests that, among LTCF residents, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was effective regardless of sex, yet sex-specific comorbidities influenced the antibody response. Local adverse reactions were more common in females.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We hypothesised that a novel oral microbiome formula (SIM01) can reduce the risk of adverse health outcomes in at-risk subjects during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this single-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited subjects aged ≥65 years or with type two diabetes mellitus. Eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive three months of SIM01 or placebo (vitamin C) within one week of the first COVID-19 vaccine dose. Both the researchers and participants were blinded to the groups allocated. The rate of adverse health outcomes was significantly lower in the SIM01 group than the placebo at one month (6 [2.9%] vs. 25 [12.6],p< 0.001) and three months (0 vs. 5 [3.1%],p= 0.025). At three months, more subjects who received SIM01 than the placebo reported better sleep quality (53 [41.4%] vs. 22 [19.3%],p< 0.001), improved skin condition (18 [14.1%] vs. 8 [7.0%],p= 0.043), and better mood (27 [21.2%] vs. 13 [11.4%],p= 0.043). Subjects who received SIM01 showed a significant increase in beneficial Bifidobacteria and butyrate-producing bacteria in faecal samples and strengthened the microbial ecology network. SIM01 reduced adverse health outcomes and restored gut dysbiosis in elderly and diabetes patients during the COVID-19 pandemic."

"37091144","Recent revelations and future directions using single-cell technologies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","Front Oncol","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease with varying outcomes. In the last decade, the application of next-generation sequencing technologies has allowed extensive mapping of disease-specific genomic, epigenomic, immunogenetic, and transcriptomic signatures linked to CLL pathogenesis. These technologies have improved our understanding of the impact of tumor heterogeneity and evolution on disease outcome, although they have mostly been performed on bulk preparations of nucleic acids. As a further development, new technologies have emerged in recent years that allow high-resolution mapping at the single-cell level. These include single-cell RNA sequencing for assessment of the transcriptome, both of leukemic and non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment; immunogenetic profiling of B and T cell receptor rearrangements; single-cell sequencing methods for investigation of methylation and chromatin accessibility across the genome; and targeted single-cell DNA sequencing for analysis of copy-number alterations and single nucleotide variants. In addition, concomitant profiling of cellular subpopulations, based on protein expression, can also be obtained by various antibody-based approaches. In this review, we discuss different single-cell sequencing technologies and how they have been applied so far to study CLL onset and progression, also in response to treatment. This latter aspect is particularly relevant considering that we are moving away from chemoimmunotherapy to targeted therapies, with a potentially distinct impact on clonal dynamics. We also discuss new possibilities, such as integrative multi-omics analysis, as well as inherent limitations of the different single-cell technologies, from sample preparation to data interpretation using available bioinformatic pipelines. Finally, we discuss future directions in this rapidly evolving field.Copyright © 2023 Oder, Chatzidimitriou, Langerak, Rosenquist and Österholm."
"37106766","Intergenerational Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorder.","Biology (Basel)","Accelerated neurocognitive decline after general anesthesia/surgery, also known as perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND), is a widely recognized public health problem that may affect millions of patients each year. Advanced age, with its increasing prevalence of heightened stress, inflammation, and neurodegenerative alterations, is a consistent contributing factor to the development of PND. Although a strong homeostatic reserve in young adults makes them more resilient to PND, animal data suggest that young adults with pathophysiological conditions characterized by excessive stress and inflammation may be vulnerable to PND, and this altered phenotype may be passed to future offspring (intergenerational PND). The purpose of this narrative review of data in the literature and the authors' own experimental findings in rodents is to draw attention to the possibility of intergenerational PND, a new phenomenon which, if confirmed in humans, may unravel a big new population that may be affected by parental PND. In particular, we discuss the roles of stress, inflammation, and epigenetic alterations in the development of PND. We also discuss experimental findings that demonstrate the effects of surgery, traumatic brain injury, and the general anesthetic sevoflurane that interact to induce persistent dysregulation of the stress response system, inflammation markers, and behavior in young adult male rats and in their future offspring who have neither trauma nor anesthetic exposure (i.e., an animal model of intergenerational PND)."

We herein demonstrated that a prior stimulation with bacterial and viral products followed by loss of the Tet2 gene facilitated the development of MDS via up-regulating the target genes of the Elf1 transcription factor and remodeling the epigenome in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in a manner that was dependent on Polo-like kinases (Plk) downstream of Tlr3/4-Trif signaling but did not increase genomic mutations. The pharmacological inhibition of Plk function or the knockdown of Elf1 expression was sufficient to prevent the epigenetic remodeling in HSCs and diminish the enhanced clonogenicity and the impaired erythropoiesis. Moreover, this Elf1-target signature was significantly enriched in MDS HSPCs in humans. Therefore, prior infection stress and the acquisition of a driver mutation remodeled the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes and cellular functions in HSCs via the Trif-Plk-Elf1 axis, which promoted the development of MDS.© 2023 Yokomizo-Nakano et al."
"36993751","Metabolic memory of Î”9-tetrahydrocannabinol exposure in pluripotent stem cells and primordial germ cells-like cells.","bioRxiv","Cannabis, the most consumed psychoactive drug in the world, is increasingly used by pregnant women. However, while cannabinoid receptors are expressed in the early embryo, the impact of phytocannabinoids exposure on early embryonic processes is lacking. Here, we leverage a stepwise in vitro differentiation system that captures early embryonic developmental cascade to investigate the impact of exposure to the most abundant phytocannabinoid, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC). We demonstrate that Δ9-THC increases the proliferation of naïve mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but not of their primed counterpart. Surprisingly, this increased proliferation, dependent on the CB1 receptor binding, is only associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ9-THC capitalizes on ESCs' metabolic bivalence by increasing their glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities. A memory of this metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile. These results represent the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early developmental stages."
"37091805","The Tet2-Upf1 complex modulates mRNA stability under stress conditions.","Front Genet","Introduction:Environmental stress promotes epigenetic alterations that impact gene expression and subsequently participate in the pathological processes of the disorder. Among epigenetic regulations, ten-eleven Translocation (Tet) enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in DNA and RNA and function as critical players in the pathogenesis of diseases. Our previous results showed that chronic stress increases the expression of cytoplasmic Tet2 in the hippocampus of mice exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS). Whether the cytoplasmic Tet2 alters RNA 5hmC modification in chronic stress-related processes remains largely unknown.Methods:To explore the role of cytoplasmic Tet2 under CMS conditions, we established CMS mice model and detected the expression of RNA 5hmC by dot blot. We verified the interaction of Tet2 and its interacting protein by co-immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry and screened downstream target genes by cluster analysis of Tet2 and upstream frameshift 1 (Upf1) interacting RNA. The expression of protein was detected by Western blot and the expression of the screened target genes was detected by qRT-PCR.Results:In this study, we found that increased cytoplasmic Tet2 expression under CMS conditions leads to increase in total RNA 5hmC modification. Tet2 interacted with the key non-sense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) factor Upf1, regulated the stability of stress-related genes such as Unc5b mRNA, and might thereby affect neurodevelopment.Discussion:In summary, this study revealed that Tet2-mediated RNA 5hmC modification is involved in stress-related mRNA stability regulation and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for chronic stress-related diseases such as depression.Copyright © 2023 Xia, Yan, Wang, Kong, Zhang, Miao, Ge, Wan and Xu."

"37111297","A Novel Electrochemical Differentiation between Exosomal-RNA of Breast Cancer MCF7 and MCF7/ADR-Resistant Cells.","Pharmaceuticals (Basel)","Cancer is considered one of the most burdensome diseases affecting lives and, hence, the economy. Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Patients with breast cancer are divided into two groups: one group responds to the chemotherapy, and the other group resists the chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the group which resists the chemotherapy is still suffering the pain associated with the severe side effects of the chemotherapy. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method to differentiate between both groups before the administration of the chemotherapy. Exosomes, the recently discovered nano-vesicles, are often used as cancer diagnostic biomarkers as their unique composition allows them to represent their parental cells, which makes them promising indicators for tumor prognosis. Exosomes contain proteins, lipids, and RNA that exist in most body fluids and are expelled by multiple cell types, including cancer cells. Furthermore, exosomal RNA has been significantly used as a promising biomarker for tumor prognosis. Herein, we have developed an electrochemical system that could successfully differentiate between MCF7 and MCF7/ADR depending on the exosomal RNA. The high sensitivity of the proposed electrochemical assay opens the door for further investigation that will address the other type of cancer cells."

The aims of this study were to explore the potential role of ALDOB in pan-cancer, in order to deepen the research on the pathological mechanism of cancer. Hence, we used several online tools (TIMER2, GEPIA2, UALCAN, cBioPortal, and MXPRESS) and R language to identify the correlation between the ALDOB expression and survival analysis, genetic alteration, DNA methylation, and immune cell infiltration based on The Cancer Genome Atlas project. The results showed that ALDOB was lowly expressed in pan-cancer. Survival analysis revealed that low expression of ALDOB was markedly related with poor clinical prognosis, while the genetic alteration within ALDOB changed along with the difference of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) prognosis in several cancers. A possible relationship between DNA methylation and ALDOB expression for several tumors was found. Besides, ALDOB expression was confirmed to be associated with tumor immune cell infiltration, especially in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), and testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) cases. Further, the enrichment analysis demonstrated that metabolic pathway was closely related to ALDOB expression. Our results provide a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis and suggest ALDOB could act as a promising tumor predictive biomarker for human cancer.Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

Renal inflammation and infiltration of immune cells contribute to the development and progression of DKD. Thus, the aim of the present study was to identify and validate immune-related biomarkers and analyze potential regulators including transcription factors (TFs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and drugs for DKD.Immune-related genes from the ImmPort database and glomeruli samples from GSE1009 and GSE30528 were used to identify differentially expressed immune-related genes (DEIRGs) of DKD. The expression level and clinical correlation analyses of DEIRGs were verified in the Nephroseq database. Murine podocytes were cultured to construct the high glucose-induced podocyte injury model. The reliability of the bioinformatics analysis was experimentally validated by RT-qPCR in podocytes. Networks among DEIRGs, regulators, and drugs were constructed to predict potential regulatory mechanisms for DKD.DKD-associated DEIRGs were identified. CCL19 and IL7R were significantly upregulated in the DKD group and negatively correlated with glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GHR, FGF1, FYN, VEGFA, F2R, TGFBR3, PTGDS, FGF9, and SEMA5A were significantly decreased in the DKD group and positively correlated with GFR. RT-qPCR showed that the relative mRNA expression levels of GHR, FGF1, FYN, TGFBR3, PTGDS, FGF9, and SEMA5A were significantly down-regulated in the high glucose-induced podocyte injury group. The enriched regulators for DEIRGs included 110 miRNAs and 8 TFs. The abnormal expression of DEIRGs could be regulated by 16 established drugs.This study identified immune-related biomarkers, regulators, and drugs of DKD.

In contrast, lncRNAs located in gene deserts are rarely explored. Here, we utilize multiple differentiation systems to dissect the role of a desert lncRNA, HIDEN (human IMP1-associated ""desert"" definitive endoderm lncRNA), in definitive endoderm differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells.We show that desert lncRNAs are highly expressed with cell-stage-specific patterns and conserved subcellular localization during stem cell differentiation. We then focus on the desert lncRNA HIDEN which is upregulated and plays a vital role during human endoderm differentiation. We find depletion of HIDEN by either shRNA or promoter deletion significantly impairs human endoderm differentiation. HIDEN functionally interacts with RNA-binding protein IMP1 (IGF2BP1), which is also required for endoderm differentiation. Loss of HIDEN or IMP1 results in reduced WNT activity, and WNT agonist rescues endoderm differentiation deficiency caused by the depletion of HIDEN or IMP1. Moreover, HIDEN depletion reduces the interaction between IMP1 protein and FZD5 mRNA and causes the destabilization of FZD5 mRNA, which is a WNT receptor and necessary for definitive endoderm differentiation.These data suggest that desert lncRNA HIDEN facilitates the interaction between IMP1 and FZD5 mRNA, stabilizing FZD5 mRNA which activates WNT signaling and promotes human definitive endoderm differentiation.© 2023.

However, much less is understood on whether social and fiscal policies have the capacity to reverse this damage, which intervention is likely to be most effective and when these interventions should be delivered to maximise their impact. This systematic review attempts to address these questions by looking at the impact of income-support interventions, delivered during the first 1,000 days of life, on cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory and mental health outcomes.The review was restricted to experimental or quasi experimental studies conducted in high income countries. Studies were retrieved from multidisciplinary databases as well as health, economic, social sciences-specific literature browsers. All papers retrieved through the search strategy were double screened at title, abstract and full text stage. Relevant data of the selected studies were extracted and collected in tables, then summarised via narrative synthesis approach. Robustness of findings was assessed by tabulating impact by health outcome, type of intervention and study design.Overall, 16 relevant papers were identified, including 15 quasi-experimental studies and one randomized control trial (RCT). Income-support interventions included were unconditional/conditional cash transfers, income tax credit and minimum wage salary policies. Most studies were conducted in United States and Canada. Overall, the evidence suggested limited effect on mental health indicators but a positive, albeit small, effect of most policies on birth weight outcomes. Despite this, according to few studies that tried to extrapolate the results into public health terms, the potential number of negative outcomes averted might be consistent.Income-support interventions can positively affect some of the health outcomes of interest in this review, including birth weight and mental health. Given the large number of people targeted by these programs, one could infer that - despite small - the observed effect may be still relevant at population level. Nonetheless, the limited generalisability of the evidence gathered hampers firm conclusions. For the future, the breadth and scope of this literature need to be broadened to fully exploit the potential of these interventions and understand how their public health impact can be maximised.© 2023.

Abnormal nucleotide metabolism (NM) not only promotes tumour cell proliferation but also inhibits immune responses in the TME. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether the combined signatures of NM and the TME could better predict the prognosis and treatment response in gastric cancer (GC). 97 NM-related genes and 22 TME cells were evaluated in TCGA-STAD samples, and predictive NM and TME characteristics were determined. Subsequent correlation analysis and single-cell data analysis illustrated a link between NM scores and TME cells. Thereafter, NM and TME characteristics were combined to construct an NM-TME classifier. Patients in the NMlow/TMEhigh group exhibited better clinical outcomes and treatment responses, which could be attributed to the differences in immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, tumour somatic mutations, immunophenoscore, immunotherapy response rate and proteomap. Additionally, the NMhigh/TMElow group benefited more from Imatinib, Midostaurin and Linsitinib, while patients in the NMlow/TMEhigh group benefited more from Paclitaxel, Methotrexate and Camptothecin. Finally, a highly reliable nomogram was developed. In conclusion, the NM-TME classifier demonstrated a pretreatment predictive value for prognosis and therapeutic responses, which may offer novel strategies for strategizing patients with optimal therapies.© 2023.

"37079537","A comparison of anatomic and cellular transcriptome structures across 40 human brain diseases.","PLoS Biol","Genes associated with risk for brain disease exhibit characteristic expression patterns that reflect both anatomical and cell type relationships. Brain-wide transcriptomic patterns of disease risk genes provide a molecular-based signature, based on differential co-expression, that is often unique to that disease. Brain diseases can be compared and aggregated based on the similarity of their signatures which often associates diseases from diverse phenotypic classes. Analysis of 40 common human brain diseases identifies 5 major transcriptional patterns, representing tumor-related, neurodegenerative, psychiatric and substance abuse, and 2 mixed groups of diseases affecting basal ganglia and hypothalamus. Further, for diseases with enriched expression in cortex, single-nucleus data in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) exhibits a cell type expression gradient separating neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and substance abuse diseases, with unique excitatory cell type expression differentiating psychiatric diseases. Through mapping of homologous cell types between mouse and human, most disease risk genes are found to act in common cell types, while having species-specific expression in those types and preserving similar phenotypic classification within species. These results describe structural and cellular transcriptomic relationships of disease risk genes in the adult brain and provide a molecular-based strategy for classifying and comparing diseases, potentially identifying novel disease relationships.Copyright: © 2023 Zeighami et al.

We measured 665 proteins in 797 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with mild cognitive impairment with abnormal amyloid (MCI(Aβ+): n = 50), AD-dementia (n = 230), non-AD dementias (n = 322) and cognitively unimpaired controls (n = 195) using proximity ligation-based immunoassays. Here we identified >100 CSF proteins dysregulated in MCI(Aβ+) or AD compared to controls or non-AD dementias. Proteins dysregulated in MCI(Aβ+) were primarily related to protein catabolism, energy metabolism and oxidative stress, whereas those specifically dysregulated in AD dementia were related to cell remodeling, vascular function and immune system. Classification modeling unveiled biomarker panels discriminating clinical groups with high accuracies (area under the curve (AUC): 0.85-0.99), which were translated into custom multiplex assays and validated in external and independent cohorts (AUC: 0.8-0.99).

However, the mechanisms by which such programs are regulated and how these may be targeted for therapeutic benefit remain poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively profile the genomic occupancy of mSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes throughout acute and chronic T cell stimulation, finding that stepwise changes in localization over transcription factor binding sites direct site-specific chromatin accessibility and gene activation leading to distinct phenotypes. Notably, perturbation of mSWI/SNF complexes using genetic and clinically relevant chemical strategies enhances the persistence of T cells with attenuated exhaustion hallmarks and increased memory features in vitro and in vivo. Finally, pharmacologic mSWI/SNF inhibition improves CAR-T expansion and results in improved anti-tumor control in vivo.

Senotherapy can be classified into senolytics (induce cell death in senescent cells) and senomorphics (ameliorate the adverse effects of senescent cells represented by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype). Although the precise mechanism has not been elucidated, various drugs against metabolic diseases may function as senotherapeutics, which has piqued the interest of the scientific community. Cellular senescence is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which are aging-related respiratory diseases. Large-scale observational studies have reported that several drugs, such as metformin and statins, may ameliorate the progression of COPD and IPF. Recent studies have reported that drugs against metabolic diseases may exert a pharmacological effect on aging-related respiratory diseases that can be different from their original effect on metabolic diseases. However, high non-physiological concentrations are needed to determine the efficacy of these drugs under experimental conditions. Inhalation therapy may increase the local concentration of drugs in the lungs without exerting systemic adverse effects. Thus, the clinical application of drugs against metabolic diseases, especially through an inhalation treatment modality, can be a novel therapeutic approach for aging-related respiratory diseases. This review summarizes and discusses accumulating evidence on the mechanisms of aging, as well as on cellular senescence and senotherapeutics, including drugs against metabolic diseases. We propose a developmental strategy for a senotherapeutic approach for aging-related respiratory diseases with a special focus on COPD and IPF.Copyright © 2023 Matsubayashi, Ito, Araya and Kuwano."
"37095957","Folate-dependent hypermobility syndrome: A proposed mechanism and diagnosis.","Heliyon","Hypermobility involves excessive flexibility and systemic manifestations of connective tissue fragility. We propose a folate-dependent hypermobility syndrome model based on clinical observations, and through a review of existing literature, we raise the possibility that hypermobility presentation may be dependent on folate status. In our model, decreased methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) activity disrupts the regulation of the ECM-specific proteinase matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), leading to high levels of MMP-2 and elevated MMP-2-mediated cleavage of the proteoglycan decorin. Cleavage of decorin leads ultimately to extracellular matrix (ECM) disorganization and increased fibrosis. This review aims to describe relationships between folate metabolism and key proteins in the ECM that can further explain the signs and symptoms associated with hypermobility, along with possible treatment with 5-methyltetrahydrofolate supplementation.© 2023 The Authors."

Up to now, we still know little about why plants make such decision from the perspective of biological genetic mechanisms.In this study, we construct an analytical mapping framework to explore the genetic mechanism regulating the interaction of two complex traits. The framework describes the dynamic growth of two traits and their interaction as Differential Interaction Regulatory Equations (DIRE), then DIRE is embedded into QTL mapping model to identify the key quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that regulate this interaction and clarify the genetic effect, genetic contribution and genetic network structure of these key QTLs. Computer simulation experiment proves the reliability and practicability of our framework.In order to verify that our framework is universal and flexible, we applied it to two sets of data fromPopulus euphratica, namely, aboveground stem length - underground taproot length, underground root number - underground root length, which represent relationships of phenotypic traits in two spatial dimensions of plant architecture. The analytical result shows that our model is well applicable to datasets of two dimensions.Our model helps to better illustrate the cooperation-competition patterns between phenotypic traits, and understand the decisions that plants make in a specific environment that are most conducive to their growth from the genetic perspective.Copyright © 2023 Lu, Wang, Gong, Yang, Ye, Fang, Zhang and Wu."

Recent studies have shown that epigenetic modifications contribute to alterations in gene expression and the development of DKD. This study aimed to show an expression profile of key DNA (de)methylation enzymes (DNMT, TET proteins) and their differences between sexes under obesity and diabetic condition. Male and female black and tan brachyury (BTBR) ob/ob mice and their corresponding wild-type littermates (BTBR WT) were studied until 16 weeks of age. Metabolic parameters, kidney morphophysiology and the expression of fibrotic markers and epigenetic enzymes were studied in whole kidney tissue or specifically in the glomerulus. The results showed sexual dimorphism in the development of metabolic disease and in kidney morphophysiology. Female mice have a different profile of DNMTs expression in both WT and obese/diabetic condition. Furthermore, metabolic condition negatively modulated the glomerular expression of TET1 and TET3 only in females. To our knowledge, this is the first study that shows a kidney profile of the expression of key (de)methylation enzymes, DNMTs and TETs, in the BTBR ob/ob experimental model of DKD and its association with sex. The knowledge of this epigenetic profile may help future research to understand the pathophysiology of DKD in males and females.Copyright © 2023 Veloso Pereira, Charleaux de Ponte, Malavolta Luz and Thieme."

Although studies have evaluated neighborhood-level disadvantage and breast cancer-specific survival after accounting for individual-level socioeconomic status (SES) in large national cancer databases, these studies are limited by age, socioeconomic, and racial and ethnic diversity.To investigate neighborhood SES (using a validated comprehensive composite measure) and breast cancer-specific survival in a majority-minority population.This retrospective multi-institutional cohort study included patients with stage I to IV breast cancer treated at a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center and sister safety-net hospital from January 10, 2007, to September 9, 2016. Mean (SD) follow-up time was 60.3 (41.4) months. Data analysis was performed from March 2022 to March 2023.Neighborhood SES was measured using the Area Deprivation Index (tertiles), a validated comprehensive composite measure of neighborhood SES.The primary outcome was breast cancer-specific survival. Random effects frailty models for breast cancer-specific survival were performed controlling for individual-level sociodemographic, comorbidity, breast cancer risk factor, access to care, tumor, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-concordant treatment characteristics. The Area Deprivation Index was calculated for each patient at the census block group level and categorized into tertiles (T1-T3).A total of 5027 women with breast cancer were included: 55.8% were Hispanic, 17.5% were non-Hispanic Black, and 27.0% were non-Hispanic White. Mean (SD) age was 55.5 (11.7) years. Women living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods (T3) had shorter breast cancer-specific survival compared with those living in the most advantaged neighborhoods (T1) after controlling for individual-level sociodemographic, comorbidity, breast cancer risk factor, access to care, tumor, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-concordant treatment characteristics (T3 vs T1: hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.65; P < .04).In this cohort study, a shorter breast cancer-specific survival in women from disadvantaged neighborhoods compared with advantaged neighborhoods was identified, even after controlling for individual-level sociodemographic, comorbidity, breast cancer risk factor, access to care, tumor, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-concordant treatment characteristics. The findings suggest potential unaccounted mechanisms, including unmeasured social determinants of health and access to care measures. This study also lays the foundation for future research to evaluate whether social adversity from living in a disadvantaged neighborhood is associated with more aggressive tumor biologic factors, and ultimately shorter breast cancer-specific survival, through social genomic and/or epigenomic alterations."

"37090552","MAPT expression is mediated by long-range interactions with cis -regulatory elements.","bioRxiv","Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases driven by abnormal aggregates of tau, a microtubule associated protein encoded by theMAPTgene.MAPTexpression is absent in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and increases during differentiation. This temporally dynamic expression pattern suggests thatMAPTexpression is controlled by transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements specific to differentiated cell types. Given the relevance ofMAPTexpression to neurodegeneration pathogenesis, identification of such elements is relevant to understanding genetic risk factors.We performed HiC, chromatin conformation capture (Capture-C), single-nucleus multiomics (RNA-seq+ATAC-seq), bulk ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq for H3K27Ac and CTCF in NPCs and neurons differentiated from human iPSC cultures. We nominated candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) forMAPTin human NPCs, differentiated neurons, and pure cultures of inhibitory and excitatory neurons. We then assayed these cCREs using luciferase assays and CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) experiments to measure their effects onMAPTexpression. Finally, we integrated cCRE annotations into an analysis of genetic variation in AD cases and controls.Using orthogonal genomics approaches, we nominated 94 cCREs forMAPT, including the identification of cCREs specifically active in differentiated neurons. Eleven regions enhanced reporter gene transcription in luciferase assays. Using CRISPRi, 5 of the 94 regions tested were identified as necessary forMAPTexpression as measured by RT-qPCR and RNA-seq. Rare and predicted damaging genetic variation in both nominated and confirmed CREs was depleted in AD cases relative to controls (OR = 0.40, p = 0.004), consistent with the hypothesis that variants that disruptMAPTenhancer activity, and thereby reduceMAPTexpression, may be protective against neurodegenerative disease.We identified both proximal and distal regulatory elements forMAPTand confirmed the regulatory function for several regions, including three regions centromeric toMAPTbeyond the well-described H1/H2 haplotype inversion breakpoint. This study provides compelling evidence for pursuing detailed knowledge of CREs for genes of interest to permit better understanding of disease risk."

A grading system based on the tumor cells' proliferation index predicts high-risk for G3 NETs. However, low-to-intermediate grade (G1/G2) NETs have an unpredictable clinical course that varies from indolent to highly malignant. Cultures of human cancer cells enable to perform functional perturbation analyses that are instrumental to enhance our understanding of cancer biology. To date, no tractable and reliable long-term culture of G1/G2 NET has been reported to permit disease modeling and pharmacological screens. Here, we report of the first long-term culture of a G2 metastatic small intestinal NET that preserves the main genetic drivers of the tumor and retains expression patterns of the endocrine cell lineage. Replicating the tissue, this long-term culture showed a low proliferation index, and yet it could be propagated continuously without dramatic changes in the karyotype. The model was readily available for pharmacological screens using targeted agents and as expected, showed low tumorigenic capacityin vivo. Overall, this is the first long-term culture of NETs to faithfully recapitulate many aspects of the original neuroendocrine tumor.Copyright © 2023 D’Agosto, Fiorini, Pezzini, Delfino, Simbolo, Vicentini, Andreani, Capelli, Rusev, Lawlor, Bassi, Landoni, Pea, Luchini, Scarpa and Corbo."
"37085894","YY1 lactylation in microglia promotes angiogenesis through transcription activation-mediated upregulation of FGF2.","Genome Biol","Ocular neovascularization is a leading cause of blindness. Retinal microglia have been implicated in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis and vasculopathy, but the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Lactylation is a novel lactate-derived posttranslational modification that plays key roles in multiple cellular processes. Since hypoxia in ischemic retinopathy is a precipitating factor for retinal neovascularization, lactylation is very likely to be involved in this process. The present study aimed to explore the role of lactylation in retinal neovascularization and identify new therapeutic targets for retinal neovascular diseases.Microglial depletion by the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor PLX3397 suppresses retinal neovascularization in oxygen-induced retinopathy. Hypoxia increased lactylation in microglia and accelerates FGF2 expression, promoting retinal neovascularization. We identify 77 sites of 67 proteins with increased lactylation in the context of increased lactate under hypoxia. Our results show that the nonhistone protein Yin Yang-1 (YY1), a transcription factor, is lactylated at lysine 183 (K183), which is regulated by p300. Hyperlactylated YY1 directly enhances FGF2 transcription and promotes angiogenesis. YY1 mutation at K183 eliminates these effects. Overexpression of p300 increases YY1 lactylation and enhances angiogenesis in vitro and administration of the p300 inhibitor A485 greatly suppresses vascularization in vivo and in vitro.Our results suggest that YY1 lactylation in microglia plays an important role in retinal neovascularization by upregulating FGF2 expression. Targeting the lactate/p300/YY1 lactylation/FGF2 axis may provide new therapeutic targets for proliferative retinopathies.© 2023. The Author(s)."

The primary injury damages spinal cord tissues and secondary injury mechanisms, including ischemia, apoptosis, inflammation, and astrogliosis, further exacerbate the lesions to the spinal cord. Recently, researchers have designed various therapeutic approaches for SCI by targeting its major cellular or molecular pathophysiology.Some strategies have shown promise in repairing injured spinal cord for functional recoveries, such as administering neuroprotective reagents, targeting specific genes to promote robust axon regeneration of disconnected spinal fiber tracts, targeting epigenetic factors to enhance cell survival and neural repair, and facilitating neuronal relay pathways and neuroplasticity for restoration of function after SCI. This review focuses on the major advances in preclinical molecular therapies for SCI reported in recent years.Recent progress in developing novel and effective repairing strategies for SCI is encouraging, but many challenges remain for future design of effective treatments, including developing highly effective neuroprotectants for early interventions, stimulating robust neuronal regeneration with functional synaptic reconnections among disconnected neurons, maximizing the recovery of lost neural functions with combination strategies, and translating the most promising therapies into human use."
"37115317","The omics era: a nexus of untapped potential for Mendelian chromatinopathies.","Hum Genet","The OMICs cascade describes the hierarchical flow of information through biological systems. The epigenome sits at the apex of the cascade, thereby regulating the RNA and protein expression of the human genome and governs cellular identity and function. Genes that regulate the epigenome, termed epigenes, orchestrate complex biological signaling programs that drive human development. The broad expression patterns of epigenes during human development mean that pathogenic germline mutations in epigenes can lead to clinically significant multi-system malformations, developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, and stem cell dysfunction. In this review, we refer to germline developmental disorders caused by epigene mutation as ""chromatinopathies"". We curated the largest number of human chromatinopathies to date and our expanded approach more than doubled the number of established chromatinopathies to 179 disorders caused by 148 epigenes. Our study revealed that 20.6% (148/720) of epigenes cause at least one chromatinopathy. In this review, we highlight key examples in which OMICs approaches have been applied to chromatinopathy patient biospecimens to identify underlying disease pathogenesis. The rapidly evolving OMICs technologies that couple molecular biology with high-throughput sequencing or proteomics allow us to dissect out the causal mechanisms driving temporal-, cellular-, and tissue-specific expression. Using the full repertoire of data generated by the OMICs cascade to study chromatinopathies will provide invaluable insight into the developmental impact of these epigenes and point toward future precision targets for these rare disorders.© 2023.

However, it is not yet clear how DNA methylation affects early embryonic muscle development between goose breeds of different body size. In this study, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was conducted on leg muscle tissue from Wuzong (WZE) and Shitou (STE) geese on embryonic day 15 (E15), E23, and post-hatch day 1. It was found that at E23, the embryonic leg muscle development of STE was more intense than that of WZE. A negative correlation was found between gene expression and DNA methylation around transcription start sites (TSSs), while a positive correlation was observed in the gene body near TTSs. It was also possible that earlier demethylation of myogenic genes around TSSs contributes to their earlier expression in WZE. Using pyrosequencing to analyze DNA methylation patterns of promoter regions, we also found that earlier demethylation of theMyoD1promoter in WZE contributed to its earlier expression. This study reveals that DNA demethylation of myogenic genes may contribute to embryonic leg muscle development differences between Wuzong and Shitou geese."

In this study, we investigated gene expressions and biological pathways underlying the associations between MDCs and birth weight, using microarray transcriptomics, in a Belgian birth cohort. Whole cord blood measurements of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls 153 (PCB-153), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and transcriptome profiling were conducted in 192 mother-child pairs. A workflow including a transcriptome-wide association study, pathway enrichment analysis with a meet-in-the-middle approach, and mediation analysis was performed to characterize the biological pathways and intermediate gene expressions of the MDC-birth weight relationship. Among 26,170 transcriptomic features, we successfully annotated five overlapping metabolism-related gene expressions associated with both an MDC and birth weight, comprisingBCAT2,IVD,SLC25a16,HAS3, andMBOAT2. We found 11 overlapping pathways, and they are mostly related to genetic information processing. We found no evidence of any significant mediating effect. In conclusion, this exploratory study provides insights into transcriptome perturbations that may be involved in MDC-induced altered birth weight."

Although alternative splicing is common mechanism in generating transcriptional diversity, its role in generating sex differences relative to differential gene expression is less clear. Here, we investigate the relative roles of differential gene expression and alternative splicing between male and female the horseshoe bat species,Rhinolophus sinicus. Horseshoe bats are an excellent model to study acoustic differences between sexes. Using RNA-seq analyses of two somatic tissues (brain and liver) from males and females of the same population, we identified 3,471 and 2,208 differentially expressed genes between the sexes (DEGs) in the brain and liver, respectively. DEGs were enriched with functional categories associated with physiological difference of the sexes (e.g.,gamete generation and energy production for reproduction in females). In addition, we also detected many differentially spliced genes between the sexes (DSGs, 2,231 and 1,027 in the brain and liver, respectively) which were mainly involved in regulation of RNA splicing and mRNA metabolic process. Interestingly, we found a significant enrichment of DEGs on the X chromosome, but not for DSGs. As for the extent of overlap between the two sets of genes, more than expected overlap of DEGs and DSGs was observed in the brain but not in the liver. This suggests that more complex tissues, such as the brain, may require the intricate and simultaneous interplay of both differential gene expression and splicing of genes to govern sex-specific functions. Overall, our results support that variation in gene expression and alternative splicing are important and complementary mechanisms governing sex differences.©2023 Chen et al."

This study aimed to clarify the association of core circadian clock gene expression with clinical features of asthma. For this purpose, we accessed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database and analyzed transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and clinical characteristics of 134 pediatric/adolescent patients with asthma. Based on the expression patterns of seven core circadian clock genes (CLOCK, BMAL1, PER1-3, CRY1-2), we identified three circadian clusters (CCs) with distinct comorbidities and transcriptomic expressions. In the three CC subtypes, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis, both asthma comorbidities occurred in different proportions: CC1 had a high proportion of allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis; CC2 had a high proportion of atopic dermatitis but a low proportion of allergic rhinitis; and CC3 had a high proportion of allergic rhinitis but a low proportion of atopic dermatitis. This might be associated with the low activity of the FcεRI signaling pathway in CC2 and the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways in CC3. This is the first report to consider circadian clock gene expression in subcategories of patients with asthma and to explore their contribution to pathophysiology and comorbidity."

Much remains unclear about the molecular mechanisms that regulate its normal and pathological physiology. This lack of knowledge largely stems from the inaccessible nature of the human brain, and the limitation of animal models. As a result, brain disorders are difficult to understand and even more difficult to treat. Recent advances in generating human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)-derived 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) neural cultures have provided an accessible system to model the human brain. Breakthroughs in gene editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 further elevate the hPSCs into a genetically tractable experimental system. Powerful genetic screens, previously reserved for model organisms and transformed cell lines, can now be performed in human neural cells. Combined with the rapidly expanding single-cell genomics toolkit, these technological advances culminate to create an unprecedented opportunity to study the human brain using functional genomics. This review will summarize the current progress of applying CRISPR-based genetic screens in hPSCs-derived 2D neural cultures and 3D brain organoids.

Here, we integrated statistical fine-mapping and functional annotation from prostate-specific epigenomic profiles, 3D genome features, and quantitative trait loci data to distinguish causal variants from associations and identify target genes. Our fine-mapping analysis yielded 3,395 likely causal variants, and multiscale functional annotation linked them to 487 target genes.

"36990085","Deletion mapping of regulatory elements for GATA3 in TÂ cells reveals a distal enhancer involved in allergic diseases.","Am J Hum Genet","GATA3 is essential for T cell differentiation and is surrounded by genome-wide association study (GWAS) hits for immune traits. Interpretation of these GWAS hits is challenging because gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies lack power to detect variants with small effects on gene expression in specific cell types and the genome region containing GATA3 contains dozens of potential regulatory sequences. To map regulatory sequences for GATA3, we performed a high-throughput tiling deletion screen of a 2 Mb genome region in Jurkat T cells. This revealed 23 candidate regulatory sequences, all but one of which is within the same topological-associating domain (TAD) as GATA3. We then performed a lower-throughput deletion screen to precisely map regulatory sequences in primary T helper 2 (Th2) cells. We tested 25 sequences with ∼100 bp deletions and validated five of the strongest hits with independent deletion experiments. Additionally, we fine-mapped GWAS hits for allergic diseases in a distal regulatory element, 1 Mb downstream of GATA3, and identified 14 candidate causal variants. Small deletions spanning the candidate variant rs725861 decreased GATA3 levels in Th2 cells, and luciferase reporter assays showed regulatory differences between its two alleles, suggesting a causal mechanism for this variant in allergic diseases. Our study demonstrates the power of integrating GWAS signals with deletion mapping and identifies critical regulatory sequences for GATA3.Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Traditional methods of mapping a transgene are challenging, thus complicating breeding strategies and accurate interpretation of phenotypes, particularly when a transgene disrupts critical coding or noncoding sequences. As the vast majority of transgenic mouse lines remain unmapped, we developed CRISPR-Cas9 Long-Read Sequencing (CRISPR-LRS) to ascertain transgene integration loci. This novel approach mapped a wide size range of transgenes and uncovered more complex transgene-induced host genome re-arrangements than previously appreciated. CRISPR-LRS offers a facile, informative approach to establish robust breeding practices and will enable researchers to study a gene without confounding genetic issues. Finally, CRISPR-LRS will find utility in rapidly and accurately interrogating gene/genome editing fidelity in experimental and clinical settings."

DDR-associated parameters, including endogenous DNA damage (single-strand breaks and double-strand breaks (DSBs) measured by the alkaline comet assay (Olive Tail Moment (OTM); DSBs-only by γH2AX immunofluorescence staining), DSBs repair capacity, oxidative stress, and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites were evaluated in PBMCs of 243 individuals aged 18-75 years, free of any major comorbidity. While OTM values showed marginal correlation with age until 50 years (rs= 0.41,p= 0.11), a linear relationship was observed after 50 years (r = 0.95,p< 0.001). Moreover, individuals older than 50 years showed increased endogenous DSBs levels (γH2Ax), higher oxidative stress, augmented apurinic/apyrimidinic sites and decreased DSBs repair capacity than those with age lower than 50 years (allp< 0.001). Results were reproduced when we examined men and women separately. Prospective studies confirming the value of DNA damage accumulation as a biomarker of aging, as well as the presence of a relevant agethreshold, are warranted."
"37039566","Variation in DNA Methylation in Avian Nestlings Is Largely Determined by Genetic Effects.","Mol Biol Evol","As environmental fluctuations are becoming more common, organisms need to rapidly adapt to anthropogenic, climatic, and ecological changes. Epigenetic modifications and DNA methylation in particular provide organisms with a mechanism to shape their phenotypic responses during development. Studies suggest that environmentally induced DNA methylation might allow for adaptive phenotypic plasticity that could last throughout an organism's lifetime. Despite a number of studies demonstrating environmentally induced DNA methylation changes, we know relatively little about what proportion of the epigenome is affected by environmental factors, rather than being a consequence of genetic variation. In the current study, we use a partial cross-foster design in a natural great tit (Parus major) population to disentangle the effects of common origin from common rearing environment on DNA methylation. We found that variance in DNA methylation in 8,315 CpG sites was explained by a common origin and only in 101 by a common rearing environment. Subsequently, we mapped quantitative trait loci for the brood of origin CpG sites and detected 754 cis and 4,202 trans methylation quantitative trait loci, involving 24% of the CpG sites. Our results indicate that the scope for environmentally induced methylation marks independent of the genotype is limited and that the majority of variation in DNA methylation early in life is determined by genetic factors instead. These findings suggest that there may be little opportunity for selection to act on variation in DNA methylation. This implies that most DNA methylation variation likely does not evolve independently of genomic changes.© The Author(s) 2023.

"36947101","High Nucleotide Diversity Accompanies Differential DNA Methylation in Naturally Diverging Populations.","Mol Biol Evol","Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation (DNAme) are thought to comprise an invaluable adaptive toolkit in the early stages of local adaptation, especially when genetic diversity is constrained. However, the link between genetic diversity and DNAme has been scarcely examined in natural populations, despite its potential to shed light on the evolutionary forces acting on methylation state. Here, we analyzed reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing and whole-genome pool-seq data from marine and freshwater stickleback populations to examine the relationship between DNAme variation (between- and within-population) and nucleotide diversity in the context of freshwater adaptation. We find that sites that are differentially methylated between populations have higher underlying standing genetic variation, with diversity higher among sites that gained methylation in freshwater than those that lost it. Strikingly, although nucleotide diversity is generally lower in the freshwater population as expected from a population bottleneck, this is not the case for sites that lost methylation, which instead have elevated nucleotide diversity in freshwater compared with marine. Subsequently, we show that nucleotide diversity is higher among sites with ancestrally variable methylation and also positively correlates with the sensitivity to environmentally induced methylation change. The results suggest that as selection on the control of methylation state becomes relaxed, so too does selection against mutations at the sites themselves. Increased epigenetic variance in a population is therefore likely to precede genetic diversification.© The Author(s) 2023.

Although most individuals who sustain mTBI typically achieve a seemingly full recovery within a few weeks, a subset experience delayed-onset symptoms later in life. As most mTBI research has focused on the acute phase of injury, there is an incomplete understanding of mechanisms related to the late-life emergence of neurodegeneration after early exposure to mild head trauma. The recent adoption ofDrosophila-based brain injury models provides several unique advantages over existing preclinical animal models, including a tractable framework amenable to high-throughput assays and short relative lifespan conducive to lifelong mechanistic investigation. The use of flies also provides an opportunity to investigate important risk factors associated with neurodegenerative conditions, specifically age and sex. In this review, we survey current literature that examines age and sex as contributing factors to head trauma-mediated neurodegeneration in humans and preclinical models, including mammalian andDrosophilamodels. We discuss similarities and disparities between human and fly in aging, sex differences, and pathophysiology. Finally, we highlightDrosophilaas an effective tool for investigating mechanisms underlying head trauma-induced neurodegeneration and for identifying therapeutic targets for treatment and recovery.Copyright © 2023 Ye, Behnke, Hardin and Zheng."
"37123215","Effect of splenectomy based on inverse probability weighting of the propensity score on Wilson's disease with hypersplenism: A retrospective cohort study.","Exp Ther Med","Hypersplenism is a long-term complication of Wilson's disease (WD). Patients often have to stop copper excretion treatment due to the decrease in blood cell count aggravation of abnormal liver function, anaemia, bleeding caused by coagulation dysfunction. The present study aimed to explore the effect of splenectomy on serum, biochemical indicators and neurological function in patients with hypersplenism of WD to evaluate the impact of splenectomy on their survival and prognosis. Due to the non-randomness of splenectomy in patients with hypersplenism in WD in the present study, the propensity scoring model and inverse probability treatment weighting were used to evaluate the age, sex, duration of the disease. A total of 86 patients (40 with and 46 without splenectomy) were included in the present study. The baseline and preoperative data were adjusted by the inverse probability weighting method using the propensity score model. There was no significant difference in distribution of propensity scores between the two groups (P>0.05). There were significant differences in time-weighted PLT levels in patients with hypersplenism of WD [after adjustment, odd ratio (OR)=0.010; 95% CI, 0.0013-0.047; P<0.001]. The time-weighted Child-Pugh scores after adjustment also suggested a significant difference (OR=0.0684; 95% CI, 0.018-0.207; P<0.001). The time-weighted modified Young scale scores demonstrated no statistical significance (after adjustment, OR=0.294; 95% CI, 0.074-1.001; P>0.05). Survival data showed a mean survival time of 11.2±3.15 years with a 10-year survival rate of 64.97% for patients with non-splenectomy and 12.9±2.62 years with a 10-year survival rate of 92.11% for patients with splenectomy, which was statistically significant (P<0.05). Due to crossover of survival curves at a later stage, the data were analysed using landmark analysis. The results suggested that splenectomy decreased death rate within 10 years by 84% compared with the non-splenectomy group (HR=0.158; 95% Cl, 0.0198-1.2545; P<0.05), but the survival rate of the two groups was not statistically significant after 10 years. (HR=0.445; 95% Cl, 0.2463-0.8022; P>0.05). In conclusion, splenectomy significantly improved levels of PLT and liver function in patients with hypersplenism of WD, neurological function did not deteriorate and survival rate was improved.Copyright: © Chen et al."
"37115432","Screening of marine sediment-derived microorganisms and their bioactive metabolites: a review.","World J Microbiol Biotechnol","Marine sediments are one of the largest habitats on Earth, and their unique ecology, such as high salinity, high pressure, and hypoxia, may activate certain silent genes in marine microbes, resulting in microbes, enzymes, active products, and specific metabolic pathways that can adapt to these specific ecological environments. Marine sediment-derived microorganisms and their bioactive metabolites are of great significance and have potential commercial development prospects for food, pharmaceutical, chemical industries, agriculture, environmental protection and human nutrition and health. In recent years, although there have been numerous scientific reports surrounding marine sediment-derived microorganisms and their bioactive metabolites, a comprehensive review of their research progress is lacking. This paper presents the development and renewal of traditional culture-dependent and omics analysis techniques and their application to the screening of marine sediment-derived microorganisms producing bioactive substances. It also highlights recent research advances in the last five years surrounding the types, functional properties and potential applications of bioactive metabolites produced by marine sediment-derived microorganisms. These bioactive metabolites mainly include antibiotics, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, sugars, proteins, peptides, and some other small molecule metabolites. In addition, the review ends with concluding remarks on the challenges and future directions for marine sediment-derived microorganisms and their bioactive metabolites. The review report not only helps to deepen the understanding of marine sediment-derived microorganisms and their bioactive metabolites, but also provides some useful information for the exploitation and utilization of marine microbial resources and the mining of new compounds with potential functional properties.© 2023.

Using the heart as a model system, we develop a cross-modal autoencoder framework for integrating distinct data modalities and constructing a holistic representation of cardiovascular state. In particular, we use our framework to construct such cross-modal representations from cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRIs), containing structural information, and electrocardiograms (ECGs), containing myoelectric information. We leverage the learned cross-modal representation to (1) improve phenotype prediction from a single, accessible phenotype such as ECGs; (2) enable imputation of hard-to-acquire cardiac MRIs from easy-to-acquire ECGs; and (3) develop a framework for performing genome-wide association studies in an unsupervised manner.

"37130870","Critically short telomeres derepress retrotransposons to promote genome instability in embryonic stem cells.","Cell Discov","Telomeres, at the ends of chromosomes, protect chromosomes from fusion and preserve genomic stability. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying telomere attrition-induced genome instability remain to be understood. We systematically analyzed the expression of retrotransposons and performed genomic sequencing of different cell and tissue types with telomeres of varying lengths due to telomerase deficiency. We found that critically short telomeres altered retrotransposon activity to promote genomic instability in mouse embryonic stem cells, as evidenced by elevated numbers of single nucleotide variants, indels and copy number variations (CNVs). Transpositions of retrotransposons such as LINE1 resulting from the short telomeres can also be found in these genomes with elevated number of mutations and CNVs. Retrotransposon activation is linked to increased chromatin accessibility, and reduced heterochromatin abundance correlates with short telomeres. Re-elongation of telomeres upon recovery of telomerase partly represses retrotransposons and heterochromatin accumulation. Together, our findings suggest a potential mechanism by which telomeres maintain genomic stability by suppressing chromatin accessibility and retrotransposon activity.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) affords tremendous throughput but cannot directly sequence double-stranded DNA molecules ('single duplexes') to discern the true mutations on both strands. Here we present Concatenating Original Duplex for Error Correction (CODEC), which confers single duplex resolution to NGS. CODEC affords 1,000-fold higher accuracy than NGS, using up to 100-fold fewer reads than duplex sequencing. CODEC revealed mutation frequencies of 2.72 × 10-8in sperm of a 39-year-old individual, and somatic mutations acquired with age in blood cells. CODEC detected genome-wide, clonal hematopoiesis mutations from single DNA molecules, single mutated duplexes from tumor genomes and liquid biopsies, microsatellite instability with 10-fold greater sensitivity and mutational signatures, and specific tumor mutations with up to 100-fold fewer reads. CODEC enables more precise genetic testing and reveals biologically significant mutations, which are commonly obscured by NGS errors.© 2023. The Author(s)."

We employed Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing in a paired diagnostic and post-therapy medulloblastoma to unravel the haplotype-resolved somatic genetic and epigenetic landscape. We assembled complex rearrangements, including a 1.55-Mbp chromothripsis event, and we uncover a complex SV pattern termed templated insertion (TI) thread, characterized by short (mostly <1 kb) insertions showing prevalent self-concatenation into highly amplified structures of up to 50 kbp in size. TI threads occur in 3% of cancers, with a prevalence up to 74% in liposarcoma, and frequent colocalization with chromothripsis. We also perform long-read-based methylome profiling and discover allele-specific methylation (ASM) effects, complex rearrangements exhibiting differential methylation, and differential promoter methylation in cancer-driver genes.

"37091543","Cognitive heterogeneity reveals molecular signatures of age-related impairment.","PNAS Nexus","The greatest risk factor for cognitive decline is aging. The biological mechanisms for this decline remain enigmatic due, in part, to the confounding of normal aging mechanisms and those that contribute to cognitive impairment. Importantly, many individuals exhibit impaired cognition in age, while some retain functionality despite their age. Here, we establish a behavioral testing paradigm to characterize age-related cognitive heterogeneity in inbred aged C57BL/6 mice and reliably separate animals into cognitively ""intact"" (resilient) and ""impaired"" subgroups using a high-resolution home-cage testing paradigm for spatial discrimination. RNA sequencing and subsequent pathway analyses of cognitively stratified mice revealed molecular signatures unique to cognitively impaired animals, including transcriptional down-regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and sirtuin (Sirt1andSirt3) expression in the hippocampus. Mitochondrial function assessed using high-resolution respirometry indicated a reduced OXPHOS coupling efficiency in cognitively impaired animals with subsequent hippocampal analyses revealing an increase in the oxidative damage marker (3-nitrotyrosine) and an up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes (Sod2, Sod1, Prdx6, etc.). Aged-impaired animals also showed increased levels ofIL-6andTNF-αgene expression in the hippocampus and increased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. These results provide critical insight into the diversity of brain aging in inbred animals and reveal the unique mechanisms that separate cognitive resilience from cognitive impairment. Our data indicate the importance of cognitive stratification of aging animals to delineate the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment and test the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.© The Author(s) 2023.

"37124606","Genetic predisposition may not improve prediction of cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury.","Front Genet","Background:The recent integration of genomic data with electronic health records has enabled large scale genomic studies on a variety of perioperative complications, yet genome-wide association studies on acute kidney injury have been limited in size or confounded by composite outcomes. Genome-wide association studies can be leveraged to create a polygenic risk score which can then be integrated with traditional clinical risk factors to better predict postoperative complications, like acute kidney injury.Methods:Using integrated genetic data from two academic biorepositories, we conduct a genome-wide association study on cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury. Next, we develop a polygenic risk score and test the predictive utility within regressions controlling for age, gender, principal components, preoperative serum creatinine, and a range of patient, clinical, and procedural risk factors. Finally, we estimate additive variant heritability using genetic mixed models.Results:Among 1,014 qualifying procedures at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and 478 at Michigan Medicine, 348 (34.3%) and 121 (25.3%) developed AKI, respectively. No variants exceeded genome-wide significance (p< 5 × 10-8) threshold, however, six previously unreported variants exceeded the suggestive threshold (p< 1 × 10-6). Notable variants detected include: 1) rs74637005, located in the exonic region ofNFU1and 2) rs17438465, located betweenEVX1andHIBADH. We failed to replicate variants from prior unbiased studies of post-surgical acute kidney injury. Polygenic risk was not significantly associated with post-surgical acute kidney injury in any of the models, however, case duration (aOR = 1.002, 95% CI 1.000-1.003,p= 0.013), diabetes mellitus (aOR = 2.025, 95% CI 1.320-3.103,p= 0.001), and valvular disease (aOR = 0.558, 95% CI 0.372-0.835,p= 0.005) were significant in the full model.Conclusion:Polygenic risk score was not significantly associated with cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury and acute kidney injury may have a low heritability in this population. These results suggest that susceptibility is only minimally influenced by baseline genetic predisposition and that clinical risk factors, some of which are modifiable, may play a more influential role in predicting this complication. The overall impact of genetics in overall risk for cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury may be small compared to clinical risk factors.Copyright © 2023 Douville, Larach, Lewis, Bastarache, Pandit, He, Heung, Mathis, Wanderer, Kheterpal, Surakka and Kertai."

However, the observed associations from epidemiological studies are either inconsistent or inconclusive.The genetic summary data of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and those of the LC and its histological subtypes were retrieved from previous GWASs. We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) and multivariable MR analyses to examine the associations between genetically predicted metabolic biomarkers and LC in East Asians and Europeans.In East Asians, the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method suggests that LDL (odds ratio [OR] = 0.799, 95% CI 0.712-0.897), TC (OR = 0.713, 95% CI 0.638-0.797), and TG (OR = 0.702, 95% CI 0.613-0.804) were significantly associated with LC after correction for multiple testing. For the remaining three biomarkers, we did not detect significant association with LC by any MR method. Multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis yielded an OR of 0.958 (95% CI 0.748-1.172) for HDL, 0.839 (95% CI 0.738-0.931) for LDL, 0.942 (95% CI 0.742-1.133) for TC, 1.161 (95% CI 1.070-1.252) for TG, 1.079 (95% CI 0.851-1.219) for FPG, and 1.101 (95% CI 0.922-1.191) for HbA1c. In Europeans, the univariate MR analyses did not detect significant association between exposures and outcomes. However, in MVMR analysis integrating circulating lipids and lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol drinking, and body mass index), we found that TG was positively associated with LC in Europeans (OR = 1.660, 95% CI 1.060-2.260). Subgroup and sensitivity analysis yielded similar results to the main analyses.Our study provides genetic evidence that circulating levels of LDL was negatively associated with LC in East Asians, whereas TG was positively associated with LC in both populations.© 2023.

However, estimates of the heritability of HbA1c and glucose levels are different. Therefore, we explored HbA1c- and blood glucose-associated loci in a non-diabetic Japanese population.We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) on variants associated with HbA1c and blood glucose levels in a Japanese population. In the initial stage, data of 4911 participants of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) were subjected to discovery analysis. In the second stage, two datasets from the Tohoku Medical Megabank project, with 8175 and 40,519 participants, were used for the replication study. Association of the imputed variants with HbA1c and blood glucose levels was determined via linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and genetic principal components (PC1-PC10). Moreover, we performed a BMI-stratified GWAS on HbA1c levels in the J-MICC. The discovery analysis and BMI-stratified GWAS results were validated with re-analyses of normalized HbA1c levels adjusted for site in addition to the above, and blood glucose adjusted for fasting time as an additional covariate.Genetic variants associated with HbA1c levels were identified inKCNQ1andTMC6. None of the genetic variants associated with blood glucose levels in the discovery analysis were replicated. Association of rs2299620 inKCNQ1with HbA1c levels showed heterogeneity between individuals with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2and BMI < 25 kg/m2.The variant rs2299620 inKCNQ1might affect HbA1c levels differentially based on BMI grouping in the Japanese population.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13340-023-00618-0.© The Japan Diabetes Society 2023, Springer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law."

Genetic variants occurring in the NAT2 coding region have been well-defined and are known to affect the enzyme activity or protein stability. Individuals can be categorized into rapid, intermediate, and slow acetylator phenotypes that significantly alter their ability to metabolize arylamines, including drugs (e.g., isoniazid) and carcinogens (e.g., 4-aminobiphenyl). However, functional studies on non-coding or intergenic variants ofNAT2are lacking. Multiple, independent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have reported that non-coding or intergenic variants ofNAT2are associated with elevated plasma lipid and cholesterol levels, as well as cardiometabolic disorders, suggesting a novel cellular role of NAT2 in lipid and cholesterol homeostasis. The current review highlights and summarizes GWAS reports that are relevant to this association. We also present a new finding that seven, non-coding, intergenicNAT2variants (i.e., rs4921913, rs4921914, rs4921915, rs146812806, rs35246381, rs35570672, and rs1495741), which have been associated with plasma lipid and cholesterol levels, are in linkage disequilibrium with one another, and thus form a novel haplotype. The dyslipidemia risk alleles of non-codingNAT2variants are associated with rapid NAT2 acetylator phenotype, suggesting that differential systemic NAT2 activity might be a risk factor for developing dyslipidemia. The current review also discusses the findings of recent reports that are supportive of the role of NAT2 in lipid or cholesterol synthesis and transport. In summary, we review data suggesting that humanNAT2is a novel genetic factor that influences plasma lipid and cholesterol levels and alters the risk of cardiometabolic disorders. The proposed novel role of NAT2 merits further investigations.Copyright © 2023 Hong, Walls and Hein."
"37067540","Adaptive Regulation of Stopover Refueling during Bird Migration: Insights from Whole Blood Transcriptomics.","Genome Biol Evol","Migration is one of the most energy-demanding tasks in avian life cycle. Many birds might not have sufficient fuel stores to cover long distances, so they must stop to rest and refuel at stopover sites, especially after the crossing of large ecological barriers. There, birds undergo several behavioral, morphological, and physiological trait adjustments to recover from and prepare for their journey; however, regulation of such processes at the molecular level remains largely unknown. In this study, we used transcriptomic information from the whole blood of migrating garden warblers (Sylvia borin) to identify key regulatory pathways related to adaptations for migration. Birds were temporarily caged during spring migration stopover and then sampled twice at different refueling states (lean vs. fat), reflecting different migratory stages (stopover arrival vs. departure) after the crossing of an extended ecological barrier. Our results show that top expressed genes during migration are involved in important pathways regarding adaptations to migration at high altitudes such as increase of aerobic capacity and angiogenesis. Gene expression profiles largely reflected the two experimental conditions with several enzymes involved in different aspects of metabolic activity being differentially expressed between states providing several candidate genes for future functional studies. Additionally, we identified several hub genes, upregulated in lean birds that could be involved in the extraordinary phenotypic flexibility in organ mass displayed by avian migrants. Finally, our approach provides novel evidence that regulation of water homeostasis may represent a significant adaptive mechanism, allowing birds to conserve water during long-distance flight, mainly through protein catabolism.© The Author(s) 2023.

Furthermore, the cholelithiasis was also treated as the exposure to compare its causal effects to those of cholecystectomy, and multivariable MR analysis was carried out to judge whether the effect of cholecystectomy was independent of cholelithiasis. The study was reported based on Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Using Mendelian Randomization guidelines.The selected IVs explained 1.76% variance of cholecystectomy. Our MR analysis suggested that cholecystectomy cannot elevate the risk of CRC (odds ratio [OR] =1.543, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.607-3.924). Also, it was not significant in either colon or rectum cancer. Intriguingly, cholecystectomy might decrease the risk of Crohn's disease (OR = 0.078, 95% CI: 0.016-0.368) and coronary heart disease (OR = 0.352, 95% CI: 0.164-0.756). However, it might increase the risk of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (OR = 7.573, 95% CI: 1.096-52.318). Cholelithiasis could increase the risk of CRC in the largest population (OR = 1.041, 95% CI: 1.010-1.073). The multivariable MR analysis suggested that genetic liability to cholelithiasis could increase the risk of CRC in the largest population (OR = 1.061, 95% CI: 1.002-1.125) after adjustment of cholecystectomy.The study indicated that cholecystectomy might not increase the risk of CRC, but such a conclusion needs further proving by clinical equivalence.

In addition, when only a small proportion of variants are causal variants, PRS methods that employ a Bayesian framework with shrinkage can account for such sparsity. It is possible that the annotation group level effect is also sparse. However, the number of PRS methods that incorporate both annotation information and shrinkage on effect sizes is limited. We propose a PRS method, PRSbils, which utilizes the functional annotation information with a bilevel continuous shrinkage prior to accommodate the varying genetic architectures both on the variant-specific level and on the functional annotation level.We conducted simulation studies and investigated the predictive performance in settings with different genetic architectures. Results indicated that when there was a relatively large variability of group-wise heritability contribution, the gain in prediction performance from the proposed method was on average 8.0% higher AUC compared to the benchmark method PRS-CS. The proposed method also yielded higher predictive performance compared to PRS-CS in settings with different overlapping patterns of annotation groups and obtained on average 6.4% higher AUC. We applied PRSbils to binary and quantitative traits in three real world data sources (the UK Biobank, the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), and the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES)), and two sources of annotations: ANNOVAR, and pathway information from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and demonstrated that the proposed method holds the potential for improving predictive performance by incorporating functional annotations.By utilizing a bilevel shrinkage framework, PRSbils enables the incorporation of both overlapping and non-overlapping annotations into PRS construction to improve the performance of genetic risk prediction.

Here, we characterize field-wide replicability and biological fidelity through a meta-analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data for first and second trimester human primary brain (2.95 million cells, 51 datasets) and neural organoids (1.63 million cells, 130 datasets). We quantify the degree to which primary tissue cell-type marker expression and co-expression are recapitulated in organoids across 12 different protocol types. By quantifying gene-level preservation of primary tissue co-expression, we show neural organoids lie on a spectrum ranging from virtually no signal to co-expression near indistinguishable from primary tissue data, demonstrating high fidelity is within the scope of current methods. Additionally, we show neural organoids preserve the cell-type specific co-expression of developing rather than adult cells, confirming organoids are an appropriate model for primary tissue development. Overall, quantifying the preservation of primary tissue co-expression is a powerful tool for uncovering unifying axes of variation across heterogeneous neural organoid experiments."

Here we present and validate a TF activity estimation method for single cells from the hematopoietic system that is based on TF regulons, and apply it to a mouse single-cell RNA-sequencing atlas, to infer age-associated differentiation activity changes in the immune cells of different organs. This revealed an age-associated signature of macrophage dedifferentiation, which is shared across tissue types, and aggravated in tumor-associated macrophages. By extending the analysis to all major cell types, we reveal cell-type and tissue-type-independent age-associated alterations to regulatory factors controlling antigen processing, inflammation, collagen processing and circadian rhythm, that are implicated in age-related diseases. Finally, our study highlights the limitations of using TF expression to infer age-associated changes, underscoring the need to use regulatory activity inference methods.© 2022.

"37091793","Single-cell transcriptome analysis for cancer and biology of the pancreas: A review on recent progress.","Front Genet","Single-cell sequencing has become one of the most used techniques across the wide field of biology. It has enabled researchers to investigate the whole transcriptome at the cellular level across tissues, which unlocks numerous potentials for basic and applied studies in future diagnosis and therapy. Here, we review the impact of single-cell RNA sequencing, as the prominent single-cell technique, in pancreatic biology and cancer. We discuss the most recent findings about pancreatic physiology and pathophysiology owing to this technological advancement in the past few years. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, researchers have been able to discover cellular heterogeneity across healthy cell types, as well as cancer tissues of the pancreas. We will discuss the new immunological targets and new molecular mechanisms of progression in the microenvironment of pancreatic cancer studied using single-cell RNA sequencing. The scope is not limited to cancer tissues, and we cover novel developmental, evolutionary, physiological, and heterogenic insights that have also been achieved recently for pancreatic tissues. We cover all biological insights derived from the single-cell RNA sequencing data, discuss the corresponding pros and cons, and finally, conclude how future research can move better by utilizing single-cell analysis for pancreatic biology.Copyright © 2023 Tamaddon, Azimzadeh, Gifani and Tavangar."

The obtained compounds were tested against breast cancer cell lines of the NCI subpanel, followed by further analysis using the COMPARE algorithm from the Therapeutics Development Program, NCI. All synthesized derivatives displayed activity against most cell lines in the range of micromolar concentrations in terms of all parameters studied. Oxazolopyrimidine 5 exhibited the highest antitumor activity. A standard COMPARE analysis of the compounds showed that the vectors of the cytotoxic activity of derivatives 10 and 11 displayed a close to very high correlation with tamoxifen, and oxazolopyrimidine 13 displayed a very high correlation with the same drug. Five derivatives (2, 4, 6, 11 and 13) showed a high correlation with aclacinomycin A in the TGI vector. At the same time, compound 1 effectively suppressed ADK in cultured MDA-MB 231 cell lines, indicating that ADK is one of its targets through which it exerts anticancer properties. Based on molecular docking results, the possible binding mode of oxazolopyrimidine 1 to ADK has been suggested.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry."

"37097603","Emphasizing the Crosstalk Between Inflammatory and Neural Signaling in Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).","J Neuroimmune Pharmacol","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic incapacitating condition with recurrent experience of trauma-related memories, negative mood, altered cognition, and hypervigilance. Agglomeration of preclinical and clinical evidence in recent years specified that alterations in neural networks favor certain characteristics of PTSD. Besides the disruption of hypothalamus-pituitary-axis (HPA) axis, intensified immune status with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and arachidonic metabolites of COX-2 such as PGE2 creates a putative scenario in worsening the neurobehavioral facet of PTSD. This review aims to link the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorders (DSM-V) symptomology to major neural mechanisms that are supposed to underpin the transition from acute stress reactions to the development of PTSD. Also, to demonstrate how these intertwined processes can be applied to probable early intervention strategies followed by a description of the evidence supporting the proposed mechanisms. Hence in this review, several neural network mechanisms were postulated concerning the HPA axis, COX-2, PGE2, NLRP3, and sirtuins to unravel possible complex neuroinflammatory mechanisms that are obscured in PTSD condition.© 2023.

Meta-analysis of sc transcriptomes across 17 human arterial specimens was performed and two quantitative measures assessed the similarities ofex vivoversusin vitromolecular profiles. Primary HAEC cultures were reproducibly populated by 4 major clusters, termed EC1 -4: EC1-angiogenic; EC2-proliferative; EC3-activated/mesenchymal-like; and EC4-mesenchymal. Independent exposure to siERG, IL1B and TGFB2 elicited mostly distinct transcriptional and chromatin accessible responses. EC1 and EC2, the most canonically 'healthy' EC populations were affected predominantly by siERG; the activated cluster EC3 was most responsive to IL1B; and the mesenchymal population EC4 was most affected by TGFB2. Quantitative comparisons betweenin vitroandex vivotranscriptomes confirmed EC1 and EC2 as most canonically EC-like, and EC4 as most mesenchymal with minimal effects elicited by siERG, IL1B and TGFB2. Lastly, accessible chromatin regions unique to EC2 and EC4 were most enriched for CAD-associated SNPs from GWAS suggesting these cell phenotypes harbor CAD-modulating mechanisms.Primary EC cultures contain markedly heterogenous cell subtypes defined by their molecular profiles. Surprisingly, pro-EndMT exposures for 7 days were inadequate to shift cells from one subpopulation to another suggesting relatively stable molecular phenotypes in culture. Interpretations could be that EndMT acts on a modest number of transcripts or that thein vitrosystems used herein fail to recapitulate the complex EndMT-promoting microenvironment of human atherosclerotic lesions.

The daily mean concentration of PM1was obtained from ChinaHighAirPollutants (CHAP) and matched with the residential address of each woman. Data on TI was derived from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The independent effects of PM1and TI exposures on SGA in each gestational week were estimated by the distributed lag model (DLM) nested in Cox regression model, and the potential interactive effects of PM1and TI on SGA were investigated by adapting the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) index.Per 10 μg/m3increase in PM1was associated with an increase in the risk of SGA at 1-3 and 17-23 gestational weeks, with the strongest effect at the first gestational week (HR = 1.043, 95%CI: 1.008, 1.078). Significant links between one day increase of TI and SGA were found at the 1-4 and 13-23 gestational weeks and the largest effects were observed at the 17thgestational week (HR = 1.018, 95%CI: 1.009, 1.027). Synergistic effects of PM1and TI on SGA were detected in the 20thgestational week, with RERI of 0.208 (95%CI: 0.033,0.383).Both prebirth PM1and TI exposure were significantly associated with SGA. Simultaneous exposure to PM1and TI might have synergistic effect on SGA. The second trimester seems to be a sensitive window of environmental and air pollution exposure.© 2023.

"37095162","Central role for neurally dysregulated IL-17A in dynamic networks of systemic and local inflammation in combat casualties.","Sci Rep","Dynamic Network Analysis (DyNA) and Dynamic Hypergraphs (DyHyp) were used to define protein-level inflammatory networks at the local (wound effluent) and systemic circulation (serum) levels from 140 active-duty, injured service members (59 with TBI and 81 non-TBI). Interleukin (IL)-17A was the only biomarker elevated significantly in both serum and effluent in TBI vs. non-TBI casualties, and the mediator with the most DyNA connections in TBI wounds. DyNA combining serum and effluent data to define cross-compartment correlations suggested that IL-17A bridges local and systemic circulation at late time points. DyHyp suggested that systemic IL-17A upregulation in TBI patients was associated with tumor necrosis factor-α, while IL-17A downregulation in non-TBI patients was associated with interferon-γ. Correlation analysis suggested differential upregulation of pathogenic Th17 cells, non-pathogenic Th17 cells, and memory/effector T cells. This was associated with reduced procalcitonin in both effluent and serum of TBI patients, in support of an antibacterial effect of Th17 cells in TBI patients. Dysregulation of Th17 responses following TBI may drive cross-compartment inflammation following combat injury, counteracting wound infection at the cost of elevated systemic inflammation.© 2023.

However, the cell-specific effect of variants in these genes is not fully understood. Here, we perform single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on nearly 300,000 nuclei from the parietal cortex of AD autosomal dominant (APP and PSEN1) and risk-modifying variant (APOE, TREM2 and MS4A) carriers. Within individual cell types, we capture genes commonly dysregulated across variant groups. However, specific transcriptional states are more prevalent within variant carriers. TREM2 oligodendrocytes show a dysregulated autophagy-lysosomal pathway, MS4A microglia have dysregulated complement cascade genes, and APOEε4 inhibitory neurons display signs of ferroptosis. All cell types have enriched states in autosomal dominant carriers. We leverage differential expression and single-nucleus ATAC-seq to map GWAS signals to effector cell types including the NCK2 signal to neurons in addition to the initially proposed microglia.

"36993752","Integrative Blood-Based Characterization of Oxidative Mitochondrial DNA Damage Variants Implicates Mexican Americans' Metabolic Risk for Developing Alzheimer's Disease.","Res Sq","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) continues to be a leading cause of death in the US. As the US aging population (ages 65+) expands, the impact will disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, e.g., Hispanic/Latinx population, due to their AD-related health disparities. Age-related regression in mitochondrial activity and ethnic-specific differences in metabolic burden could potentially explain in part the racial/ethnic distinctions in etiology that exist for AD. Oxidation of guanine (G) to 8-oxo-guanine (8oxoG) is a prevalent lesion and an indicator of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Damaged mtDNA (8oxoG) can serve as an important marker of age-related systemic metabolic dysfunction and upon release into peripheral circulation may exacerbate pathophysiology contributing to AD development and/or progression. Analyzing blood samples from Mexican American (MA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) participants enrolled in the Texas Alzheimer's Research & Care Consortium, we used blood-based measurements of 8oxoG from both buffy coat PBMCs and plasma to determine associations with population, sex, type-2 diabetes, and AD risk. Our results show that 8oxoG levels in both buffy coat and plasma were significantly associated with population, sex, years of education, and reveal a potential association with AD. Furthermore, MAs are significantly burdened by mtDNA oxidative damage in both blood fractions, which may contribute to their metabolic vulnerability to developing AD."
"36977417","Molecular encoding of stimulus features in a single sensory neuron type enables neuronal and behavioral plasticity.","Curr Biol","Neurons modify their transcriptomes in response to an animal's experience. How specific experiences are transduced to modulate gene expression and precisely tune neuronal functions are not fully defined. Here, we describe the molecular profile of a thermosensory neuron pair in C. elegans experiencing different temperature stimuli. We find that distinct salient features of the temperature stimulus, including its duration, magnitude of change, and absolute value, are encoded in the gene expression program in this single neuron type, and we identify a novel transmembrane protein and a transcription factor whose specific transcriptional dynamics are essential to drive neuronal, behavioral, and developmental plasticity. Expression changes are driven by broadly expressed activity-dependent transcription factors and corresponding cis-regulatory elements that nevertheless direct neuron- and stimulus-specific gene expression programs. Our results indicate that coupling of defined stimulus characteristics to the gene regulatory logic in individual specialized neuron types can customize neuronal properties to drive precise behavioral adaptation.Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we used single-nucleus sequencing, anatomical reconstructions, and electrophysiology to characterize murine OCNs during postnatal development, in mature animals, and after sound exposure. We identified markers for known medial (MOC) and lateral (LOC) OCN subtypes, and show that they express distinct cohorts of physiologically relevant genes that change over development. In addition, we discovered a neuropeptide-enriched LOC subtype that produces Neuropeptide Y along with other neurotransmitters. Throughout the cochlea, both LOC subtypes extend arborizations over wide frequency domains. Moreover, LOC neuropeptide expression is strongly upregulated days after acoustic trauma, potentially providing a sustained protective signal to the cochlea. OCNs are therefore poised to have diffuse, dynamic effects on early auditory processing over timescales ranging from milliseconds to days."

Previous research has highlighted consequences for infants' socio-emotional and cognitive outcomes, but less is known for what regards socio-cognitive development. In this study, we report on the effects of maternal prenatal stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic on 12-month-old infants' behavioral markers of socio-cognitive development.Ninety infants and their mothers provided complete longitudinal data from birth to 12 months. At birth, mothers reported on pandemic-related stress during pregnancy. At infants' 12-month-age, a remote mother-infant interaction was videotaped: after an initial 2-min face-to-face episode, the experimenter remotely played a series of four auditory stimuli (2 human and 2 non-human sounds). The auditory stimuli sequence was counterbalanced among participants and each sound was repeated three times every 10 seconds (Exposure, 30 seconds) while mothers were instructed not to interact with their infants and to display a neutral still-face expression. Infants' orienting, communication, and pointing toward the auditory source was coded micro-analytically and a socio-cognitive score (SCS) was obtained by means of a principal component analysis.Infants equally oriented to human and non-human auditory stimuli. All infants oriented toward the sound during the Exposure episode, 80% exhibited any communication directed to the auditory source, and 48% showed at least one pointing toward the sound. Mothers who reported greater prenatal pandemic-related stress had infants with higher probability of showing no communication, t = 2.14 (p = .035), or pointing, t = 1.93 (p = .057). A significant and negative linear association was found between maternal prenatal pandemic-related stress and infants' SCS at 12 months, R2 = .07 (p = .010), while adjusting for potential confounders.This study suggests that prenatal maternal stress during the COVID-19 pandemic might have increased the risk of an altered socio-cognitive development in infants as assessed through an observational paradigm at 12 months. Special preventive attention should be devoted to infants born during the pandemic.Copyright: © 2023 Nazzari et al.

Involvement of A-to-I RNA editing has been reported during viral infection but remains to be elucidated during intracellular bacterial infections.Herein we analyzed A-to-I RNA editing during intracellular bacterial infections based on 18 RNA-Seq datasets of 210 mouse samples involving 7 tissue types and 8 intracellular bacterial pathogens (IBPs), and identified a consensus signature of RNA editing for IBP infections, mainly involving neutrophil-mediated innate immunity and lipid metabolism. Further comparison of host RNA editing patterns revealed remarkable similarities between pneumonia caused by IBPs and single-strand RNA (ssRNA) viruses, such as altered editing enzyme expression, editing site numbers, and levels. In addition, functional enrichment analysis of genes with RNA editing highlighted that the Rab GTPase family played a common and vital role in the host immune response to IBP and ssRNA viral infections, which was indicated by the consistent up-regulated RNA editing of Ras-related protein Rab27a. Nevertheless, dramatic differences between IBP and viral infections were also observed, and clearly distinguished the two types of intracellular infections.Our study showed transcriptome-wide host A-to-I RNA editing alteration during IBP and ssRNA viral infections. By identifying and comparing consensus signatures of host A-to-I RNA editing, our analysis implicates the importance of host A-to-I RNA editing during these infections and provides new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases.Copyright © 2023 Wei, Wang, Li, Wen, Gao, Xia, Li, Pan, Liu, Jin and Chen."

Comprehensive molecular phenotyping and cardiac imaging during the post-discharge time window may provide cues for risk stratification for the outcomes.In a prospective AMI cohort in New Zealand (N = 464), we measured plasma proteins and lipids 30 days after hospital discharge and inferred a unified partial correlation network with echocardiographic variables and established clinical biomarkers (creatinine, c-reactive protein, cardiac troponin I and natriuretic peptides). Using a network-based data integration approach (iOmicsPASS+), we identified predictive signatures of long-term secondary outcomes based on plasma protein, lipid, imaging markers and clinical biomarkers and assessed the prognostic potential in an independent cohort from Singapore (N = 190).The post-discharge levels of plasma proteins and lipids showed strong correlations within each molecular type, reflecting concerted homeostatic regulation after primary MI events. However, the two molecular types were largely independent with distinct correlation structures with established prognostic imaging parameters and clinical biomarkers. To deal with massively correlated predictive features, we used iOmicsPASS + to identify subnetwork signatures of 211 and 189 data features (nodes) predictive of MACE and HF events, respectively (160 overlapping). The predictive features were primarily imaging parameters, including left ventricular and atrial parameters, tissue Doppler parameters, and proteins involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, cell differentiation, chemotaxis, and inflammation. The network signatures contained plasma protein pairs with area-under-the-curve (AUC) values up to 0.74 for HF prediction in the validation cohort, but the pair of NT-proBNP and fibulin-3 (EFEMP1) was the best predictor (AUC = 0.80). This suggests that there were a handful of plasma proteins with mechanistic and functional roles in predisposing patients to the secondary outcomes, although they may be weaker prognostic markers than natriuretic peptides individually. Among those, the diastolic function parameter (E/e' - an indicator of left ventricular filling pressure) and two ECM proteins,EFEMP1and follistatin-like 3 (FSTL3) showed comparable performance to NT-proBNP and outperformed left ventricular measures as benchmark prognostic factors for post-MI HF.Post-discharge levels of E/e',EFEMP1andFSTL3are promising complementary markers of secondary adverse outcomes in AMI patients.© 2023 Koh, Pilbrow, Tan, Zhao, Benke, Burla, Torta, Pickering, Troughton, Pemberton, Soo, Ling, Doughty, Choi, Wenk, Richards and Chan."
"37073276","Cadmium nitrate and DNA methylation in gastropods: comparison between ovotestis and hepatopancreas.","PeerJ","Dietary ingestion is the main route of exposure to hazardous contaminants in land animals. Cadmium, a high-profile toxic metal, affects living systems at different organismal levels, including major storage organs (liver, kidneys), key organs for species survival (gonads), and epigenetic networks regulating gene expression. 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is the most common and best-characterized epigenetic mark among different modified nucleosides in DNA. This important player in methylation-driven gene expression is impacted by cadmium in sentinel terrestrial vertebrates. However, limited information exists regarding its impact on macroinvertebrates, especially land snails commonly used as (eco)toxicological models. We first investigate the methylomic effects of dietary cadmium given as cadmium nitrate on terrestrial mollusks. Mature specimens of the common brown garden snail,Cornu aspersum, were continuously exposed for four weeks to environmentally-relevant cadmium levels. We determined global genomic DNA methylation in hepatopancreas and ovotestis, as well as changes in the methylation status of CG pairs at the 5' region close to the transcription site of gene encoding the Cd-selective metallothionein (Cd-MT). Weight gain/loss, hypometabolism tendency, and survival rates were also assessed. Although this exposure event did not adversely affect survival, gastropods exposed to the highest Cd dose revealed a significant reduction in body weight and a significant increase in hypometabolic behavior. The hepatopancreas, but not the ovotestis, displayed significant hypermethylation, but only for the aforementioned specimens. We also found that the 5' end of theCd-MTgene was unmethylated in both organs and its methylation status was insensitive to cadmium exposure. Our results are important since they provide scientists, for the first time, with quantitative data on DNA methylation in gastropod ovotestis and refine our understanding of Cd epigenetic effects on terrestrial mollusks.©2023 Draghici et al."

Here we present photoselective sequencing, a new method for genomic and epigenomic profiling within morphologically distinct regions. Starting with an intact biological specimen, photoselective sequencing uses targeted illumination to selectively unblock a photocaged fragment library, restricting the sequencing-based readout to microscopically identified spatial regions. We validate photoselective sequencing by measuring the chromatin accessibility profiles of fluorescently labeled cell types within the mouse brain and comparing with published data. Furthermore, by combining photoselective sequencing with a computational strategy for decomposing bulk accessibility profiles, we find that the oligodendrocyte-lineage-cell population is relatively enriched for oligodendrocyte-progenitor cells in the cortex versus the corpus callosum. Finally, we leverage photoselective sequencing at the subcellular scale to identify features of chromatin that are correlated with positioning at the nuclear periphery. These results collectively demonstrate that photoselective sequencing is a flexible and generalizable platform for exploring the interplay of spatial structures with genomic and epigenomic properties.© 2023.

This review synthesizes evidence from human studies and model systems to discuss the impact of different nutritional sources on co-development of the gut microbiome, antigen tolerance, and immunity. We highlight two key mechanisms: epigenetics and the so-called ""weaning reaction"". Collectively, this evidence highlights i) the fundamental role of parents' own milk, fed directly at the breast, as a dynamic and personalized nutrition source that drives developmental programming, and ii) the deficiencies of alternative nutritional sources and priority research areas for improving these alternatives when direct breastfeeding is not possible."

Newly formed cells end up accessing numerous multicellular and unicellular programs that enable metastasis, drug resistance, tumor recurrence, and self-renewal or diverse clone formation. An integrative literature review was carried out, searching articles in several sites, including: PUBMED, NCBI-PMC, and Google Academic, published in English, indexed in referenced databases and without a publication time filter, but prioritizing articles from the last 3 years, to answer the following questions: (i) ""What is the current knowledge about polyploidy in tumors?""; (ii) ""What are the applications of computational studies for the understanding of cancer polyploidy?""; and (iii) ""How do PGCCs contribute to tumorigenesis?"""
"37095364","Single-cell analyses and host genetics highlight the role of innate immune cells in COVID-19 severity.","Nat Genet","Mechanisms underpinning the dysfunctional immune response in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection are elusive. We analyzed single-cell transcriptomes and T and B cell receptors (BCR) of >895,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 73 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and 75 healthy controls of Japanese ancestry with host genetic data. COVID-19 patients showed a low fraction of nonclassical monocytes (ncMono). We report downregulated cell transitions from classical monocytes to ncMono in COVID-19 with reduced CXCL10 expression in ncMono in severe disease. Cell-cell communication analysis inferred decreased cellular interactions involving ncMono in severe COVID-19. Clonal expansions of BCR were evident in the plasmablasts of patients. Putative disease genes identified by COVID-19 genome-wide association study showed cell type-specific expressions in monocytes and dendritic cells. A COVID-19-associated risk variant at the IFNAR2 locus (rs13050728) had context-specific and monocyte-specific expression quantitative trait loci effects. Our study highlights biological and host genetic involvement of innate immune cells in COVID-19 severity.© 2023. The Author(s)."
"37123247","A five-safes approach to a secure and scalable genomics data repository.","iScience","Genomic researchers increasingly utilize commercial cloud service providers (CSPs) to manage data and analytics needs. CSPs allow researchers to grow Information Technology (IT) infrastructure on demand to overcome bottlenecks when combining large datasets. However, without adequate security controls, the risk of unauthorized access may be higher for data stored on the cloud. Additionally, regulators are mandating data access patterns and specific security protocols for the storage and use of genomic data. While CSP provides tools for security and regulatory compliance, building the necessary controls required for cloud solutions is not trivial. Research Assets Provisioning and Tracking Online Repository (RAPTOR) by the Genome Institute of Singapore is a cloud-native genomics data repository and analytics platform that implements a ""five-safes"" framework to provide security and governance controls to data contributors and users, leveraging CSP for sharing and analysis of genomic datasets without the risk of security breaches or running afoul of regulations.© 2023 The Author(s)."
