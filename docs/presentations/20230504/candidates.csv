Matt,No,20230504,methods,37072822,The ENCODE Imputation Challenge: a critical assessment of methods for cross-cell type imputation of epigenomic profiles,Genome Biol,"A promising alternative to comprehensively performing genomics experiments is to, instead, perform a subset of experiments and use computational methods to impute the remainder. However, identifying the best imputation methods and what measures meaningfully evaluate performance are open questions. We address these questions by comprehensively analyzing 23 methods from the ENCODE Imputation Challenge. We find that imputation evaluations are challenging and confounded by distributional shifts from differences in data collection and processing over time, the amount of available data, and redundancy among performance measures. Our analyses suggest simple steps for overcoming these issues and promising directions for more robust research."
Matt,No,20230504,single-cell,37131654,Single-cell DNA Methylome and 3D Multi-omic Atlas of the Adult Mouse Brain.,bioRxiv,"Cytosine DNA methylation is essential in brain development and has been implicated in various neurological disorders. A comprehensive understanding of DNA methylation diversity across the entire brain in the context of the brain's 3D spatial organization is essential for building a complete molecular atlas of brain cell types and understanding their gene regulatory landscapes. To this end, we employed optimized single-nucleus methylome (snmC-seq3) and multi-omic (snm3C-seq1) sequencing technologies to generate 301,626 methylomes and 176,003 chromatin conformation/methylome joint profiles from 117 dissected regions throughout the adult mouse brain. Using iterative clustering and integrating with companion whole-brain transcriptome and chromatin accessibility datasets, we constructed a methylation-based cell type taxonomy that contains 4,673 cell groups and 261 cross-modality-annotated subclasses. We identified millions of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across the genome, representing potential gene regulation elements. Notably, we observed spatial cytosine methylation patterns on both genes and regulatory elements in cell types within and across brain regions. Brain-wide multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH2) data validated the association of this spatial epigenetic diversity with transcription and allowed the mapping of the DNA methylation and topology information into anatomical structures more precisely than our dissections. Furthermore, multi-scale chromatin conformation diversities occur in important neuronal genes, highly associated with DNA methylation and transcription changes. Brain-wide cell type comparison allowed us to build a regulatory model for each gene, linking transcription factors, DMRs, chromatin contacts, and downstream genes to establish regulatory networks. Finally, intragenic DNA methylation and chromatin conformation patterns predicted alternative gene isoform expression observed in a companion whole-brain SMART-seq3dataset. Our study establishes the first brain-wide, single-cell resolution DNA methylome and 3D multi-omic atlas, providing an unparalleled resource for comprehending the mouse brain's cellular-spatial and regulatory genome diversity."
Matt,No,20230504,dnamage,37118425,Effect of long-term caloric restriction on DNA methylation measures of biological aging in healthy adults from the CALERIE trial.,Nat Aging,"The geroscience hypothesis proposes that therapy to slow or reverse molecular changes that occur with aging can delay or prevent multiple chronic diseases and extend healthy lifespan1-3. Caloric restriction (CR), defined as lessening caloric intake without depriving essential nutrients4, results in changes in molecular processes that have been associated with aging, including DNA methylation (DNAm)5-7, and is established to increase healthy lifespan in multiple species8,9. Here we report the results of a post hoc analysis of the influence of CR on DNAm measures of aging in blood samples from the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE) trial, a randomized controlled trial in which n = 220 adults without obesity were randomized to 25% CR or ad libitum control diet for 2 yr (ref.10). We found that CALERIE intervention slowed the pace of aging, as measured by the DunedinPACE DNAm algorithm, but did not lead to significant changes in biological age estimates measured by various DNAm clocks including PhenoAge and GrimAge. Treatment effect sizes were small. Nevertheless, modest slowing of the pace of aging can have profound effects on population health11-13. The finding that CR modified DunedinPACE in a randomized controlled trial supports the geroscience hypothesis, building on evidence from small and uncontrolled studies14-16and contrasting with reports that biological aging may not be modifiable17. Ultimately, a conclusive test of the geroscience hypothesis will require trials with long-term follow-up to establish effects of intervention on primary healthy-aging endpoints, including incidence of chronic disease and mortality18-20.© 2023.

They have now scaled to the point that it is possible to query samples at the population level, across thousands of individuals. Combining single-cell information with genotype data at this scale provides opportunities to link genetic variation to the cellular processes underpinning key aspects of human biology and disease. This strategy has potential implications for disease diagnosis, risk prediction and development of therapeutic solutions. But, effectively integrating large-scale single-cell genomic data, genetic variation and additional phenotypic data will require advances in data generation and analysis methods.

Here we conduct a Mendelian randomization study by integrating plasma proteome and GWASs of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. The primate-specific immune-related protein BTN3A3 showed the most significant associations with all three psychiatric disorders. In addition, other immune-related proteins, including AIF1, FOXO3, IRF3, CFHR4, IGLON5, FKBP2, and PI3, also showed significant associations with psychiatric disorders. Our study showed that a proportion of psychiatric risk variants may contribute to disease risk by regulating immune-related plasma proteins, providing direct evidence that connect the genetic risk of psychiatric disorders to immune system.© 2023.

Paul,No,20230504,prediction,37117793,Development and validation of DNA methylation scores in two European cohorts augment 10-year risk prediction of type 2 diabetes.,Nat Aging,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) presents a major health and economic burden that could be alleviated with improved early prediction and intervention. While standard risk factors have shown good predictive performance, we show that the use of blood-based DNA methylation information leads to a significant improvement in the prediction of 10-year T2D incidence risk. Previous studies have been largely constrained by linear assumptions, the use of cytosine-guanine pairs one-at-a-time and binary outcomes. We present a flexible approach (via an R package, MethylPipeR) based on a range of linear and tree-ensemble models that incorporate time-to-event data for prediction. Using the Generation Scotland cohort (training set ncases = 374, ncontrols = 9,461; test set ncases = 252, ncontrols = 4,526) our best-performing model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.872, area under the precision-recall curve (PRAUC) = 0.302) showed notable improvement in 10-year onset prediction beyond standard risk factors (AUC = 0.839, precision-recall AUC = 0.227).

Sam,No,20230504,eqtl,37076491,Mapping genomic regulation of kidney disease and traits through high-resolution and interpretable eQTLs.,Nat Commun,"Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies illuminate genomic variants that regulate specific genes and contribute to fine-mapped loci discovered via genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Efforts to maximize their accuracy are ongoing. Using 240 glomerular (GLOM) and 311 tubulointerstitial (TUBE) micro-dissected samples from human kidney biopsies, we discovered 5371 GLOM and 9787 TUBE genes with at least one variant significantly associated with expression (eGene) by incorporating kidney single-nucleus open chromatin data and transcription start site distance as an ""integrative prior"" for Bayesian statistical fine-mapping. The use of an integrative prior resulted in higher resolution eQTLs illustrated by (1) smaller numbers of variants in credible sets with greater confidence, (2) increased enrichment of partitioned heritability for GWAS of two kidney traits, (3) an increased number of variants colocalized with the GWAS loci, and (4) enrichment of computationally predicted functional regulatory variants. A subset of variants and genes were validated experimentally in vitro and using a Drosophila nephrocyte model. More broadly, this study demonstrates that tissue-specific eQTL maps informed by single-nucleus open chromatin data have enhanced utility for diverse downstream analyses.© 2023. The Author(s)."
Sam,No,20230504,gwas,37120605,Multi-population genome-wide association study implicates immune and non-immune factors in pediatric steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome.,Nat Commun,"Pediatric steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (pSSNS) is the most common childhood glomerular disease. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a risk locus in the HLA Class II region and three additional independent risk loci. But the genetic architecture of pSSNS, and its genetically driven pathobiology, is largely unknown. Here, we conduct a multi-population GWAS meta-analysis in 38,463 participants (2440 cases). We then conduct conditional analyses and population specific GWAS. We discover twelve significant associations-eight from the multi-population meta-analysis (four novel), two from the multi-population conditional analysis (one novel), and two additional novel loci from the European meta-analysis. Fine-mapping implicates specific amino acid haplotypes in HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 driving the HLA Class II risk locus. Non-HLA loci colocalize with eQTLs of monocytes and numerous T-cell subsets in independent datasets. Colocalization with kidney eQTLs is lacking but overlap with kidney cell open chromatin suggests an uncharacterized disease mechanism in kidney cells. A polygenic risk score (PRS) associates with earlier disease onset. Altogether, these discoveries expand our knowledge of pSSNS genetic architecture across populations and provide cell-specific insights into its molecular drivers. Evaluating these associations in additional cohorts will refine our understanding of population specificity, heterogeneity, and clinical and molecular associations.© 2023. The Author(s)."
Sarah,No,20230504,dnamage,37118759,Associations of socioeconomic disparities with buccal DNA-methylation measures of biological aging.,Clin Epigenetics,"Individuals who are socioeconomically disadvantaged are at increased risk for aging-related diseases and perform less well on tests of cognitive function. The weathering hypothesis proposes that these disparities in physical and cognitive health arise from an acceleration of biological processes of aging. Theories of how life adversity is biologically embedded identify epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation (DNAm), as a mechanistic interface between the environment and health. Consistent with the weathering hypothesis and theories of biological embedding, recently developed DNAm algorithms have revealed profiles reflective of more advanced aging and lower cognitive function among socioeconomically-at-risk groups. These DNAm algorithms were developed using blood-DNA, but social and behavioral science research commonly collect saliva or cheek-swab DNA. This discrepancy is a potential barrier to research to elucidate mechanisms through which socioeconomic disadvantage affects aging and cognition. We therefore tested if social gradients observed in blood DNAm measures could be reproduced using buccal-cell DNA obtained from cheek swabs.We analyzed three DNAm measures of biological aging and one DNAm measure of cognitive performance, all of which showed socioeconomic gradients in previous studies: the PhenoAge and GrimAge DNAm clocks, DunedinPACE, and Epigenetic-g. We first computed blood-buccal cross-tissue correlations in n = 21 adults (GEO111165). Cross-tissue correlations were low-to-moderate (r = .25 to r = .48). We next conducted analyses of socioeconomic gradients using buccal DNAm data from SOEP-G (n = 1128, 57% female; age mean = 42 yrs, SD = 21.56, range 0-72). Associations of socioeconomic status with DNAm measures of aging were in the expected direction, but were smaller as compared to reports from blood DNAm datasets (r = - .08 to r = - .13).Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with DNAm indicators of worse physical health. However, relatively low cross-tissue correlations and attenuated effect sizes for socioeconomic gradients in buccal DNAm compared with reports from analysis of blood DNAm suggest that in order to take full advantage of buccal DNA samples, DNAm algorithms customized to buccal DNAm are needed.© 2023.

Scott,No,20230504,prediction,37127563,A comparison of feature selection methodologies and learning algorithms in the development of a DNA methylation-based telomere length estimator.,BMC Bioinformatics,"The field of epigenomics holds great promise in understanding and treating disease with advances in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence being vitally important in this pursuit. Increasingly, research now utilises DNA methylation measures at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) to detect disease and estimate biological traits such as aging. Given the challenge of high dimensionality of DNA methylation data, feature-selection techniques are commonly employed to reduce dimensionality and identify the most important subset of features. In this study, our aim was to test and compare a range of feature-selection methods and ML algorithms in the development of a novel DNA methylation-based telomere length (TL) estimator. We utilised both nested cross-validation and two independent test sets for the comparisons.We found that principal component analysis in advance of elastic net regression led to the overall best performing estimator when evaluated using a nested cross-validation analysis and two independent test cohorts. This approach achieved a correlation between estimated and actual TL of 0.295 (83.4% CI [0.201, 0.384]) on the EXTEND test data set. Contrastingly, the baseline model of elastic net regression with no prior feature reduction stage performed less well in general-suggesting a prior feature-selection stage may have important utility. A previously developed TL estimator, DNAmTL, achieved a correlation of 0.216 (83.4% CI [0.118, 0.310]) on the EXTEND data. Additionally, we observed that different DNA methylation-based TL estimators, which have few common CpGs, are associated with many of the same biological entities.The variance in performance across tested approaches shows that estimators are sensitive to data set heterogeneity and the development of an optimal DNA methylation-based estimator should benefit from the robust methodological approach used in this study. Moreover, our methodology which utilises a range of feature-selection approaches and ML algorithms could be applied to other biological markers and disease phenotypes, to examine their relationship with DNA methylation and predictive value.© 2023.

,Yes,20230504,ewas,37106120,Genes implicated by a methylome-wide schizophrenia study in neonatal blood show differential expression in adult brain samples.,Mol Psychiatry,"Schizophrenia is a disabling disorder involving genetic predisposition in combination with environmental influences that likely act via dynamic alterations of the epigenome and the transcriptome but its detailed pathophysiology is largely unknown. We performed cell-type specific methylome-wide association study of neonatal blood (N = 333) from individuals who later in life developed schizophrenia and controls. Suggestively significant associations (P < 1.0 × 10-6) were detected in all cell-types and in whole blood with methylome-wide significant associations in monocytes (P = 2.85 × 10-9-4.87 × 10-9), natural killer cells (P = 1.72 × 10-9-7.82 × 10-9) and B cells (P = 3.8 × 10-9). Validation of methylation findings in post-mortem brains (N = 596) from independent schizophrenia cases and controls showed significant enrichment of transcriptional differences (enrichment ratio = 1.98-3.23, P = 2.3 × 10-3-1.0 × 10-5), with specific highly significant differential expression for, for example, BDNF (t = -6.11, P = 1.90 × 10-9). In addition, expression difference in brain significantly predicted schizophrenia (multiple correlation = 0.15-0.22, P = 3.6 × 10-4-4.5 × 10-8). In summary, using a unique design combining pre-disease onset (neonatal) blood methylomic data and post-disease onset (post-mortem) brain transcriptional data, we have identified genes of likely functional relevance that are associated with schizophrenia susceptibility, rather than confounding disease associated artifacts. The identified loci may be of clinical value as a methylation-based biomarker for early detection of increased schizophrenia susceptibility.© 2023.

We hypothesized that DNA methylation could function as an intermediary epigenetic mechanism that internalizes and reflects the biological impact of SEP.Based on tumor DNA methylation data from the Illumina 450 K array from 694 breast cancer patients in the Women's Circle of Health Study, we conducted an epigenome-wide analysis in relation to educational attainment and household income. Functional impact of the identified CpG sites was explored in silico using data from publicly available databases.We identified 25 CpG sites associated with household income at an array-wide significance level, but none with educational attainment. Two of the top CpG sites, cg00452016 and cg01667837, were in promoter regions of NNT and GPR37, respectively, with multiple epigenetic regulatory features identified in each region. NNT is involved in β-adrenergic stress signaling and inflammatory responses, whereas GPR37 is involved in neurological and immune responses. For both loci, gene expression was inversely correlated to the levels of DNA methylation. The associations were consistent between Black and White women and did not differ by tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status.In a large breast cancer patient population, we discovered evidence of the significant biological impact of household income on the tumor DNA methylome, including genes in the β-adrenergic stress and immune response pathways. Our findings support biological effects of socioeconomic status on tumor tissues, which might be relevant to cancer development and progression.© 2023. The Author(s)."

Foetal DNA methylation changes could underlie these associations. Within the Pregnancy And Childhood Epigenetics Consortium, we meta-analysed epigenome-wide associations of circulating vitamin B12 concentrations in mothers during pregnancy (n = 2,420) or cord blood (n = 1,029), with cord blood DNA methylation. Maternal and newborn vitamin B12 concentrations were associated with DNA methylation at 109 and 7 CpGs, respectively (False Discovery RateP-value <0.05). Persistent associations with DNA methylation in the peripheral blood of up to 482 children aged 4-10 y were observed for 40.7% of CpGs associated with maternal vitamin B12 and 57.1% of CpGs associated with newborn vitamin B12. Of the CpGs identified in the maternal meta-analyses, 4.6% were associated with either birth weight or gestational age in a previous work. For the newborn meta-analysis, this was the case for 14.3% of the identified CpGs. Also, of the CpGs identified in the newborn meta-analysis, 14.3% and 28.6%, respectively, were associated with childhood cognitive skills and nonverbal IQ. Of the 109 CpGs associated with maternal vitamin B12, 18.3% were associated with nearby gene expression. In this study, we showed that maternal and newborn vitamin B12 concentrations are associated with DNA methylation at multiple CpGs in offspring blood (PFDR<0.05). Whether this differential DNA methylation underlies associations of vitamin B12 concentrations with child health outcomes, such as birth weight, gestational age, and childhood cognition, should be further examined in future studies."
,Yes,20230504,ewas,37088033,Umbilical cord DNA methylation is associated with body mass index trajectories from birth to adolescence.,EBioMedicine,"DNA methylation (DNAm) in cord blood has been associated with various prenatal factors and birth outcomes. This study sought to fill an important knowledge gap: the link of cord DNAm with child postnatal growth trajectories from birth to age 18 years (y).Using data from a US predominantly urban, low-income, multi-ethnic birth cohort (N = 831), we first applied non-parametric methods to identify body-mass-index percentile (BMIPCT) trajectories from birth to age 18 y (the outcome); then, conducted epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of the outcome, interrogating over 700,000 CpG sites profiled by the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Multivariate linear regression models and likelihood ratio tests (LRT) were applied to examine the DNAm-outcome association in the overall sample and sex strata.We identified four distinct patterns of BMIPCT trajectories: normal weight (NW), Early overweight or obesity (OWO), Late OWO, and normal to very late OWO. DNAm at CpG18582997 annotated to TPGS1, CpG15241084 of TLR7, and cg24350936 of RAB31 were associated with BMIPCT at birth-to-3 y, 10 y, and 14 y, respectively (LRT FDR < 0.05 for all).In this prospective birth cohort study, we identified 4 distinct and robust patterns of growth trajectories from birth to 18 y, which were associated with variations in cord blood DNAm at genes implicated in inflammation induction pathways. These findings, if further replicated, raise the possibility that these DNAm markers along with early assessment of BMIPCT trajectories may help identify young children at high-risk for obesity later in life.Detailed in the Acknowledgements section.Copyright © 2023.

,No,20230504,ewas,37085889,The X-factor in ART: does the use of assisted reproductive technologies influence DNA methylation on the X chromosome?,Hum Genomics,"Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) may perturb DNA methylation (DNAm) in early embryonic development. Although a handful of epigenome-wide association studies of ART have been published, none have investigated CpGs on the X chromosome. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged one of the largest collections of mother-father-newborn trios of ART and non-ART (natural) conceptions to date to investigate sex-specific DNAm differences on the X chromosome. The discovery cohort consisted of 982 ART and 963 non-ART trios from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). To verify our results from the MoBa cohort, we used an external cohort of 149 ART and 58 non-ART neonates from the Australian 'Clinical review of the Health of adults conceived following Assisted Reproductive Technologies' (CHART) study. The Illumina EPIC array was used to measure DNAm in both datasets. In the MoBa cohort, we performed a set of X-chromosome-wide association studies ('XWASs' hereafter) to search for sex-specific DNAm differences between ART and non-ART newborns. We tested several models to investigate the influence of various confounders, including parental DNAm. We also searched for differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and regions of co-methylation flanking the most significant CpGs. Additionally, we ran an analogous model to our main model on the external CHART dataset.In the MoBa cohort, we found more differentially methylated CpGs and DMRs in girls than boys. Most of the associations persisted after controlling for parental DNAm and other confounders. Many of the significant CpGs and DMRs were in gene-promoter regions, and several of the genes linked to these CpGs are expressed in tissues relevant for both ART and sex (testis, placenta, and fallopian tube). We found no support for parental DNAm-dependent features as an explanation for the observed associations in the newborns. The most significant CpG in the boys-only analysis was in UBE2DNL, which is expressed in testes but with unknown function. The most significant CpGs in the girls-only analysis were in EIF2S3 and AMOT. These three loci also displayed differential DNAm in the CHART cohort.Genes that co-localized with the significant CpGs and DMRs associated with ART are implicated in several key biological processes (e.g., neurodevelopment) and disorders (e.g., intellectual disability and autism). These connections are particularly compelling in light of previous findings indicating that neurodevelopmental outcomes differ in ART-conceived children compared to those naturally conceived.© 2023.

DNA methylation (DNAm) variation influences many of these glioma-related traits and is an established feature of glioma. Yet the causal relationship between DNAm variation with both glioma incidence and glioma risk factors is unknown. We applied a two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) approach and several sensitivity analyses (including colocalization and Steiger filtering) to assess the association of DNAm with glioma risk factors and glioma incidence. We used data from a recently published catalogue of germline genetic variants robustly associated with DNAm variation in blood (32,851 participants) and data from a genome-wide association study of glioma risk (12,488 cases and 18,169 controls, sub-divided into 6191 glioblastoma cases and 6305 non-glioblastoma cases). MR evidence indicated that DNAm at 3 CpG sites (cg01561092, cg05926943, cg01584448) in one genomic region (HEATR3) had a putative association with glioma and glioblastoma risk (False discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). Steiger filtering provided evidence against reverse causation. Colocalization presented evidence against genetic confounding and suggested that differential DNAm at the 3 CpG sites and glioma were driven by the same genetic variant. MR provided little evidence to suggest that DNAm acts as a mediator on the causal pathway between risk factors previously examined and glioma onset. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use MR to appraise the causal link of DNAm with glioma risk factors and glioma onset. Subsequent analyses are required to improve the robustness of our results and rule out horizontal pleiotropy.© 2023. The Author(s)."

DNA samples collected and stored in clinical biobanks over the past years are an important source for future epigenetic studies. Isolated gDNA is considered stable when stored at low temperatures for several years. However, the effect of multiple use and the associated repeated thawing of long-term stored DNA samples on DNA methylation patterns has not yet been investigated. In this study, we examined the influence of up to 10 freeze and thaw cycles on global DNA methylation by comparing genome-wide methylation profiles. DNA samples from 19 healthy volunteers were either frozen at -80°C or subjected to up to 10 freeze and thaw cycles. Genome-wide DNA methylation was analyzed after 0, 1, 3, 5, or 10 thaw cycles using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Evaluation of the global DNA methylation profile by beta-value density plots and multidimensional scaling plots revealed an expected clear participant-dependent variability, but a very low variability depending on the freeze and thaw cycles. In accordance, no significant difference in any of the methylated cytosine/guanine sites studied could be detected in the performed statistical analyses. Our results suggest that long-term frozen DNA samples are still suitable for epigenetic studies after multiple thaw cycles."

This cortical clock (CC) dramatically outperformed extant blood-based epigenetic clocks in predicting brain age and neurological degeneration. Unfortunately, measures that require brain tissue are of limited utility to investigators striving to identify everyday risk factors for dementia. The present study investigated the utility of using the CpG sites included in the CC to formulate a peripheral blood-based cortical measure of brain age (CC-Bd). To establish the utility of CC-Bd, we used growth curves with individually varying time points and longitudinal data from a sample of 694 aging African Americans. We examined whether three risk factors that have been linked to cognitive decline-loneliness, depression, and BDNFm-predicted CC-Bd after controlling for several factors, including three new-generation epigenetic clocks. Our findings showed that two clocks-DunedinPACE and PoAm-predicted CC-BD, but that increases in loneliness and BDNFm continued to be robust predictors of accelerated CC-Bd even after taking these effects into account. This suggests that CC-Bd is assessing something more than the pan-tissue epigenetic clocks but that, at least in part, brain health is also associated with the general aging of the organism."

Phthalate levels were measured in 274 maternal urine samples obtained during late pregnancy and 102 neonatal urine samples obtained at birth, and DNA methylation levels were measured in cord blood samples. For each infant in the cohort, associations between CpG methylation and both maternal and neonate phthalate levels were analyzed using linear mixed models. The results were combined with those from a meta-analysis of the levels of phthalates in maternal and neonatal urine samples, which were also analyzed for MEOHP, MEHHP, MnBP, and DEHP. This meta-analysis revealed significant associations between the methylation levels of CpG sites near the CHN2 and CUL3 genes, which were also associated with MEOHP and MnBP in neonatal urine. When the data were stratified by the sex of the infant, MnBP concentration was found to be associated with one CpG site near the OR2A2 and MEGF11 genes in female infants. In contrast, the concentrations of the three maternal phthalates showed no significant association with CpG site methylation. Furthermore, the data identified distinct differentially methylated regions in maternal and neonatal urine samples following exposure to phthalates. The CpGs with methylation levels that were positively associated with phthalate levels (particularly MEOHP and MnBP) were found to be enriched genes and related pathways. These results indicate that prenatal phthalate exposure is significantly associated with DNA methylation at multiple CpG sites. These alterations in DNA methylation may serve as biomarkers of maternal exposure to phthalates in infants and are potential candidates for investigating the mechanisms by which phthalates impact maternal and neonatal health.© 2023.

,No,20230504,dnamage,37076473,Multi-omic underpinnings of epigenetic aging and human longevity.,Nat Commun,"Biological aging is accompanied by increasing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs; however, its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we use multi-omic methods to integrate genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data and identify biological associations with four measures of epigenetic age acceleration and a human longevity phenotype comprising healthspan, lifespan, and exceptional longevity (multivariate longevity). Using transcriptomic imputation, fine-mapping, and conditional analysis, we identify 22 high confidence associations with epigenetic age acceleration and seven with multivariate longevity. FLOT1, KPNA4, and TMX2 are novel, high confidence genes associated with epigenetic age acceleration. In parallel, cis-instrument Mendelian randomization of the druggable genome associates TPMT and NHLRC1 with epigenetic aging, supporting transcriptomic imputation findings. Metabolomics Mendelian randomization identifies a negative effect of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and associated lipoproteins on multivariate longevity, but not epigenetic age acceleration. Finally, cell-type enrichment analysis implicates immune cells and precursors in epigenetic age acceleration and, more modestly, multivariate longevity. Follow-up Mendelian randomization of immune cell traits suggests lymphocyte subpopulations and lymphocytic surface molecules affect multivariate longevity and epigenetic age acceleration. Our results highlight druggable targets and biological pathways involved in aging and facilitate multi-omic comparisons of epigenetic clocks and human longevity.© 2023.

,No,20230504,single-cell,37034737,A single-nucleus transcriptome-wide association study implicates novel genes in depression pathogenesis.,medRxiv,"Depression is a common psychiatric illness and global public health problem. However, our limited understanding of the biological basis of depression has hindered the development of novel treatments and interventions.To identify new candidate genes for therapeutic development, we examined single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snucRNAseq) data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (N=424) in relation to ante-mortem depressive symptoms. To complement these direct analyses, we also used genome- wide association study (GWAS) results for depression (N=500,199) along with genetic tools for inferring the expression of 22,159 genes in 7 cell types and 55 cell subtypes to perform transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) of depression followed by Mendelian randomization (MR).Our single-nucleus TWAS analysis identified 71 causal genes in depression that have a role in specific neocortical cell subtypes; 59 of 71 genes were novel compared to previous studies. Depression TWAS genes showed a cell type specific pattern, with the greatest enrichment being in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as astrocytes. Gene expression in different neuron subtypes have different directions of effect on depression risk. Compared to lower genetically correlated traits (e.g. body mass index) with depression, higher correlated traits (e.g., neuroticism) have more common TWAS genes with depression. In parallel, we performed differential gene expression analysis in relation to depression in 55 cortical cell subtypes, and we found that genes such asANKRD36,MADD,TAOK3,SCAIandCHUKare associated with depression in specific cell subtypes.These two sets of analyses illustrate the utility of large snucRNAseq data to uncover both genes whose expression is altered in specific cell subtypes in the context of depression and to enhance the interpretation of well-powered GWAS so that we can prioritize specific susceptibility genes for further analysis and therapeutic development."

However, existing subtyping studies have mostly focused on single data modalities and only those individuals with severe cognitive impairment. To address these gaps, we applied similarity network fusion, a method capable of integrating multiple high-dimensional multi-omic data modalities simultaneously, to an elderly sample spanning the full spectrum of cognitive ageing trajectories. We analyzed human frontal cortex brain samples characterized by five omic modalities: bulk RNA sequencing (18 629 genes), DNA methylation (53 932 CpG sites), histone acetylation (26 384 peaks), proteomics (7737 proteins) and metabolomics (654 metabolites). Similarity network fusion followed by spectral clustering was used for subtype detection, and subtype numbers were determined by Eigen-gap and rotation cost statistics. Normalized mutual information determined the relative contribution of each modality to the fused network. Subtypes were characterized by associations with 13 age-related neuropathologies and cognitive decline. Fusion of all five data modalities (n= 111) yielded two subtypes (nS1= 53,nS2= 58), which were nominally associated with diffuse amyloid plaques; however, this effect was not significant after correction for multiple testing. Histone acetylation (normalized mutual information = 0.38), DNA methylation (normalized mutual information = 0.18) and RNA abundance (normalized mutual information = 0.15) contributed most strongly to this network. Secondary analysis integrating only these three modalities in a larger subsample (n= 513) indicated support for both three- and five-subtype solutions, which had significant overlap, but showed varying degrees of internal stability and external validity. One subtype showed marked cognitive decline, which remained significant even after correcting for tests across both three- and five-subtype solutions (pBonf= 5.9 × 10-3). Comparison to single-modality subtypes demonstrated that the three-modal subtypes were able to uniquely capture cognitive variability. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses explored influences of sample size and cluster number parameters. We identified highly integrative molecular subtypes of ageing derived from multiple high dimensional, multi-omic data modalities simultaneously. Fusing RNA abundance, DNA methylation, and histone acetylation measures generated subtypes that were associated with cognitive decline. This work highlights the potential value and challenges of multi-omic integration in unsupervised subtyping of post-mortem brain.© The Author(s) 2023.
