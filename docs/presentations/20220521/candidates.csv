"35585152","Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression patterns of androgenetic haploid tiger pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes) provide insights into haploid syndrome.","Sci Rep","Androgenesis is an important chromosome set manipulation technique used in sex control in aquaculture. Haploid embryos exhibit haploid syndrome with body abnormalities and even die during early embryonic development. In this study, we used whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to investigate the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in haploid females (1n-X) and males (1n-Y), and diploid females (2n-XX) and males (2n-XY) of tiger pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes), an economically important fish in China. A total of 96.32 Gb clean data was produced. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found between haploids and diploids, which may be related to abnormal development and early embryonic death in haploids. There were 3,641 hyper-methylated differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and 2,179 hypo-methylated DMGs in haploid vs. diploid comparisons in both females and males. These DMGs were mainly related to genomic stability maintenance and cell cycle regulation. slf1, actr8, gas2, and pbrm1 genes were selected to validate the methylation sequencing. After combining the methylation data with the corresponding transcriptome data, we identified several genes, including guca2a, myoc, fezf2, rprml, telo2, s100a1, and marveld1, which exhibited differential expression levels modulated by DNA methylation. In conclusion, our study revealed different methylation and expression profiles between haploid and diploid T. rubripes for the first time. Several DMGs were identified between different ploidy levels, which may be related to haploid syndrome formation. The results expand the understanding of the effects of ploidy on the early development of teleosts and provide knowledge about target genes and networks to improve the survival rate of haploids.© 2022.

Specific methylated genes and methylated diagnostic models of tumors have become current research focuses. The methylation status of circulating DNA in plasma might serve as a potential biomarker for CRC.To investigate genome-wide methylation pattern in early CRC using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 850K BeadChip.The 850K Methylation BeadChip was used to analyze the genome-wide methylation status of early CRC patients (n= 5) and colorectal adenoma patients (n= 5). Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enrichment analyses were performed on the selected differentially methylated sites to further discover candidate methylation biomarkers in plasma.A total of 1865 methylated CpG sites with significant differences were detected, including 676 hypermethylated sites and 1189 hypomethylated sites. The distribution of these sites covered from the 1stto 22ndchromosomes and are mainly distributed on the gene body and gene promoter region. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the functions of these genes were related to biological regulation, molecular binding, transcription factor activity and signal transduction pathway.The study demonstrated that the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 850K BeadChip can be used to investigate genome-wide methylation status of plasma DNA in early CRC and colorectal adenoma patients.©The Author(s) 2022.

"35581635","The m6A methylation regulates gonadal sex differentiation in chicken embryo.","J Anim Sci Biotechnol","As a ubiquitous reversible epigenetic RNA modification, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays crucial regulatory roles in multiple biological pathways. However, its functional mechanisms in sex determination and differentiation during gonadal development of chicken embryos are not clear. Therefore, we established a transcriptome-wide m6A map in the female and male chicken left gonads of embryonic day 7 (E7) by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) to offer insight into the landscape of m6A methylation and investigate the post-transcriptional modification underlying gonadal differentiation.The chicken embryonic gonadal transcriptome was extensively methylated. We found 15,191 and 16,111 m6A peaks in the female and male left gonads, respectively, which were mainly enriched in the coding sequence (CDS) and stop codon. Among these m6A peaks, we identified that 1013 and 751 were hypermethylated in females and males, respectively. These differential peaks covered 281 and 327 genes, such as BMP2, SMAD2, SOX9 and CYP19A1, which were primarily associated with development, morphogenesis and sex differentiation by functional enrichment. Further analysis revealed that the m6A methylation level was positively correlated with gene expression abundance. Furthermore, we found that YTHDC2 could regulate the expression of sex-related genes, especially HEMGN and SOX9, in male mesonephros/gonad mingle cells, which was verified by in vitro experiments, suggesting a regulatory role of m6A methylation in chicken gonad differentiation.This work provided a comprehensive m6A methylation profile of chicken embryonic gonads and revealed YTHDC2 as a key regulator responsible for sex differentiation. Our results contribute to a better understanding of epigenetic factors involved in chicken sex determination and differentiation and to promoting the future development of sex manipulation in poultry industry.© 2022.

"35581385","Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling and exome sequencing resolved a long-time misdiagnosed case.","J Hum Genet","The search for aetiology of Mendelian disorders is traditionally based on the observation of clinical phenotypes and molecular screening of associated genes. However, a disease-specific diagnosis can be challenging. In this study we detail how the combinatorial genomic and epigenomic assessment allowed to find the underlying molecular event of a clinical case that remained misdiagnosed for years. The individual was referred as affected by an atypical form of Kabuki syndrome with a variant of uncertain significance in the KMT2D gene. However, significant inconsistencies with this diagnosis emerged upon familial segregation of the variant and after the clinical re-evaluation. Therefore, we applied an epigenomic strategy by studying the DNA methylation profile which resulted not consistent with the Kabuki syndrome episignature or with any other disorder-specific episignature described so far, providing strong evidence that the Kabuki syndrome diagnosis does not apply. This result led us to further investigate for epigenetic machinery diseases by using a multigene panel for chromatinopathies. Since this analysis yielded negative results, we applied a whole exome sequencing and identified a de novo pathogenic variant in the CTNNB1 gene associated to NEDSDV syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and craniofacial anomalies. Based on molecular results and the updated clinical features, we confirmed the NEDSDV diagnosis. Our findings show that the combination of genomic and epigenomics strategies, along with a deeper analysis of clinical phenotype, may provide a significant improvement in the diagnostic protocols for rare genetic disorders and help resolve long-time misdiagnosed and unsolved case.© 2022.

"35576644","Longitudinal analysis of blood DNA methylation identifies mechanisms of response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.","EBioMedicine","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease of the joints that has been associated with variation in the peripheral blood methylome. In this study, we aim to identify epigenetic variation that is associated with the response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) therapy.Peripheral blood genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were analyzed in a discovery cohort of 62 RA patients at baseline and at week 12 of TNFi therapy. DNA methylation of individual CpG sites and enrichment of biological pathways were evaluated for their association with drug response. Using a novel cell deconvolution approach, altered DNA methylation associated with TNFi response was also tested in the six main immune cell types in blood. Validation of the results was performed in an independent longitudinal cohort of 60 RA patients.Treatment with TNFi was associated with significant longitudinal peripheral blood methylation changes in biological pathways related to RA (FDR<0.05). 139 biological functions were modified by therapy, with methylation levels changing systematically towards a signature similar to that of healthy controls. Differences in the methylation profile of T cell activation and differentiation, GTPase-mediated signaling, and actin filament organization pathways were associated with the clinical response to therapy. Cell type deconvolution analysis identified CpG sites in CD4+T, NK, neutrophils and monocytes that were significantly associated with the response to TNFi.Our results show that treatment with TNFi restores homeostatic blood methylation in RA. The clinical response to TNFi is associated to methylation variation in specific biological pathways, and it involves cells from both the innate and adaptive immune systems.The Instituto de Salud Carlos III.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

"35576144","Impacts of <i>Mycoplasma agalactiae</i> restriction-modification systems on pan-epigenome dynamics and genome plasticity.","Microb Genom","DNA methylations play an important role in the biology of bacteria. Often associated with restriction modification (RM) systems, they are important drivers of bacterial evolution interfering in horizontal gene transfer events by providing a defence against foreign DNA invasion or by favouring genetic transfer through production of recombinogenic DNA ends. Little is known regarding the methylome of theMycoplasmagenus, which encompasses several pathogenic species with small genomes. Here, genome-wide detection of DNA methylations was conducted using single molecule real-time (SMRT) and bisulphite sequencing in several strains ofMycoplasma agalactiae, an important ruminant pathogen and a model organism. Combined with whole-genome analysis, this allowed the identification of 19 methylated motifs associated with three orphan methyltransferases (MTases) and eight RM systems. All systems had a homolog in at least one phylogenetically distinctMycoplasmaspp. Our study also revealed that several superimposed genetic events may participate in theM. agalactiaedynamic epigenomic landscape. These included (i) DNA shuffling and frameshift mutations that affect the MTase and restriction endonuclease content of a clonal population and (ii) gene duplication, erosion, and horizontal transfer that modulate MTase and RM repertoires of the species. Some of these systems were experimentally shown to play a major role in mycoplasma conjugative, horizontal DNA transfer. While the versatility of DNA methylation may contribute to regulating essential biological functions at cell and population levels, RM systems may be key in mycoplasma genome evolution and adaptation by controlling horizontal gene transfers."
"35575945","Signatures of polygenic adaptation align with genome-wide methylation patterns in wild strawberry plants.","New Phytol","Epigenetic inheritance can drive adaptive evolution independent of DNA sequence variation. However, to what extent epigenetic variation represents an autonomous evolutionary force remains largely elusive. Through gene ontology and comparative analyses of genomic and epigenomic variation of wild strawberry plants raised in distinct drought settings, we characterized genome-wide covariation between SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and DMCs (differentially methylated cytosines). Covariation between SNPs and DMCs was independent of genomic proximity, but instead associated with fitness-related processes such as stress responses, genome regulation and reproduction. We expected this functional SNP-DMC covariation to be driven by adaptive evolution canalizing SNP and DMC variation, but instead observed significantly lower covariation with DMCs for adaptive than for neutral SNPs. Drought-induced DMCs frequently co-varied with tens of SNPs, suggesting high genomic redundancy as a broad potential basis for polygenic adaptation of gene expression. Our findings suggest that stress-responsive DMCs initially co-vary with many SNPs under increased environmental stress, and that natural selection acting upon several of these SNPs subsequently reduce standing covariation with stress-responsive DMCs. Our study supports DNA methylation profiles representing complex quantitative traits rather than autonomous evolutionary forces. We provide a conceptual framework for polygenic regulation and adaptation shaping genome-wide methylation patterns in plants.This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
"35574972","Birth weight and maternal energy status during pregnancy as predictors of epigenetic age acceleration in young adults from metropolitan Cebu, Philippines.","Epigenetics","Epigenetic clocks quantify regular changes in DNA methylation that occur with age, or in relation to biomarkers of ageing, and are strong predictors of morbidity and mortality. Here, we assess whether measures of fetal nutrition and growth that predict adult chronic disease also predict accelerated biological ageing in young adulthood using a suite of commonly used epigenetic clocks. Data come from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS), a long-running cohort followed since birth in metropolitan Cebu, Philippines. Past work has shown that birth weight (BW) and the mother's arm fat during pregnancy (a measure of pregnancy energy status) relate inversely to health outcomes in the CLHNS but primarily in males. Genome-wide DNA methylation was assessed in whole blood using the Infinium EPIC array. Participants included males (n=895) and females (n=803) measured in 2005 (20.8-22.5 years). Clocks included the Hannum and Horvath clocks trained on chronological age, the DNAmPhenoAge and DNAmGrimAge clocks trained on clinical biomarkers, the Dunedin pace of ageing (DunedinPACE) clock trained on longitudinal changes in ageing biomarkers, and the DNAmTL clock trained on leukocyte telomere length. In males, lower BW predicted advanced biological ageing using the Hannum, DNAmPhenoAge, DunedinPoAm, and DNAmTL clocks. In contrast, BW did not predict any clock in female participants. Participants' mothers' pregnancy arm fat only predicted DNAmTL in males. These findings suggest that epigenetic clocks are a useful tool for gauging long-term outcomes predicted by fetal growth, and add to existing evidence in the CLHNS for sex differences in these relationships."

In the present study, 51JmjCgenes (GhJMJs) were identified by genome-wide analysis in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), which can be categorized into six distinct groups by phylogenetic analysis. Extensive syntenic relationship events were found betweenG. hirsutumandTheobroma cacao. We have further explored the putative molecular regulatory mechanisms of theJmjCgene family in cotton.GhJMJ24andGhJMJ49were both preferentially expressed in embryogenic callus compared to nonembryogenic callus in cotton tissue culture, which might be regulated by transcription factors and microRNAs to some extent. Further experiments indicated that GhJMJ24 and GhJMJ49 might interact with SUVH4, SUVH6, DDM1, CMT3, and CMT1 in the nucleus, potentially in association with demethylation of H3K9me2. Taken together, our results provide a foundation for future research on the biological functions ofGhJMJgenes in cotton, especially in somatic embryogenesis in cotton tissue culture, which is crucial for the regeneration of transgenic plants.Copyright © 2022 Li, Zhu, Yao, Fang, Li, Li, Wang, Wang, Wu, Pan, Feng, Chen and Zhang."

Recently, genomic underpinnings explaining additional interindividual risk beyond psychological factors have been proposed.We present a comprehensive review of current preclinical and clinical evidence for genetic and epigenetic mechanisms relevant to pediatric CPSP.Narrative review.Animal models are relevant to translational research for unraveling genomic mechanisms. For example,Cacng2, p2rx7, andbdnfmutant mice show altered mechanical hypersensitivity to injury, and variants of the same genes have been associated with CPSP susceptibility in humans; similarly, differential DNA methylation (H1SP) and miRNAs (miR-96/7a) have shown translational implications. Animal studies also suggest that crosstalk between neurons and immune cells may be involved in nociceptive priming observed in neonates. In children, differential DNA methylation in regulatory genomic regions enriching GABAergic, dopaminergic, and immune pathways, as well as polygenic risk scores for enhanced prediction of CPSP, have been described. Genome-wide studies in pediatric CPSP are scarce, but pathways identified by adult gene association studies point to potential common mechanisms.Bench-to-bedside genomics research in pediatric CPSP is currently limited. Reverse translational approaches, use of other -omics, and inclusion of pediatric/CPSP endophenotypes in large-scale biobanks may be potential solutions. Time of developmental vulnerability and longitudinal genomic changes after surgery warrant further investigation. Emergence of promising precision pain management strategies based on gene editing and epigenetic programing emphasize need for further research in pediatric CPSP-related genomics.© 2022 The Author(s).

Many cutting-edge epigenetic research techniques have been applied to the study of the pathogenesis of asthma, which has promoted the development of asthma etiology and brought new possibilities for treatment. We summarized recent advances in epigenetic research of the pathogenesis of asthma, especially from the perspective of high-throughput analysis techniques, to find potential epigenetic biomarkers and possible molecular targets for the future intervention and treatment of the disease.We reviewed and summarized recent progress in epigenomic studies of asthma on a ""pre-transcriptional level"", including DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling, and on a ""post-transcriptional level"" with a focus on non-coding RNA, from the perspective of high-throughput analysis technologies.We have summarized the progress of different kinds of recent epigenetic studies in asthma, including DNA methylation studies [candidate genes methylation studies and epigenome-wide association study (EWAS)], histone modification studies (histone acetylation/deacetylation studies and histone methylation studies), non-coding RNA studies [microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs)], to help the readers to gain a comprehensive insight into the epigenetic research fields for asthma. The application of high-throughput analysis techniques in asthma research, including EWAS (DNA methylation chips), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (CHIP-seq), microRNA sequencing, whole transcriptome sequencing, co-expression network and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) analyses, were introduced accompany with the main findings. And the potential epigenetic biomarkers and possible molecular targets identified via high-throughput analyses were also discussed.Epigenetic research has become a hotspot in research on the pathogenesis of asthma.

"35567546","Alpha-synuclein overexpression induces epigenomic dysregulation of glutamate signaling and locomotor pathways.","Hum Mol Genet","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder with complex interindividual etiology that is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. Elevated alpha-synuclein levels can increase risk of PD and may influence epigenetic regulation of PD pathways. Here, we report genome-wide DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation alterations associated with overexpression of two PD-linked alpha-synuclein variants (wild-type and A30P) in LUHMES cells differentiated to dopaminergic neurons. Alpha-synuclein altered DNA methylation at thousands of CpGs and DNA hydroxymethylation at hundreds of CpGs in both genotypes, primarily in locomotor behavior and glutamate signaling pathway genes. In some cases, epigenetic changes were associated with transcription. SMITE network analysis incorporating H3K4me1 ChIP-seq to score DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation changes across promoters, enhancers, and gene bodies confirmed epigenetic and transcriptional deregulation of glutamate signaling modules in both genotypes. Our results identify distinct and shared impacts of alpha-synuclein variants on the epigenome, and associate alpha-synuclein with the epigenetic etiology of PD.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35567415","Evaluation of nanopore sequencing for epigenetic epidemiology: a comparison with DNA methylation microarrays.","Hum Mol Genet","Most epigenetic epidemiology to date has utilized microarrays to identify positions in the genome where variation in DNA methylation is associated with environmental exposures or disease. However, these profile less than 3% of DNA methylation sites in the human genome, potentially missing affected loci and preventing the discovery of disrupted biological pathways. Third generation sequencing technologies, including Nanopore sequencing, have the potential to revolutionise the generation of epigenetic data, not only by providing genuine genome-wide coverage but profiling epigenetic modifications direct from native DNA. Here we assess the viability of using Nanopore sequencing for epidemiology by performing a comparison with DNA methylation quantified using the most comprehensive microarray available, the Illumina EPIC array. We implemented a CRISPR-Cas9 targeted sequencing approach in concert with Nanopore sequencing to profile DNA methylation in three genomic regions to attempt to rediscover genomic positions that existing technologies have shown are differentially methylated in tobacco smokers. Using Nanopore sequencing reads, DNA methylation was quantified at 1779 CpGs across three regions, providing a finer resolution of DNA methylation patterns compared to the EPIC array. The correlation of estimated levels of DNA methylation between platforms was high. Furthermore, we identified 12 CpGs where hypomethylation was significantly associated with smoking status, including 10 within the AHRR gene. In summary, Nanopore sequencing is a valid option for identifying genomic loci where large differences in DNAm are associated with a phenotype and has the potential to advance our understanding of the role differential methylation plays in the aetiology of complex disease.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35565379","Relative Telomere Length Change in Colorectal Carcinoma and Its Association with Tumor Characteristics, Gene Expression and Microsatellite Instability.","Cancers (Basel)","We compared tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples from 165 colorectal carcinoma (CRC) patients to study change in relative telomere length (RTL) and its association with different histological and molecular features. To measure RTL, we used a Luminex-based assay. We observed shorter RTL in the CRC tissue compared to paired normal tissue (RTL 0.722 ± SD 0.277 vs. 0.809 ± SD 0.242,p= 0.00012). This magnitude of RTL shortening (by ~0.08) in tumor tissue is equivalent to RTL shortening seen in human leukocytes over 10 years of aging measured by the same assay. RTL was shorter in cancer tissue, irrespective of age group, gender, tumor pathology, location and microsatellite instability (MSI) status. RTL shortening was more prominent in low-grade CRC and in the presence of microsatellite instability (MSI). In a subset of patients, we also examined differential gene expression of (a) telomere-related genes, (b) genes in selected cancer-related pathways and (c) genes at the genome-wide level in CRC tissues to determine the association between gene expression and RTL changes. RTL shortening in CRC was associated with (a) upregulation of DNA replication genes, cyclin dependent-kinase genes (anti-tumor suppressor) and (b) downregulation of ""caspase executor"", reducing apoptosis."

The primary aims of this study were (1) to compare blood DNA methylation profiles of WTC-exposed community members with breast cancer and WTC-unexposed pre-diagnostic breast cancer blood samples, and (2) to compare the DNA methylation differences among the WTC EHC breast cancer cases and WTC-exposed cancer-free controls. Gene pathway enrichment analyses were further conducted. There were significant differences in DNA methylation between WTC-exposed breast cancer cases and unexposed prediagnostic breast cancer cases. The top differentially methylated genes were Intraflagellar Transport 74 (IFT74), WD repeat-containing protein 90 (WDR90), and Oncomodulin (OCM), which are commonly upregulated in tumors. Probes associated with established tumor suppressor genes (ATM, BRCA1, PALB2, and TP53) were hypermethylated among WTC-exposed breast cancer cases compared to the unexposed group. When comparing WTC EHC breast cancer cases vs. cancer-free controls, there appeared to be global hypomethylation among WTC-exposed breast cancer cases compared to exposed controls. Functional pathway analysis revealed enrichment of several gene pathways in WTC-exposed breast cancer cases including endocytosis, proteoglycans in cancer, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, axon guidance, focal adhesion, calcium signaling, cGMP-PKG signaling, mTOR, Hippo, and oxytocin signaling. The results suggest potential epigenetic links between WTC exposure and breast cancer in local community members enrolled in the WTC EHC program."

Using various models, such as yeasts, appropriate tissue culture cells, Drosophila, the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansand the mouse, has tremendously increased our knowledge around the relationship between diet, nutrient-response signaling pathways and lifespan regulation. In recent years, combinatorial drug treatments combined with mutagenesis, high-throughput screens, as well as multi-omics approaches, have provided unprecedented insights in cellular metabolism, development, differentiation, and aging. Scientists are, therefore, moving towards characterizing the fine architecture and cross-talks of growth and stress pathways towards identifying possible interventions that could lead to healthy aging and the amelioration of age-related diseases in humans. In this short review, we briefly examine recently uncovered knowledge around nutrient-response pathways, such as the Insulin Growth Factor (IGF) and the mechanistic Target of Rapamycin signaling pathways, as well as specific GWAS and some EWAS studies on lifespan and age-related disease that have enhanced our current understanding within the aging and biogerontology fields.

Here, we first profile transcriptome-wide m6A in female and maleAnopheles sinensisand reveal that m6A is also a highly conserved modification of mRNA in mosquitoes. Distinct from mammals and yeast but similar toArabidopsis thaliana, m6A inAn. sinensisis enriched not only around the stop codon and within 3'-untranslated regions but also around the start codon and 5'-UTR. Gene ontology analysis indicates the unique distribution pattern of m6A inAn. sinensisis associated with mosquito sex-specific pathways such as tRNA wobble uridine modification and phospholipid-binding in females, and peptidoglycan catabolic process, exosome and signal recognition particle, endoplasmic reticulum targeting, and RNA helicase activity in males. The positive correlation between m6A deposition and mRNA abundance indicates that m6A can play a role in regulating gene expression in mosquitoes. Furthermore, many spermatogenesis-associated genes, especially those related to mature sperm flagellum formation, are positively modulated by m6A methylation. A transcriptional regulatory network of m6A inAn. sinensisis first profiled in the present study, especially in spermatogenesis, which may provide a new clue for the control of this disease-transmitting vector."

The current system of grading has been shown to be unsatisfactory due to its poor reproducibility as well as the considerable variability within grades. With the increasing availability of genomic and epigenomic profiling, several markers have been suggested to correlate with the location, histological subtype, and clinical behavior of meningiomas. These developments have enabled the development of targeted therapy, as well as individualized use of currently available adjuvant methods. These include copy number alterations (CNAs), specific genetic abnormalities (germline and sporadic), and genome-wide methylation profiles. In this review, we recapitulate the changes in the classification of meningiomas thus far, discuss the various histological subtypes recognized, and present the available literature on the genetic and epigenetic profiles of meningiomas.

However, the biological function and prognostic value of TRPVs in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) are still largely unknown.We obtained the gene expression data and clinical information of 539 ccRCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. A series of databases were used for data processing and visualization, including GEPIA, GeneMANIA, MethSurv, GSCA, TIMER, and starBase databases.The mRNA expression of TRPV2/3 was upregulated while the expression of TRPV5/6 was downregulated in ccRCC tumor tissues. TRPV family members in ccRCC were rarely mutated (nearly 7 frequencies). The ROC curve showed that TRPV2/5/6 had a high diagnostic ability in discriminating ccRCC from the control samples (AUC>0.9). Higher levels of TRPV3 expression were associated with poor prognosis of ccRCC patients, while higher expression of TRPV4 was associated with favorable prognosis. The expression of TRPV3 in normal and ccRCC tissues was validated by Immunohistochemistry, and its expression was remarkably related to high histologic grade and advanced stage. Besides, TRPV3 exhibit a reduction of DNA methylation level with tumor progression, and 12 CpGs of TRPV3 were associated with a significant prognosis. In addition, TRPV3 expression was significantly associated with the accumulation of several tumor-infiltrating immune cells, especially regulatory T cells. Furthermore, high levels of TRPV3 induced the expression of immune checkpoints such as LAG3, CTLA4, PDCD1, and TIGIT. Finally, we predicted a key SNHG3/AL513497.1-miR-10b-5p-TRPV3 axis linking to carcinogenesis and progression of ccRCC.Our study may uncover TRPV channels-associated molecular mechanisms involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of ccRCC.

The integrated diagnostic performance of microRNA panel (microRNA-34a+let-7f+microRNA-31) in late-stage and early-stage serum samples was 95.5 and 96.9 respectively.Our data correlated hypermethylation-associated downregulation of microRNA in EOC.

"35552544","Identification of differential hypothalamic DNA methylation and gene expression associated with sexual partner preferences in rams.","PLoS One","The sheep is a valuable model to test whether hormone mechanisms that sexually differentiate the brain underlie the expression of sexual partner preferences because as many as 8% of rams prefer same-sex partners. Epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation act as mediators in the interaction between steroid hormones and the genome. Variations in the epigenome could be important in determining morphological or behavior differences among individuals of the same species. In this study, we explored DNA methylation differences in the hypothalamus of male oriented rams (MORs) and female oriented rams (FORs). We employed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to generate a genome-wide map of DNA methylation and RNA-Seq to profile the transcriptome. We found substantial DNA methylation and gene expression differences between FORs and MORs. Although none of the differentially methylated genes yielded significant functional terms directly associated with sex development, three differentially expressed genes were identified that have been associated previously with sexual behaviors. We hypothesize that these differences are involved in the phenotypic variation in ram sexual partner preferences, whereas future studies will have to find the specific mechanisms. Our results add an intriguing new dimension to sheep behavior that should be useful for further understanding epigenetic and transcriptomic involvement."

In this study, we identified totally 231 chromatin regulators including 63 histones, 29 histone chaperones, 101 histone modification enzymes, and 38 chromatin remodeling factors fromSorghum bicolor(L.) Moench. Most of these chromatin regulators are homologous to their counterparts in Arabidopsis or rice. However, sorghum genome evolves a few novel histone variants specific to some grass species and a sorghum-unique chromatin remodeling factor that contain the domains belonging to the elongation factor EF-Tu and the histone chaperone SPT16. Finally, we performed co-expression analysis for the chromatin regulator-encoding genes by clustering the expression patterns of these genes.

"35546478","Integrative analysis of clinical and epigenetic biomarkers of mortality.","Aging Cell","DNA methylation (DNAm) has been reported to be associated with many diseases and with mortality. We hypothesized that the integration of DNAm with clinical risk factors would improve mortality prediction. We performed an epigenome-wide association study of whole blood DNAm in relation to mortality in 15 cohorts (n = 15,013). During a mean follow-up of 10 years, there were 4314 deaths from all causes including 1235 cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths and 868 cancer deaths. Ancestry-stratified meta-analysis of all-cause mortality identified 163 CpGs in European ancestry (EA) and 17 in African ancestry (AA) participants at p < 1 × 10-7, of which 41 (EA) and 16 (AA) were also associated with CVD death, and 15 (EA) and 9 (AA) with cancer death. We built DNAm-based prediction models for all-cause mortality that predicted mortality risk after adjusting for clinical risk factors. The mortality prediction model trained by integrating DNAm with clinical risk factors showed an improvement in prediction of cancer death with 5% increase in the C-index in a replication cohort, compared with the model including clinical risk factors alone. Mendelian randomization identified 15 putatively causal CpGs in relation to longevity, CVD, or cancer risk. For example, cg06885782 (in KCNQ4) was positively associated with risk for prostate cancer (Beta = 1.2, PMR = 4.1 × 10-4) and negatively associated with longevity (Beta = -1.9, PMR = 0.02). Pathway analysis revealed that genes associated with mortality-related CpGs are enriched for immune- and cancer-related pathways. We identified replicable DNAm signatures of mortality and demonstrated the potential utility of CpGs as informative biomarkers for prediction of mortality risk.© 2022 The Authors.

However, the pathogenesis and potential epigenetic mechanism involved in this process are unclear. In this study, we used MethylRAD sequencing to compare changes in methylation levels in the genomic landscapes in the fetal heart in a rat model of hyperglycemia. Our results showed that methylation of CCGG/CCNGG sites were mostly enriched in intergenic regions, followed by intron, exon, upstream and the 5' and 3' untranslated regions. qRT-PCR results confirmed the MethylRAD sequencing findings, suggesting that abnormal CCGG/CCNGG methylation in the upstream region regulated gene expression. The differential methylation genes (DMGs) based on the CCGG and CCNGG sites in the upstream region were examined by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. Gene Ontology indicated that the CCGG-based DMGs involved in biological process and function were mainly related to transcription and co-SMAD binding. The CCNGG-based DMGs were mainly related to transcription and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis indicated that CCGG-based DMGs were mainly involved in the Wnt signaling and TGF-β signaling pathways. CCNGG-based DMGs were involved in the TNF signaling and apoptosis pathways. These genes may play dominant roles in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and heart disease and require further study. These genes may also serve as potential molecular targets or diagnostic biomarkers for heart malformations under hyperglycemia."

However, its function in FGSCs remains unclear. In this study, we showed that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout ofStellapromoted FGSC proliferation and reduced the level of genome-wide DNA methylation of FGSCs. Conversely,Stellaoverexpression led to the opposite results, and enhanced FGSC differentiation. We also performed an integrative analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), high-throughput genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and use of our published epigenetic data. Results indicated that the binding sites of STELLA and active histones H3K4me3 and H3K27ac were enriched near the TAD boundaries. Hi-C analysis showed thatStellaoverexpression attenuated the interaction within TADs, and interestingly enhanced the TAD boundary strength in STELLA-associated regions. Taking these findings together, our study not only reveals the role ofStellain regulating DNA methylation and chromatin structure, but also provides a better understanding of FGSC development.© The author(s)."
"35537341","Methylome analysis of ALS patients and presymptomatic mutation carriers in blood cells.","Neurobiol Aging","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motoneuron disease with a monogenic cause in approximately 10% of cases. However, familial clustering of disease without inheritance in a Mendelian manner and the broad range of phenotypes suggest the presence of epigenetic mechanisms. Hence, we performed an epigenome-wide association study on sporadic, symptomatic and presymptomatic familial ALS cases with mutations in C9ORF72 and FUS and healthy controls studying DNA methylation in blood cells. We found differentially methylated DNA positions (DMPs) and regions embedding DMPs associated with either disease status, C9ORF72 or FUS mutation status. One DMP reached methylome-wide significance and is attributed to a region encoding a long non-coding RNA (LOC389247). Furthermore, we could demonstrate co-localization of DMPs with an ALS-associated GWAS region near the SCN7A/SCN9A and XIRP2 genes. Finally, a classifier model that predicts disease status (ALS, healthy) classified all but one presymptomatic mutation carrier as healthy, suggesting that the presence of ALS symptoms rather than the presence of ALS-associated genetic mutations is associated with blood cell DNA methylation.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

We performed multi-ancestry epigenome-wide meta-analyses (17,503 individuals: 14,761 European; 2,549 African; and 193 Hispanic/Latino ancestries) and interpreted results using integrative epigenomics.We identified 1,267 CpGs (1,042 genes) differentially methylated (FDR<0.025) in relation to FEV1, FVC, or FEV1/FVC, including 1,240 novel and 73 also related to COPD (1,787 cases). We found 294 CpGs unique to European or African ancestry and 395 CpGs unique to never or ever smokers. The majority of significant CpGs correlated with nearby gene expression in blood. Findings were enriched in key regulatory elements for gene function, including accessible chromatin elements, in both blood and lung. Sixty-nine implicated genes are targets of investigational or approved drugs. One example novel gene highlighted by integrative epigenomic and druggable target analysis is TNFRSF4. Mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses suggest that EWAS signals capture causal regulatory genomic loci.We identified numerous novel loci differentially methylated in relation to pulmonary function; few were detected in large genome-wide association studies. Integrative analyses highlight functional relevance and potential therapeutic targets. This comprehensive discovery of potentially modifiable, novel lung function loci expands knowledge gained from genetic studies providing insights into lung pathogenesis."

As an organotin acaricide widely used in China, azocyclotin can lead to endocrine disrupting effect on directly exposed environmental organisms, but whether it has transgenerational negative impact remains unknown. In order to illustrate this issue, in the present study, zebrafish, an aquatic model animal, was exposed to azocyclotin at less than μg/L level in a time span of embryonic stage to adult stage. Subsequently, the developmental and reproductive endocrine disrupting effects of azocyclotin on exposed F0 and unexposed offspring (F1 and F2) were evaluated. Result indicated that parentally exposed to 0.36 μg/L azocyclotin induced embryonic toxicity to unexposed offspring, and significantly (p < 0.05) reduced body weight (by 8.5%-13.9%), whole body length (by 4.8%-14.3%), hepatosomatic index (by 15.6%-24.3%), gonadosomatic index (by 5.3%-17.1%), egg production (by 19.5%-25.4%), estradiol content (47.0%-65.0%) and proportion of mature germ cells (by 29.3%-41.0% and 39.2%-47.7% for late oocytes and spermatozoa, respectively) in adults of F0 and offspring. Additionally, azocyclotin decreased the contents of 5-methycytosine in gonads of unexposed offspring (by 9.9%-38.6%, p < 0.05), led to genome-wide gene up-regulated expression bias and genomic DNA hypomethylation tendency in unexposed offspring. Moreover, based on the level of differentially methylated cytosine in promoter regions/gene body regions, it was found totally 5331/11,170 (in F1) and 3808/7507 (in F2) differentially expressed genes were closely related with differentially methylated genes (r > 0.6).

Postmortem human brain tissue enables the investigation of molecular mechanisms of AUD in the neurocircuitry of addiction. We aimed to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes in the ventral and dorsal striatum between individuals with AUD and controls, and to integrate the results with findings from genome- and epigenome-wide association studies (GWAS/EWAS) to identify functionally relevant molecular mechanisms of AUD. DNA-methylation and gene expression (RNA-seq) data was generated from postmortem brain samples of 48 individuals with AUD and 51 controls from the ventral striatum (VS) and the dorsal striatal regions caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (PUT). We identified DE genes using DESeq2, performed gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and tested enrichment of DE genes in results of GWASs using MAGMA. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed for DNA-methylation and gene expression data and gene overlap was tested. Differential gene expression was observed in the dorsal (FDR < 0.05), but not the ventral striatum of AUD cases. In the VS, DE genes at FDR < 0.25 were overrepresented in a recent GWAS of problematic alcohol use. The ARHGEF15 gene was upregulated in all three brain regions. GSEA in CN and VS pointed towards cell-structure associated GO-terms and in PUT towards immune pathways. The WGCNA modules most strongly associated with AUD showed strong enrichment for immune response and inflammation pathways. Our integrated analysis of multi-omics data sets provides further evidence for the importance of immune- and inflammation-related processes in AUD.© 2022. The Author(s)."

In this study, we characterised four new cell lines from GCTB. Furthermore, we compared the genome-wide DNA methylation profile of 13 such tumours and three further cell lines with giant cell rich lesions comprising three H3F3B-mutated chondroblastomas, three USP6-rearranged aneurysmal bone cysts, three non-ossifying fibromas, two hyperparathyroidism-associated brown tumours as well as mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. In an unsupervised analysis, we delineated GCTB and chondroblastomas from the other analysed tumour entities. Using comparative methylation analysis, we demonstrated that the methylation pattern of the cell lines approximately equals that of H3F3A-mutated stromal cells in tissue. These patterns more resemble that of osteoblasts than that of mesenchymal stem cells, which argues for the osteoblast as the cell of origin of giant cell tumours of bone. Using enrichment analysis, we detected distinct hypermethylated clusters containing histone and collagen genes as well as target genes of the tumour suppressor p53. We found that the promotor regions of CDKN1A, CDKN2A and IGFBP3 are methylated more strongly in GCTB than in the other giant cell containing lesions, mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts (p<0.001). This hypermethylation correlates with the lower gene expression at the mRNA level for these three genes in the cell lines, the lack of p16 and p21 in these cell lines and the lower expression of p16 and p21 in GCTB. Overall, our analysis reveals characteristic DNA methylation patterns of giant cell tumours of bone and chondroblastomas and shows that cell lines of giant cell tumours of bone are a valid model for further analysis of H3F3A-mutated tumour cells.

However, DNA methylation evolves surprisingly rapidly across eukaryotes. The genome-wide distribution of methylation diversifies rapidly in different lineages, and DNA methylation is lost altogether surprisingly frequently. The growing availability of genomic and epigenomic sequencing across organisms highlights this diversity but also illuminates potential factors that could explain why both the DNA methylation machinery and its genome-wide distribution evolve so rapidly. Key to this are new discoveries about the fitness costs associated with DNA methylation, and new theories about how the fundamental biochemical mechanisms of DNA methylation introduction and maintenance could explain how new genome-wide patterns of methylation evolve.© 2022 The Author(s)."

This study investigated DNA methylation in cord blood to identify possible ""at birth"" signatures that may indicate susceptibility to behavioral problems at 18 months of age. Cord blood was collected from 256 children of mothers who had self-reported on symptoms of depression during pregnancy and the behavior of their child at 18 months of age. Whole genome DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina MethylationEPIC assay. The mother and child pairs were categorized into four groups, based on both self-reported depressive symptoms, PND or Healthy control (HC), and scores from the Child Behavior checklist (high or low for internalizing, externalizing, and total scores). Adjustments were made for batch effects, cell-type, and clinical covariates. Differentially methylated sites were identified using Kruskal-Wallis test, and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p values < 0.05 were considered significant. The analysis was also stratified by sex of the child. Among boys, we observed higher and correlated DNA methylation of one CpG-site in the promoter region of TPP1 in the HC group, with high externalizing scores compared to HC with low externalizing scores. Boys in the PND group showed lower DNA methylation in NUDT15 among those with high, compared to low, internalizing scores; the DNA methylation levels of CpGs in this gene were positively correlated with the CBCL scores. Hence, the differentially methylated CpG sites could be of interest for resilience, regardless of maternal mental health during pregnancy. The findings are in a relatively healthy study cohort, thus limiting the possibility of detecting strong effects associated with behavioral difficulties. This is the first investigation of cord blood DNA methylation signs of fetal programming of PND on child behavior at 18 months of age and thus calls for independent replications.© 2022.

"35511767","Sex-heterogeneous SNPs disproportionately influence gene expression and health.","PLoS Genet","Phenotypic differences across sexes are pervasive, but the genetic architecture of sex differences within and across phenotypes is mostly unknown. In this study, we aimed to improve detection power for sex-differentially contributing SNPs previously demonstrated to be enriched in disease association, and we investigate their functions in health, pathophysiology, and genetic function. We leveraged GIANT and UK Biobank summary statistics and defined a set of 2,320 independent SNPs having sexually dimorphic effects within and across biometric traits (MAF > 0.001, P < 5x10-8). Biometric trait sex-heterogeneous SNPs (sex-het SNPs) showed enrichment in association signals for 20 out of 33 diseases/traits at 5% alpha compared to sex-homogeneous matched SNPs (empP < 0.001), and were significantly overrepresented in muscle, skeletal and stem cell development processes, and in calcium channel and microtubule complexes (FDR < 0.05, empP < 0.05). Interestingly, we found that sex-het SNPs significantly map to predicted expression quantitative trait loci (Pr-eQTLs) across brain and other tissues, methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) during development, and transcription start sites, compared to sex-homogeneous SNPs. Finally, we verified that the sex-het disease/trait enrichment was not explained by Pr-eQTL enrichment alone, as sex-het Pr-eQTLs were more enriched than matched sex-homogeneous Pr-eQTLs. We conclude that genetic polymorphisms with sexually dimorphic effects on biometric traits not only contribute to fundamental embryogenic processes, but later in life play an outsized role in disease risk. These sex-het SNPs disproportionately influence gene expression and have a greater influence on disorders of body and brain than other expression-regulatory variation. Together, our data emphasize the genetic underpinnings of sexual dimorphism and its role in human health."

Roughly, 25-30 % of glioblastoma (GBM) patients initially present with seizures, and an additional 30 % develop seizures during the course of the disease. Early studies failed to show an effect of general administration of anti-epileptic drugs for glioblastoma patients, since they were unable to stratify patients into high- or low-risk seizure groups.111 patients, who underwent surgery for a GBM, were included. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed, before methylation subclasses and copy number changes inferred from methylation data were correlated with clinical characteristics. Independently, global gene expression was analyzed in GBM methylation subclasses from TCGA datasets (n=68).Receptor tyrosine Kinase (RTK) II GBM showed a significantly higher incidence of seizures than RTK I and mesenchymal (MES) GBM (p<0.01). Accordingly, RNA expression datasets revealed an upregulation of genes involved in neurotransmitter synapses and vesicle transport in RTK II glioblastomas. In a multivariate analysis, temporal location (p=0.02, OR 5.69) and RTK II (p=0.03, OR 5.01) were most predictive for preoperative seizures. During postoperative follow-up, only RTK II remained significantly associated with the development of seizures (p<0.01, OR 8.23). Consequently, the need for antiepileptic medication and its increase due to treatment failure was highly associated with the RTK II methylation subclass (p<0.01).Our study shows a strong correlation of RTK II glioblastomas with preoperative and long-term seizures. These results underline the benefit of molecular glioblastoma profiling with important implications for postoperative seizure control.© The Author(s) 2022.

In this study, we show that cocaine exposure worsens the learning and memory of doxycycline-inducible and brain-specific HIV Tat transgenic mice (iTat) and results in 14,838 hypermethylated CpG-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 15,800 hypomethylated CpG-related DMRs, which are linked to 52 down- and 127 upregulated genes, respectively, in the hippocampus of iTat mice. These genes are mostly enriched at the neuronal function-, cell morphology-, and synapse formation-related extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor-ligand interaction pathway and mostly impacted in microglia. The accompanying neuropathological changes include swollen dendritic spines, increased synaptophysin expression, and diminished glial activation. We also find that sex (female) and age additively worsen the behavioral and pathological changes. These findings together indicate that chronic cocaine and long-term Tat expression interactively contribute to HAND, likely involving changes of DNA methylation and ECM receptor-ligand interactions.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Accumulating evidence suggests a role for RNA m6A methylation in various aspects of cancer biology. In this study, we aimed to explore the biological role of RNA m6A modification in tumor metastasis and to identify novel therapeutic strategies for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Integration of genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 functional screening with highly invasive and metastatic ESCC subline models led to the identification of METTL3, the catalytic subunit of the N6-adenosine-methyltransferase complex, as a promoter of cancer metastasis. METTL3 expression was upregulated in ESCC tumors and metastatic tissues. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicated that METTL3 increased m6A in EGR1 mRNA and enhanced its stability in a YTHDF3-dependent manner, activating EGR1/Snail signaling. Investigation into regulation of METTL3 expression found that KAT2A increased H3K27 acetylation levels in the METTL3 promoter region and activated transcription of METTL3 while SIRT2 exerted the opposite effects. Molecular docking and computational screening in a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compound library consisting of 1,443 small molecules identified compounds targeting METTL3 to suppress cancer metastasis. Elvitegravir, originally developed to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, suppressed metastasis by directly targeting METTL3 and enhancing its STUB1-mediated proteasomal degradation. Overall, RNA m6A modifications are important in cancer metastasis, and targeting METTL3 with elvitegravir has therapeutic potential for treating ESCC."

DNA methylation has been suggested as a potential underlying mechanism linking environmental exposures such as micronutrient status during pregnancy with offspring health. We performed a meta-analysis on the association of maternal early-pregnancy serum ferritin concentrations, as a marker of body iron stores, and cord blood DNA methylation. We included 1286 mother-newborn pairs from two population-based prospective cohorts. Serum ferritin concentrations were measured in early pregnancy. DNA methylation was measured with the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina). We examined epigenome-wide associations of maternal early-pregnancy serum ferritin and cord blood DNA methylation using robust linear regression analyses, with adjustment for confounders and performed fixed-effects meta-analyses. We additionally examined whether associations of any CpGs identified in cord blood persisted in the peripheral blood of older children and explored associations with other markers of maternal iron status. We also examined whether similar findings were present in the association of cord blood serum ferritin concentrations with cord blood DNA methylation.Maternal early-pregnancy serum ferritin concentrations were inversely associated with DNA methylation at two CpGs (cg02806645 and cg06322988) in PRR23A and one CpG (cg04468817) in PRSS22. Associations at two of these CpG sites persisted at each of the follow-up time points in childhood. Cord blood serum ferritin concentrations were not associated with cord blood DNA methylation levels at the three identified CpGs.Maternal early-pregnancy serum ferritin concentrations were associated with lower cord blood DNA methylation levels at three CpGs and these associations partly persisted in older children. Further studies are needed to uncover the role of these CpGs in the underlying mechanisms of the associations of maternal iron status and offspring health outcomes.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35505216","Predicting Chronological Age from DNA Methylation Data: A Machine Learning Approach for Small Datasets and Limited Predictors.","Methods Mol Biol","Recent research studies using epigenetic data have been exploring whether it is possible to estimate how old someone is using only their DNA. This application stems from the strong correlation that has been observed in humans between the methylation status of certain DNA loci and chronological age. While genome-wide methylation sequencing has been the most prominent approach in epigenetics research, recent studies have shown that targeted sequencing of a limited number of loci can be successfully used for the estimation of chronological age from DNA samples, even when using small datasets. Following this shift, the need to investigate further into the appropriate statistics behind the predictive models used for DNA methylation-based prediction has been identified in multiple studies. This chapter will look into an example of basic data manipulation and modeling that can be applied to small DNA methylation datasets (100-400 samples) produced through targeted methylation sequencing for a small number of predictors (10-25 methylation sites). Data manipulation will focus on converting the obtained methylation values for the different predictors to a statistically meaningful dataset, followed by a basic introduction into importing such datasets in R, as well as randomizing and splitting into appropriate training and test sets for modeling. Finally, a basic introduction to R modeling will be outlined, starting with feature selection algorithms and continuing with a simple modeling example (linear model) as well as a more complex algorithm (Support Vector Machine).© 2022.

"35505215","BCurve: Bayesian Curve Credible Bands Approach for the Detection of Differentially Methylated Regions.","Methods Mol Biol","High-throughput assays have been developed to measure DNA methylation, among which bisulfite-based sequencing (BS-seq) and microarray technologies are the most popular for genome-wide profiling. A major goal in DNA methylation analysis is the detection of differentially methylated genomic regions under two different conditions. To accomplish this, many state-of-the-art methods have been proposed in the past few years; only a handful of these methods are capable of analyzing both types of data (BS-seq and microarray), though. On the other hand, covariates, such as sex and age, are known to be potentially influential on DNA methylation; and thus, it would be important to adjust for their effects on differential methylation analysis. In this chapter, we describe a Bayesian curve credible bands approach and the accompanying software, BCurve, for detecting differentially methylated regions for data generated from either microarray or BS-Seq. The unified theme underlying the analysis of these two different types of data is the model that accounts for correlation between DNA methylation in nearby sites, covariates, and between-sample variability. The BCurve R software package also provides tools for simulating both microarray and BS-seq data, which can be useful for facilitating comparisons of methods given the known ""gold standard"" in the simulated data. We provide detailed description of the main functions in BCurve and demonstrate the utility of the package for analyzing data from both platforms using simulated data from the functions provided in the package. Analyses of two real datasets, one from BS-seq and one from microarray, are also furnished to further illustrate the capability of BCurve.© 2022.

"35505213","DNA Methylation Imputation Across Platforms.","Methods Mol Biol","In this chapter, we will provide a review on imputation in the context of DNA methylation, specifically focusing on a penalized functional regression (PFR) method we have previously developed. We will start with a brief review of DNA methylation, genomic and epigenomic contexts where imputation has proven beneficial in practice, and statistical or computational methods proposed for DNA methylation in the recent literature (Subheading 1). The rest of the chapter (Subheadings 2-4) will provide a detailed review of our PFR method proposed for across-platform imputation, which incorporates nonlocal information using a penalized functional regression framework. Subheading 2 introduces commonly employed technologies for DNA methylation measurement and describes the real dataset we have used in the development of our method: the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Subheading 3 comprehensively reviews our method, encompassing data harmonization prior to model building, the actual building of penalized functional regression model, post-imputation quality filter, and imputation quality assessment. Subheading 4 shows the performance of our method in both simulation and the TCGA AML dataset, demonstrating that our penalized functional regression model is a valuable across-platform imputation tool for DNA methylation data, particularly because of its ability to boost statistical power for subsequent epigenome-wide association study. Finally, Subheading 5 provides future perspectives on imputation for DNA methylation data.© 2022. Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

With new advances in technique, epigenome-wide DNA methylation data (EWAS) have become the new standard for epigenetic studies in human populations. However, to date most epigenetic studies of mediation effects only involve selected (gene-specific) candidate methylation markers. There is an urgent need for appropriate analytical methods for EWAS mediation analysis.

In this chapter, we introduce a multiple testing procedure that weights each hypothesis based on the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), a measure of ""noisiness"" of CpG methylation measurement, to increase the power of epigenome-wide association testing. Compared to the traditional multiple testing procedure on a filtered CpG set, the proposed procedure circumvents the difficulty to determine the optimal ICC cutoff value and is overall more powerful. We illustrate the procedure and compare the power to classical multiple testing procedures using an example data.© 2022. Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that genetic variations only account for a small proportion of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated type I hypersensitivity. Recently, epigenetics has gained attention as an approach to further understand the missing heritability and underpinning mechanisms of allergic diseases. Furthermore, epigenetic regulation allows the evaluation of the interaction between an individual's genetic predisposition and their environmental exposures.

Any difference in the measurement of DNA methylation, such as laboratory operation and sequencing platform, may lead to batch effects. With the accumulation of large-scale omics data, scientists are making joint efforts to generate and analyze omics data to answer various scientific questions. However, batch effects are inevitable in practice, and careful adjustment is needed. Multiple statistical methods for controlling bias and inflation between batches have been developed either by correcting based on known batch factors or by estimating directly from the output data.

Despite this progress, it remains a major challenge in EWAS to detect both cell type-specific and cell type confounding effects impacting study results. One way to identify these effects is through eFORGE (experimentally derived Functional element Overlap analysis of ReGions from EWAS), a published tool that uses 815 datasets from large-scale mapping studies to detect enriched tissues, cell types, and genomic regions. Here, I show that eFORGE analysis can be extended to EWAS differentially variable positions (DVPs), identifying target cell types and tissues. In addition, I also show that eFORGE tissue-specific enrichment can be detected for sites below EWAS significance threshold. I develop on these and other analysis examples, extending our knowledge of eFORGE cell type- and tissue-specific enrichment results for different EWAS.© 2022.

"35505205","Accurate Measurement of DNA Methylation: Challenges and Bias Correction.","Methods Mol Biol","DNA methylation is a key epigenetic modification involved in gene regulation whose contribution to disease susceptibility is still not fully understood. As the cost of genome sequencing technologies continues to drop, it will soon become commonplace to perform genome-wide quantification of DNA methylation at a single base-pair resolution. However, the demand for its accurate quantification might vary across studies. When the scope of the analysis is to detect regions of the genome with different methylation patterns between two or more conditions, e.g., case vs control; treatments vs placebo, accuracy is not crucial. This is the case in epigenome-wide association studies used as genome-wide screening of methylation changes to detect new candidate genes and regions associated with a specific disease or condition. If the aim of the analysis is to use DNA methylation measurements as a biomarker for diseases diagnosis and treatment (Laird, Nat Rev Cancer 3:253-266, 2003; Bock, Epigenomics 1:99-110, 2009), it is instead recommended to produce accurate methylation measurements. Furthermore, if the objective is the detection of DNA methylation in subclonal tumor cell populations or in circulating tumor DNA or in any case of mosaicism, the importance of accuracy becomes critical. The aim of this chapter is to describe the factors that could affect the precise measurement of methylation levels and a recent Bayesian statistical method called MethylCal and its extension that have been proposed to minimize this problem.© 2022.

In this chapter, we will discuss the use of intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for assessing technical variations induced by methylation arrays at single-CpG level. ICC compares variation of methylation levels within- and between-replicate measurements, ranging between 0 and 1. We further characterize the distribution of ICCs using a mixture of truncated normal and normal distributions, and cluster CpG sites on the arrays into low- and high-reliability groups.

"35505060","Epigenetics and ADHD.","Curr Top Behav Neurosci","There is robust evidence of genetic susceptibility to Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); however, there still remains significant variability that is not attributable to genetic factors. The emerging field of epigenetics is beginning to reveal how genotypic expression can be mediated by an array of variables including external environmental exposure, inter-individual developmental variation, and by the genome itself. Epigenetic modification plays a central role in neurobiological and developmental processes, and disturbances to these processes can have implications for a range of mental health problems. Although the field is still in its early days, this chapter will discuss the current standing of epigenetic research into ADHD. Firstly, key relevant epigenetic processes will be discussed. This will be followed by an overview of the key findings to date investigating the role of epigenetics in ADHD. Human studies have included the theory-driven approach of candidate-gene studies (CGS), as well as the increasingly popular exploratory approach of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Overall, the findings are heterogeneous. However, it is possible that with more longitudinal studies and better characterised cohorts, both predictive and protective links between epigenetic processes and ADHD will be revealed.© 2022.

"35504910","DNA methylation signature of chronic low-grade inflammation and its role in cardio-respiratory diseases.","Nat Commun","We performed a multi-ethnic Epigenome Wide Association study on 22,774 individuals to describe the DNA methylation signature of chronic low-grade inflammation as measured by C-Reactive protein (CRP). We find 1,511 independent differentially methylated loci associated with CRP. These CpG sites show correlation structures across chromosomes, and are primarily situated in euchromatin, depleted in CpG islands. These genomic loci are predominantly situated in transcription factor binding sites and genomic enhancer regions. Mendelian randomization analysis suggests altered CpG methylation is a consequence of increased blood CRP levels. Mediation analysis reveals obesity and smoking as important underlying driving factors for changed CpG methylation. Finally, we find that an activated CpG signature significantly increases the risk for cardiometabolic diseases and COPD.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35501460","RNA bisulfite sequencing reveals NSUN2-mediated suppression of epithelial differentiation in pancreatic cancer.","Oncogene","Posttranscriptional modifications in RNA have been considered to contribute to disease pathogenesis and tumor progression. NOL1/NOP2/Sun domain family member 2 (NSUN2) is an RNA methyltransferase that promotes tumor progression in several cancers. Pancreatic cancer relapse inevitably occurs even in cases where primary tumors have been successfully treated. Associations of cancer progression due to reprogramming of the cancer methyl-metabolome and the cancer genome have been noted, but the effect of base modifications, namely 5-methylcytosine (m5C), in the transcriptome remains unclear. Aberrant regulation of 5-methylcytosine turnover in cancer may affect posttranscriptional modifications in coding and noncoding RNAs in disease pathogenesis. Mutations in NSUN2 have been reported as drivers of neurodevelopmental disorders in mice, and upregulated expression of NSUN2 in tumors of the breast, bladder, and pancreas has been reported. In this study, we conducted mRNA whole transcriptomic bisulfite sequencing to categorize NSUN2 target sites in the mRNA of human pancreatic cancer cells. We identified a total of 2829 frequent m5C sites in mRNA from pancreatic cancer cells. A total of 90.9% (2572/2829) of these m5C sites were mapped to annotated genes in autosomes and sex chromosomes X and Y. Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed that the NSUN2 expression was significantly upregulated in cancer lesions in the LSL-KrasG12D/+;Trp53fl/fl;Pdx1-Cre (KPC) spontaneous pancreatic cancer mouse model induced by Pdx1-driven Cre/lox system expressing mutant KrasG12Dand p53 deletion. The in vitro phenotypic analysis of NSUN2 knockdown showed mild effects on pancreatic cancer cell 2D/3D growth, morphology and gemcitabine sensitivity in the early phase of tumorigenesis, but cumulative changes after multiple cell doubling passages over time were required for these mutations to accumulate. Syngeneic transplantation of NSUN2-knockdown KPC cells via subcutaneous injection showed decreased stromal fibrosis and restored differentiation of ductal epithelium in vivo. SIGNIFICANCE: Transcriptome-wide mRNA bisulfite sequencing identified candidate m5C sites of mRNAs in human pancreatic cancer cells. NSUN2-mediated m5C mRNA metabolism was observed in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. NSUN2 regulates cancer progression and epithelial differentiation via mRNA methylation.© 2022.

"35501337","Epigenome erosion and SOX10 drive neural crest phenotypic mimicry in triple-negative breast cancer.","NPJ Breast Cancer","Intratumoral heterogeneity is caused by genomic instability and phenotypic plasticity, but how these features co-evolve remains unclear. SOX10 is a neural crest stem cell (NCSC) specifier and candidate mediator of phenotypic plasticity in cancer. We investigated its relevance in breast cancer by immunophenotyping 21 normal breast and 1860 tumour samples. Nuclear SOX10 was detected in normal mammary luminal progenitor cells, the histogenic origin of most TNBCs. In tumours, nuclear SOX10 was almost exclusive to TNBC, and predicted poorer outcome amongst cross-sectional (p = 0.0015, hazard ratio 2.02, n = 224) and metaplastic (p = 0.04, n = 66) cases. To understand SOX10's influence over the transcriptome during the transition from normal to malignant states, we performed a systems-level analysis of co-expression data, de-noising the networks with an eigen-decomposition method. This identified a core module in SOX10's normal mammary epithelial network that becomes rewired to NCSC genes in TNBC. Crucially, this reprogramming was proportional to genome-wide promoter methylation loss, particularly at lineage-specifying CpG-island shores. We propose that the progressive, genome-wide methylation loss in TNBC simulates more primitive epigenome architecture, making cells vulnerable to SOX10-driven reprogramming. This study demonstrates potential utility for SOX10 as a prognostic biomarker in TNBC and provides new insights about developmental phenotypic mimicry-a major contributor to intratumoral heterogeneity.© 2022.

"35501330","Placental multi-omics integration identifies candidate functional genes for birthweight.","Nat Commun","Abnormal birthweight is associated with increased risk for cardiometabolic diseases in later life. Although the placenta is critical to fetal development and later life health, it has not been integrated into largescale functional genomics initiatives, and mechanisms of birthweight-associated variants identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS) are unclear. The goal of this study is to provide functional mechanistic insight into the causal pathway from a genetic variant to birthweight by integrating placental methylation and gene expression with established GWAS loci for birthweight. We identify placental DNA methylation and gene expression targets for several birthweight GWAS loci. The target genes are broadly enriched in cardiometabolic, immune response, and hormonal pathways. We find that methylation causally influences WNT3A, CTDNEP1, and RANBP2 expression in placenta. Multi-trait colocalization identifies PLEKHA1, FES, CTDNEP1, and PRMT7 as likely functional effector genes. These findings reveal candidate functional pathways that underpin the genetic regulation of birthweight via placental epigenetic and transcriptomic mechanisms.

Studies have suggested that CT may affect brain plasticity through epigenetic mechanisms and contribute to developing various psychiatric disorders. We performed a blood-based epigenome-wide association study using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-short form in 602 patients with a current severe mental illness, investigating DNA methylation association separately for five trauma subtypes and the total trauma score. The median trauma score was set as the predefined cutoff for determining whether the trauma was present or not. Additionally, we compared our genome-wide results with methylation probes annotated to candidate genes previously associated with CT. Of the patients, 83.2% reported CT above the cutoff in one or more trauma subtypes, and emotional neglect was the trauma subtype most frequently reported. We identified one significant differently methylated position associated with the gene TANGO6 for physical neglect. Seventeen differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were associated with different trauma categories. Several of these DMRs were annotated to genes previously associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive impairments. Our results support a biomolecular association between CT and severe mental disorders. Genes that were previously identified as differentially methylated in CT-exposed subjects with and without psychosis did not show methylation differences in our analysis. We discuss this inconsistency, the relevance of our findings, and the limitations of our study.© 2022. The Author(s)."

ICS response was measured using two definitions in asthmatics on ICS treatment: (1) absence of oral corticosteroid (OCS) bursts using prescription records and (2) absence of asthma-related exacerbations using diagnosis codes. A fixed-effect meta-analysis was performed for each outcome. The validated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were functionally annotated to standard databases.In 5710 subjects in GERA, 676 subjects in MGB Biobank, and 465 subjects in the Rotterdam Study, four novel SNPs on chromosome six nearPTCHD4validated across all cohorts and met genome-wide significance on meta-analysis for the OCS burst outcome. In 4541 subjects in GERA and 505 subjects in MGB Biobank, 152 SNPs with p<5 × 10-5were validated across these two cohorts for the asthma-related exacerbation outcome. The validated SNPs included methylation and expression quantitative trait loci forCPED1,CRADDandDSTfor the OCS burst outcome andGM2A,SNW1,CACNA1C,DPH1, andRPS10for the asthma-related exacerbation outcome.Multiple novel SNPs associated with ICS response were identified in older adult asthmatics.

We used geocoded participant address-specific mean ambient carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO2; NOx), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations estimated over the 2-, 7-, 28-, and 365-day periods before collection of blood samples used to generate Illumina 450 k array leukocyte DNAm measurements. We estimated methylome-wide, subpopulation- and race/ethnicity-stratified pollutant-DNAm associations in multi-level, linear mixed-effects models adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, meteorological, and technical covariates. We combined stratum-specific estimates in inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses and characterized significant associations (false discovery rate; FDR<0.05) at Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites without among-strata heterogeneity (PCochran's Q > 0.05). We attempted replication in the Cooperative Health Research in Region of Augsburg (KORA) study and Normative Aging Study (NAS). We observed a -0.3 (95% CI: -0.4, -0.2) unit decrease in percent DNAm per interquartile range (IQR, 7.3 ppb) increase in 28-day mean NO2concentration at cg01885635 (chromosome 3; regulatory region 290 bp upstream from ZNF621; FDR = 0.03). At intragenic sites cg21849932 (chromosome 20; LIME1; intron 3) and cg05353869 (chromosome 11; KLHL35; exon 2), we observed a -0.3 (95% CI: -0.4, -0.2) unit decrease (FDR = 0.04) and a 1.2 (95% CI: 0.7, 1.7) unit increase (FDR = 0.04), respectively, in percent DNAm per IQR (17.6 ppb) increase in 7-day mean ozone concentration. Results were not fully replicated in KORA and NAS. We identified three CpG sites potentially susceptible to gaseous air pollution-induced DNAm changes near genes relevant for cardiovascular and lung disease.

"35498717","Long-Lasting Defence Priming by β-Aminobutyric Acid in Tomato Is Marked by Genome-Wide Changes in DNA Methylation.","Front Plant Sci","Exposure of plants to stress conditions or to certain chemical elicitors can establish a primed state, whereby responses to future stress encounters are enhanced. Stress priming can be long-lasting and likely involves epigenetic regulation of stress-responsive gene expression. However, the molecular events underlying priming are not well understood. Here, we characterise epigenetic changes in tomato plants primed for pathogen resistance by treatment with β-aminobutyric acid (BABA). We used whole genome bisulphite sequencing to construct tomato methylomes from control plants and plants treated with BABA at the seedling stage, and a parallel transcriptome analysis to identify genes primed for the response to inoculation by the fungal pathogen,Botrytis cinerea. Genomes of plants treated with BABA showed a significant reduction in global cytosine methylation, especially in CHH sequence contexts. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) revealed that CHH DMRs were almost exclusively hypomethylated and were enriched in gene promoters and in DNA transposons located in the chromosome arms. Genes overlapping CHH DMRs were enriched for a small number of stress response-related gene ontology terms. In addition, there was significant enrichment of DMRs in the promoters of genes that are differentially expressed in response to infection withB. cinerea. However, the majority of genes that demonstrated priming did not contain DMRs, and nor was the overall distribution of methylated cytosines in primed genes altered by BABA treatment. Hence, we conclude that whilst BABA treatment of tomato seedlings results in characteristic changes in genome-wide DNA methylation, CHH hypomethylation appears only to target a minority of genes showing primed responses to pathogen infection. Instead, methylation may confer priming viain-transregulation, acting at a distance from defence genes, and/or by targeting a smaller group of regulatory genes controlling stress responses.Copyright © 2022 Catoni, Alvarez-Venegas, Worrall, Holroyd, Barraza, Luna, Ton and Roberts."

Here, a novel methodology is proposed to investigate genome-wide regulatory mechanisms in cancer, as studied with the example of follicular Lymphoma (FL). In a first phase, a new machine-learning method is designed to identify Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs) by computing six attributes. In a second phase, an integrative data analysis method is developed to study regulatory mutations in FL, by considering differential methylation information together with DNA sequence variation, differential gene expression, 3D organization of genome (e.g., topologically associated domains), and enriched biological pathways. Resulting mutation block-gene pairs are further ranked to find out the significant ones. By this approach, BCL2 and BCL6 were identified as top-ranking FL-related genes with several mutation blocks and DMRs acting on their regulatory regions. Two additional genes, CDCA4 and CTSO, were also found in top rank with significant DNA sequence variation and differential methylation in neighboring areas, pointing towards their potential use as biomarkers for FL. This work combines both genomic and epigenomic information to investigate genome-wide gene regulatory mechanisms in cancer and contribute to devising novel treatment strategies.© 2022 The Authors."
"35490756","Human adaptation to arsenic in Bolivians living in the Andes.","Chemosphere","Humans living in the Andes Mountains have been historically exposed to arsenic from natural sources, including drinking water. Enzymatic methylation of arsenic allows it to be excreted more efficiently by the human body. Adaptation to high-arsenic environments via enhanced methylation and excretion of arsenic was first reported in indigenous women in the Argentinean Andes, but whether adaptation to arsenic is a general phenomenon across native populations from the Andes Mountains remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated whether adaptation to arsenic has occurred in the Bolivian Andes by studying indigenous groups who belong to the Aymara-Quechua and Uru ethnicities and have lived in the Bolivian Andes for generations. Our population genetics methods, including genome-wide selection scans based on linkage disequilibrium patterns and allele frequency differences, in combination with targeted and whole-genome sequencing and genotype-phenotype association analyses, detected signatures of positive selection near the gene encoding arsenite methyltransferase (AS3MT), the main arsenic methylating enzyme. This was among the strongest selection signals (top 0.5% signals via locus-specific branch length and extended haplotype homozygosity tests) at a genome-wide level in the Bolivian study groups. We found a large haplotype block of 676 kb in the AS3MT region and identified candidate functional variants for further analysis. Moreover, our analyses revealed associations between AS3MT variants and the fraction of mono-methylated arsenic in urine and showed that the Bolivian study groups had the highest frequency of alleles associated with more efficient arsenic metabolism reported so far. Our data support the idea that arsenic exposure has been a driver for human adaptation to tolerate arsenic through more efficient arsenic detoxification in different Andean populations.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

We sought to test whether DNAm signatures of lifestyle and biochemical factors were associated with MDD to reveal dynamic biomarkers of MDD risk that may be amenable to lifestyle interventions.Here, we calculated methylation scores (MS) at multiple p-value thresholds for lifestyle (BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, and educational attainment) and biochemical (high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and total cholesterol) factors in Generation Scotland (GS) (N=9,502) and in a replication cohort (ALSPACadults, N=565), using CpG sites reported in previous well-powered methylome-wide association studies. We also compared their predictive accuracy for MDD to a MDD MS in an independent GS sub-sample (N=4,432).Each trait MS was significantly associated with its corresponding phenotype in GS (βrange=0.089-1.457) and in ALSPAC (βrange=0.078-2.533). Each MS was also significantly associated with MDD before and after adjustment for its corresponding phenotype in GS (βrange=0.053-0.145). After accounting for relevant lifestyle factors, MS for educational attainment (β=0.094) and alcohol consumption (MSp-value<0.01-0.5; βrange=-0.069-0.083) remained significantly associated with MDD in GS. Smoking (AUC=0.569) and educational attainment (AUC=0.585) MSs could discriminate MDD from controls better than the MDD MS (AUC=0.553) in the independent GS sub-sample. Analyses implicating MDD did not replicate across ALSPAC, although the direction of effect was consistent for all traits when adjusting for the MS corresponding phenotypes.We showed that lifestyle and biochemical MS were associated with MDD before and after adjustment for their corresponding phenotypes (pnominal<0.05), but not when smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI were also included as covariates. MDD results did not replicate in the smaller, female-only independent ALSPAC cohort (NALSPAC=565; NGS=9,502), potentially due to demographic differences or low statistical power, but effect sizes were consistent with the direction reported in GS. DNAm scores for modifiable MDD risk factors may contribute to disease vulnerability and, in some cases, explain additional variance to their observed phenotypes.Wellcome Trust.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Given the subtlety of biological phenotypes in many EWAS, control for batch-effects should be a consideration.Using the batch-effect removal approaches in the ComBat and Harman software, we examined two in-house datasets and compared results with three large publicly available datasets, (1214 HumanMethylation450 and 1094 MethylationEPIC BeadChips in total), and find that despite various forms of preprocessing, some batch-effects persist. This residual batch-effect is associated with the day of processing, the individual glass slide and the position of the array on the slide. Consistently across all datasets, 4649 probes required high amounts of correction. To understand the impact of this set to EWAS studies, we explored the literature and found three instances where persistently batch-effect prone probes have been reported in abstracts as key sites of differential methylation. As well as batch-effect susceptible probes, we also discover a set of probes which are erroneously corrected. We provide batch-effect workflows for Infinium Methylation data and provide reference matrices of batch-effect prone and erroneously corrected features across the five datasets spanning regionally diverse populations and three commonly collected biosamples (blood, buccal and saliva).Batch-effects are ever present, even in high-quality data, and a strategy to deal with them should be part of experimental design, particularly for EWAS. Batch-effect removal tools are useful to reduce technical variance in Infinium Methylation data, but they need to be applied with care and make use of post hoc diagnostic measures.© 2022.

"35488087","Incorporating local ancestry improves identification of ancestry-associated methylation signatures and meQTLs in African Americans.","Commun Biol","Here we report three epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of DNA methylation on self-reported race, global genetic ancestry, and local genetic ancestry in admixed Americans from three sets of samples, including internal and external replications (Ntotal = 1224). Our EWAS on local ancestry (LA) identified the largest number of ancestry-associated DNA methylation sites and also featured the highest replication rate. Furthermore, by incorporating ancestry origins of genetic variations, we identified 36 methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) clumps for LA-associated CpGs that cannot be captured by a model that assumes identical genetic effects across ancestry origins. Lead SNPs at 152 meQTL clumps had significantly different genetic effects in the context of an African or European ancestry background. Local ancestry information enables superior capture of ancestry-associated methylation signatures and identification of ancestry-specific genetic effects on DNA methylation. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating local ancestry for EWAS in admixed samples from multi-ancestry cohorts.© 2022. The Author(s)."

ABCB1 mRNA levels in liver tissues and HepG2 cells were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. DNA methylation status in liver tissues and HepG2 cells was determined using Illumina 850 methylation chip sequencing technology and pyrosequencing. 5-Aza-2dC was used to reverse methylation in HepG2 cells. Intracellular tacrolimus concentrations were determined by liquid mass spectrometry.Genome-wide methylation sequencing and pyrosequencing analyses showed that the methylation levels of 3 ABCB1 CpG sites (cg12501229, cg00634941 and cg05496710) were significantly different between groups with different tacrolimus concentration/dose (C0/D) ratios. ABCB1 mRNA expression in donor livers was found to be positively correlated with tacrolimus C0/D ratio (R = .458, P < .05). After treatment with 5-Aza-2-Dc, the methylation levels of the ABCB1 CpG sites in HepG2 cells significantly decreased, and this was confirmed by pyrosequencing; there was also a significant increase in ABCB1 transcription, which induced a decrease in intracellular tacrolimus concentrations.ABCB1 CpG site methylation affects tacrolimus metabolism in humans by regulating ABCB1 expression. Therefore, ABCB1 DNA methylation in donor livers might be an important epigenetic factor that affects tacrolimus blood concentrations following liver transplantation.© 2022 British Pharmacological Society."
"35487468","A review of practical statistical methods used in epidemiological studies to estimate the health effects of multi-pollutant mixture.","Environ Pollut","Environmental risk factors have been implicated in adverse health effects. Previous epidemiological studies on environmental risk factors mainly analyzed the impact of single pollutant exposure on health, while in fact, humans are constantly exposed to a complex mixture consisted of multiple pollutants/chemicals. In recent years, environmental epidemiologists have sought to assess adverse health effects of exposure to multi-pollutant mixtures based on the diversity of real-world environmental pollutants. However, the statistical challenges are considerable, for instance, multicollinearity and interaction among components of the mixture complicate the statistical analysis. There is currently no consensus on appropriate statistical methods. Here we summarized the practical statistical methods used in environmental epidemiology to estimate health effects of exposure to multi-pollutant mixture, such as Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), weighted quantile sum (WQS) regressions, shrinkage methods (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, elastic network model, adaptive elastic-net model, and principal component analysis), environment-wide association study (EWAS), etc. We sought to review these statistical methods and determine the application conditions, strengths, weaknesses, and result interpretability of each method, providing crucial insight and assistance for addressing epidemiological statistical issues regarding health effects from multi-pollutant mixture.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Reliable biomarkers allowing early identification of tumor progression are missing.To explore DNA methylation patterns associated with tumor progression in NFPA patients.Case-controlled exploratory trial.University Hospital.Patients operated for NFPA with immunohistochemical characteristics of a gonadotropinoma were studied. Cases included patients requiring reintervention due to tumor progression (reintervention group, n = 26) and controls who had a post-operative residual tumor without tumor progression for at least 5 years (radiologically stable group, n = 17).None.Genome-wide methylation data from each tumor sample using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip platform.The analysis showed that 605 CpG positions were significantly differently methylated (differently methylated positions, DMPs) between the patient groups (false discovery rate adjusted P-value <0.05, beta value >0.2), mapping to 389 genes. The largest number of DMPs were detected in the genes NUP93 and LGALS1. The three hypomethylated DMPs and the three hypermethylated DMPs with the lowest P-values were all significantly (P < 0.05) and individually associated with reintervention-free survival. One of the hypermethylated DMPs with the lowest P-value was located in the gene GABRA1.In this exploratory study, DNA methylation patterns in NFPA patients were associated with postoperative tumor progression requiring reintervention. The DMPs included genes that have been previously associated with tumor development.

While advances in neonatal care have improved survival rates of premature infants, cases of BPD have been increasing with limited therapeutic options for prevention and treatment. This study was designed to explore the relationship between gestational age (GA), birth weight, and estimated blood cell-type composition in premature infants and to elucidate early epigenetic biomarkers associated with BPD.Cord blood DNA from preterm neonates that went on to develop BPD (n = 14) or not (non-BPD, n = 93) was applied to Illumina 450 K methylation arrays. Blood cell-type compositions were estimated using DNA methylation profiles. Multivariable robust regression analysis elucidated CpGs associated with BPD risk. cDNA microarray analysis of cord blood RNA identified differentially expressed genes in neonates who later developed BPD.The development of BPD and the need for oxygen supplementation were strongly associated with GA (BPD, p < 1.0E-04; O2supplementation, p < 1.0E-09) and birth weight (BPD, p < 1.0E-02; O2supplementation, p < 1.0E-07). The estimated nucleated red blood cell (NRBC) percent was negatively associated with birth weight and GA, positively associated with hypomethylation of the tobacco smoke exposure biomarker cg05575921, and high-NRBC blood samples displayed a hypomethylation profile. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) identified 38 (Bonferroni) and 275 (false discovery rate 1%) differentially methylated CpGs associated with BPD. BPD-associated CpGs in cord blood were enriched for lung maturation and hematopoiesis pathways. Stochastic epigenetic mutation burden at birth was significantly elevated among those who developed BPD (adjusted p = 0.02). Transcriptome changes in cord blood cells reflected cell cycle, development, and pulmonary disorder events in BPD.While results must be interpreted with caution because of the small size of this study, NRBC content strongly impacted DNA methylation profiles in preterm cord blood and EWAS analysis revealed potential insights into biological pathways involved in BPD pathogenesis.© 2022.

DNA methylation is a form of epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression. Few studies have analyzed the relationship between genome-wide methylation patterns and antipsychotic dosage. The primary aim of this pilot study was to investigate the association between antipsychotic dosage and genome-wide DNA methylation in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ).Current dosage of antipsychotic medications was assessed in 136 patients with SCZ. Dosage was standardized using three different methods: chlorpromazine equivalent dose (CPZe), defined daily dose (DDD), and percentage of Lexicomp maximum dose (PM%). DNA methylation was measured in white blood cells. Antipsychotic dosage was the primary outcome variable in a model, including genome-wide methylation status as the main predictor.This study did not show any association between DNA methylation and dosage variation for CPZe, PM%, and DDD. However, the probe cg271403389 was consistently associated with antipsychotic dosage across the three standardization methods. When looking at the genomic location of the most significant probes, we found that 15% were intergenic, 23% were in the distal promoter, 9% in the 3'untranslated region, 32% in the gene body, 3% in the 5' untranslated region, 15% in the proximal promoter, and 3% in the first exon.This study shows the importance of investigating the relationship between DNA methylation and optimal antipsychotic dosage to personalize treatment in SCZ. Future studies require larger prescription databases to build on the results of this analysis.Thieme. All rights reserved."
"35483741","Noncanonical imprinting sustains embryonic development and restrains placental overgrowth.","Genes Dev","Genomic imprinting regulates parental origin-dependent monoallelic gene expression. It is mediated by either germline differential methylation of DNA (canonical imprinting) or oocyte-derived H3K27me3 (noncanonical imprinting) in mice. Depletion of Eed, an essential component of Polycomb repressive complex 2, results in genome-wide loss of H3K27me3 in oocytes, which causes loss of noncanonical imprinting (LOI) in embryos. AlthoughEedmaternal KO (matKO) embryos show partial lethality after implantation, it is unknown whether LOI itself contributes to the developmental phenotypes of these embryos, which makes it unclear whether noncanonical imprinting is developmentally relevant. Here, by combinatorial matKO ofXist, a noncanonical imprinted gene whose LOI causes aberrant transient maternal X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) at preimplantation, we show that prevention of the transient maternal XCI greatly restores the development ofEedmatKO embryos. Moreover, we found that the placentae ofEedmatKO embryos are remarkably enlarged in a manner independent ofXistLOI. Heterozygous deletion screening of individual autosomal noncanonical imprinted genes suggests that LOI of theSfmbt2miRNA cluster chromosome 2 miRNA cluster (C2MC), solute carrier family 38 member 4 (Slc38a4), andGm32885contributes to the placental enlargement.

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) as a kind of abundant epitranscriptomic modification in eukaryotes, plays important roles in regulation of gene expression for various physiological functions. Our previous study demonstrated that sea cucumber lncRNAs were differentially expressed during bacterial infection. However, whether the post-transcriptional regulation of lncRNAs influenced by m6A modification in sea cucumbers with different stages of skin ulceration syndrome (SUS) are largely unknown. Here, we generated the genome-wide map of m6A lncRNAs in SUS-diseased and SUS-resistant sea cucumbers for the first time, revealed that m6A levels in lncRNAs were mainly upregulated in SUS-resistant group. Intriguingly, most of the m6A lncRNAs showed a positive correlation between the expression levels and m6A levels based on conjoint analysis, suggesting that m6A modification on a lncRNA may contribute to its RNA stability. Furthermore, the host genes of lncRNAs with dysregulated m6A peaks were enriched in immune pathway. More importantly, methyltransferase METTL3 was required for m6A methylation modification and played positive roles in lncRNA expression. Collectively, this study presents the comprehensive characters of m6A lncRNAs in marine invertebrate. These m6A modified lncRNAs may be served as potential regulators associated with SUS and provide a promising avenue for disease therapy through targeting METTL3.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to identify novel methylation changes in ischemic stroke.Methods:We carried out an epigenome-wide study of ischemic stroke using an Infinium HumanMethylation 850K array (cases:controls = 4:4). 10 CpG sites in 8 candidate genes from gene ontology analytics top-ranked pathway were selected to validate 850K BeadChip results (cases:controls = 20:20). We further qualified the methylation level of promoter regions in 8 candidate genes (cases:controls = 188:188). Besides, we performed subgroup analysis, dose-response relationship and diagnostic prediction polygenic model of candidate genes.Results:In the discovery stage, we found 462 functional DNA methylation positions to be associated with ischemic stroke. Gene ontology analysis highlighted the ""calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion via plasma membrane cell adhesion molecules"" item, including 8 candidate genes (CDH2/PCDHB10/PCDHB11/PCDHB14/PCDHB16/PCDHB3/PCDHB6/PCDHB9). In the replication stage, we identified 5 differentially methylated loci in 20 paired samples and 7 differentially methylated genes (CDH2/PCDHB10/PCDHB11/PCDHB14/PCDHB16/PCDHB3/PCDHB9) in 188 paired samples. Subgroup analysis showed that the methylation level of above 7 genes remained significantly different in the male subgroup, large-artery atherosclerosis subgroup and right hemisphere subgroup. The methylation level of each gene was grouped into quartiles, and Q4 groups of the 7 genes were associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke than Q1 groups (p< 0.05). Besides, the polygenic model showed high diagnostic specificity (0.8723), sensitivity (0.883), and accuracy (0.8777).Conclusion:Our results demonstrate that DNA methylation plays a crucial part in ischemic stroke. The methylation of these 7 genes may be potential diagnostic biomarker for ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2022 Sun, Xu, Hu, Liu, Zhai, Sun, Sun, Li, Wang, Feng, Tang and Zhao."
"35478952","History of Wrist Arthroscopy.","J Wrist Surg","Wrist arthroscopy has a rich history, drawing on contributions from around the world. Its foundation was laid in Japan with Kenji Takagi and Masaki Watanabe, who developed the arthroscope and the techniques for arthroscopy. Across several decades they advanced the optic and lighting technology, allowing the miniaturization which made wrist arthroscopy technologically feasible. A safe and standardized technique for wrist arthroscopy was evolved by Terry Whipple, Gary Poehling, and James Roth in the 1980s, and they shared this with their fellow surgeons through courses and publications. The techniques then spread across the world, leading to widespread uptake and exploration of new therapeutic possibilities. The worldwide spread of wrist arthroscopy was accelerated by the European Wrist Arthroscopy Society (EWAS), founded in 2005 by Christophe Mathoulin. The Asia Pacific Wrist Association (APWA), founded by PC Ho in 2015, also extended the progression of wrist arthroscopy. This article brings together this history and tells the global story of its development through the recollections of those involved. The manuscript includes some amazing videos of the early historical arthroscopy. There are also videos of Gary and Terry describing some of their special memories of the early politics, developments, and evolution of wrist arthroscopy.Thieme. All rights reserved."
"35477560","Effects of stressful life-events on DNA methylation in panic disorder and major depressive disorder.","Clin Epigenetics","Panic disorder (PD) is characterized by recurrent panic attacks and higher affection of women as compared to men. The lifetime prevalence of PD is about 2-3% in the general population leading to tremendous distress and disability. Etiologically, genetic and environmental factors, such as stress, contribute to the onset and relapse of PD. In the present study, we investigated epigenome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) in respond to a cumulative, stress-weighted life events score (wLE) in patients with PD and its boundary to major depressive disorder (MDD), frequently co-occurring with symptoms of PD.DNAm was assessed by the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. In a meta-analytic approach, epigenome-wide DNAm changes in association with wLE were first analyzed in two PD cohorts (with a total sample size of 183 PD patients and 85 healthy controls) and lastly in 102 patients with MDD to identify possible overlapping and opposing effects of wLE on DNAm. Additionally, analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was conducted to identify regional clusters of association.Two CpG-sites presented with p-values below 1 × 10-05in PD: cg09738429 (p = 6.40 × 10-06, located in an intergenic shore region in next proximity of PYROXD1) and cg03341655 (p = 8.14 × 10-06, located in the exonic region of GFOD2). The association of DNAm at cg03341655 and wLE could be replicated in the independent MDD case sample indicating a diagnosis independent effect. Genes mapping to the top hits were significantly upregulated in brain and top hits have been implicated in the metabolic system. Additionally, two significant DMRs were identified for PD only on chromosome 10 and 18, including CpG-sites which have been reported to be associated with anxiety and other psychiatric phenotypes.This first DNAm analysis in PD reveals first evidence of small but significant DNAm changes in PD in association with cumulative stress-weighted life events. Most of the top associated CpG-sites are located in genes implicated in metabolic processes supporting the hypothesis that environmental stress contributes to health damaging changes by affecting a broad spectrum of systems in the body.© 2022.

Bulls used for artificial insemination represent a relevant model in this field, as the broad dissemination of bull semen considerably alleviates confounding factors and enables the precise assessment of male fertility. This study was therefore designed to assess the potential for sperm DNA methylation to predict bull fertility.A unique collection of 100 sperm samples was constituted by pooling 2-5 ejaculates per bull from 100 Montbéliarde bulls of comparable ages, assessed as fertile (n = 57) or subfertile (n = 43) based on non-return rates 56 days after insemination. The DNA methylation profiles of these samples were obtained using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. After excluding putative sequence polymorphisms, 490 fertility-related differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) were identified, most of which were hypermethylated in subfertile bulls. Interestingly, 46 genes targeted by DMCs are involved in embryonic and fetal development, sperm function and maturation, or have been related to fertility in genome-wide association studies; five of these were further analyzed by pyrosequencing. In order to evaluate the prognostic value of fertility-related DMCs, the sperm samples were split between training (n = 67) and testing (n = 33) sets. Using a Random Forest approach, a predictive model was built from the methylation values obtained on the training set. The predictive accuracy of this model was 72% on the testing set and 72% on individual ejaculates collected from an independent cohort of 20 bulls.This study, conducted on the largest set of bull sperm samples so far examined in epigenetic analyses, demonstrated that the sperm methylome is a valuable source of male fertility biomarkers. The next challenge is to combine these results with other data on the same sperm samples in order to improve the quality of the model and better understand the interplay between DNA methylation and other molecular features in the regulation of fertility. This research may have potential applications in human medicine, where infertility affects the interaction between a male and a female, thus making it difficult to isolate the male factor.© 2022.

We hypothesized DNA methylation may contribute to pathogenesis in radiation-induced heart fibrosis (RIHF) and altered DNA methylation patterns probably influenced the genes expression in RIHF. In present study, we found genome-wide differences in DNA methylation status and RNA expression were demonstrated and we screened out 44 genes whose altered expression maybe were regulated by CpG island methylation within the gene promoter in RIHF of Sprague-Dawley rat by employing gene expression arrays and human CpG island microarrays.

Experiment-derived enhancer-gene links are restricted to a small set of enhancers and/or cell types, while the accuracy of genome-wide approaches remains elusive due to the lack of a systematic evaluation. We combined multiple spatial and in silico approaches for defining enhancer locations and linking them to their target genes aggregated across >500 cell types, generating 1860 human genome-wide distal enhancer-to-target gene definitions (EnTDefs). To evaluate performance, we used gene set enrichment (GSE) testing on 87 independent ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets of 34 transcription factors (TFs) and assessed concordance of results with known TF Gene Ontology annotations, and other benchmarks.The top ranked 741 (40%) EnTDefs significantly outperform the common, naïve approach of linking distal regions to the nearest genes, and the top 10 EnTDefs perform well when applied to ChIP-seq data of other cell types. The GSE-based ranking of EnTDefs is highly concordant with ranking based on overlap with curated benchmarks of enhancer-gene interactions. Both our top general EnTDef and cell-type-specific EnTDefs significantly outperform seven independent computational and experiment-based enhancer-gene pair datasets. We show that using our top EnTDefs for GSE with either genome-wide DNA methylation or ATAC-seq data is able to better recapitulate the biological processes changed in gene expression data performed in parallel for the same experiment than our lower-ranked EnTDefs.Our findings illustrate the power of our approach to provide genome-wide interpretation regardless of cell type.© 2022.

"35472415","Atrazine exposure in zebrafish induces aberrant genome-wide methylation.","Neurotoxicol Teratol","Atrazine (ATZ) is the second most common agricultural herbicide used in the United States and is an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC). Developmental exposure to ATZ can lead to significant behavioral and morphological alterations in exposed animals and their progeny suggesting the involvement of an epigenetic mechanism. Specific epigenetic mechanisms responsible for these alterations, however, are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we exposed zebrafish embryos to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 ppb (μg/L) of ATZ from 1 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf). Chemical exposure was ceased and zebrafish maintained until 9 months post fertilization (mpf), when whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed to assess the effects of embryonic ATZ exposure on DNA methylation in female fish brains. The number of differentially methylated genes (DMGs) increased with increasing treatment concentration. DMGs were enriched in neurological pathways with extensive methylation changes consistently observed in neuroendocrine pathways. Specifically, DMGs with methylation changes in promoter regions showed hypomethylation in estrogen receptor signaling and hypermethylation in androgen signaling. DMGs with methylation changes in genebody were primarily enriched for mitochondrion-related pathways associated with healthy aging. Integrated analysis with transcriptomic data at 9 mpf exhibited a similar trend identifying CABLES1 and NDUFA4 as shared targets at all concentrations. We then compared the predicted upstream regulators of transcriptomic changes with DMGs and identified CALML3 as a common upstream regulator at both 0.3 and 30 ppb that exhibit significant methylation changes. Collectively, our study identified long-lasting DNA methylation changes in genome after embryonic ATZ exposure and elucidated potential gene targets whose aberrant methylation features may drive alterations in gene transcription in long-term.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

"35470009","Methylomic and transcriptomic characterization of postoperative systemic inflammatory dysregulation.","Transl Res","In this study, we define and validate a state of postoperative systemic inflammatory dysregulation (PSID) based on postoperative phenotypic extremes of plasma C-reactive protein concentration following major abdominal surgery. PSID manifested clinically with significantly higher rates of sepsis, complications, longer hospital stays and poorer short, and long-term outcomes. We hypothesized that PSID will be associated with, and potentially predicted by, altered patterns of genome-wide peripheral blood mononuclear cell differential DNA methylation and gene expression. We identified altered DNA methylation and differential gene expression in specific immune and metabolic pathways during PSID. Our findings suggest that dysregulation results in, or from, dramatic changes in differential DNA methylation and highlights potential targets for early detection and treatment. The combination of altered DNA methylation and gene expression suggests that dysregulation is mediated at multiple levels within specific gene sets and hence, nonspecific anti-inflammatory treatments such as corticosteroids alone are unlikely to represent an effective therapeutic strategy.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

"35466879","Maternal Metabolic Health, Lifestyle, and Environment - Understanding How Epigenetics Drives Future Offspring Health.","Curr Diabetes Rev","The incidence of metabolic disorders such as obesity and type two diabetes (T2DM) continues to increase worldwide, and their onset is often attributed to adherence to a western diet and a sedentary lifestyle. However, a large variability exists in one's likelihood of developing metabolic dysregulation, illustrating that our understanding of heritability patterns remains poorly understood. Diabetes and obesity are multifactorial diseases, and their onset is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies reported a number of alterations in the coding sequence associated with the onset of T2DM and obesity. However, these genes explain only a fraction of the cases, leaving the majority unaccounted for. The missing heritability question implies that other factors are responsible for the onset and development of the disease. Given that the developing fetus is susceptible to the maternal environment, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that maternal metabolic characteristics as well as disruptions to the prenatal environment may induce long-term genetic, phenotypic, and physiologic adaptations in the developing fetus, which could have a permanent effect on its future health. This phenomenon is known as developmental programming and is mediated through epigenetic modifications, which include modulation of gene expression that do not alter the original deoxyribonucleic (DNA) sequence. Epigenetic modifications are capable of changing gene expression in metabolism-related genes and are accomplished through DNA methylation, histone acetylation, and ribonucleic acid (RNA) mechanisms. In this review, we discuss maternal metabolic factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and gestational diabetes (GDM) that lead to epigenetic changes in the offspring and predispose future generations to metabolic abnormalities. We will also describe the association between maternal lifestyle factors and exposure to toxins with epigenetic modulations in the offspring. Lastly, we will provide a brief review of the possibility of using epigenetics as potential interventions and therapeutic modalities to help with early diagnosis and prevention of metabolic disorders.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net."
"35464396","Multi-Omics Integration Reveals Only Minor Long-Term Molecular and Functional Sequelae in Immune Cells of Individuals Recovered From COVID-19.","Front Immunol","The majority of COVID-19 patients experience mild to moderate disease course and recover within a few weeks. An increasing number of studies characterized the long-term changes in the specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses, but how COVID-19 shapes the innate and heterologous adaptive immune system after recovery is less well known. To comprehensively investigate the post-SARS-CoV-2 infection sequelae on the immune system, we performed a multi-omics study by integrating single-cell RNA-sequencing, single-cell ATAC-sequencing, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling, and functional validation experiments in 14 convalescent COVID-19 and 15 healthy individuals. We showed that immune responses generally recover without major sequelae after COVID-19. However, subtle differences persist at the transcriptomic level in monocytes, with downregulation of the interferon pathway, while DNA methylation also displays minor changes in convalescent COVID-19 individuals. However, these differences did not affect the cytokine production capacity of PBMCs upon different bacterial, viral, and fungal stimuli, although baseline release of IL-1Ra and IFN-γ was higher in convalescent individuals. In conclusion, we propose that despite minor differences in epigenetic and transcriptional programs, the immune system of convalescent COVID-19 patients largely recovers to the homeostatic level of healthy individuals.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Kilic, Li, Bulut, Gupta, Zhang, Qi, Peng, Tsay, Soon, Mekonnen, Ferreira, van der Made, van Cranenbroek, Koenen, Simonetti, Diavatopoulos, de Jonge, Müller, Schaal, Ostermann, Cornberg, Eiz-Vesper, van de Veerdonk, van Crevel, Joosten, Domínguez-Andrés, Xu, Netea and Li."
"35463757","Profiling Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Patterns in Human Aortic and Mitral Valves.","Front Cardiovasc Med","Cardiac valves exhibit highly complex structures and specialized functions that include dynamic interactions between cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and their hemodynamic environment. Valvular gene expression is tightly regulated by a variety of mechanisms including epigenetic factors such as histone modifications, RNA-based mechanisms and DNA methylation. To date, methylation fingerprints of non-diseased human aortic and mitral valves have not been studied. In this work we analyzed the differential methylation profiles of 12 non-diseased aortic and mitral valve tissue samples (in matched pairs). Analysis of methylation data [reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS)] of 16,101 promoters genome-wide revealed 584 differentially methylated (DM) promoters, of which 13 were reported in endothelial mesenchymal trans-differentiation (EMT), 37 in aortic and mitral valve disease and 7 in ECM remodeling. Both functional classification as well as network analysis showed that the genes associated with the DM promoters were enriched for WNT-, Cadherin-, Endothelin-, PDGF-, HIF-1 and VEGF- signaling implicated in valvular physiology and pathophysiology. Additional enrichment was detected for TGFB-, NOTCH- and Integrin- signaling involved in EMT as well as ECM remodeling. This data provides the first insight into differential regulation of human aortic and mitral valve tissue and identifies candidate genes linked to DM promoters. Our work will improve the understanding of valve biology, valve tissue engineering approaches and contributes to the identification of relevant drug targets.Copyright © 2022 Halawa, Latif, Tseng, Ibrahim, Chester, Moustafa, Aguib and Yacoub."

Here, we aimed to explore the regulation strategy ofM. micranthaseed development under cold stress through molecular physiology and multi-omics analysis. Significant increase of hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde, and electrolyte leakage observed under cold stress revealed that oxidative damage withinM. micranthaseed cells was induced in the initial germination phase. Proteomic data underscored an activation of antioxidant activity to maintain redox homeostasis, with a cluster of antioxidant proteins identified. Genomic-wide transcriptome, in combination with time-series whole-genome bisulfite sequencing mining, elucidated that seven candidate genes, which were the target of DNA demethylation-dependent ROS scavenging, were possibly associated with anM. micranthagerm break. Progressive gain of CHH context DNA methylation identified in an early germination phrase suggested a role of a DNA methylation pathway, while an active DNA demethylation pathway was also initiated during late seed development, which was in line with the expression trend of methylation and demethylation-related genes verified through qRT-PCR. These data pointed out that cold-dependent DNA demethylation and an antioxidant regulatory were involved together in restoring seed germination. The expression level of total 441 genes presented an opposite trend to the methylation divergence, while the expression of total 395 genes was proved to be negatively associated with their methylation levels. These data provided new insights into molecular reprograming events duringM. micranthaseed development.Copyright © 2022 Cui, Wang, Su and Wang."
"35462427","DNA hypomethylation is the plausible driver of heat stress adaptation in Linum usitatissimum.","Physiol Plant","Heat stress has a significant impact on the climatic adaptation of flax, a cool-season economic crop. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns are crucial for understanding how flax cultivars respond to heat adversities. It is worth noting that the DNA methylome in flax has yet to be investigated at the nucleotide level. Although heat stress above 40°C caused oxidative damage in flax leaves, 5-azacytidine, a hypomethylating agent, reduced this effect by 15-24%. Differences in the expression of the LuMET1 (DNA methyltransferase) gene suggested that DNA methylation/demethylation may play a major role in the flax heat stress response. Thus, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing-derived DNA methylation profiles in flax, with or without heat stress and 5-azaC, were developed and analysed here. In response to heat stress, a high percentage of significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs), particularly hypomethylated DMRs, were identified in the CHH nucleotide sequence context (H = A/T/C). Some of these DMRs overlapped with transposable element insertions. The majority of DMRs were discovered in intergenic regions, but several DMR loci were also found near genes relevant to heat stress response and epigenetic processes. These DMRs, in particular, are linked to CpG islands, implying a possible role in promoter methylation and gene silencing. The DMRs discovered in this study are crucial for understanding and identifying the key players in heat stress response in flax, which will help in developing climate-smart flax varieties.

However, the role of DYSF in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD) and the regulation mechanism of DYSF expression have not been fully studied. In this study, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) literatures were searched to find the DNA methylation-driven genes (including DYSF) of ASCVD. The hub genes related to DYSF were also identified through weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Regulation of DYSF expression through its promoter methylation status was verified using peripheral blood leucocytes (PBLs) from ASCVD patients and normal controls, and experiments on THP1 cells and Apoe-/-mice. Similarly, the expressions of DYSF related hub genes, mainly contained SELL, STAT3 and TMX1, were also validated. DYSF functions were then evaluated by phagocytosis, transwell and adhesion assays in DYSF knock-down and overexpressed THP1 cells. The results showed that DYSF promoter hypermethylation up-regulated its expression in clinical samples, THP1 cells and Apoe-/-mice, confirming DYSF as a DNA methylation-driven gene. The combination of DYSF expression and methylation status in PBLs had a considerable prediction value for ASCVD. Besides, DYSF could enhance the phagocytosis, migration and adhesion ability of THP1 cells. Among DYSF related hub genes, SELL was proven to be the downstream target of DYSF by wet experiments. In conclusion, DYSF promoter hypermethylation upregulated its expression and promoted monocytes activation, which further participated in the pathogenesis of ASCVD.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the identification of well over a hundred genetic variants and CpG sites that associate with T2D, a robust biosignature that could be used to prevent or forestall clinical disease has not been developed. Based on the premise that underlying genetic variation influences DNA methylation (DNAm) independently of or in combination with environmental exposures, we assessed the ability of local and distal gene x methylation (GxMeth) interactive effects to improve cg19693031 models for predicting T2D status in an African American cohort. Using genome-wide genetic data from 506 subjects, we identified a total of 1476 GxMeth terms associated with HbA1c values. The GxMeth SNPs map to biological pathways associated with the development and complications of T2D, with genetically contextual differences in methylation observed only in diabetic subjects for two GxMeth SNPs (rs2390998 AG vs. GG,p= 4.63 × 10-11, Δβ= 13%, effect size = 0.16 [95% CI = 0.05, 0.32]; rs1074390 AA vs. GG,p= 3.93 × 10-4, Δβ= 9%, effect size = 0.38 [95% CI = 0.12, 0.56]. Using a repeated stratified k-fold cross-validation approach, a series of balanced random forest classifiers with random under-sampling were built to evaluate the addition of GxMeth terms to cg19693031 models to discriminate between normoglycemic controls versus T2D subjects. The results were compared to those obtained from models incorporating only the covariates (age, sex and BMI) and the addition of cg19693031. We found a post-pruned classifier incorporating 10 GxMeth SNPs and cg19693031 adjusted for covariates predicted the T2D status, with the AUC, sensitivity, specificity and precision of the positive target class being 0.76, 0.81, 0.70 and 0.63, respectively. Comparatively, the AUC, sensitivity, specificity and precision using the covariates and cg19693031 were only 0.71, 0.74, 0.67 and 0.59, respectively. Collectively, we demonstrate correcting for genetic confounding of cg19693031 improves its ability to detect type 2 diabetes. We conclude that an integrated genetic-epigenetic approach could inform personalized medicine programming for more effective prevention and treatment of T2D."

(2) Methods: We investigated the similarity of DNAm signatures in matched blood and postmortem brain samples (n= 10). In addition, we performed EWASs in five brain regions belonging to the neurocircuitry of addiction: anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), Brodmann Area 9, caudate nucleus, putamen, and ventral striatum (n= 38-72). (3) Results: cg15925993 within theLOC339975gene was epigenome-wide significant in the ACC. Of 16 identified differentially methylated regions, two (PRSS50andLINC00612/A2M-AS1) overlapped between multiple brain regions. Functional enrichment was detected for biological processes related to neuronal development, inflammatory signaling and immune cell migration. Additionally, our results indicate the association of the well-knownAHRRCpG site cg05575921 with smoking in the brain.

Genetic and environmental factors contribute to ASD etiology. DNA methylation is particularly relevant for ASD due to its mediating role in the complex interaction between genotype and environment and has been implicated in ASD pathophysiology. The lack of diversity in DNA methylation studies in ASD individuals is remarkable. Since genetic and environmental factors are likely to vary across populations, the study of underrepresented populations is necessary to understand the molecular alterations involved in ASD and the risk factors underlying these changes. This study explored genome-wide differences in DNA methylation patterns in buccal epithelium cells between Mexican ASD patients (n= 27) and age-matched typically developing (TD:n= 15) children. DNA methylation profiles were evaluated with the Illumina 450k array. We evaluated the interaction between sex and ASD and found a differentially methylated region (DMR) over the 5'UTR region ofZFP57and one of its targets,RASGRF2.These results match previous findings in brain tissue, which may indicate thatZFP57could be used as a proxy for DNA methylation in different tissues. This is the first study performed in a Mexican, and subsequently, Latin American, population that evaluates DNA methylation in ASD patients."

Subsequently, DNA methylation of candidate genes was evaluated using bisulphite pyrosequencing, and DNA methylation of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) was characterized in DNA from blood mononuclear cells (259 PD patients and 182 healthy controls) and skin fibroblasts (10 PD patients and 5 healthy controls). Protein levels ofCYP2E1were analysed using Western blot in human cortex andknock-outmice brain samples.We found 35 hypomethylated and 22 hypermethylated genes with a methylation M-value difference &gt;0.5. Decreased methylation of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) was associated with increased protein levels in PD brains, but in peripheral tissues, i.e., in blood cells and skin fibroblasts, DNA methylation ofCYP2E1was unchanged. InCYP2E1 knock-outmice brain alpha-synuclein (SNCA) protein levels were down-regulated compared to wild-type mice, whereas treatment with trichloroethylene (TCE) up-regulatedCYP2E1protein in a dose-dependent manner in cultured cells.

Moreover, its relationship to other epigenetic alterations is incomplete. Therefore, we carried out an in-depth study of the DNA methylation process in human cardiac tissue. We showed a dysregulation of the DNA methylation machinery accordingly with the genome-wide hypomethylation that we observed: specifically, an overexpression of main genes involved in the elimination of methyl groups (TET1,SMUG1),and underexpression of molecules implicated in the maintenance of methylation (MBD2,UHRF1). By contrast, we foundDNMT3Bupregulation, a key molecule in the addition of methyl residues in DNA, and an underexpression of miR-133a-3p, an inhibitor ofDNMT3Btranscription. However, we found many relevant alterations that would counteract the upregulation observed, such as the overexpression ofTRAF6, responsible for Dnmt3b degradation. Furthermore, we showed that molecules regulating Dnmts activity were altered; specifically, SAM/SAH ratio reduction. All these results are in concordance with the Dnmts normal function that we show. Our analysis revealed genome-wide hypomethylation along with dysregulation in the mechanisms of addition, elimination and maintenance of methyl groups in the DNA of ICM. We describe relevant alterations in the DNMT3B system, which promote a normal Dnmt3b function despite its upregulation."

Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis hyperactivity is believed to affect cellular senescence and has been implicated in HD. No previous study investigated HD or HPA-axis dysregulation in relation to measures of epigenetic age (EA) acceleration.This study reports on a case-control study set-up from a well-characterized cohort, contrasting EA predictors in relation to 60 HD patients and 33 healthy volunteers (HV) and 19 mixed HD/HV exhibiting dexamethasone suppression test (DST) non-suppression to 73 mixed HD/HV DST controls. The genome-wide methylation pattern was measured in whole blood from 94 subjects using the Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip and preprocessed according to specialized protocols suitable for epigenetic age estimation. The online DNAm Age Calculator (https://dnamage.ucla.edu/) was implemented to retrieve various EA predictors, which were compared between the in-silico generated subgroups.Quality control analyses indicated strong correlations between the EA measure DNA methylation GrimAge (DNAm GrimAge - the EA clock most reliably associated with mortality risk) and chronological age in all sub-groups. The study was adequately powered to detect differences of 2.5 and 3.0 years in DNAm GrimAge minus age in relation to both HD and HPA-axis dysregulation, respectively. Baseline DNAm GrimAge exceeded chronological age by 2.8 years on average across all samples. No EA acceleration marker was associated with HD or DST suppression status (p > 0.05).EA acceleration markers shown to be strongly predictive of physiological dysregulation and mortality-risk, are not related to HD or DST non-suppression status (measured after 0.5 mg dexamethasone). The independency of HPA-axis dysregulation to EA acceleration does not support the biological relevance of this dosage-regimen when applied to patients with HD. These findings do not support the notion of accelerated cellular senescence in HD. Studies stratifying DST non-suppressors according to established dosage-regimens in somatic settings are needed to fully elucidate the putative contribution of HPA-axis dysregulation to EA.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Studies have shown that smoking has significant detrimental effects on the course of CD. So we assessed whether DNA methylation mediates the association between smoking and CD. Among 103 CD cases and 174 controls, we estimated whether the effects of smoking on CD are mediated through DNA methylation CpG sites, which we referred to as causal mediation effect. Based on the causal diagram, we first implemented sure independence screening (SIS) to reduce the pool of potential mediator CpGs from a very large to a moderate number; then, we implemented variable selection with de-sparsifying the LASSO regression. Finally, we carried out a comprehensive mediation analysis and conducted sensitivity analysis, which was adjusted for potential confounders of age, sex, and blood cell type proportions to estimate the mediation effects. Smoking was significantly associated with CD under odds ratio (OR) of 2.319 (95% CI: 1.603, 3.485,p < 0.001) after adjustment for confounders. Ninety-nine mediator CpGs were selected from SIS, and then, seven candidate CpGs were obtained by de-sparsifying the LASSO regression. Four of these CpGs showed statistical significance, and the average causal mediation effects (ACME) were attenuated from 0.066 to 0.126. Notably, three significant mediator CpGs had absolute sensitivity parameters of 0.40, indicating that these mediation effects were robust even when the assumptions were slightly violated. Genes (BCL3 and FKBP5) harboring these four CpGs were related to CD. These findings suggest that changes in methylation are involved in the mechanism by which smoking increases risk of CD.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Xia and Su."

Intense promoter hypermethylation is a frequent molecular finding in the serrated pathway and may be present in normal mucosa, predisposing to the formation of serrated lesions. To identify novel biomarkers for SPS, fresh-frozen samples of normal mucosa from 50 patients with SPS and 19 healthy individuals were analyzed by using the 850K BeadChip Technology (Infinium). Aberrant methylation levels were correlated with gene expression using a next-generation transcriptome profiling tool. Two validation steps were performed on independent cohorts: first, on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue of the normal mucosa; and second, on 24 serrated lesions. The most frequently hypermethylated genes were HLA-F, SLFN12, HLA-DMA, and RARRES3; and the most frequently hypomethylated genes were PIWIL1 and ANK3 (Δβ = 10%; P < 0.05). In formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue, we positively validated HLA-F. Expression levels of HLA-F, SLFN12, and HLA-DMA were significantly different between SPS patients and healthy individuals and correlated well with the methylation status of the corresponding differentially methylated region (fold change, >20%; r > 0.55; P < 0.001). Significant hypermethylation of CpGs in the gene body of HLA-F was also found in serrated lesions (Δβ = 23%; false discovery rate = 0.01). Epigenome-wide methylation profiling has revealed numerous differentially methylated CpGs in normal mucosa from SPS patients.

However, most genome-wide mapping of RNA modifications has focused on messenger RNAs and transfer RNAs, but such datasets have been lacking for small RNAs. Here we mapped N1-methyladenosine (m1A) in the cellular small RNA space. Benchmarked with synthetic m1A RNAs, our workflow identified specific groups of m1A-containing small RNAs, which are otherwise disproportionally under-represented. In particular, 22-nucleotides long 3' tRNA-fragments are highly enriched for TRMT6/61A-dependent m1A located within the seed region. TRMT6/61A-dependent m1A negatively affects gene silencing by tRF-3s. In urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, where TRMT6/61A is over-expressed, higher m1A modification on tRFs is detected, correlated with a dysregulation of tRF targetome. Lastly, TRMT6/61A regulates tRF-3 targets involved in unfolded protein response. Together, our results reveal a mechanism of regulating gene expression via base modification of small RNA.© 2022.

"35440009","Epigenome-wide contributions to individual differences in childhood phenotypes: a GREML approach.","Clin Epigenetics","DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism involved in human development. Numerous epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have investigated the associations of DNA methylation at single CpG sites with childhood outcomes. However, the overall contribution of DNA methylation across the genome (R2Methylation) towards childhood phenotypes is unknown. An estimate of R2Methylationwould provide context regarding the importance of DNA methylation explaining variance in health outcomes. We therefore estimated the variance explained by epigenome-wide cord blood methylation (R2Methylation) for five childhood phenotypes: gestational age, birth weight, and body mass index (BMI), IQ and ADHD symptoms at school age. We adapted a genome-based restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) approach with cross-validation (CV) to DNA methylation data and applied it in two population-based birth cohorts: ALSPAC (n = 775) and Generation R (n = 1382).Using information from > 470,000 autosomal probes we estimated that DNA methylation at birth explains 32% (SDCV = 0.06) of gestational age variance and 5% (SDCV = 0.02) of birth weight variance. The R2Methylationestimates for BMI, IQ and ADHD symptoms at school age estimates were near 0% across almost all cross-validation iterations.The results suggest that cord blood methylation explains a moderate degree of variance in gestational age and birth weight, in line with the success of previous EWAS in identifying numerous CpG sites associated with these phenotypes. In contrast, we could not obtain a reliable estimate for school-age BMI, IQ and ADHD symptoms. This may reflect a null bias due to insufficient sample size to detect variance explained in more weakly associated phenotypes, although the true R2Methylationfor these phenotypes is likely below that of gestational age and birth weight when using DNA methylation at birth.© 2022.

We found inversion-state specific methylation patterns within and nearby flanking each inversion region in both datasets. Additionally, numerous inversion-exposure interactions on methylation levels were identified from early-life exposome data comprising 64 exposures. For instance, children homozygous at inv-8p23.1 and higher meat intake were more susceptible to TDH hypermethylation (P = 3.8 × 10-22); being the inversion, exposure, and gene known risk factors for adult obesity.

ART pregnancies have an increased risk of low birth weight, abnormal placentation, pregnancy complications, and imprinting disorders. Embryo culture induces low birth weight, abnormal placental morphology, and lower levels of DNA methylation in placentas in a mouse model of ART. Whether preimplantation embryos at specific stages of development are more susceptible to these perturbations remains unresolved. Accordingly, we performed embryo culture for several discrete periods of preimplantation development and following embryo transfer, assessed fetal and placental outcomes at term. We observed a reduction in fetal:placental ratio associated with two distinct windows of preimplantation embryo development, one prior to the morula stage and the other from the morula to blastocyst stage, whereas placental morphological abnormalities and reduced imprinting control region methylation were only associated with culture prior to the morula stage. Extended culture to the blastocyst stage also induces additional placental DNA methylation changes compared to embryos transferred at the morula stage, and female concepti exhibited a higher loss of DNA methylation than males.

"35501397","Making sense of the ageing methylome.","Nat Rev Genet","Over time, the human DNA methylation landscape accrues substantial damage, which has been associated with a broad range of age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Various age-related DNA methylation changes have been described, including at the level of individual CpGs, such as differential and variable methylation, and at the level of the whole methylome, including entropy and correlation networks. Here, we review these changes in the ageing methylome as well as the statistical tools that can be used to quantify them. We detail the evidence linking DNA methylation to ageing phenotypes and the longevity strategies aimed at altering both DNA methylation patterns and machinery to extend healthspan and lifespan. Lastly, we discuss theories on the mechanistic causes of epigenetic ageing.© 2022. Springer Nature Limited."

From 247 cases and 453 controls, we obtained variant genotypes for CBLIF, CUBN, AMN, ABCC1, CD320, and TCN2 from a single nucleotide polymorphisms array. Global DNA methylation in 95 controls was obtained through LINE-1 methylation. After multiple comparison corrections, only rs780807 in CUBN remains associated with NSCL/P at dominant model (OR 0.564, p-value = 0.0006, q-value = 0.0450). Carriers of protective allele showed lower levels of DNA methylation than non-carriers (p = 0.0259). Further studies are necessary in order to explain relations with the phenotype and DNA methylation due to the absence of functional evidence for rs780807 in CUBN.© 2022.

Previous studies have revealed autosomal epigenetic differences between males and females in some tissues, including differences in DNA methylation patterns. Here, we report for the first time an analysis of autosomal sex differences in DNAme using the Illumina EPIC array in human whole blood by performing a discovery (n = 1171) and validation (n = 2471) analysis.We identified and validated 396 sex-associated differentially methylated CpG sites (saDMPs) with the majority found to be female-biased CpGs (74%). These saDMP's are enriched in CpG islands and CpG shores and located preferentially at 5'UTRs, 3'UTRs and enhancers. Additionally, we identified 266 significant sex-associated differentially methylated regions overlapping genes, which have previously been shown to exhibit epigenetic sex differences, and novel genes. Transcription factor binding site enrichment revealed enrichment of transcription factors related to critical developmental processes and sex determination such as SRY and ESR1.Our study reports a reliable catalogue of sex-associated CpG sites and elucidates several characteristics of these sites using large-scale discovery and validation data sets. This resource will benefit future studies aiming to investigate sex specific epigenetic signatures and further our understanding of the role of DNA methylation in sex differences in human whole blood.© 2022.

"35562603","Vitamin D supplementation is associated with slower epigenetic aging.","Geroscience","Adverse effects of low vitamin D level on mortality and morbidity are controversially discussed. Especially older people are at risk for vitamin D deficiency and therefore exposed to its potentially harmful consequences. A way of measuring differences in the biological age is through DNA methylation age (DNAm age) and its deviation from chronological age, DNAm age acceleration (DNAmAA). We previously reported on an association between vitamin D deficiency and higher 7-CpG DNAmAA in participants of the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II). In this study, we employ a quasi-interventional study design to assess the relationship between DNAmAA of five epigenetic clocks and vitamin D supplementation. Longitudinal data were available for 1,036 participants of BASE-II that were reexamined on average 7.4 years later in the GendAge study (mean age at follow-up: 75.6 years, SD = 3.8 years, age range: 64.9-94.1 years, 51.9% female). DNAmAA was estimated with the 7-CpG clock, Horvath's clock, Hannum's clock, PhenoAge, and GrimAge. Methylation data were obtained through methylation-sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (MS-SNuPE) or Illumina's Infinium ""MethylationEPIC"" array. Vitamin D-deficient participants who chose to start vitamin D supplementation after baseline examination showed a 2.6-year lower 7-CpG DNAmAA (p = 0.011) and 1.3-year lower Horvath DNAmAA (p = 0.042) compared to untreated and vitamin D-deficient participants. DNAmAA did not statistically differ between participants with successfully treated vitamin D deficiency and healthy controls (p > 0.16). Therefore, we conclude that intake of vitamin D supplement is associated with lower DNAmAA in participants with vitamin D deficiency.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35488174","The Placental Epigenome as a Molecular Link Between Prenatal Exposures and Fetal Health Outcomes Through the DOHaD Hypothesis.","Curr Environ Health Rep","The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis posits that the perinatal environment can impact fetal and later life health. The placenta is uniquely situated to assess prenatal exposures in the context of DOHaD because it is an essential ephemeral fetal organ that manages the transport of oxygen, nutrients, waste, and endocrine signals between the mother and fetus. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent studies that evaluated the DOHaD hypothesis in human placentas using epigenomics, including DNA methylation and transcriptomic studies of mRNA, lncRNA, and microRNAs.Between 2016 and 2021, 28 articles evaluated associations between prenatal exposures and placental epigenomics across broad exposure categories including maternal smoking, psychosocial stressors, chemicals, air pollution, and metals. Sixteen of these studies connected exposures to health outcome such as birth weight, fetal growth, or infant neurobehavior through mediation analysis, identification of shared associations between exposure and outcome, or network analysis. These aspects of infant and childhood health serve as a foundation for future studies that aim to use placental epigenetics to understand relationships between the prenatal environment and perinatal complications (such as preterm birth or fetal growth restriction) or later life childhood health. Placental DNA methylation and RNA expression have been linked to numerous prenatal exposures, such as PM2.5 air pollution, metals, and maternal smoking, as well as infant and childhood health outcomes, including fetal growth and birth weight. Placental epigenomics provides a unique opportunity to expand the DOHaD premise, particularly if research applies novel methodologies such as multi-omics analysis, sequencing of non-coding RNAs, mixtures analysis, and assessment of health outcomes beyond early childhood.© 2022.

"35455649","Epigenetics in Precision Nutrition.","J Pers Med","Precision nutrition is an emerging area of nutrition research, with primary focus on the individual variability in response to dietary and lifestyle factors, which are mainly determined by an individual's intrinsic variations, such as those in genome, epigenome, and gut microbiome. The current research on precision nutrition is heavily focused on genome and gut microbiome, while epigenome (DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs, and histone modification) is largely neglected. The epigenome acts as the interface between the human genome and environmental stressors, including diets and lifestyle. Increasing evidence has suggested that epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, may determine the individual variability in metabolic health and response to dietary and lifestyle factors and, therefore, hold great promise in discovering novel markers for precision nutrition and potential targets for precision interventions. This review summarized recent studies on DNA methylation with obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, with more emphasis put in the relations of DNA methylation with nutrition and diet/lifestyle interventions. We also briefly reviewed other epigenetic events, such as non-coding RNAs, in relation to human health and nutrition, and discussed the potential role of epigenetics in the precision nutrition research."
"35449591","Cell models for Down syndrome-Alzheimer's disease research.","Neuronal Signal","Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal abnormality and leads to intellectual disability, increased risk of cardiac defects, and an altered immune response. Individuals with DS have an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21) and are more likely to develop early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) than the general population. Changes in expression of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21)-encoded genes, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP), play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD in DS (DS-AD). However, the mechanisms of DS-AD remain poorly understood. To date, several mouse models with an extra copy of genes syntenic to Hsa21 have been developed to characterise DS-AD-related phenotypes. Nonetheless, due to genetic and physiological differences between mouse and human, mouse models cannot faithfully recapitulate all features of DS-AD. Cells differentiated from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), isolated from individuals with genetic diseases, can be used to model disease-related cellular and molecular pathologies, including DS. In this review, we will discuss the limitations of mouse models of DS and how these can be addressed using recent advancements in modelling DS using human iPSCs and iPSC-mouse chimeras, and potential applications of iPSCs in preclinical studies for DS-AD.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35585103","Obesity and accelerated epigenetic aging in a high-risk cohort of children.","Sci Rep","New insights into mechanisms linking obesity to poor health outcomes suggest a role for cellular aging pathways, casting obesity as a disease of accelerated biological aging. Although obesity has been linked to accelerated epigenetic aging in middle-aged adults, the impact during childhood remains unclear. We tested the association between body mass index (BMI) and accelerated epigenetic aging in a cohort of high-risk children. Participants were children (N = 273, aged 8 to 14 years, 82% investigated for maltreatment) recruited to the Child Health Study, an ongoing prospective study of youth investigated for maltreatment and a comparison youth. BMI was measured as a continuous variable. Accelerated epigenetic aging of blood leukocytes was defined as the age-adjusted residuals of several established epigenetic aging clocks (Horvath, Hannum, GrimAge, PhenoAge) along with a newer algorithm, the DunedinPoAm, developed to quantify the pace-of-aging. Hypotheses were tested with generalized linear models. Higher age-and sex- adjusted z-scored BMI was significantly correlated with household income, blood cell counts, and three of the accelerated epigenetic aging measures: GrimAge (r = 0.31, P < .0001), PhenoAge (r = 0.24, P < .0001), and DunedinPoAm (r = 0.38, P < .0001). In fully adjusted models, GrimAge (β = 0.07; P = .0009) and DunedinPoAm (β = 0.0017; P < .0001) remained significantly associated with higher age- and sex-adjusted z-scored BMI. Maltreatment-status was not associated with accelerated epigenetic aging. In a high-risk cohort of children, higher BMI predicted epigenetic aging as assessed by two epigenetic aging clocks. These results suggest the association between obesity and accelerated epigenetic aging begins in early life, with implications for future morbidity and mortality risk.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Importantly, these studies identified epigenetic modifications, including altered DNA methylation, in pancreatic islets, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and the liver from individuals with T2DM. As non-genetic factors that affect the risk of T2DM, such as obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, ageing and the intrauterine environment, have been associated with epigenetic modifications in healthy individuals, epigenetics probably also contributes to T2DM development. In addition, genetic factors associated with T2DM and obesity affect the epigenome in human tissues. Notably, causal mediation analyses found DNA methylation to be a potential mediator of genetic associations with metabolic traits and disease. In the past few years, translational studies have identified blood-based epigenetic markers that might be further developed and used for precision medicine to help patients with T2DM receive optimal therapy and to identify patients at risk of complications. This Review focuses on epigenetic mechanisms in the development of T2DM and the regulation of body weight in humans, with a special focus on precision medicine.© 2022. Springer Nature Limited."

However, proving that such 'geroprotectors' do what they are hypothesized to do in relevant clinical trials is not trivial. We briefly discuss some of the more salient issues surrounding the design and interpretation of clinical trials of geroprotectors, including, importantly, how one defines a geroprotector. We also discuss whether emerging surrogate endpoints, such as epigenetic clocks, should be treated as primary or secondary endpoints in such trials. Simply put, geroprotectors should provide overt health and disease prevention benefits but the time-dependent relationships between epigenetic clocks and health-related phenomena are complex and in need of further scrutiny. Therefore, studies that enable understanding of the relationships between epigenetic clocks and disease processes while simultaneously testing the efficacy of a candidate geroprotector are crucial to move the field forward."
"35440567","Accelerated biological aging in COVID-19 patients.","Nat Commun","Chronological age is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19. Previous findings indicate that epigenetic age could be altered in viral infection. However, the epigenetic aging in COVID-19 has not been well studied. In this study, DNA methylation of the blood samples from 232 healthy individuals and 413 COVID-19 patients is profiled using EPIC methylation array. Epigenetic ages of each individual are determined by applying epigenetic clocks and telomere length estimator to the methylation profile of the individual. Epigenetic age acceleration is calculated and compared between groups. We observe strong correlations between the epigenetic clocks and individual's chronological age (r > 0.8, p < 0.0001). We also find the increasing acceleration of epigenetic aging and telomere attrition in the sequential blood samples from healthy individuals and infected patients developing non-severe and severe COVID-19. In addition, the longitudinal DNA methylation profiling analysis find that the accumulation of epigenetic aging from COVID-19 syndrome could be partly reversed at late clinic phases in some patients. In conclusion, accelerated epigenetic aging is associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing severe COVID-19. In addition, the accumulation of epigenetic aging from COVID-19 may contribute to the post-COVID-19 syndrome among survivors.© 2022. The Author(s)."

"35456226","Contemporary Use of ICSI and Epigenetic Risks to Future Generations.","J Clin Med","Since the birth of Louise Brown in 1978 via IVF, reproductive specialists have acquired enormous knowledge and refined several procedures, which are nowadays applied in assisted reproductive technology (ART). One of the most critical steps in this practice is the fertilization process. In the early days of IVF, a remarkable concern was the unpleasant outcomes of failed fertilization, overtaken by introducing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), delineating a real breakthrough in modern ART. ICSI became standard practice and was soon used as the most common method to fertilize oocytes. It has been used for severe male factor infertility and non-male factors, such as unexplained infertility or advanced maternal age, without robust scientific evidence. However, applying ICSI blindly is not free of potential detrimental consequences since novel studies report possible health consequences to offspring. DNA methylation and epigenetic alterations in sperm cells of infertile men might help explain some of the adverse effects reported in ICSI studies on reproductive health in future generations. Collected data concerning the health of ICSI children over the past thirty years seems to support the notion that there might be an increased risk of epigenetic disorders, congenital malformations, chromosomal alterations, and subfertility in babies born following ICSI compared to naturally conceived children. However, it is still to be elucidated to what level these data are associated with the cause of infertility or the ICSI technique. This review provides an overview of epigenetic mechanisms and possible imprinting alterations following the use of ART, in particular ICSI. It also highlights the sperm contribution to embryo epigenetic regulation and the risks of in vitro culture conditions on epigenetic dysregulation. Lastly, it summarizes the literature concerning the possible epigenetic disorders in children born after ART."

In this paper, we describe a new application of a comprehensive model for cancer-related fatigue: the predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating (3P) factors model. This model framework outlined herein, which incorporates the emerging field of metabolomics, may help to frame a more in-depth analysis of the etiology of cancer-related fatigue as well as a broader and more personalized set of approaches to the clinical treatment of fatigue in oncology care. Included within this review paper is an in-depth description of the proposed biological mechanisms of cancer-related fatigue, as well as a presentation of the 3P model's application to this phenomenon. We conclude that a clinical focus on organization risk stratification and treatment around the 3P model may be warranted, and future research may benefit from expanding the 3P model to understand fatigue not only in oncology, but also across a variety of chronic conditions."

It was shown that in cell cultures obtained on different days from embryos of different ages, the phase of the 4-day rhythm coincides. In vitro the maxima of the proliferative activity were consistent with the minima of the motor activity of mice. Freezing the culture for 2 or 6 days does not cause a shift in the phase of the 4-day rhythm of cell proliferative activity compare with the unfreezing culture. That indicates the existence of an external synchronizer, which determines the 4-day infradian rhythm of the proliferative activity of embryonic cells. Then we daily thawed samples of single L929 culture of mice fibroblast-like cells for 22 and 17 days and researched the dynamics of its proliferative activity. We also showed 4-day rhythm of the simultaneous increase in the number of cells for all thawed samples. Taking into account that deep freezing of a culture leads to the cessation of all life processes, the fact we obtained indicates an exogenous mechanism of the formation of about a 4-day rhythm of the proliferative activity of cell culture. Variations of the Earth's magnetic field could be one of the external synchronizers of the infradian rhythm. We studied the increase in number of L929 cell in conditions of a magnetic permalloy screen and showed that the magnetic shielding no affect the parameters of the infradian rhythm of L929 cell proliferative activity. So further searches of the external synchronizers are need.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Using samples from our randomized controlled trial of folic acid supplementation in second and third trimester (FASSTT), where significant improvements in cognitive and psychosocial performance were demonstrated in children from mothers supplemented in pregnancy with 400 µg/day FA compared with placebo, we examined methylation patterns from cord blood (CB) using the EPIC array which covers approximately 850,000 cytosine-guanine (CG) sites across the genome. Genes showing significant differences were verified using pyrosequencing and mechanistic approaches used in vitro to determine effects on transcription.FA supplementation resulted in significant differences in methylation, particularly at brain-related genes. Further analysis showed these genes split into two groups. In one group, which included the CES1 gene, methylation changes at the promoters were important for regulating transcription. We also identified a second group which had a characteristic bimodal profile, with low promoter and high gene body (GB) methylation. In the latter, loss of methylation in the GB is linked to decreases in transcription: this group included the PRKAR1B/HEATR2 genes and the dopamine receptor regulator PDE4C. Overall, methylation in CB also showed good correlation with methylation profiles seen in a published data set of late gestation foetal brain samples.We show here clear alterations in DNA methylation at specific classes of neurodevelopmental genes in the same cohort of children, born to FA-supplemented mothers, who previously showed improved cognitive and psychosocial performance. Our results show measurable differences at neural genes which are important for transcriptional regulation and add to the supporting evidence for continued FA supplementation throughout later gestation.

"35524222","A novel and sensitive DNA methylation marker for the urine-based liquid biopsies to detect bladder cancer.","BMC Cancer","Better prognostic outcome is closely correlated with early detection of bladder cancer. Current non-invasive urianalysis relies on simultaneously testing multiple methylation markers to achieve relatively high accuracy. Therefore, we have developed an easy-to-use, convenient, and accurate single-target urine-based DNA methylation test for the malignancy.By analyzing TCGA data, 344 candidate markers with 424 primer pairs and probe sets synthesized were systematically screened in cancer cell lines, paired tissue specimens, and urine sediments from bladder cancer patients and normal controls. The identified marker was further validated in large case-control cohorts. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and c2 tests were performed to compare methylation levels between case-control groups and correlate methylation levels with demographic and clinical characteristics. In addition, MSP, qMSP, RT-PCR, western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry were performed to measure levels of DNA methylation, mRNA transcription, and protein expression in cancer cell lines and tissues.A top-performing DMRTA2 marker identified was tested in both discovery and validation sets, showing similar sensitivity and specificity for bladder cancer detection. Overall sensitivity in the aggregate set was 82.9%(179/216). The specificity, from a control group consisting of patients with lithangiuria, prostatoplasia, and prostatitis, is 92.5%(468/506). Notably, the methylation assay had the highest sensitivities for tumors at stages of T1(90.4%) and T2(95.0%) compared with Ta (63.0%), T3(81.8%), and T4(81.8%). Furthermore, the test showed admirable detection rate of 80.0%(24/30) for recurring cancers. While methylation was observed in 39/54(72.2%) urine samples from patients with carcinomas of renal pelvis and ureter, it was detected at extremely low rate of 6.0%(8/133) in kidney and prostate cancers. Compared with SV-HUC-1, the normal bladder epithelial cell line, DMRTA2 was hypermethylated in 8/9 bladder cancer cell lines, consistent with the results of MSP and qMSP, but not correlated with mRNA and protein expression levels in these cell lines. Similarly, DMRTA2 immunostaining was moderate in some tissues but weak in others. Further studies are needed to address functional implications of DMRTA2 hypermethylation.Our data demonstrated that a single-target DNA methylation signature, mDMRTA2, could be highly effective to detect both primary and recurring bladder cancer via urine samples.© 2022.

The aims of this study were to: (1) compare the predictive utility of mortality by three aging measures at three hierarchical levels; (2) develop a composite aging measure that integrated aging measures at different hierarchical levels; and (3) evaluate the response of these aging measures to modifiable life style factors.Data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 were used. Three aging measures included telomere length (TL, biological level), Phenotypic Age (PA, phenotypic level), and frailty index (FI, functional level). Mortality information was collected until December 2015. Cox proportional hazards regression and multiple linear regression models were performed.A total of 3,249 participants (20-84 years) were included. Both accelerations (accounting for chronological age) of PA and FI were significantly associated with mortality, with HRs of 1.67 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.41-1.98] and 1.59 (95% CI = 1.35-1.87), respectively, while that of TL showed non-significant associations. We thus developed a new composite aging measure (named PC1) integrating the accelerations of PA and FI, and demonstrated its better predictive utility relative to each single aging measure. PC1, as well as the accelerations of PA and FI, were responsive to several life style factors including smoking status, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and leisure-time physical activity.This study demonstrates that both phenotypic (i.e., PA) and functional (i.e., FI) aging measures can capture mortality risk and respond to modifiable life style factors, despite their inherent differences. Furthermore, the PC1 that integrated phenotypic and functional aging measures outperforms in predicting mortality risk in comparison with each single aging measure, and strongly responds to modifiable life style factors. The findings suggest the complementary of aging measures at different hierarchical levels and highlight the potential of life style-targeted interventions as geroprotective programs.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Cao, Chen, He, Ren, Xiao, Han, Wu and Liu."

However, because the training data always have a biased age distribution, the model performance becomes weak for the samples with a small age distribution density. To solve this problem, we developed the R package eClock, which uses a bagging-SMOTE method to adjust the biased distribution and predict age with an ensemble model. Moreover, it also provides a bootstrapped model based on bagging only and a traditional clock model. The performance on three datasets showed that the bagging-SMOTE model significantly improved rare sample age prediction. In addition to model construction, the package also provides other functions such as data visualization and methylation feature conversion to facilitate the research in relevant areas."

It is the most significant risk factor for all non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Another contributing factor to the rise in NCDs is obesity. It has been suggested that obesity not only accelerates the onset of metabolic imbalances but also decreases lifespan and impacts cellular and molecular processes in a manner similar to aging. Obesity might accelerate the pace of aging. Guided by a lifecourse approach, we will explore how exposure to obesity in critical developmental stages disrupt homeostatic resilience mechanisms that preserve physiological integrity, inducing an early expression of aging phenotypes. Also, we will determine whether exposure to early psychosocial adversity influences vulnerability to obesity as a risk factor for accelerated aging.Multiple events case-control study embedded in a prospective cohort of Chileans at 30-31y, 50% females, of low- to-middle socioeconomic status, who participated in nutrition research since birth. At 23y, 25% had obesity and cardiometabolic risk was high. We will use a multi-layer approach including: anthropometric assessment; DXA scan for body composition; abdominal ultrasound of the liver; stool samples collection and sequencing of the ribosomal RNA 16S gene to characterize the gut microbiome; determination of age-related pro-inflammatory cytokynes and anti-inflammatory miokynes. For the first time in Chile, we will address age-related epigenetic changes using the Horvath´s epigenetic clock. In a subset we will conduct a controlled physical challenge to characterize physical resilience (autophagy).ObAGE is in an excellent position to: approach aging as a process whose expression involves multiple factors from the early stages of a person's life; understand how longitudinal changes in health trajectories impact the biological mechanisms of aging; identify potential resilience mechanisms that help prevent unhealthy aging. Because SLS participants are still young, our research setting combined with advanced scientific techniques may identify individuals or groups at risk of early onset health issues. Results from ObAGE may pave the way to address the contribution of obesity to aging through lifespan from cells to systems and might be instrumental to developing interventions to improve health span in the Chilean population.The proposed study does not consider any health care intervention on human participants.© 2022.

These differences are often considered to be a key cause of age-associated diseases as well as decreased vaccine responses in humans. The most often cited vaccine failure is seasonal influenza, but, while it is usually the case that the efficiency of this vaccine is lower in older than younger adults, this is not always true, and the reasons for the differential responses are manifold. Undoubtedly, changes in the innate and adaptive immune response with ageing are associated with failure to respond to the influenza vaccine, but the cause is unclear. Moreover, recent advances in vaccine formulations and adjuvants, as well as in our understanding of immune changes with ageing, have contributed to the development of vaccines, such as those against herpes zoster and SARS-CoV-2, that can protect against serious disease in older adults just as well as in younger people. In the present article, we discuss the reasons why it is a myth that vaccines inevitably protect less well in older individuals, and that vaccines represent one of the most powerful means to protect the health and ensure the quality of life of older adults."

This chapter makes a critical inventory of the methods developed to calculate these accuracies a posteriori and a priori. The most significant factors affecting this accuracy are described (size of the reference population, number of markers, linkage disequilibrium, heritability).© 2022.

"35442943","Efficient estimation of SNP heritability using Gaussian predictive process in large scale cohort studies.","PLoS Genet","With the advent of high throughput genetic data, there have been attempts to estimate heritability from genome-wide SNP data on a cohort of distantly related individuals using linear mixed model (LMM). Fitting such an LMM in a large scale cohort study, however, is tremendously challenging due to its high dimensional linear algebraic operations. In this paper, we propose a new method named PredLMM approximating the aforementioned LMM motivated by the concepts of genetic coalescence and Gaussian predictive process. PredLMM has substantially better computational complexity than most of the existing LMM based methods and thus, provides a fast alternative for estimating heritability in large scale cohort studies. Theoretically, we show that under a model of genetic coalescence, the limiting form of our approximation is the celebrated predictive process approximation of large Gaussian process likelihoods that has well-established accuracy standards. We illustrate our approach with extensive simulation studies and use it to estimate the heritability of multiple quantitative traits from the UK Biobank cohort."
"35471149","Cohesin-dependence of neuronal gene expression relates to chromatin loop length.","Elife","Cohesin and CTCF are major drivers of 3D genome organization, but their role in neurons is still emerging. Here, we show a prominent role for cohesin in the expression of genes that facilitate neuronal maturation and homeostasis. Unexpectedly, we observed two major classes of activity-regulated genes with distinct reliance on cohesin in mouse primary cortical neurons. Immediate early genes (IEGs) remained fully inducible by KCl and BDNF, and short-range enhancer-promoter contacts at the IEGsFosformed robustly in the absence of cohesin. In contrast, cohesin was required for full expression of a subset of secondary response genes characterized by long-range chromatin contacts. Cohesin-dependence of constitutive neuronal genes with key functions in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter signaling also scaled with chromatin loop length. Our data demonstrate that key genes required for the maturation and activation of primary cortical neurons depend on cohesin for their full expression, and that the degree to which these genes rely on cohesin scales with the genomic distance traversed by their chromatin contacts.© 2022, Calderon et al."
"35565358","Analytical Considerations of Large-Scale Aptamer-Based Datasets for Translational Applications.","Cancers (Basel)","The development and advancement of aptamer technology has opened a new realm of possibilities for unlocking the biocomplexity available within proteomics. With ultra-high-throughput and multiplexing, alongside remarkable specificity and sensitivity, aptamers could represent a powerful tool in disease-specific research, such as supporting the discovery and validation of clinically relevant biomarkers. One of the fundamental challenges underlying past and current proteomic technology has been the difficulty of translating proteomic datasets into standards of practice. Aptamers provide the capacity to generate single panels that span over 7000 different proteins from a singular sample. However, as a recent technology, they also present unique challenges, as the field of translational aptamer-based proteomics still lacks a standardizing methodology for analyzing these large datasets and the novel considerations that must be made in response to the differentiation amongst current proteomic platforms and aptamers. We address these analytical considerations with respect to surveying initial data, deploying proper statistical methodologies to identify differential protein expressions, and applying datasets to discover multimarker and pathway-level findings. Additionally, we present aptamer datasets within the multi-omics landscape by exploring the intersectionality of aptamer-based proteomics amongst genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, alongside pre-existing proteomic platforms. Understanding the broader applications of aptamer datasets will substantially enhance current efforts to generate translatable findings for the clinic."

In clinical practice, there is a need for improved plasma biomarker-based tools for diagnosis and risk prediction of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Analysis of blood, to identify plasma proteins with potential utility for such tools, could enable an individualized approach to treatment and prevention. Technological advances to study the plasma proteome on a large scale allows broad screening for the identification of novel plasma biomarkers, both by targeted and nontargeted proteomics methods. However, assay limitations need to be considered when interpreting results, with orthogonal validation required before conclusions are drawn. Here, we review and provide perspectives on the application of affinity- and mass spectrometry-based methods for the identification and analysis of plasma protein biomarkers, with potential application in the field of VTE.

However, the underlying mechanisms at these loci in the pathogenesis of stroke and effective stroke drug targets are elusive. Therefore, we aimed to identify causal genes in the pathogenesis of stroke and its subtypes.Utilizing multidimensional high-throughput data generated, we integrated proteome-wide association study (PWAS), transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR), and Bayesian colocalization analysis to prioritize genes that contribute to stroke and its subtypes risk via affecting their expression and protein abundance in brain and blood.Our integrative analysis revealed that ICA1L was associated with small-vessel stroke (SVS), according to robust evidence at both protein and transcriptional levels based on brain-derived data. We also identified NBEAL1 that was causally related to SVS via its cis-regulated brain expression level. In blood, we identified 5 genes (MMP12, SCARF1, ABO, F11, and CKAP2) that had causal relationships with stroke and stroke subtypes.Together, via using an integrative analysis to deal with multidimensional data, we prioritized causal genes in the pathogenesis of SVS, which offered hints for future biological and therapeutic studies.© 2022.

Using an oligonucleotide microarray method, we assessed differences in expression patterns of genes in astrocytic brain tumor sections from 43 patients at different stages of disease. Quantitative mRNA assessment of the threeTGFβisoforms was also performed by real-time RT-qPCR. Oligonucleotide microarray data were analyzed using the PL-Grid Infrastructure. The microarray analysis showed a statistically significant (p&lt; 0.05) increase inTGFβ1andTGFβ2expression in G3/G4 stage relative to G2, whereas real-time RT-qPCR validation confirmed this change only for theTGFβ2isoform (p&lt; 0.05). The oligonucleotide microarray method allowed the identification of 16 differential genes associated withTGFβisoforms. Analysis of the STRING database showed that the proteins encoded by the analyzed genes form a strong interaction network (p&lt; 0.001), and a significant number of proteins are involved in carcinogenesis. Differences in expression patterns of transcripts associated withTGFβisoforms confirm that they play a role in astrocytic brain tumor transformation.

"35563298","New Insights into TETs in Psychiatric Disorders.","Int J Mol Sci","Psychiatric disorders are complex and heterogeneous disorders arising from the interaction of multiple factors based on neurobiology, genetics, culture, and life experience. Increasing evidence indicates that sustained abnormalities are maintained by epigenetic modifications in specific brain regions. Over the past decade, the critical, non-redundant roles of the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of dioxygenase enzymes have been identified in the brain during developmental and postnatal stages. Specifically, TET-mediated active demethylation, involving the iterative oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and subsequent oxidative derivatives, is dynamically regulated in response to environmental stimuli such as neuronal activity, learning and memory processes, and stressor exposure. Here, we review the progress of studies designed to provide a better understanding of how profiles of TET proteins and 5hmC are powerful mechanisms by which to explain neuronal plasticity and long-term behaviors, and impact transcriptional programs operative in the brain that contribute to psychiatric disorders."

As a downstream product of the genome and epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome activity, the metabolome can be considered as being the most proximal correlate to the phenotype. Integration of metabolomics data with other -omics data in multi-omics analyses has the potential to advance understanding of human disease development and treatment.To understand the current funding and potential research opportunities for when metabolomics is used in human multi-omics studies, we cross-sectionally evaluated National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded grants to examine the use of metabolomics data when collected with at least one other -omics data type. First, we aimed to determine what types of multi-omics studies included metabolomics data collection. Then, we looked at those multi-omics studies to examine how often grants employed an integrative analysis approach using metabolomics data.We observed that the majority of NIH-funded multi-omics studies that include metabolomics data performed integration, but to a limited extent, with integration primarily incorporating only one other -omics data type. Some opportunities to improve data integration may include increasing confidence in metabolite identification, as well as addressing variability between -omics approach requirements and -omics data incompatibility.© 2022.

"35513722","Genetic architecture of 11 major psychiatric disorders at biobehavioral, functional genomic and molecular genetic levels of analysis.","Nat Genet","We interrogate the joint genetic architecture of 11 major psychiatric disorders at biobehavioral, functional genomic and molecular genetic levels of analysis. We identify four broad factors (neurodevelopmental, compulsive, psychotic and internalizing) that underlie genetic correlations among the disorders and test whether these factors adequately explain their genetic correlations with biobehavioral traits. We introduce stratified genomic structural equation modeling, which we use to identify gene sets that disproportionately contribute to genetic risk sharing. This includes protein-truncating variant-intolerant genes expressed in excitatory and GABAergic brain cells that are enriched for genetic overlap across disorders with psychotic features. Multivariate association analyses detect 152 (20 new) independent loci that act on the individual factors and identify nine loci that act heterogeneously across disorders within a factor. Despite moderate-to-high genetic correlations across all 11 disorders, we find little utility of a single dimension of genetic risk across psychiatric disorders either at the level of biobehavioral correlates or at the level of individual variants.© 2022.

Nevertheless, the molecular features associated with DA neuron vulnerability have not yet been fully identified. Here, we developed a protocol to enrich and transcriptionally profile DA neurons from patients with PD and matched controls, sampling a total of 387,483 nuclei, including 22,048 DA neuron profiles. We identified ten populations and spatially localized each within the SNpc using Slide-seq. A single subtype, marked by the expression of the gene AGTR1 and spatially confined to the ventral tier of SNpc, was highly susceptible to loss in PD and showed the strongest upregulation of targets of TP53 and NR2F2, nominating molecular processes associated with degeneration. This same vulnerable population was specifically enriched for the heritable risk associated with PD, highlighting the importance of cell-intrinsic processes in determining the differential vulnerability of DA neurons to PD-associated degeneration.© 2022.

Here, we apply advanced whole-brain analyses on multi-shell diffusion imaging data and multivariate GWAS to two large scale imaging genetic datasets (UK Biobank and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study) to identify and validate genetic association signals. We discover 503 unique genetic loci that have impact on multiple regions of human brain. Among them, more than 79% are validated in either of two large-scale independent imaging datasets. Key molecular pathways involved in axonal growth, astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation, and synaptogenesis during development are found to significantly impact the measured variations in tissue-specific imaging features.

"35581276","Reconstructing SNP allele and genotype frequencies from GWAS summary statistics.","Sci Rep","The emergence of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has led to the creation of large repositories of human genetic variation, creating enormous opportunities for genetic research and worldwide collaboration. Methods that are based on GWAS summary statistics seek to leverage such records, overcoming barriers that often exist in individual-level data access while also offering significant computational savings. Such summary-statistics-based applications include GWAS meta-analysis, with and without sample overlap, and case-case GWAS. We compare performance of leading methods for summary-statistics-based genomic analysis and also introduce a novel framework that can unify usual summary-statistics-based implementations via the reconstruction of allelic and genotypic frequencies and counts (ReACt). First, we evaluate ASSET, METAL, and ReACt using both synthetic and real data for GWAS meta-analysis (with and without sample overlap) and find that, while all three methods are comparable in terms of power and error control, ReACt and METAL are faster than ASSET by a factor of at least hundred. We then proceed to evaluate performance of ReACt vs an existing method for case-case GWAS and show comparable performance, with ReACt requiring minimal underlying assumptions and being more user-friendly. Finally, ReACt allows us to evaluate, for the first time, an implementation for calculating polygenic risk score (PRS) for groups of cases and controls based on summary statistics. Our work demonstrates the power of GWAS summary-statistics-based methodologies and the proposed novel method provides a unifying framework and allows further extension of possibilities for researchers seeking to understand the genetics of complex disease.© 2022.

"35513724","Improving polygenic prediction in ancestrally diverse populations.","Nat Genet","Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have attenuated cross-population predictive performance. As existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted predominantly in individuals of European descent, the limited transferability of PRS reduces their clinical value in non-European populations, and may exacerbate healthcare disparities. Recent efforts to level ancestry imbalance in genomic research have expanded the scale of non-European GWAS, although most remain underpowered. Here, we present a new PRS construction method, PRS-CSx, which improves cross-population polygenic prediction by integrating GWAS summary statistics from multiple populations. PRS-CSx couples genetic effects across populations via a shared continuous shrinkage (CS) prior, enabling more accurate effect size estimation by sharing information between summary statistics and leveraging linkage disequilibrium diversity across discovery samples, while inheriting computational efficiency and robustness from PRS-CS. We show that PRS-CSx outperforms alternative methods across traits with a wide range of genetic architectures, cross-population genetic overlaps and discovery GWAS sample sizes in simulations, and improves the prediction of quantitative traits and schizophrenia risk in non-European populations.© 2022.

Univariate analysis was performed to assess patient factors associated with the desire for multiple births. Independent factors associated with this desire were subsequently assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.Nearly a third of women preferred multiples over a singleton gestation. Nulliparity, lower annual household income, older maternal age, marital status, larger ideal family size, openness to multifetal reduction, and lack of knowledge of the maternal/fetal risks of twin pregnancies were associated with pregnancy desire. Older age (OR (95% CI) 1.66 (1.20-2.29)), nulliparity (OR (95% CI) 0.34 (0.20-0.58)), larger ideal family size (OR (95% CI) 2.34 (1.73-3.14)), and lesser knowledge of multifetal pregnancy risk (OR (95% CI) 0.67 (0.55-0.83)) were independently associated with desire.A large number of patients undergoing fertility treatment desire multifetal gestation. Although a lack of understanding of the risks associated with higher order pregnancies contributes to this desire, additional individual specific variables also contribute to this trend.

However, their cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms in the brain remain largely unclear. Here, we conducted an analysis of allele-specific expression quantitative trait loci (aseQTLs) for 33 AD-associated variants in four brain regions and seven cell types using ~3000 bulk RNA-seq samples and >0.25 million single nuclei. We first develop a flexible hierarchical Poisson mixed model (HPMM) and demonstrate its superior statistical power to a beta-binomial model achieved by unifying samples in both allelic and genotype-level expression data. Using the HPMM, we identified 24 (~73%) aseQTLs in at least one brain region, including three new eQTLs associated with CA12, CHRNE, and CASS4. Notably, the APOE ε4 variant reduces APOE expression across all regions, even in AD-unaffected controls. Our results reveal region-dependent and exon-specific effects of multiple aseQTLs, such as rs2093760 with CR1, rs7982 with CLU, and rs3865444 with CD33. In an attempt to pinpoint the cell types responsible for the observed tissue-level aseQTLs using the snRNA-seq data, we detected many aseQTLs in microglia or monocytes associated with immune-related genes, including HLA-DQB1, HLA-DQA2, CD33, FCER1G, MS4A6A, SPI1, and BIN1, highlighting the regulatory role of AD-associated variants in the immune response.

However, this progress has not been equally shared across all people and conditions, in part due to limited resources. Leveraging publicly available sequencing data as external common controls, rather than sequencing new controls for every study, can better allocate resources by augmenting control sample sizes or providing controls where none existed. However, common control studies must be carefully planned and executed as even small differences in sample ascertainment and processing can result in substantial bias.

Here we first outline the main approaches for describing expression evolution and their inherent biases. Next, we bridge the gap between the fields of phylogenetic comparative methods and transcriptomics to reinforce the main pitfalls of inferring selection on expression patterns and use simulation studies to show that shifts in tissue composition can heavily bias inferences of selection.

We identified 6,778,286cis-eQTL variant-gene transcript (eGene) pairs atp<5×10-8(2,855,111 uniquecis-eQTL variants and 15,982 unique eGenes) and 1,469,754trans-eQTL variant-eGene pairs atp<1e-12 (526,056 uniquetrans-eQTL variants and 7,233 unique eGenes). In addition, 442,379cis-eQTL variants were associated with expression of 1518 long non-protein coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Gene Ontology (GO) analyses revealed that the top GO terms forcis-eGenes are enriched for immune functions (FDR <0.05). Thecis-eQTL variants are enriched for SNPs reported to be associated with 815 traits in prior GWAS, including cardiovascular disease risk factors. As proof of concept, we used this eQTL resource in conjunction with genetic variants from public GWAS databases in causal inference testing (e.g., COVID-19 severity).

Unresolved problems include how to organize and prioritize between disease-associated changes in digital twins, on cellulome- and genome-wide scales. We present a dynamic framework that can be used to model such changes and thereby prioritize upstream regulators (URs) for biomarker- and drug discovery.We started with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) as a disease model, by analyses of in vitro allergen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SAR patients. Time-series a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of these cells were used to construct multicellular network models (MNMs) at each time point of molecular interactions between cell types. We hypothesized that predicted molecular interactions between cell types in the MNMs could be traced to find an UR gene, at an early time point. We performed bioinformatic and functional studies of the MNMs to develop a scalable framework to prioritize UR genes. This framework was tested on a single-cell and bulk-profiling data from SAR and other inflammatory diseases.Our scRNA-seq-based time-series MNMs of SAR showed thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across multiple cell types, which varied between time points. Instead of a single-UR gene in each MNM, we found multiple URs dispersed across the cell types. Thus, at each time point, the MNMs formed multi-directional networks. The absence of linear hierarchies and time-dependent variations in MNMs complicated the prioritization of URs. For example, the expression and functions of Th2 cytokines, which are approved drug targets in allergies, varied across cell types, and time points. Our analyses of bulk- and single-cell data from other inflammatory diseases also revealed multi-directional networks that showed stage-dependent variations. We therefore developed a quantitative approach to prioritize URs: we ranked the URs based on their predicted effects on downstream target cells. Experimental and bioinformatic analyses supported that this kind of ranking is a tractable approach for prioritizing URs.We present a scalable framework for modeling dynamic changes in digital twins, on cellulome- and genome-wide scales, to prioritize UR genes for biomarker and drug discovery.© 2022.

With unsupervised clustering algorithms we group these patient-specific networks into four distinct clusters driven by PRKCB, HLA, SNAI1/CEBPB/PTPN1 and VEGFA/XPO5/POLH hubs. The pathway analysis identifies calcium homeostasis, wound healing and cell motility as key processes in UC pathogenesis.

The genetic underpinnings of the treatment response are not well understood. We performed a pharmacogenomic study of the treatment response to risperidone in patients with schizophrenia by using a SNP microarray -based genome-wide association study (GWAS) and whole exome sequencing (WES)-based GWAS. DNA samples were collected from 189 patients for the GWAS and from 222 patients for the WES after quality control in multiple centers of China. Antipsychotic response phenotypes of patients who received eight weeks of risperidone treatment were quantified with percentage change on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The GWAS revealed a significant association between several SNPs and treatment response, such as three GRM7 SNPs (rs141134664, rs57521140, and rs73809055). Gene-based analysis in WES revealed 13 genes that were associated with antipsychotic response, such as GPR12 and MAP2K3. We did not identify shared loci or genes between GWAS and WES, but association signals tended to cluster into the GPCR gene family and GPCR signaling pathway, which may play an important role in the treatment response etiology. This study may provide a research paradigm for pharmacogenomic research, and these data provide a promising illustration of our potential to identify genetic variants underlying antipsychotic responses and may ultimately facilitate precision medicine in schizophrenia.© 2022.

It provides an overview of the principles and the evolution of methods for mapping the variation of complex traits, and methods for QTL-based prediction of human disease risk and animal and plant breeding value. The principles of linkage-based and linkage disequilibrium-based QTL mapping methods are described in the context of the simplest, single-marker, methods. Methodological evolutions are analysed in relation with their ability to account for the complexity of the genotype-phenotype relations. Main characteristics of the genetic architecture of complex traits, drawn from QTL mapping works using large populations of unrelated individuals, are presented. Methods combining marker-QTL association data into polygenic risk score that captures part of an individual's susceptibility to complex diseases are reviewed. Principles of best linear mixed model-based prediction of breeding value in animal- and plant-breeding programs using phenotypic and pedigree data, are summarized and methods for moving from BLUP to marker-QTL BLUP are presented.

"35440633","Redefining the hypotheses driving Parkinson's diseases research.","NPJ Parkinsons Dis","Parkinson's disease (PD) research has largely focused on the disease as a single entity centred on the development of neuronal pathology within the central nervous system. However, there is growing recognition that PD is not a single entity but instead reflects multiple diseases, in which different combinations of environmental, genetic and potential comorbid factors interact to direct individual disease trajectories. Moreover, an increasing body of recent research implicates peripheral tissues and non-neuronal cell types in the development of PD. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the initial causative changes for PD development need not occur in the central nervous system. Here, we discuss how the use of neuronal pathology as a shared, qualitative phenotype minimises insights into the possibility of multiple origins and aetiologies of PD. Furthermore, we discuss how considering PD as a single entity potentially impairs our understanding of the causative molecular mechanisms, approaches for patient stratification, identification of biomarkers, and the development of therapeutic approaches to PD. The clear consequence of there being distinct diseases that collectively form PD, is that there is no single biomarker or treatment for PD development or progression. We propose that diagnosis should shift away from the clinical definitions, towards biologically defined diseases that collectively form PD, to enable informative patient stratification. N-of-one type, clinical designs offer an unbiased, and agnostic approach to re-defining PD in terms of a group of many individual diseases.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35437332","Development of a clinical polygenic risk score assay and reporting workflow.","Nat Med","Implementation of polygenic risk scores (PRS) may improve disease prevention and management but poses several challenges: the construction of clinically valid assays, interpretation for individual patients, and the development of clinical workflows and resources to support their use in patient care. For the ongoing Veterans Affairs Genomic Medicine at Veterans Affairs (GenoVA) Study we developed a clinical genotype array-based assay for six published PRS. We used data from 36,423 Mass General Brigham Biobank participants and adjustment for population structure to replicate known PRS-disease associations and published PRS thresholds for a disease odds ratio (OR) of 2 (ranging from 1.75 (95% CI: 1.57-1.95) for type 2 diabetes to 2.38 (95% CI: 2.07-2.73) for breast cancer). After confirming the high performance and robustness of the pipeline for use as a clinical assay for individual patients, we analyzed the first 227 prospective samples from the GenoVA Study and found that the frequency of PRS corresponding to published OR > 2 ranged from 13/227 (5.7%) for colorectal cancer to 23/150 (15.3%) for prostate cancer. In addition to the PRS laboratory report, we developed physician- and patient-oriented informational materials to support decision-making about PRS results. Our work illustrates the generalizable development of a clinical PRS assay for multiple conditions and the technical, reporting and clinical workflow challenges for implementing PRS information in the clinic.© 2022.

"35565867","Vitamin D: Before, during and after Pregnancy: Effect on Neonates and Children.","Nutrients","A worldwide high prevalence of vitamin D (VD) deficiency has become of growing concern because of potential adverse effects on human health, including pregnant women and their offsprings. Beyond its classical function as a regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism, together with its fundamental role in bone health in every stage of life, its deficiency has been associated to multiple adverse health effects. The classic effects of VD deficiency in pregnancy and neonates have been late hypocalcemia and nutritional rickets. Nevertheless, recent studies have linked VD to fertility and 25(OH)D with several clinical conditions in pregnancy: preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, higher incidence of cesarean section and preterm birth, while in infants, the clinical conditions are low birth weight, lower bone mass and possible relationship with the development of such diseases as bronchiolitis, asthma, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and autism included as VD non-classical actions. The supplementation with Vitamin D and achievement of optimal levels reduce maternal-fetal and newborn complications. Supplementation in children with VD deficiency reduces the risk of respiratory infections and possibly autoimmune diseases and autism. This review emphasizes the roles of Vitamin D deficiency and the consequences of intervention from preconception to infancy."

It is well established that opioids and tobacco smoke induce a degree of immune activation, and recent work suggests that the combination of these drugs promotes further activation of the immune system. Our approach involved the treatment of wild-type mice with cigarette smoke (SM) for a period of eight weeks, and the chronic continuous administration of morphine (M)viamini-pumps for the final four weeks. In an effort to examine the responses of CD4+CD25highCD127lowregulatory T (Treg) cells, the major immune suppressive cell type, to the combined chronic administration of SM and M, we determined the frequency of these cells in the spleen, lymph nodes and lungs. Flow cytometric analyses showed that SM and M individually, and the combination (SM + M) have differential effects on the numbers of Treg in the spleen, lymph node, and lung. Either SM or M alone increased Treg cell numbers in the spleen, but SM+M did not. Furthermore, SM + M decreased Treg cell numbers in the lymph node and lung. We then performed RNA-Seq on Treg cells from mice treated with SM, M, or SM + M, and we found that the S + M induced a number of significant changes in the transcriptome, that were not as apparent following treatment with either SM or M alone. This included an activation of TWEAK, PI3K/AKT and OXPHOS pathways and a shift to Th17 immunity. Our results have provided novel insights on tissue Treg cell changes, which we suggest are the result of transcriptomic reprogramming induced by SM, M, and SM + M, respectively. We believe these results may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for suppressing smoke and opioid induced Treg cell impairment.Copyright © 2022 Shao, Cornwell, Xu, Kirchhoff, Saasoud, Lu, Jiang, Criner, Wang, Rogers and Yang."

Mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a prominent cellular mechanism involved in neurodegeneration, including Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative movement disorder, characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons and the occurrence of proteinaceous Lewy body inclusions. The contribution of mtDNA variants to PD pathogenesis has long been debated and is still not clearly answered. Cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) cell models provided evidence for a contribution of mtDNA variants to the PD phenotype. However, conclusive evidence of mtDNA mutations as genetic cause of PD is still lacking. Several models have shown a role of somatic, rather than inherited mtDNA variants in the impairment of mitochondrial function and neurodegeneration. Accordingly, several nuclear genes driving inherited forms of PD are linked to mtDNA quality control mechanisms, and idiopathic as well as familial PD tissues present increased mtDNA damage. In this review, we highlight the use of cybrids in this PD research field and summarize various aspects of how and to what extent mtDNA variants may contribute to the etiology of PD.© 2022.

"35484163","Direct observation of DNA alterations induced by a DNA disruptor.","Sci Rep","DNA alterations, such as base modifications and mutations, are closely related to the activity of transcription factors and the corresponding cell functions; therefore, detection of DNA alterations is important for understanding their relationships. Particularly, DNA alterations caused by exposure to exogenous molecules, such as nucleic acid analogues for cancer therapy and the corresponding changes in cell functions, are of interest in medicine for drug development and diagnosis purposes. However, detection of comprehensive direct evidence for the relationship of DNA modifications/mutations in genes, their effect on transcription factors, and the corresponding cell functions have been limited. In this study, we utilized a single-molecule electrical detection method for the direct observation of DNA alterations on transcription factor binding motifs upon exposure to a nucleic acid analogue, trifluridine (FTD), and evaluated the effects of the DNA alteration on transcriptional activity in cancer cell line cells. We found ~ 10% FTD incorporation at the transcription factor p53 binding regions in cancer cells exposed to FTD for 5 months. Additionally, through single-molecule analysis of p53-enriched DNA, we found that the FTD incorporation at the p53 DNA binding regions led to less binding, likely due to weaken the binding of p53. This work suggests that single-molecule detection of DNA sequence alterations is a useful methodology for understanding DNA sequence alterations.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35440061","Pioneer transcription factors are associated with the modulation of DNA methylation patterns across cancers.","Epigenetics Chromatin","Methylation of cytosines on DNA is a prominent modification associated with gene expression regulation. Aberrant DNA methylation patterns have recurrently been linked to dysregulation of the regulatory program in cancer cells. To shed light on the underlying molecular mechanism driving this process, we hypothesised that aberrant methylation patterns could be controlled by the binding of specific transcription factors (TFs) across cancer types. By combining DNA methylation arrays and gene expression data with TF binding sites (TFBSs), we explored the interplay between TF binding and DNA methylation in 19 cancer types. We performed emQTL (expression-methylation quantitative trait loci) analyses independently in each cancer type and identified 13 TFs whose expression levels are correlated with local DNA methylation patterns around their binding sites in at least 2 cancer types. The 13 TFs are mainly associated with local demethylation and are enriched for pioneer function, suggesting a specific role for these TFs in modulating chromatin structure and transcription in cancer patients. Furthermore, we confirmed that de novo methylation is precluded across cancers at CpGs lying in genomic regions enriched for TF binding signatures associated with SP1, CTCF, NRF1, GABPA, KLF9, and/or YY1. The modulation of DNA methylation associated with TF binding was observed at cis-regulatory regions controlling immune- and cancer-associated pathways, corroborating that the emQTL signals were derived from both cancer and tumor-infiltrating cells. As a case example, we experimentally confirmed that FOXA1 knock-down is associated with higher methylation in regions bound by FOXA1 in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. Finally, we reported physical interactions between FOXA1 with TET1 and TET2 both in an in vitro setup and in vivo at physiological levels in MCF-7 cells, adding further support for FOXA1 attracting TET1 and TET2 to induce local demethylation in cancer cells.© 2022.

"35546942","Immune System Abnormalities in Schizophrenia: An Integrative View and Translational Perspectives.","Front Psychiatry","The immune system is generally known to be the primary defense mechanism against pathogens. Any pathological conditions are reflected in anomalies in the immune system parameters. Increasing evidence suggests the involvement of immune dysregulation and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In this systematic review, we summarized the available evidence of abnormalities in the immune system in schizophrenia. We analyzed impairments in all immune system components and assessed the level of bias in the available evidence. It has been shown that schizophrenia is associated with abnormalities in all immune system components: from innate to adaptive immunity and from humoral to cellular immunity. Abnormalities in the immune organs have also been observed in schizophrenia. Evidence of increased C-reactive protein, dysregulation of cytokines and chemokines, elevated levels of neutrophils and autoantibodies, and microbiota dysregulation in schizophrenia have the lowest risk of bias. Peripheral immune abnormalities contribute to neuroinflammation, which is associated with cognitive and neuroanatomical alterations and contributes to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. However, signs of severe inflammation are observed in only about 1/3 of patients with schizophrenia. Immunological parameters may help identify subgroups of individuals with signs of inflammation who well respond to anti-inflammatory therapy. Our integrative approach also identified gaps in knowledge about immune abnormalities in schizophrenia, and new horizons for the research are proposed.Copyright © 2022 Ermakov, Melamud, Buneva and Ivanova."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a lethal vasculopathy associated with increased inflammation. Although PAH exhibits a higher prevalence among women, men have a poorer prognosis. We investigated the NLR as an independent predictor of transplant-free survival in PAH.We performed a retrospective analysis of 78 PAH patients from the Quebec PAHBiobank (71% female). We used univariate and multivariate (adjusted for age, sex, renal function, and disease severity) Cox regression analyses to assess the relationship between the NLR and transplant-free survival, in the whole sample, and according to sex. The NLR was categorized as high (≥ 4.8) or low (< 4.8) using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis estimated survival per NLR category.The NLR was higher in patients who died, compared to that in patients who had transplant-free survival (P< 0.05). The NLR was an independent predictor of event-free survival in PAH (unadjusted hazard ratio: 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.18, which remained significant after adjustment for covariates). The high-NLR group had lower 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival compared to those with a low NLR (P< 0.001). The NLR remains a predictor of survival in women.The NLR is an independent predictor of transplant-free survival in PAH. We report a potential sexual dimorphism in the ability of the NLR to predict mortality in PAH, emphasizing the importance of considering sex-related differences in the development of biomarkers in PAH.© 2021 The Authors."

Interestingly, NLR and CLR typically returned to near normal value as patients recover from severe infection. By contrast, deceased patients had persistent increased NLR and CLR until last day of hospitalization in ICU. ROC obtained for the above parameters showed that NLR and CLR were the most associated immunological parameters with the severity of COVID-19 disease. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, CLR > 69.46 is an independent prognostic factors in identifying critically ill COVID-19 cases. Study of the combined markers NLR and CLR showed that most of patients admitted in ICU were characterized with high NLR combined with high CLR, while most of healthy subjects and non-ICU group have low NLR combined with low CLR.The combination of NLR and CLR could improve the predictive efficacy compared to individual markers to segregate patients who will develop a severe disease from those with a mild pathology.Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

"35478270","CYP311A1 in the anterior midgut is involved in lipid distribution and microvillus integrity in Drosophila melanogaster.","Cell Mol Life Sci","Lipids are either taken up from food sources or produced internally in specialized tissues such as the liver. Among others, both routes of lipid metabolism involve cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs). We sought to analyze the function of Cyp311a1 that has been shown to be expressed in the midgut of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Using a GFP-tagged version of CYP311A1 that is expressed under the control of its endogenous promoter, we show that Cyp311a1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum in epithelial cells of the anterior midgut. In larvae with reduced Cyp311a1 expression in the anterior midgut, compared to control larvae, the apical plasma membrane of the respective epithelial cells contains less and shorter microvilli. In addition, we observed reduction of neutral lipids in the fat body, the insect liver, and decreased phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and triacylglycerols (TAG) amounts in the whole body of these larvae. Probably as a consequence, they cease to grow and eventually die. The microvillus defects in larvae with reduced Cyp311a1 expression are restored by supplying PE, a major phospholipid of plasma membranes, to the food. Moreover, the growth arrest phenotype of these larvae is partially rescued. Together, these results suggest that the anterior midgut is an import hub in lipid distribution and that the midgut-specific CYP311A1 contributes to this function by participating in shaping microvilli in a PE-dependent manner.© 2022.

As the interface between external and genetic factors, epigenetic modification such as DNA methylation may have latent effects on the aging rate at the molecular level. To understand the mechanism behind the impacts of dietary restriction and rapamycin on aging, DNA methylation and gene expression changes were measured in the hippocampi of different-aged mice. Examining the single-base resolution of DNA methylation, we discovered that both dietary restriction and rapamycin treatment can maintain DNA methylation in a younger state compared to normal-aged mice. Through functional enrichment analysis of genes in which DNA methylation or gene expression can be affected by DR/RALL, we found that DR/RALL may retard aging through a relationship in which DNA methylation and gene expression work together not only in the same gene but also in the same biological process. This study is instructive for understanding the maintenance of DNA methylation by DR/RALL in the aging process, as well as the role of DR and RALL in the amelioration of aging."

Epigenetic studies are a useful tool for determining the relationship between obesity and environment. Here, we show that the water extract of black tea (Lapsang souchong, LS) reverses HFD-induced gut dysbiosis, alters the tissue gene expression, changes the level of a major epigenetic modification (DNA methylation), and prevents obesity in HFD feeding mice. The anti-obesity properties of black tea are due to alkaloids, which are the principal active components. Our data indicate that the anti-obesity benefits of black tea are transmitted via fecal transplantation, and the change of tissue gene expression and the preventative effects on HFD-induced obesity in mice of black tea are dependent on the gut microbiota. We further show that black tea could regulate the DNA methylation of imprinted genes in the spermatozoa of high-fat diet mice. Our results show a mechanistic link between black tea, changes in the gut microbiota, epigenetic processes, and tissue gene expression in the modulation of diet-induced metabolic dysfunction."
"35458158","Time to Consider the ""Exposome Hypothesis"" in the Development of the Obesity Pandemic.","Nutrients","The obesity epidemic shows no signs of abatement. Genetics and overnutrition together with a dramatic decline in physical activity are the alleged main causes for this pandemic. While they undoubtedly represent the main contributors to the obesity problem, they are not able to fully explain all cases and current trends. In this context, a body of knowledge related to exposure to as yet underappreciated obesogenic factors, which can be referred to as the ""exposome"", merits detailed analysis. Contrarily to the genome, the ""exposome"" is subject to a great dynamism and variability, which unfolds throughout the individual's lifetime. The development of precise ways of capturing the full exposure spectrum of a person is extraordinarily demanding. Data derived from epidemiological studies linking excess weight with elevated ambient temperatures, in utero, and intergenerational effects as well as epigenetics, microorganisms, microbiota, sleep curtailment, and endocrine disruptors, among others, suggests the possibility that they may work alone or synergistically as several alternative putative contributors to this global epidemic. This narrative review reports the available evidence on as yet underappreciated drivers of the obesity epidemic. Broadly based interventions are needed to better identify these drivers at the same time as stimulating reflection on the potential relevance of the ""exposome"" in the development and perpetuation of the obesity epidemic."

The potential mechanism is that there is a critical period of brain development of the foetus, which is a result of selective adaptation to the external environment. The human glucocorticoid gene (NR3C1) is associated with memory and cognition. This study investigates the association between earthquake stress during pregnancy and CpG methylation of the NR3C1 exon 1Fpromoter and its influence on working memory in adulthood. DNA methylation analysis using bisulfite sequencing PCR was quantified in 176 subjects who were exposed or not exposed to intrauterine earthquake and were divided into three groups based on the pregnancy trimester. The Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) were used to assess working memory performance. The methylated NR3C1 exon 1Fpromoter of the prenatal earthquake exposure (PEE) group was significantly higher than that of the control group (CN). Analysis of subgroups indicated that the subjects in the second trimester of PEE group showed significantly higher methylation than those in the third trimester. Significantly low BVMT-R scores were detected in those who experienced prenatal earthquake in the second trimester of PEE group. Methylated CpG site 1 may play a critical role in contributing to lower BVMT-R scores in the second trimester in the PEE group, and may offer a potential epigenetic mechanism that links prenatal stress and long-term effects on working memory.© 2022.

Previously, ac4C mRNA modification has been reported promoting proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. However, it remains unclear whether and how ac4C-related mRNA modification patterns influencing the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Hereby, we constructed an ac4Cscore model and classified patients into two groups and investigated the potential intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of tumor. The ac4Cscore model, including COL15A1, G6PD and TP53I3, represented ac4C-related mRNA modification patterns in HCC. According to ac4Cscore, patients were stratified to high and low groups with distinct prognosis. Patients subject to high group was related to advanced tumor stage, higher TP53 mutation rate, higher tumor stemness, more activated pathways in DNA-repair system, lower stromal score, higher immune score and higher infiltrating of T cells regulatory. While patients attributed to low group were correlated with abundance of T cells CD4 memory, less aggressive immune subtype and durable therapy benefit. We also found ac4Cscore as a novel marker to predict patients' prognosis with anti-PD1 immunotherapy and/or mTOR inhibitor treatment. Our study for the first time showed the association between ac4C-related mRNA modification patterns and tumor intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics, thus influencing the prognosis of patients.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Zhang, Qiu, Zhang, Meng, Huang, Chen, Zhang and Han."

Several mechanisms proposed as explanations for gender bias, including skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and dosage or sex hormones, are often involved in the development of autoimmunity. The skewed XCI pattern can lead to an unbalanced expression of some X-linked genes, as observed in several autoimmune disorders characterized by female predominance. No data are yet available regarding XCI and MG. We hypothesize that the preferential XCI pattern may contribute to the female bias observed in the onset of MG, especially among younger women. XCI analysis was performed on blood samples of 284 women between the ages of 20 and 82. XCI was tested using the Human Androgen Receptor Assay (HUMARA). XCI patterns were classified as random (XCI &lt; 75%) and preferential (XCI ≥ 75%). In 121 informative patients, the frequency of skewed XCI patterns was 47%, significantly higher than in healthy controls (17%;p≤ 0.00001). Interestingly, the phenomenon was observed mainly in younger patients (&lt;45 years;p≤ 0.00001). Furthermore, considering the XCI pattern and the other clinical characteristics of patients, no significant differences were found.

To explore the influence of region-specific radiotherapy on blood DNA methylation, we designed a computational workflow by using machine learning methods that can identify crucial methylation alterations related to treatment exposure. Irrelevant methylation features from the DNA methylation profiles of 2052 childhood cancer survivors were excluded via the Boruta method, and the remaining features were ranked using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance method to generate feature lists. These feature lists were then fed into the incremental feature selection method, which uses a combination of deep forest, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and decision tree to find the most important methylation signatures and build the best classifiers and classification rules. Several methylation signatures and rules have been discovered and confirmed, allowing for a better understanding of methylation patterns in response to different treatment exposures."

Using iCMM, we determined cellular changes by altering mitochondrial morphology in an unprecedented manner. This approach serves as a platform for developing more sophisticated synthetic biomolecular devices to regulate biological systems by extending manipulation targets from conventional biomolecules to mitochondria. Furthermore, iCMM might serve as a tool for uncovering the biological significance of mitochondrial morphology in various physiopathological cellular processes.© 2021 The Authors."

Although genomic studies of cancer in non-human primates have been hampered by a lack of tools, recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of using human exome capture reagents across primates.In this proof-of-principle study, we applied human exome capture reagents to tumor-normal pairs from five lemurs with hepatocellular carcinoma to characterize the mutational landscape of this disease in lemurs.Several genes implicated in human hepatocellular carcinoma, includingARID1A,TP53andCTNNB1, were mutated in multiple lemurs, and analysis of cancer driver genes mutated in these samples identified enrichment of genes involved withTP53degradation and regulation. In addition to these similarities with human hepatocellular carcinoma, we also noted unique features, including six genes that contain mutations in all five lemurs. Interestingly, these genes are infrequently mutated in human hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting potential differences in the etiology and/or progression of this cancer in lemurs and humans.Collectively, this pilot study suggests that human exome capture reagents are a promising tool for genomic studies of cancer in lemurs and other non-human primates.Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs frequently in prosimians, but the cause of these liver cancers is unknown.

For five of the families, paternal exposure to chemotherapeutic agents before conception was probably a key driver of hypermutation. Our results suggest that the germline is well protected from mutagenic effects, hypermutation is rare, the number of excess mutations is relatively modest and most individuals with a hypermutated genome will not have a genetic disease.© 2022.

"35527780","Genome maintenance in retinoblastoma: Implications for therapeutic vulnerabilities.","Oncol Lett","Retinoblastoma (RB) is a pediatric ocular malignancy that is initiated mostly by biallelic inactivation of the RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) tumor suppressor gene in the developing retina. Unlike the prevailing prediction based on multiple studies involvingRB1gene disruption in experimental models, human RB tumors have been demonstrated to possess a relatively stable genome, characterized by a low mutation rate and a few recurrent chromosomal alterations related to somatic copy number changes. This suggests that RB may harbor heightened genome maintenance mechanisms to counteract or compensate for the risk of massive genome instability, which can potentially be driven by the earlyRB1loss as a tumor-initiating event. Although the genome maintenance mechanisms might have been evolved to promote RB cell survival by preventing lethal genomic defects, emerging evidence suggests that the dependency of RB cells on these mechanisms also exposes their unique vulnerability to chemotherapy, particularly when the genome maintenance machineries are tumor cell-specific. This review summarizes the genome maintenance mechanisms identified in RB, including findings on the roles of chromatin regulators in DNA damage response/repair and protein factors involved in maintaining chromosome stability and promoting survival in RB. In addition, advantages and challenges for exploiting these therapeutic vulnerabilities in RB are discussed.Copyright: © Lee et al."
"35495172","Unraveling the Genetic Architecture of Hepatoblastoma Risk: Birth Defects and Increased Burden of Germline Damaging Variants in Gastrointestinal/Renal Cancer Predisposition and DNA Repair Genes.","Front Genet","The ultrarare hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common pediatric liver cancer. HB risk is related to a few rare syndromes, and the molecular bases remain elusive for most cases. We investigated the burden of rare damaging germline variants in 30 Brazilian patients with HB and the presence of additional clinical signs. A high frequency of prematurity (20%) and birth defects (37%), especially craniofacial (17%, including craniosynostosis) and kidney (7%) anomalies, was observed. Putative pathogenic or likely pathogenic monoallelic germline variants mapped to 10 cancer predisposition genes (CPGs:APC, CHEK2, DROSHA, ERCC5, FAH, MSH2, MUTYH,RPS19, TGFBR2andVHL) were detected in 33% of the patients, only 40% of them with a family history of cancer. These findings showed a predominance of CPGs with a known link to gastrointestinal/colorectal and renal cancer risk. A remarkable feature was an enrichment of rare damaging variants affecting different classes of DNA repair genes, particularly those known as Fanconi anemia genes. Moreover, several potentially deleterious variants mapped to genes impacting liver functions were disclosed. To our knowledge, this is the largest assessment of rare germline variants in HB patients to date, contributing to elucidate the genetic architecture of HB risk.Copyright © 2022 Aguiar, Teixeira, Scliar, Sobral de Barros, Lemes, Souza, Tolezano, Santos, Tojal, Cypriano, Caminada de Toledo, Valadares, Borges Pinto, Pinto Artigalas, Caetano de Aguirre Neto, Novak, Cristofani, Miura Sugayama, Odone, Cunha, Lima da Costa, Rosenberg and Krepischi."

However, publicly available cell-specific genetic variants are not explained by well-established guidelines. Additionally, cell-specific variants interpretation and classification has remained a challenging task and lacks standardization. The Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) published the first consensus guidelines for cell-specific variants cataloging and clinical annotations.AMP-ASCO-CAP recommended sources and information were downloaded and used as follows: relative knowledge in oncology clinical practice guidelines; approved, investigative or preclinical drugs; supporting literature and each gene-tumor site correlation. All information was homogenized into a single knowledgebase. Finally, we incorporated the consensus recommendations into a new computational method.A subset of cancer genetic variants was manually curated to benchmark our method and well-known computational algorithms. We applied the new method on freely available tumor-specific databases to produce a clinically actionable cancer somatic variants (CACSV) dataset in an easy-to-integrate format for most clinical analytical workflows. The research also showed the current challenges and limitations of using different classification systems or computational methods.CACSV is a step toward cell-specific genetic variants standardized interpretation as it is readily adaptable by most clinical laboratory pipelines for somatic variants clinical annotations.

"35444284","Somatic genomic changes in single Alzheimer's disease neurons.","Nature","Dementia in Alzheimer's disease progresses alongside neurodegeneration1-4, but the specific events that cause neuronal dysfunction and death remain poorly understood. During normal ageing, neurons progressively accumulate somatic mutations5at rates similar to those of dividing cells6,7which suggests that genetic factors, environmental exposures or disease states might influence this accumulation5. Here we analysed single-cell whole-genome sequencing data from 319 neurons from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and neurotypical control individuals. We found that somatic DNA alterations increase in individuals with Alzheimer's disease, with distinct molecular patterns. Normal neurons accumulate mutations primarily in an age-related pattern (signature A), which closely resembles 'clock-like' mutational signatures that have been previously described in healthy and cancerous cells6-10. In neurons affected by Alzheimer's disease, additional DNA alterations are driven by distinct processes (signature C) that highlight C>A and other specific nucleotide changes. These changes potentially implicate nucleotide oxidation4,11, which we show is increased in Alzheimer's-disease-affected neurons in situ. Expressed genes exhibit signature-specific damage, and mutations show a transcriptional strand bias, which suggests that transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair has a role in the generation of mutations. The alterations in Alzheimer's disease affect coding exons and are predicted to create dysfunctional genetic knockout cells and proteostatic stress. Our results suggest that known pathogenic mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease may lead to genomic damage to neurons that can progressively impair function. The aberrant accumulation of DNA alterations in neurodegeneration provides insight into the cascade of molecular and cellular events that occurs in the development of Alzheimer's disease.© 2022.

Participants were categorized into two groups: full breastfeeding (FB) and non-full breastfeeding (NFB) groups. Postpartum weight changes between the FB (n = 26,340) and NFB (n = 38,129) groups were compared.At 6 months postpartum, mean weight retention was significantly lower in the FB group than in the NFB group (0.2 vs 0.8 kg, respectively, p<0.001). Weight retention differed by pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), with postpartum weights of overweight (pre-pregnancy BMI 25.0-29.9) and obese (pre-pregnancy BMI ≥30.0) participants being lower than pre-pregnancy weight; this trend was more pronounced in the FB group than in the NFB group (overweight: -2.2 vs -0.7 kg, respectively; obese: -4.8 vs -3.4 kg, respectively). Factors affecting weight retention at 6 months postpartum were weight gain during pregnancy (β = 0.43; p<0.001), pre-pregnancy BMI (β = -0.147; p<0.001) and feeding method. FB resulted in lower weight retention than NFB (β = -0.107; p<0.001).Breastfeeding reduced maternal weight retention, which was greater in mothers who were obese before pregnancy.

"35581264","Differential regulation of alternative promoters emerges from unified kinetics of enhancer-promoter interaction.","Nat Commun","Many eukaryotic genes contain alternative promoters with distinct expression patterns. How these promoters are differentially regulated remains elusive. Here, we apply single-molecule imaging to quantify the transcriptional regulation of two alternative promoters (P1 and P2) of the Bicoid (Bcd) target gene hunchback in syncytial blastoderm Drosophila embryos. Contrary to the previous notion that Bcd only activates P2, we find that Bcd activates both promoters via the same two enhancers. P1 activation is less frequent and requires binding of more Bcd molecules than P2 activation. Using a theoretical model to relate promoter activity to enhancer states, we show that the two promoters follow common transcription kinetics driven by sequential Bcd binding at the two enhancers. Bcd binding at either enhancer primarily activates P2, while P1 activation relies more on Bcd binding at both enhancers. These results provide a quantitative framework for understanding the kinetic mechanisms of complex eukaryotic gene regulation.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35563693","Role of Respiratory Epithelial Cells in Allergic Diseases.","Cells","The airway epithelium provides the first line of defense to the surrounding environment. However, dysfunctions of this physical barrier are frequently observed in allergic diseases, which are tightly connected with pro- or anti-inflammatory processes. When the epithelial cells are confronted with allergens or pathogens, specific response mechanisms are set in motion, which in homeostasis, lead to the elimination of the invaders and leave permanent traces on the respiratory epithelium. However, allergens can also cause damage in the sensitized organism, which can be ascribed to the excessive immune reactions. The tight interaction of epithelial cells of the upper and lower airways with local and systemic immune cells can leave an imprint that may mirror the pathophysiology. The interaction with effector T cells, along with the macrophages, play an important role in this response, as reflected in the gene expression profiles (transcriptomes) of the epithelial cells, as well as in the secretory pattern (secretomes). Further, the storage of information from past exposures as memories within discrete cell types may allow a tissue to inform and fundamentally alter its future responses. Recently, several lines of evidence have highlighted the contributions from myeloid cells, lymphoid cells, stromal cells, mast cells, and epithelial cells to the emerging concepts of inflammatory memory and trained immunity."
"35562359","Modulating gene regulation function by chemically controlled transcription factor clustering.","Nat Commun","Recent studies have suggested that transcriptional protein condensates (or clusters) may play key roles in gene regulation and cell fate determination. However, it remains largely unclear how the gene regulation function is quantitatively tuned by transcription factor (TF) clustering and whether TF clustering may confer emergent behaviors as in cell fate control systems. Here, to address this, we construct synthetic TFs whose clustering behavior can be chemically controlled. Through single-parameter tuning of the system (i.e., TF clustering propensity), we provide lines of evidence supporting the direct transcriptional activation and amplification of target genes by TF clustering. Single-gene imaging suggests that such amplification results from the modulation of transcriptional dynamics. Importantly, TF clustering propensity modulates the gene regulation function by significantly tuning the effective TF binding affinity and to a lesser extent the ultrasensitivity, contributing to bimodality and sustained response behavior that are reminiscent of canonical cell fate control systems. Collectively, these results demonstrate that TF clustering can modulate the gene regulation function to enable emergent behaviors, and highlight the potential applications of chemically controlled protein clustering.© 2022.

"35533073","Strengthening Causal Inference in Exposomics Research: Application of Genetic Data and Methods.","Environ Health Perspect","Advances in technologies to measure a broad set of exposures have led to a range of exposome research efforts. Yet, these efforts have insufficiently integrated methods that incorporate genetic data to strengthen causal inference, despite evidence that many exposome-associated phenotypes are heritable. Objective: We demonstrate how integration of methods and study designs that incorporate genetic data can strengthen causal inference in exposomics research by helping address six challenges: reverse causation and unmeasured confounding, comprehensive examination of phenotypic effects, low efficiency, replication, multilevel data integration, and characterization of tissue-specific effects. Examples are drawn from studies of biomarkers and health behaviors, exposure domains where the causal inference methods we describe are most often applied. Discussion: Technological, computational, and statistical advances in genotyping, imputation, and analysis, combined with broad data sharing and cross-study collaborations, offer multiple opportunities to strengthen causal inference in exposomics research. Full application of these opportunities will require an expanded understanding of genetic variants that predict exposome phenotypes as well as an appreciation that the utility of genetic variants for causal inference will vary by exposure and may depend on large sample sizes. However, several of these challenges can be addressed through international scientific collaborations that prioritize data sharing. Ultimately, we anticipate that efforts to better integrate methods that incorporate genetic data will extend the reach of exposomics research by helping address the challenges of comprehensively measuring the exposome and its health effects across studies, the life course, and in varied contexts and diverse populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9098."
"35519825","Powerful eQTL mapping through low-coverage RNA sequencing.","HGG Adv","Mapping genetic variants that regulate gene expression (eQTL mapping) in large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies is often employed to understand functional consequences of regulatory variants. However, the high cost of RNA-seq limits sample size, sequencing depth, and, therefore, discovery power in eQTL studies. In this work, we demonstrate that, given a fixed budget, eQTL discovery power can be increased by lowering the sequencing depth per sample and increasing the number of individuals sequenced in the assay. We perform RNA-seq of whole-blood tissue across 1,490 individuals at low coverage (5.9 million reads/sample) and show that the effective power is higher than that of an RNA-seq study of 570 individuals at moderate coverage (13.9 million reads/sample). Next, we leverage synthetic datasets derived from real RNA-seq data (50 million reads/sample) to explore the interplay of coverage and number individuals in eQTL studies, and show that a 10-fold reduction in coverage leads to only a 2.5-fold reduction in statistical power to identify eQTLs. Our work suggests that lowering coverage while increasing the number of individuals in RNA-seq is an effective approach to increase discovery power in eQTL studies.© 2022 The Authors."

FTD patients carrying specific mutations were at higher risk for some psychiatric disorders, and vice versa, implying potential shared genetic etiology, which is still less explored.We examined the genetic correlation using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies and analyzed their genetic enrichment leveraging the conditional false discovery rate method. Furthermore, we explored the causal association between FTD and psychiatric disorders with Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.We identified a significant genetic correlation between FTD and schizophrenia at both genetic and transcriptomic levels. Meanwhile, robust genetic enrichment was observed between FTD and schizophrenia and alcohol use disorder. Seven shared genetic loci were identified, which were mainly involved in interleukin-induced signaling, synaptic vesicle, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathways. By integrating cis-expression quantitative trait loci analysis, we identified MAPT and CADM2 as shared risk genes. MR analysis showed mutual causation between FTD and schizophrenia with nominal association.Our findings provide evidence of shared etiology between FTD and schizophrenia and indicate potential common molecular mechanisms contributing to the overlapping pathophysiological and clinical characteristics. Our results also demonstrate the essential role of autoimmunity in these diseases. These findings provide a better understanding of the pleiotropy between FTD and psychiatric disorders and have implications for therapeutic trials.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The next key step is to understand the function of these SNPs and the downstream biology through which they exert the effect on the development of AD. However, this remains a challenging task due to the tissue-specific nature of transcriptomic and proteomic data and the limited availability of brain tissue.In this paper, instead of using coupled transcriptomic data, we performed an integrative analysis of existing GWAS findings and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) results from AD-related brain regions to estimate the transcriptomic alterations in AD brain.We used summary-based mendelian randomization method along with heterogeneity in dependent instruments method and were able to identify 32 genes with potential altered levels in temporal cortex region. Among these, 10 of them were further validated using real gene expression data collected from temporal cortex region, and 19 SNPs from NECTIN and TOMM40 genes were found associated with multiple temporal cortex imaging phenotype.Significant pathways from enriched gene networks included neutrophil degranulation, Cell surface interactions at the vascular wall, and Regulation of TP53 activity which are still relatively under explored in Alzheimer's Disease while also encouraging a necessity to bind further trans-eQTL effects into this integrative analysis.© 2022.

We aimed to identify genes that confer PTSD risk through their effects on brain protein abundance to provide new insights into PTSD pathogenesis. To that end, we integrated human brain proteomes with PTSD GWAS results to perform a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) of PTSD, followed by Mendelian randomization, using a discovery and confirmatory study design. Brain proteomes (N = 525) were profiled from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using mass spectrometry. The Million Veteran Program (MVP) PTSD GWAS (n = 186,689) was used for the discovery PWAS, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium PTSD GWAS (n = 174,659) was used for the confirmatory PWAS. To understand whether genes identified at the protein-level were also evident at the transcript-level, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using human brain transcriptomes (N = 888) and the MVP PTSD GWAS results. We identified 11 genes that contribute to PTSD pathogenesis via their respective cis-regulated brain protein abundance. Seven of 11 genes (64%) replicated in the confirmatory PWAS and 4 of 11 also had their cis-regulated brain mRNA levels associated with PTSD. High confidence level was assigned to 9 of 11 genes after considering evidence from the confirmatory PWAS and TWAS. Most of the identified genes are expressed in other PTSD-relevant brain regions and several are preferentially expressed in excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. These genes are novel, promising targets for mechanistic and therapeutic studies to find new treatments for PTSD.© 2022.

Similar processes in mammals can also affect phenotype through intergenerational or trans-generational mechanisms. Here we generate a luciferase knock-in reporter mouse for the imprinted Dlk1 locus to visualise and track epigenetic fidelity across generations. Exposure to high-fat diet in pregnancy provokes sustained re-expression of the normally silent maternal Dlk1 in offspring (loss of imprinting) and increased DNA methylation at the somatic differentially methylated region (sDMR). In the next generation heterogeneous Dlk1 mis-expression is seen exclusively among animals born to F1-exposed females. Oocytes from these females show altered gene and microRNA expression without changes in DNA methylation, and correct imprinting is restored in subsequent generations.

Large scale sequencing studies have identified over one hundred ASD risk genes. Nevertheless, the vast majority of ASD risk genes remain to be discovered, as it is estimated that more than 1000 genes are likely to be involved in ASD risk. Prioritization of risk genes is an effective strategy to increase the power of identifying novel risk genes in genetics studies of ASD. As ASD risk genes are likely to exhibit distinct properties from multiple angles, we reason that integrating multiple levels of genomic data is a powerful approach to pinpoint genuine ASD risk genes.We present BNScore, a Bayesian model selection framework to probabilistically prioritize ASD risk genes through explicitly integrating evidence from sequencing-identified ASD genes, biological annotations, and gene functional network. We demonstrate the validity of our approach and its improved performance over existing methods by examining the resulting top candidate ASD risk genes against sets of high-confidence benchmark genes and large-scale ASD genome-wide association studies. We assess the tissue-, cell type- and development stage-specific expression properties of top prioritized genes, and find strong expression specificity in brain tissues, striatal medium spiny neurons, and fetal developmental stages.In summary, we show that by integrating sequencing findings, functional annotation profiles, and gene-gene functional network, our proposed BNScore provides competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods in prioritizing ASD genes.

"35465097","Validation of Candidate Sleep Disorder Risk Genes Using Zebrafish.","Front Mol Neurosci","Sleep disorders and chronic sleep disturbances are common and are associated with cardio-metabolic diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. Several genetic pathways and neuronal mechanisms that regulate sleep have been described in animal models, but the genes underlying human sleep variation and sleep disorders are largely unknown. Identifying these genes is essential in order to develop effective therapies for sleep disorders and their associated comorbidities. To address this unmet health problem, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic variants associated with human sleep traits and sleep disorders. However, in most cases, it is unclear which gene is responsible for a sleep phenotype that is associated with a genetic variant. As a result, it is necessary to experimentally validate candidate genes identified by GWAS using an animal model. Rodents are ill-suited for this endeavor due to their poor amenability to high-throughput sleep assays and the high costs associated with generating, maintaining, and testing large numbers of mutant lines. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), an alternative vertebrate model for studying sleep, allows for the rapid and cost-effective generation of mutant lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Numerous zebrafish mutant lines can then be tested in parallel using high-throughput behavioral assays to identify genes whose loss affects sleep. This process identifies a gene associated with each GWAS hit that is likely responsible for the human sleep phenotype. This strategy is a powerful complement to GWAS approaches and holds great promise to identify the genetic basis for common human sleep disorders.Copyright © 2022 Tran and Prober."

We analysed variants in genes involved in anthracycline metabolism (ABCB1,ABCC2,NQO1,CBR3, andSLC22A16) and in ifosfamide catabolism (ALDH1A1) in 79 treated patients. Two genes showed significant association after adjusted multivariate analysis:ABCC2andALDH1A1. In patients treated with anthracyclines,ABCC2rs3740066 was associated with risk of febrile neutropenia (p= 0.031), and with decreased overall survival (OS) (p= 0.024).ABCC2rs2273697 was associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS) (p= 0.024). In patients treated with ifosfamide,ALDH1A1rs3764435 was associated with RFS (p= 0.046).

These molecularly coordinated regions are named ""variable chromatin modules"" (VCMs), providing a conceptual framework of how regulatory variation might shape complex traits. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying VCM formation, here, we mechanistically dissect a VCM-modulating noncoding variant that is associated with reduced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) predisposition and disease progression. This common, germline variant constitutes a 5-bp indel that controls the activity of an AXIN2 gene-linked VCM by creating a MEF2 binding site, which, upon binding, activates a super-enhancer-like regulatory element. This triggers a large change in TF binding activity and chromatin state at an enhancer cluster spanning >150 kb, coinciding with subtle, long-range chromatin compaction and robust AXIN2 up-regulation. Our results support a model in which the indel acts as an AXIN2 VCM-activating TF nucleation event, which modulates CLL pathology.© 2022. The Author(s)."

We used GWAS summary data of DVT from the UK Biobank (UK Biobank fields: 20002) and GWAS summary data of blood metabolites from a previously published study (including 529 metabolites in plasma or serum from 7824 adults from two European population studies) for genetic correlation analysis. Then, we conducted a causal study between the screened blood metabolites and DVT by Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. In the first stage, genetic correlation analysis identified 9 blood metabolites that demonstrated a suggestive association with DVT. These metabolites included Valine (correlation coefficient = 0.2440, P value = 0.0430), Carnitine (correlation coefficient = 0.1574, P value = 0.0146), Hydroxytryptophan (correlation coefficient = 0.2376, P value = 0.0360), and 1-stearoylglycerophosphoethanolamine (correlation coefficient = - 0.3850, P value = 0.0258). Then, based on the IVW MR model, we analysed the causal relationship between the screened blood metabolites and DVT and found that there was a suggestive causal relationship between Hydroxytryptophan (exposure) and DVT (outcome) (β = - 0.0378, se = 0.0163, P = 0.0204). Our study identified a set of candidate blood metabolites that showed a suggestive association with DVT. We hope that our findings will provide new insights into the pathogenesis and diagnosis of DVT in the future.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35546551","Genetic analyses identify pleiotropy and causality for blood proteins and highlight Wnt/β-catenin signalling in migraine.","Nat Commun","Migraine is a common complex disorder with a significant polygenic SNP heritability ([Formula: see text]). Here we utilise genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics to study pleiotropy between blood proteins and migraine under the polygenic model. We estimate [Formula: see text] for 4625 blood protein GWASs and identify 325 unique proteins with a significant [Formula: see text] for use in subsequent genetic analyses. Pleiotropy analyses link 58 blood proteins to migraine risk at genome-wide, gene and/or single-nucleotide polymorphism levels-suggesting shared genetic influences or causal relationships. Notably, the identified proteins are largely distinct from migraine GWAS loci. We show that higher levels of DKK1 and PDGFB, and lower levels of FARS2, GSTA4 and CHIC2 proteins have a significant causal effect on migraine. The risk-increasing effect of DKK1 is particularly interesting-indicating a role for downregulation of β-catenin-dependent Wnt signalling in migraine risk, suggesting Wnt activators that restore Wnt/β-catenin signalling in brain could represent therapeutic tools against migraine.© 2022.

"35546142","Meta-analysis of sub-Saharan African studies provides insights into genetic architecture of lipid traits.","Nat Commun","Genetic associations for lipid traits have identified hundreds of variants with clear differences across European, Asian and African studies. Based on a sub-Saharan-African GWAS for lipid traits in the population cross-sectional AWI-Gen cohort (N = 10,603) we report a novel LDL-C association in the GATB region (P-value=1.56 × 10-8). Meta-analysis with four other African cohorts (N = 23,718) provides supporting evidence for the LDL-C association with the GATB/FHIP1A region and identifies a novel triglyceride association signal close to the FHIT gene (P-value =2.66 × 10-8). Our data enable fine-mapping of several well-known lipid-trait loci including LDLR, PMFBP1 and LPA. The transferability of signals detected in two large global studies (GLGC and PAGE) consistently improves with an increase in the size of the African replication cohort. Polygenic risk score analysis shows increased predictive accuracy for LDL-C levels with the narrowing of genetic distance between the discovery dataset and our cohort. Novel discovery is enhanced with the inclusion of African data.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35534559","Within-sibship genome-wide association analyses decrease bias in estimates of direct genetic effects.","Nat Genet","Estimates from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of unrelated individuals capture effects of inherited variation (direct effects), demography (population stratification, assortative mating) and relatives (indirect genetic effects). Family-based GWAS designs can control for demographic and indirect genetic effects, but large-scale family datasets have been lacking. We combined data from 178,086 siblings from 19 cohorts to generate population (between-family) and within-sibship (within-family) GWAS estimates for 25 phenotypes. Within-sibship GWAS estimates were smaller than population estimates for height, educational attainment, age at first birth, number of children, cognitive ability, depressive symptoms and smoking. Some differences were observed in downstream SNP heritability, genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization analyses. For example, the within-sibship genetic correlation between educational attainment and body mass index attenuated towards zero. In contrast, analyses of most molecular phenotypes (for example, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) were generally consistent. We also found within-sibship evidence of polygenic adaptation on taller height. Here, we illustrate the importance of family-based GWAS data for phenotypes influenced by demographic and indirect genetic effects.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Prior GWAS for leukocyte TL have been limited to European and Asian populations. Here, we report the first sequencing-based association study for TL across ancestrally-diverse individuals (European, African, Asian and Hispanic/Latino) from the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program. We used whole genome sequencing (WGS) of whole blood for variant genotype calling and the bioinformatic estimation of telomere length in n=109,122 individuals. We identified 59 sentinel variants (p-value <5×10-9) in 36 loci associated with telomere length, including 20 newly associated loci (13 were replicated in external datasets). There was little evidence of effect size heterogeneity across populations. Fine-mapping atOBFC1indicated the independent signals colocalized with cell-type specific eQTLs forOBFC1(STN1). Using a multi-variant gene-based approach, we identified two genes newly implicated in telomere length,DCLRE1B(SNM1B) andPARN. In PheWAS, we demonstrated our TL polygenic trait scores (PTS) were associated with increased risk of cancer-related phenotypes."

Inflammatory signatures are also related to neurobiological and behavioral changes in psychosis. Relationships between systemic inflammation and cardiometabolic genetic risk in persons with psychosis have not been examined. Thirteen peripheral inflammatory markers and genome-wide genotyping were assessed in 122 participants (n ​= ​86 psychosis, n ​= ​36 healthy controls) of European ancestry. Cluster analyses of inflammatory markers classified higher and lower inflammation subgroups. Single-trait genetic risk scores (GRS) were constructed for each participant using previously reported GWAS summary statistics for the following traits: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, coronary artery disease, type-2 diabetes, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and waist-to-hip ratio. Genetic correlations across traits were quantified. Principal component (PC) analysis of the cardiometabolic GRSs generated six PC loadings used in regression models to examine associations with inflammation markers. Functional module discovery explored biological mechanisms of the inflammation association of cardiometabolic GRS genes. A subgroup of 38% persons with psychotic disorders was characterized with higher inflammation status. These higher inflammation individuals had lower BACS scores (p ​= ​0.038) compared to those with lower inflammation. The first PC of the cardiometabolic GRS matrix was related to higher inflammation status in persons with psychotic disorders (OR ​= ​2.037,p ​= ​0.001). Two of eight modules within the functional interaction network of cardiometabolic GRS genes were enriched for immune processes. Cardiometabolic genetic risk may predispose some individuals with psychosis to elevated inflammation which adversely impacts cognition associated with illness.© 2022 The Author(s)."

Endometriosis GWAS from the International Endogene Consortium (IEC, 17 054 cases and 191 858 controls) and asthma GWAS from the United Kingdom Biobank (UKB, 26 332 cases and 375 505 controls) were analysed. Additional asthma data from the Trans-National Asthma Genetic Consortium (TAGC, 19 954 cases and 107 715 controls) were utilized for replication testing.We assessed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-level genetic overlap and correlation between endometriosis and asthma using SNP effect concordance analysis (SECA) and linkage disequilibrium score regression analysis (LDSC) methods, respectively. GWAS meta-analysis, colocalization (GWAS-PW), gene-based and pathway-based functional enrichment analysis methods were applied, respectively, to identify SNP loci, genomic regions, genes and biological pathways shared by endometriosis and asthma. Potential causal associations between endometriosis and asthma were assessed using Mendelian randomization (MR) methods.SECA revealed significant concordance of SNP risk effects across the IEC endometriosis and the UKB asthma GWAS. Also, LDSC analysis found a positive and significant genetic correlation (rG = 0.16, P = 2.01 × 10-6) between the two traits. GWAS meta-analysis of the IEC endometriosis and UKB asthma GWAS identified 14 genome-wide significant (Pmeta-analysis < 5.0 × 10-8) independent loci, five of which are putatively novel. Three of these loci were consistently replicated using TAGC asthma GWAS and reinforced in colocalization and gene-based analyses. Additional shared genomic regions were identified in the colocalization analysis. MR found no evidence of a significant causal association between endometriosis and asthma. However, combining gene-based association results across the GWAS for endometriosis and asthma, we identified 17 shared genes with a genome-wide significant Fisher's combined P-value (FCPgene) <2.73 × 10-6. Additional analyses (independent gene-based analysis) replicated evidence of gene-level genetic overlap between endometriosis and asthma. Biological mechanisms including 'thyroid hormone signalling', 'abnormality of immune system physiology', 'androgen biosynthetic process' and 'brain-derived neurotrophic factor signalling pathway', among others, were significantly enriched for endometriosis and asthma in a pathway-based analysis.The GWAS for endometriosis data were sourced from the International Endogen Consortium (IEC) and can be accessed by contacting the consortium. The GWAS data for asthma are freely available online at Lee Lab (https://www.leelabsg.org/resources) and from the Trans-National Asthma Genetic Consortium (TAGC).Given we analysed GWAS datasets from mainly European populations, our results may not be generalizable to other ancestries.This study provides novel insights into mechanisms underpinning endometriosis and asthma, and potentially their observed relationship. Findings support a co-occurring relationship of endometriosis with asthma largely due to shared genetic components. Agents targeting 'selective androgen receptor modulators' may be therapeutically relevant in both disorders.

Elucidating shared CAD/pneumonia pathways may reveal novel insights regarding CAD pathways. We performed genome-wide pleiotropy analyses of CAD and pneumonia, examined the causal effects of the expression of genes near independently replicated SNPs and interacting genes with CAD and pneumonia, and tested interactions between disruptive coding mutations of each pleiotropic gene and smoking status on CAD and pneumonia risks. Identified pleiotropic SNPs were annotated toADAMTS7andIL6R. IncreasedADAMTS7expression across tissues consistently showed decreased risk for CAD and increased risk for pneumonia; increasedIL6Rexpression showed increased risk for CAD and decreased risk for pneumonia. We similarly observed opposing CAD/pneumonia effects forNLRP3. ReducedADAMTS7expression conferred a reduced CAD risk without increased pneumonia risk only among never-smokers. Genetic immune-inflammatory axes of CAD linked to respiratory infections implicateADAMTS7andIL6R, and related genes."
"35441136","Unbiased metabolome screen leads to personalized medicine strategy for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","Brain Commun","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 1/350 individuals in the United Kingdom. The cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is unknown in the majority of cases. Two-sample Mendelian randomization enables causal inference between an exposure, such as the serum concentration of a specific metabolite, and disease risk. We obtained genome-wide association study summary statistics for serum concentrations of 566 metabolites which were population matched with a genome-wide association study of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. For each metabolite, we performed Mendelian randomization using an inverse variance weighted estimate for significance testing. After stringent Bonferroni multiple testing correction, our unbiased screen revealed three metabolites that were significantly linked to the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Estrone-3-sulphate and bradykinin were protective, which is consistent with literature describing a male preponderance of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and a preventive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors which inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin. Serum isoleucine was positively associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis risk. All three metabolites were supported by robust Mendelian randomization measures and sensitivity analyses; estrone-3-sulphate and isoleucine were confirmed in a validation amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genome-wide association study. Estrone-3-sulphate is metabolized to the more active estradiol by the enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1; further, Mendelian randomization demonstrated a protective effect of estradiol and rare variant analysis showed that missense variants withinHSD17B1, the gene encoding 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1, modify risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Finally, in a zebrafish model ofC9ORF72-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we present evidence that estradiol is neuroprotective. Isoleucine is metabolized via methylmalonyl-CoA mutase encoded by the geneMMUTin a reaction that consumes vitamin B12. Multivariable Mendelian randomization revealed that the toxic effect of isoleucine is dependent on the depletion of vitamin B12; consistent with this, rare variants which reduce the function ofMMUTare protective against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We propose that amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and family members with high serum isoleucine levels should be offered supplementation with vitamin B12.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35441133","The role of critical immune genes in brain disorders: insights from neuroimaging immunogenetics.","Brain Commun","Genetic variants in the human leukocyte antigen and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor regions have been associated with many brain-related diseases, but how they shape brain structure and function remains unclear. To identify the genetic variants inHLAandKIRgenes associated with human brain phenotypes, we performed a genetic association study of ∼30 000 European unrelated individuals using brain MRI phenotypes generated by the UK Biobank (UKB). We identified 15HLAalleles inHLAclass I and class II genes significantly associated with at least one brain MRI-based phenotypes (P < 5 × 10-8). These associations converged on several main haplotypes within theHLA. In particular, the human leukocyte antigen alleles within an ancestral haplotype 8.1 were associated with multiple MRI measures, including grey matter volume, cortical thickness (TH) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) metrics. These alleles have been strongly associated with schizophrenia. Additionally, associations were identified betweenHLA-DRB1*04∼DQA1*03:01∼DQB1*03:02 and isotropic volume fraction of diffusion MRI in multiple white matter tracts. This haplotype has been reported to be associated with Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest shared genetic associations between brain MRI biomarkers and brain-related diseases. Additionally, we identified 169 associations between the complement component 4 (C4) gene and imaging phenotypes. We found thatC4gene copy number was associated with cortical TH and dMRI metrics. NoKIRgene copy numbers were associated with image-derived phenotypes at genome-wide threshold. To address the multiple testing burden in the phenome-wide association study, we performed a multi-trait association analysis using trait-based association test that uses extended Simes procedure and identified MRI image-specific associations. This study contributes to insight into how critical immune genes affect brain-related traits as well as the development of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35494246","Genomic and dietary discontinuities during the Mesolithic and Neolithic in Sicily.","iScience","Sicily is a key region for understanding the agricultural transition in the Mediterranean because of its central position. Here, we present genomic and stable isotopic data for 19 prehistoric Sicilians covering the Mesolithic to Bronze Age periods (10,700-4,100 yBP). We find that Early Mesolithic hunter-gatherers (HGs) from Sicily are a highly drifted lineage of the Early Holocene western European HGs, whereas Late Mesolithic HGs carry ∼20% ancestry related to northern and (south) eastern European HGs, indicating substantial gene flow. Early Neolithic farmers are genetically most similar to farmers from the Balkans and Greece, with only ∼7% of ancestry from local Mesolithic HGs. The genetic discontinuities during the Mesolithic and Early Neolithic match the changes in material culture and diet. Three outlying individuals dated to ∼8,000 yBP; however, suggest that hunter-gatherers interacted with incoming farmers atGrotta dell'Uzzo, resulting in a mixed economy and diet for a brief interlude at the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition.© 2022 The Author(s)."

"35505076","Can adult polygenic scores improve prediction of body mass index in childhood?","Int J Obes (Lond)","Modelling genetic pre-disposition may identify children at risk of obesity. However, most polygenic scores (PGSs) have been derived in adults, and lack validation during childhood. This study compared the utility of existing large-scale adult-derived PGSs to predict common anthropometric traits (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and body fat) in children and adults, and examined whether childhood BMI prediction could be improved by combining PGSs and non-genetic factors (maternal and earlier child BMI).Participants (n = 1365 children, and n = 2094 adults made up of their parents) were drawn from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Children were weighed and measured every two years from 0-1 to 12-13 years, and adults were measured or self-reported measurements were obtained concurrently (average analysed). Participants were genotyped from blood or oral samples, and PGSs were derived based on published genome-wide association studies. We used linear regression to compare the relative utility of these PGSs to predict their respective traits at different ages.BMI PGSs explained up to 12% of child BMI z-score variance in 10-13 year olds, compared with up to 15% in adults. PGSs for waist circumference and body fat explained less variance (up to 8%). An interaction between BMI PGSs and puberty (p = 0.001-0.002) suggests the effect of some variants may differ across the life course. Individual BMI measures across childhood predicted 10-60% of the variance in BMI at 12-13 years, and maternal BMI and BMI PGS each added 1-9% above this.Adult-derived PGSs for BMI, particularly those derived by modelling between-variant interactions, may be useful for predicting BMI during adolescence with similar accuracy to that obtained in adulthood. The level of precision presented here to predict BMI during childhood may be relevant to public health, but is likely to be less useful for individual clinical purposes.© 2022.

To provide comprehensive insights into the complexity of plant biological systems, it is important to integrate different omics datasets. Although recent advances in computational analytical pipelines have enabled efficient and high-quality exploration and exploitation of single omics data, the integration of multidimensional, heterogenous, and large datasets (i.e., multi-omics) remains a challenge. In this regard, machine learning (ML) offers promising approaches to integrate large datasets and to recognize fine-grained patterns and relationships. Nevertheless, they require rigorous optimizations to process multi-omics-derived datasets. In this review, we discuss the main concepts of machine learning as well as the key challenges and solutions related to the big data derived from plant system biology.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence provide new methods and strategies for imputing unknown epigenomes based on existing data, yet how to reveal the predictive relationships among epigenetic marks remains largely unexplored. Here we present a machine learning approach for epigenomic imputation and interpretation. Through dissection of the spatial contributions from six histone marks, we reveal the prevalent and asymmetric cross-prediction relationships among these marks. Meanwhile, our approach achieved high predictive performance on held-out prospective epigenomes and outperformed the state-of-the-art. To facilitate future research, we further applied this approach to impute a total of 527 and 2,455 unavailable genome-wide histone modification signal tracks for the ENCODE3 and Roadmap datasets, respectively."

However, the interaction effect between parental rejection in childhood and the oxytocin receptor genotype on psychological adjustment has yet to be investigated. The present study aimed to investigate gene-environment interaction effects between parental rejection (maternal and paternal) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene polymorphisms (rs53576 and rs2254298) on depressive symptoms in adults in different cultural contexts. Adults from Italy and Japan (N= 133, age = 18-27 years, females = 68) were preliminarily genotyped and then completed the Parental Acceptance-Rejection Questionnaire for mothers and fathers and the Beck Depression Inventory. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that paternal rejection was related to self-reported depression and that the effect of parental rejection was moderated by OXTR gene polymorphisms and nationality. Among Italians, OXTR rs2254298 A-carriers showed resilience to negative early parental care, whereas among Japanese, OXTR rs53576 non-A-carriers showed resistance to negative early paternal care. These findings align with expected relations between perceived acceptance-rejection and an individual's psychological adjustment, as proposed by interpersonal acceptance-rejection theory, and indicate the need for future studies adopting a multicultural and multilevel approach to better understand how the effects of parental rejection extend into adulthood."

Discovery phase included a genome wide association study (1727 MS, 2258 HC), with SNPs selected according to their association in the Italian cohort only or in a meta-analysis of signals with a cohort of European ancestry (4088 MS, 7144 HC). Top associated loci were then tested in two Italian cohorts through array-based genotyping (903 MS, 884 HC) and pool-based target sequencing (588 MS, 408 HC). Finally, functional prioritization through conditional eQTL and mQTL has been performed.Top associated signals overlap with already known MS loci on chromosomes 3 and 17. Three SNPs (rs4267364, rs8070463, rs67919208), all involved in the regulation of TBKBP1, were prioritized to be functionally relevant.No evidence of novel signal of association with MS specific for the Italian continental population has been found; nevertheless, two MS loci seems to play a relevant role, raising the interest to further investigations for TBKBP1 gene.© 2022.

Analysis of 39,373 mapped protein-coding genes outlined copious duplications consistent with genetic and phenotypic diversity, both by retention of genes created during the ancient γ whole genome hexaploid duplication event and by tandem duplication within families, including numerous resistance genes and a very large block of duplicated DUF247 genes, which have been found to be associated with self-incompatibility in grasses. An additional surprising finding is that subcontext-specific patterns of DNA methylation associated with transposable elements reveal broadly-distributed heterochromatin in intergenic regions, similar to grasses. Collectively, these features promote genetic and phenotypic variation that would facilitate adaptability to changing environments.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Molecular and genetic stratification of IDDs remain challenging mainly due to overlapping factors and comorbidity. Advances in high throughput sequencing, imaging, and tools to record behavioral data at scale have greatly enhanced our understanding of the molecular, cellular, structural, and environmental basis of some IDDs. Fueled by the ""big data"" revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies have brought a whole new paradigm shift in computational biology. Evidently, the ML-driven approach to clinical diagnoses has the potential to augment classical methods that use symptoms and external observations, hoping to push the personalized treatment plan forward. Therefore, integrative analyses and applications of ML technology have a direct bearing on discoveries in IDDs. The application of ML to IDDs can potentially improve screening and early diagnosis, advance our understanding of the complexity of comorbidity, and accelerate the identification of biomarkers for clinical research and drug development. For more than five decades, the IDDRC network has supported a nexus of investigators at centers across the USA, all striving to understand the interplay between various factors underlying IDDs. In this review, we introduced fast-increasing multi-modal data types, highlighted example studies that employed ML technologies to illuminate factors and biological mechanisms underlying IDDs, as well as recent advances in ML technologies and their applications to IDDs and other neurological diseases. We discussed various molecular, clinical, and environmental data collection modes, including genetic, imaging, phenotypical, and behavioral data types, along with multiple repositories that store and share such data. Furthermore, we outlined some fundamental concepts of machine learning algorithms and presented our opinion on specific gaps that will need to be filled to accomplish, for example, reliable implementation of ML-based diagnosis technology in IDD clinics. We anticipate that this review will guide researchers to formulate AI and ML-based approaches to investigate IDDs and related conditions.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35468996","Drivers of genomic loss of heterozygosity in leiomyosarcoma are distinct from carcinomas.","NPJ Precis Oncol","Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare, aggressive, mesenchymal tumor. Subsets of LMS have been identified to harbor genomic alterations associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD); particularly alterations in BRCA2. Whereas genomic loss of heterozygosity (gLOH) has been used as a surrogate marker of HRD in other solid tumors, the prognostic or clinical value of gLOH in LMS (gLOH-LMS) remains poorly defined. We explore the genomic drivers associated with gLOH-LMS and their clinical import. Although the distribution of gLOH-LMS scores are similar to that of carcinomas, outside of BRCA2, there was no overlap with previously published gLOH-associated genes from studies in carcinomas. We note that early stage tumors with elevated gLOH demonstrated a longer disease-free interval following resection in LMS patients. Taken together, and despite similarities to carcinomas in gLOH distribution and clinical import, gLOH-LMS are driven by different genomic signals. Additional studies will be required to isolate and confirm the unique differences in biological factors driving these differences.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35585302","A retrotransposon storm marks clinical phenoconversion to late-onset Alzheimer's disease.","Geroscience","Recent reports have suggested that the reactivation of otherwise transcriptionally silent transposable elements (TEs) might induce brain degeneration, either by dysregulating the expression of genes and pathways implicated in cognitive decline and dementia or through the induction of immune-mediated neuroinflammation resulting in the elimination of neural and glial cells. In the work we present here, we test the hypothesis that differentially expressed TEs in blood could be used as biomarkers of cognitive decline and development of AD. To this aim, we used a sample of aging subjects (age > 70) that developed late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) over a relatively short period of time (12-48 months), for which blood was available before and after their phenoconversion, and a group of cognitive stable subjects as controls. We applied our developed and validated customized pipeline that allows the identification, characterization, and quantification of the differentially expressed (DE) TEs before and after the onset of manifest LOAD, through analyses of RNA-Seq data. We compared the level of DE TEs within more than 600,000 TE-mapping RNA transcripts from 25 individuals, whose specimens we obtained before and after their phenotypic conversion (phenoconversion) to LOAD, and discovered that 1790 TE transcripts showed significant expression differences between these two timepoints (logFC ± 1.5, logCMP > 5.3, nominal p value < 0.01). These DE transcripts mapped both over- and under-expressed TE elements. Occurring before the clinical phenoconversion, this TE storm features significant increases in DE transcripts of LINEs, LTRs, and SVAs, while those for SINEs are significantly depleted. These dysregulations end with signs of manifest LOAD. This set of highly DE transcripts generates a TE transcriptional profile that accurately discriminates the before and after phenoconversion states of these subjects. Our findings suggest that a storm of DE TEs occurs before phenoconversion from normal cognition to manifest LOAD in risk individuals compared to controls, and may provide useful blood-based biomarkers for heralding such a clinical transition, also suggesting that TEs can indeed participate in the complex process of neurodegeneration.© 2022.

Reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) changes the transcriptional profile and chromatin landscape of the starting somatic cell to that of the pluripotent cell in a stepwise manner. Changes in the regulatory networks are tightly regulated during normal embryonic development to determine cell fate, and similarly need to function in cell fate control during reprogramming. Switching off the somatic program and turning on the pluripotent program involves a dynamic reorganization of the epigenetic landscape, enhancer function, chromatin accessibility and 3D chromatin topology. Within this context, we will review here the current knowledge on the processes that control the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency during somatic cell reprogramming."

Here, we present FLAMINGO, a computational method that addresses these challenges by compressing inter-dependent Hi-C interactions to delineate the underlying low-rank structures in 3D space, based on the low-rank matrix completion technique. FLAMINGO successfully generates 5 kb- and 1 kb-resolution spatial conformations for all chromosomes in the human genome across multiple cell-types, the largest resources to date. Compared to other methods using various experimental metrics, FLAMINGO consistently demonstrates superior accuracy in recapitulating observed structures with raises in scalability by orders of magnitude. The reconstructed 3D structures efficiently facilitate discoveries of higher-order multi-way interactions, imply biological interpretations of long-range QTLs, reveal geometrical properties of chromatin, and provide high-resolution references to understand structural variabilities. Importantly, FLAMINGO achieves robust predictions against high rates of missing data and significantly boosts 3D structure resolutions. Moreover, FLAMINGO shows vigorous cross cell-type structure predictions that capture cell-type specific spatial configurations via integration of 1D epigenomic signals. FLAMINGO can be widely applied to large-scale chromatin contact maps and expand high-resolution spatial genome conformations for diverse cell-types.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35550087","Polycomb contraction differentially regulates terminal human hematopoietic differentiation programs.","BMC Biol","Lifelong production of the many types of mature blood cells from less differentiated progenitors is a hierarchically ordered process that spans multiple cell divisions. The nature and timing of the molecular events required to integrate the environmental signals, transcription factor activity, epigenetic modifications, and changes in gene expression involved are thus complex and still poorly understood. To address this gap, we generated comprehensive reference epigenomes of 8 phenotypically defined subsets of normal human cord blood.We describe a striking contraction of H3K27me3 density in differentiated myelo-erythroid cells that resembles a punctate pattern previously ascribed to pluripotent embryonic stem cells. Phenotypically distinct progenitor cell types display a nearly identical repressive H3K27me3 signature characterized by large organized chromatin K27-modification domains that are retained by mature lymphoid cells but lost in terminally differentiated monocytes and erythroblasts. We demonstrate that inhibition of polycomb group members predicted to control large organized chromatin K27-modification domains influences lymphoid and myeloid fate decisions of primary neonatal hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. We further show that a majority of active enhancers appear in early progenitors, a subset of which are DNA hypermethylated and become hypomethylated and induced during terminal differentiation.Primitive human hematopoietic cells display a unique repressive H3K27me3 signature that is retained by mature lymphoid cells but is lost in monocytes and erythroblasts. Intervention data implicate that control of this chromatin state change is a requisite part of the process whereby normal human hematopoietic progenitor cells make lymphoid and myeloid fate decisions.© 2022.

"35486646","Classification of non-coding variants with high pathogenic impact.","PLoS Genet","Whole genome sequencing is increasingly used to diagnose medical conditions of genetic origin. While both coding and non-coding DNA variants contribute to a wide range of diseases, most patients who receive a WGS-based diagnosis today harbour a protein-coding mutation. Functional interpretation and prioritization of non-coding variants represents a persistent challenge, and disease-causing non-coding variants remain largely unidentified. Depending on the disease, WGS fails to identify a candidate variant in 20-80% of patients, severely limiting the usefulness of sequencing for personalised medicine. Here we present FINSURF, a machine-learning approach to predict the functional impact of non-coding variants in regulatory regions. FINSURF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, owing in particular to optimized control variants selection during training. In addition to ranking candidate variants, FINSURF breaks down the score for each variant into contributions from individual annotations, facilitating the evaluation of their functional relevance. We applied FINSURF to a diverse set of 30 diseases with described causative non-coding mutations, and correctly identified the disease-causative non-coding variant within the ten top hits in 22 cases. FINSURF is implemented as an online server to as well as custom browser tracks, and provides a quick and efficient solution to prioritize candidate non-coding variants in realistic clinical settings."
"35473556","Accurate and highly interpretable prediction of gene expression from histone modifications.","BMC Bioinformatics","Histone Mark Modifications (HMs) are crucial actors in gene regulation, as they actively remodel chromatin to modulate transcriptional activity: aberrant combinatorial patterns of HMs have been connected with several diseases, including cancer. HMs are, however, reversible modifications: understanding their role in disease would allow the design of 'epigenetic drugs' for specific, non-invasive treatments. Standard statistical techniques were not entirely successful in extracting representative features from raw HM signals over gene locations. On the other hand, deep learning approaches allow for effective automatic feature extraction, but at the expense of model interpretation.Here, we propose ShallowChrome, a novel computational pipeline to model transcriptional regulation via HMs in both an accurate and interpretable way. We attain state-of-the-art results on the binary classification of gene transcriptional states over 56 cell-types from the REMC database, largely outperforming recent deep learning approaches. We interpret our models by extracting insightful gene-specific regulative patterns, and we analyse them for the specific case of the PAX5 gene over three differentiated blood cell lines. Finally, we compare the patterns we obtained with the characteristic emission patterns of ChromHMM, and show that ShallowChrome is able to coherently rank groups of chromatin states w.r.t. their transcriptional activity.In this work we demonstrate that it is possible to model HM-modulated gene expression regulation in a highly accurate, yet interpretable way. Our feature extraction algorithm leverages on data downstream the identification of enriched regions to retrieve gene-wise, statistically significant and dynamically located features for each HM. These features are highly predictive of gene transcriptional state, and allow for accurate modeling by computationally efficient logistic regression models. These models allow a direct inspection and a rigorous interpretation, helping to formulate quantifiable hypotheses.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35462859","Epigenetics of alcohol-related liver diseases.","JHEP Rep","Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) is a primary cause of chronic liver disease in the United States. Despite advances in the diagnosis and management of ARLD, it remains a major public health problem associated with significant morbidity and mortality, emphasising the need to adopt novel approaches to the study of ARLD and its complications. Epigenetic changes are increasingly being recognised as contributing to the pathogenesis of multiple disease states. Harnessing the power of innovative technologies for the study of epigenetics (e.g., next-generation sequencing, DNA methylation assays, histone modification profiling and computational techniques like machine learning) has resulted in a seismic shift in our understanding of the pathophysiology of ARLD. Knowledge of these techniques and advances is of paramount importance for the practicing hepatologist and researchers alike. Accordingly, in this review article we will summarise the current knowledge about alcohol-induced epigenetic alterations in the context of ARLD, including but not limited to, DNA hyper/hypo methylation, histone modifications, changes in non-coding RNA, 3D chromatin architecture and enhancer-promoter interactions. Additionally, we will discuss the state-of-the-art techniques used in the study of ARLD (e.g.single-cell sequencing). We will also highlight the epigenetic regulation of chemokines and their proinflammatory role in the context of ARLD. Lastly, we will examine the clinical applications of epigenetics in the diagnosis and management of ARLD.© 2022 Mayo Foundation https://www.mayo.clinic.org/copyright/."

However, the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of PMSCs has not been fully characterized. Here, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) techniques to cultured PMSCs from human full-term placenta. Based on the inferred characteristics of cell clusters, we identify several distinct subsets of PMSCs with specific characteristics, including immunomodulatory-potential and highly proliferative cell states. Furthermore, integrative analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility showed a clearer chromatin accessibility signature than those at the transcriptional level on immunomodulatory-related genes. Cell cycle gene-related heterogeneity can be more easily distinguished at the transcriptional than the chromatin accessibility level in PMSCs. We further reveal putative subset-specificcis-regulatory elements regulating the expression of immunomodulatory- and proliferation-related genes in the immunomodulatory-potential and proliferative subpopulations, respectively. Moreover, we infer a novel transcription factorPRDM1, which might play a crucial role in maintaining immunomodulatory capability by activatingPRDM1-regulon loop. Collectively, our study first provides a comprehensive and integrative view of the transcriptomic and epigenomic features of PMSCs, which paves the way for a deeper understanding of cellular heterogeneity and offers fundamental biological insight of PMSC subset-based cell therapy.Copyright © 2022 Li, Wang, An, Chen, Xing, Deng, Li, Wang, Dai, Liang, Hou, Yang and Shang."
"35440701","Comprehensive analysis of epigenetics regulation, prognostic and the correlation with immune infiltrates of GPX7 in adult gliomas.","Sci Rep","Gliomas are the most commonly occurring malignant brain tumor characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment accompanied by profound epigenetic changes, thus influencing the prognosis. Glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPX7) is essential for regulating reactive oxygen species homeostasis under oxidative stress. However, little is known about the function of GPX7 in gliomas. In this study, we hypothesized that GPX7 methylation status could influence biological functions and local immune responses that ultimately impact prognosis in adult gliomas. We conducted an integrated bioinformatics analysis mining GPX7 DNA methylation status, transcriptional and survival data of glioma patients. We discovered that GPX7 was remarkably increased in glioma tissues and cell lines, and was associated with poor prognosis. This upregulation was significantly linked to clinicopathological and molecular features, besides being expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Our results consistently demonstrated that upregulation of GPX7 is tightly modulated by epigenetic processes, which also impacted the overall survival of patients with low-grade gliomas (LGG). Based on the analysis of biological functions, we found that GPX7 might be involved in immune mechanisms involving both innate and adaptive immunity, type I interferon production and regulation of synaptic transmission in LGG, whereas in GBM, it is mainly related to metabolic regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. We also found that GPX7 strongly correlates with immune cell infiltration and diverse immune cell markers, suggesting its role in tumor-specific immune response and in regulating the migration of immune cell types to the tumor microenvironment. Combining these multiple data, we provided the first evidence regarding the epigenetic-mediated regulatory mechanisms underlying GPX7 activation in gliomas. Furthermore, our study brings key insights into the significant effect of GPX7 in modulating both immune molecules and in immune cell infiltration in the microenvironment of gliomas, which might impact the patient outcome, opening up future opportunities to regulate the local immune response.© 2022.

As alcohol consumption has a J-shape association with colorectal cancer risk, nondrinking and heavy drinking are both risk factors for colorectal cancer.Individual-level data was pooled from the Colon Cancer Family Registry, Colorectal Transdisciplinary Study, and Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium to compare nondrinkers (≤1 g/day) and heavy drinkers (>28 g/day) with light-to-moderate drinkers (1-28 g/day) in GxE analyses. To improve power, we implemented joint 2df and 3df tests and a novel two-step method that modifies the weighted hypothesis testing framework. We prioritized putative causal variants by predicting allelic effects using support vector machine models.For nondrinking as compared with light-to-moderate drinking, the hybrid two-step approach identified 13 significant SNPs with pairwise r2 > 0.9 in the 10q24.2/COX15 region. When stratified by alcohol intake, the A allele of lead SNP rs2300985 has a dose-response increase in risk of colorectal cancer as compared with the G allele in light-to-moderate drinkers [OR for GA genotype = 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.17; OR for AA genotype = 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.31], but not in nondrinkers or heavy drinkers. Among the correlated candidate SNPs in the 10q24.2/COX15 region, rs1318920 was predicted to disrupt an HNF4 transcription factor binding motif.Our study suggests that the association with colorectal cancer in 10q24.2/COX15 observed in genome-wide association study is strongest in nondrinkers.

Among three HIF-α isoforms, HIF-3α is the least studied to date. Here we show that oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a physiological lipid known to regulate food intake and metabolism, binds selectively to HIF-3α. Through crystallographic analysis of HIF-3 α/β heterodimer in both apo and OEA-bound forms, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and biochemical and cell-based assays, we unveil the molecular mechanism of OEA entry and binding to the PAS-B pocket of HIF-3α, and show that it leads to enhanced heterodimer stability and functional modulation of HIF-3. The identification of HIF-3α as a selective lipid sensor is consistent with recent human genetic findings linking HIF-3α with obesity, and demonstrates that endogenous metabolites can directly interact with HIF-α proteins to modulate their activities, potentially as a regulatory mechanism supplementary to the well-known oxygen-dependent HIF-α hydroxylation.© 2022.

"35458167","Beyond the Calorie Paradigm: Taking into Account in Practice the Balance of Fat and Carbohydrate Oxidation during Exercise?","Nutrients","Recent literature shows that exercise is not simply a way to generate a calorie deficit as an add-on to restrictive diets but exerts powerful additional biological effects via its impact on mitochondrial function, the release of chemical messengers induced by muscular activity, and its ability to reverse epigenetic alterations. This review aims to summarize the current literature dealing with the hypothesis that some of these effects of exercise unexplained by an energy deficit are related to the balance of substrates used as fuel by the exercising muscle. This balance of substrates can be measured with reliable techniques, which provide information about metabolic disturbances associated with sedentarity and obesity, as well as adaptations of fuel metabolism in trained individuals. The exercise intensity that elicits maximal oxidation of lipids, termed LIPOXmax, FATOXmax, or FATmax, provides a marker of the mitochondrial ability to oxidize fatty acids and predicts how much fat will be oxidized over 45-60 min of low- to moderate-intensity training performed at the corresponding intensity. LIPOXmax is a reproducible parameter that can be modified by many physiological and lifestyle influences (exercise, diet, gender, age, hormones such as catecholamines, and the growth hormone-Insulin-like growth factor I axis). Individuals told to select an exercise intensity to maintain for 45 min or more spontaneously select a level close to this intensity. There is increasing evidence that training targeted at this level is efficient for reducing fat mass, sparing muscle mass, increasing the ability to oxidize lipids during exercise, lowering blood pressure and low-grade inflammation, improving insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, reducing blood glucose and HbA1cin type 2 diabetes, and decreasing the circulating cholesterol level. Training protocols based on this concept are easy to implement and accept in very sedentary patients and have shown an unexpected efficacy over the long term. They also represent a useful add-on to bariatric surgery in order to maintain and improve its weight-lowering effect. Additional studies are required to confirm and more precisely analyze the determinants of LIPOXmax and the long-term effects of training at this level on body composition, metabolism, and health."

It is produced by an epimutation at the promoter common to CCDC163P and MMACHC, which results from an aberrant antisense transcription due to splicing mutations in the antisense PRDX1 gene neighboring MMACHC. We studied whether the aberrant transcription produced a second epimutation by encompassing the CpG island of the TESK2 gene neighboring CCDC163P.We unraveled the methylome architecture of the CCDC163P-MMACHC CpG island (CpG:33) and the TESK2 CpG island (CpG:51) of 17 epi-cblC cases. We performed an integrative analysis of the DNA methylome profiling, transcriptome reconstruction of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) of histone H3, and transcription expression of MMACHC and TESK2.The PRDX1 splice mutations and activation of numerous cryptic splice sites produced antisense readthrough transcripts encompassing the bidirectional MMACHC/CCDC163P promoter and the TESK2 promoter, resulting in the silencing of both the MMACHC and TESK2 genes through the deposition of SETD2-dependent H3K36me3 marks and the generation of epimutations in the CpG islands of the two promoters.The antisense readthrough transcription of the mutated PRDX1 produces an epigenetic silencing of MMACHC and TESK2. We propose using the term 'epi-digenism' to define this epigenetic disorder that affects two genes. Epi-cblC is an entity that differs from cblC. Indeed, the PRDX1 and TESK2 altered expressions are observed in epi-cblC but not in cblC, suggesting further evaluating the potential consequences on cancer risk and spermatogenesis.© 2022.

Long noncoding (lnc) RNAs, regulatory factors that play a role in human diseases, are commonly dysregulated in lung cancer. Cigarette smoking is closely related to changes in lncRNA expression, which can affect lung cancer. Herein, we assess the mechanism of lung cancer initiation induced by smoking. To calculate the impact of smoking on the survival of patients with lung cancer, we extracted data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases and identified the differentially expressed genes in the lung cancer tissue compared to the normal lung tissue. Genes positively and negatively associated with smoking were identified. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Cytoscape analyses were performed to determine the function of the genes and the effects of smoking on the immune microenvironment. lncRNAs corresponding to smoking-associated genes were identified, and a smoking-related lncRNA model was constructed using univariate and multivariate Cox analyses. This model was used to assess the survival of and potential risk in patients who smoked. During screening, 562 differentially expressed genes were identified, and we elucidated that smoking affected the survival of patients 4.5 years after the diagnosis of lung cancer. Furthermore, genes negatively associated with smoking were closely associated with immunity. Twelve immune cell types were also found to infiltrate differentially in smokers and nonsmokers. Thus, the smoking-associated lncRNA model is a good predictor of survival and risk in smokers and may be used as an independent prognostic factor for lung cancer.Copyright © 2022 Lei Ge et al."

Despite advancements in BC screening, prevention, and treatment, BC incidence and mortality remain high among African American (AA) women. Compared with European American (EA) women, AA women tend to be diagnosed with more advanced and aggressive tumors and exhibit worse survival outcomes. Most studies investigating the determinants of racial disparities in BC have focused on genetic factors associated with African ancestry. However, various environmental and social stressors over an individual's life course can also shape racial stratification in BC. These social and environmental exposures result in long-term changes in gene expression mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetics is often portrayed as an intersection of socially patterned stress and genetic expression. The enduring nature of epigenetic changes makes them suitable for studying the effects of different environmental exposures over an individual's life course on gene expression. The role of differential social and environmental exposures in racial disparities in BC suggests varied epigenetic profiles or signatures associated with specific BC subtypes in AA and EA women. These epigenetic profiles in EA and AA women could be used as biomarkers for early BC diagnosis and disease prognosis and may prove valuable for the development of targeted therapies for BC. This review article discusses the current state of knowledge regarding epigenetic differences between AA and EA women with BC. We also discuss the role of socio-environmental factors, including psychosocial stress, environmental toxicants, and dietary factors, in delineating the different epigenetic profiles in AA and EA patients with BC."

RNA sequencing data and clinicopathological information from renal cancer patients extracted from The Tumor Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed to evaluate the prognostic value of C5orf46. The role of C5orf46 in vitro was verified by migration, proliferation and apoptosis experiments in renal cancer cell lines. Furthermore, the transcriptome of renal cancer cell lines with C5orf46 knocked down was sequenced to analyze potential signaling network pathways. Finally, the possible mechanisms of C5orf46 involvement in renal cancer development were analyzed by evaluating the immune microenvironment, mutation status and methylation levels.C5orf46 was highly expressed in renal cancer and was an independent prognostic factor. In vitro cell experiments showed that inhibition of C5orf46 expression could reduce renal cancer cell proliferation and migration and increase apoptosis. Transcriptomic sequencing after knockdown of C5orf46 in renal cancer cells revealed that it is involved in the malignant phenotype and immune microenvironment regulation of renal cancer. Finally, public databases suggest that C5orf46-related immune cell infiltration, mutational potential, and low methylation levels may contribute to poor prognosis in renal cancer.These findings suggest that C5orf46 is associated with renal cancer progression and could be a potential target for improving renal cancer prognosis.Copyright © 2022.

Subsequently, fat-1 can influence the n-6: n-3 PUFA ratio infat-1transgenic cells. This study aimed to explore which processes of energy metabolism are affected exogenousfat-1transgene and the relationship between these effects and DNA methylation. Compared with the wild-type group, the n-3 PUFA content infat-1transgenic bovine fetal fibroblasts was significantly increased, and the n-6 PUFA content and the n-6: n-3 PUFA ratio decreased. In the context of energy metabolism, the increase of exogenousfat-1transgene decreased ATP synthesis by 39% and reduced the activity and expression of key rate-limiting enzymes in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation, thus weakening the cells' capacity for ATP production. DNA methylation sequencing indicated that this inhibition of gene expression may be due to altered DNA methylation that regulates cell energy metabolism. Exogenousfat-1transgenic cells showed changes in the degree of methylation in the promoter region of genes related to energy metabolism rate-limiting enzymes. We suggest that alters the balance of n-6/n-3 PUFA could regulate altered DNA methylation that affect mitochondrial energy metabolism.Copyright © 2022 Wang, Zhu, Wei, Gu, Yang, Zhou, Bai, Su, Liu, Yang and Li."

Transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq) revealed that the expression of neuroinflammation-associated genes was systematically upregulated in ICH rat brains, irrespective of age. Further, we found that interferon-γ (IFN-γ) response genes were activated in both 13- and 22-month-old rats. Anti-IFN-γ treatment markedly reduced ICH-induced acute brain injury in 22-month-old rats. At the chromatin level, ICH induced the redistribution of histone modifications in the promoter regions, especially H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, in neuroinflammation-associated genes in 13- and 22-month-old rats, respectively. Moreover, ICH-induced histone mark redistribution and gene expression were found to be correlated. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that histone modifications related to gene expression are extensively regulated in 13- and 22-month-old rats and that anti-IFN-γ is effective for ICH treatment, highlighting the potential of developing therapies targeting histone modifications to cure age-related diseases, including brain injury and neuroinflammation.Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Kong, Yuan, Chen, Gong, Liu, Wang, Huang, Yang, Zhou, Xu, Xiong and Yang."
"35461274","Gene co-expression changes underlying the functional connectomic alterations in Alzheimer's disease.","BMC Med Genomics","There is growing evidence indicating that a number of functional connectivity networks are disrupted at each stage of the full clinical Alzheimer's disease spectrum. Such differences are also detectable in cognitive normal (CN) carrying mutations of AD risk genes, suggesting a substantial relationship between genetics and AD-altered functional brain networks. However, direct genetic effect on functional connectivity networks has not been measured.Leveraging existing AD functional connectivity studies collected in NeuroSynth, we performed a meta-analysis to identify two sets of brain regions: ones with altered functional connectivity in resting state network and ones without. Then with the brain-wide gene expression data in the Allen Human Brain Atlas, we applied a new biclustering method to identify a set of genes with differential co-expression patterns between these two set of brain regions.Differential co-expression analysis using biclustering method led to a subset of 38 genes which showed distinctive co-expression patterns between AD-related and non AD-related brain regions in default mode network. More specifically, we observed 4 sub-clusters with noticeable co-expression difference, where the difference in correlations is above 0.5 on average.This work applies a new biclustering method to search for a subset of genes with altered co-expression patterns in AD-related default mode network regions. Compared with traditional differential expression analysis, differential co-expression analysis yielded many more significant hits with extra insights into the wiring mechanism between genes. Particularly, the differential co-expression pattern was observed between two sets of genes, suggesting potential upstream genetic regulators in AD development.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35456203","Neural Network Aided Detection of Huntington Disease.","J Clin Med","Huntington Disease (HD) is a degenerative neurological disease that causes a significant impact on the quality of life of the patient and eventually death. In this paper we present an approach to create a biomarker using as an input DNA CpG methylation data to identify HD patients. DNA CpG methylation is a well-known epigenetic marker for disease state. Technological advances have made it possible to quickly analyze hundreds of thousands of CpGs. This large amount of information might introduce noise as potentially not all DNA CpG methylation levels will be related to the presence of the illness. In this paper, we were able to reduce the number of CpGs considered from hundreds of thousands to 237 using a non-linear approach. It will be shown that using only these 237 CpGs and non-linear techniques such as artificial neural networks makes it possible to accurately differentiate between control and HD patients. An underlying assumption in this paper is that there are no indications suggesting that the process is linear and therefore non-linear techniques, such as artificial neural networks, are a valid tool to analyze this complex disease. The proposed approach is able to accurately distinguish between control and HD patients using DNA CpG methylation data as an input and non-linear forecasting techniques. It should be noted that the dataset analyzed is relatively small. However, the results seem relatively consistent and the analysis can be repeated with larger data-sets as they become available."

"35500004","DNA methylation profiles in the blood of newborn term infants born to mothers with obesity.","PLoS One","Maternal obesity is an important risk factor for childhood obesity and influences the prevalence of metabolic diseases in offspring. As childhood obesity is influenced by postnatal factors, it is critical to determine whether children born to women with obesity during pregnancy show alterations that are detectable at birth. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation modifications have been proposed to mediate prenatal programming. We investigated DNA methylation signatures in male and female infants from mothers with a normal Body Mass Index (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2) compared to mothers with obesity (BMI≥30 kg/m2). BMI was measured during the first prenatal visit from women recruited into the Ontario Birth Study (OBS) at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, ON, Canada. DNA was extracted from neonatal dried blood spots collected from heel pricks obtained 24 hours after birth at term (total n = 40) from women with a normal BMI and women with obesity matched for parity, age, and neonatal sex. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was used to identify genomic loci associated with differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in CpG-dense regions most likely to influence gene regulation. DMRs were predominantly localized to intergenic regions and gene bodies, with only 9% of DMRs localized to promoter regions. Genes associated with DMRs were compared to those from a large publicly available cohort study, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; total n = 859). Hypergeometric tests revealed a significant overlap in genes associated with DMRs in the OBS and ALSPAC cohorts. PTPRN2, a gene involved in insulin secretion, and MAD1L1, which plays a role in the cell cycle and tumor suppression, contained DMRs in males and females in both cohorts. In males, KEGG pathway analysis revealed significant overrepresentation of genes involved in endocytosis and pathways in cancer, including IGF1R, which was previously shown to respond to diet-induced metabolic stress in animal models and in lymphocytes in the context of childhood obesity. These preliminary findings are consistent with Developmental Origins of Health and Disease paradigm, which posits that adverse prenatal exposures set developmental health trajectories."

(3) There were 3 statistically significant haplotypes between the normal-weight group and overweight/obesity group (2 in SAT and 1 in OAT).The methylation level of CIDEB gene promoter in abdominal SAT and OAT may be related to overweight or obesity in adults, and the specific regulatory mechanism needs to be further studied."
"35529056","Updated Perspectives on Keratinocytes and Psoriasis: Keratinocytes are More Than Innocent Bystanders.","Psoriasis (Auckl)","Psoriasis is a complex disease triggered by genetic, immunologic, and environmental stimuli. Many genes have been linked to psoriasis, like the psoriasis susceptibility genes, some of which are critical in keratinocyte biology and epidermal barrier function. Still, the exact pathogenesis of psoriasis is unknown. In the disease, the balance between the proliferative and differentiative processes of keratinocytes becomes altered. Multiple studies have highlighted the role of dysregulated immune cells in provoking the inflammatory responses seen in psoriasis. In addition to immune cells, accumulating evidence shows that keratinocytes are involved in psoriasis pathogenesis, as discussed in this review. Although certain immune cell-derived factors stimulate keratinocyte hyperproliferation, activated keratinocytes can also produce anti-microbial peptides, cytokines, and chemokines that can promote their proliferation, as well as recruit immune cells to help initiate and reinforce inflammatory feedback loops. Psoriatic keratinocytes also show intrinsic differences from normal keratinocytes even after removal from the in vivo inflammatory environment; thus, psoriatic keratinocytes have been found to exhibit abnormal calcium metabolism and possible epigenetic changes that contribute to psoriasis. The Koebner phenomenon, in which injury promotes the development of psoriatic lesions, also provides evidence for keratinocytes' contributions to disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, transgenic mouse studies have confirmed the importance of keratinocytes in the etiology of psoriasis. Finally, in addition to immune cells and keratinocytes, data in the literature support roles for other cell types, tissues, and systems in psoriasis development. These other contributors are all potential targets for therapies, suggesting the importance of a holistic approach when treating psoriasis.© 2022 Ortiz-Lopez et al."
"35565275","Potential of Inflammatory Protein Signatures for Enhanced Selection of People for Lung Cancer Screening.","Cancers (Basel)","Randomized trials have demonstrated a substantial reduction in lung cancer (LC) mortality by screening heavy smokers with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). The aim of this study was to assess if and to what extent blood-based inflammatory protein biomarkers might enhance selection of those at highest risk for LC screening. Ever smoking participants were chosen from 9940 participants, aged 50-75 years, who were followed up with respect to LC incidence for 17 years in a prospective population-based cohort study conducted in Saarland, Germany. Using proximity extension assay, 92 inflammation protein biomarkers were measured in baseline plasma samples of ever smoking participants, including 172 incident LC cases and 285 randomly selected participants free of LC. Smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalized regression with 0.632+ bootstrap for correction of overoptimism was applied to derive an inflammation protein biomarker score (INS) and a combined INS-pack-years score in a training set, and algorithms were further evaluated in an independent validation set. Furthermore, the performances of nine LC risk prediction models individually and in combination with inflammatory plasma protein biomarkers for predicting LC incidence were comparatively evaluated. The combined INS-pack-years score predicted LC incidence with area under the curves (AUCs) of 0.811 and 0.782 in the training and the validation sets, respectively. The addition of inflammatory plasma protein biomarkers to established nine LC risk models increased the AUCs up to 0.121 and 0.070 among ever smoking participants from training and validation sets, respectively. Our results suggest that inflammatory protein biomarkers may have potential to improve the selection of people for LC screening and thereby enhance screening efficiency."

We also evaluated the associations of the 71 CVD proteins with the following dichotomous secondary outcomes: prevalent CKD stage ≥3 (cross-sectional), new-onset CKD stage ≥3 (longitudinal), and rapid decline in eGFR (longitudinal). Proteins significantly associated with eGFR and ΔeGFR were subsequently validated in 3,951 FHS Third Generation cohort participants and were tested using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to infer putatively causal relations between plasma protein biomarkers and kidney function.In cross-sectional analysis, 37 protein biomarkers were significantly associated with eGFR at FDR<0.05 in the FHS Offspring cohort and 20 of these validated in the FHS Third Generation cohort at p<0.05/37. In longitudinal analysis, 27 protein biomarkers were significantly associated with ΔeGFR at FDR<0.05 and 12 of these were validated in the FHS Third Generation cohort at p<0.05/27. Additionally, 35 protein biomarkers were significantly associated with prevalent CKD, five were significantly associated with new-onset CKD, and 17 were significantly associated with rapid decline in eGFR. MR suggested putatively causal relations of melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM; -0.011±0.003 mL/min/1.73m2, p = 5.11E-5) and epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like extracellular matrix protein 1 (EFEMP1; -0.006±0.002 mL/min/1.73m2, p = 0.0001) concentration with eGFR.Eight protein biomarkers were consistently associated with eGFR in cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis in both cohorts and may capture early kidney impairment; others were implicated in association and causal inference analyses. A subset of CVD protein biomarkers may contribute causally to the pathogenesis of kidney impairment and should be studied as targets for CKD treatment and early prevention."

Abnormal ncRNAs have been verified to be involved in potential metastasis via modulating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition progression and are vital for the progression of cancers. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs) are a vital indicator of whether cancer patients will benefit from immunotherapy. Nonetheless, the association between ceRNAs and immune cells remained largely unclear. We used the ceRNA network combined with TICs for the prediction of the clinical outcome of GC patients based on TCGA datasets. The percentage of immunocytes in GC was speculated by the use of CIBERSORT. Via Lasso and multivariate assays, prognostic models were established applying survival-related genes and immune cells. Nomograms were developed, and the accuracy of the nomograms was determined using calibration curves. The association between ceRNAs and TICs was validated by the use of integration analysis. In this study, there were 2219 mRNAs (1308 increased and 911 decreased), 171 lncRNAs (51 decreased and 120 increased), and 123 miRNAs (55 decreased and 68 increased) differentially expressed between tumor groups and nontumor groups. Five lncRNAs, six miRNAs, and 64 mRNAs were used for ceRNA network construction. Eight genes including LOX, SPARC, MASTL, PI15, BMPR1B, ANKRD13B, PVT1, and miR-7-5p were applied for the development of the prognostic model. Survival assays suggested that tumor cases with high risk exhibited a shorter overall survival. In addition, we included T-cell CD4 memory activated, monocytes, and neutrophils for the development of a prognosis model. Eventually, our team demonstrated the possible associations between the ceRNA prognosis model and prognostic model based on immune cells. To sum up, the ceRNA network could be used for gene regulation and predict clinical outcomes of GC patients.Copyright © 2022 Meng-Yang Shi et al."
"35562995","Cortactin in Lung Cell Function and Disease.","Int J Mol Sci","Cortactin (CTTN) is an actin-binding and cytoskeletal protein that is found in abundance in the cell cortex and other peripheral structures of most cell types. It was initially described as a target for Src-mediated phosphorylation at several tyrosine sites within CTTN, and post-translational modifications at these tyrosine sites are a primary regulator of its function. CTTN participates in multiple cellular functions that require cytoskeletal rearrangement, including lamellipodia formation, cell migration, invasion, and various other processes dependent upon the cell type involved. The role of CTTN in vascular endothelial cells is particularly important for promoting barrier integrity and inhibiting vascular permeability and tissue edema. To mediate its functional effects, CTTN undergoes multiple post-translational modifications and interacts with numerous other proteins to alter cytoskeletal structures and signaling mechanisms. In the present review, we briefly describe CTTN structure, post-translational modifications, and protein binding partners and then focus on its role in regulating cellular processes and well-established functional mechanisms, primarily in vascular endothelial cells and disease models. We then provide insights into how CTTN function affects the pathophysiology of multiple lung disorders, including acute lung injury syndromes, COPD, and asthma."

Immune cell classification was performed on the basis of the expression pattern of detected genes. Finally, we selected ten genes with dysregulated methylation and expression levels for RT-qPCR validation.Global DNA methylation profile showed obvious changes between normal aortic and atherosclerotic lesion tissues. We found that differentially methylated genes (DMGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were highly associated with atherosclerosis by being enriched in atherosclerotic plaque formation-related pathways, including cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization. Immune cell fraction analysis revealed that a large number of immune cells, especially macrophages, activated mast cells, NK cells, and Tfh cells, were specifically enriched in the plaque. DEGs associated with immune cell fraction change showed that they were mainly related to the level of macrophages, monocytes, resting NK cells, activated CD4 memory T cells, and gamma delta T cells. These genes were highly enriched in multiple pathways of atherosclerotic plaque formation, including blood vessel remodeling, collagen fiber organization, cell adhesion, collagen catalogic process, extractable matrix assembly, and platelet activation. We also validated the expression alteration of ten genes associated with infiltrating immune cells in atherosclerosis.In conclusion, these findings provide new evidence for understanding the mechanisms of atherosclerotic plaque formation, and provide a new and valuable research direction based on immune cell infiltration.© 2022.

Because adipose tissue metabolism is involved in the progression of obesity and diabetes, it might be efficient to target adipocyte metabolic pathways. Positive regulatory domain zinc finger region protein 16 (PRDM16), a transcription factor that is highly expressed in adipocytes, plays a key role in adipose tissue metabolism, such as the browning and thermogenesis of adipocytes, the beigeing of adipocytes, the adipogenic differentiation of myoblasts, and the conversion of visceral adipocytes to subcutaneous adipocytes. Furthermore, clinical and basic studies have shown that the expression of PRDM16 is associated with obesity and diabetes and that PRDM16 signaling participates in the treatment of the two diseases. For example, metformin promotes thermogenesis and alleviates obesity by activating the AMPK/αKG/PRDM16 signaling pathway; rosiglitazone alleviates obesity under the synergistic effect of PRDM16; resveratrol plays an antiobesity role by inducing the expression of PRDM16; liraglupeptide improves insulin resistance by inducing the expression of PRDM16; and mulberry leaves play an anti-inflammatory and antidiabetes role by activating the expression of brown fat cell marker genes (including PRDM16). In this review, we summarize the evidence of PRDM16 involvement in the progression of obesity and diabetes and that PRDM16 may be a promising therapy for obesity and diabetes.Copyright © 2022 Jiang, Yang, Han, Zhao and Sun."

People with PTSD also suffer from a number of comorbid clinical and behavioral disorders that are related to chronic inflammation. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of enhanced inflammation in PTSD can provide insights into the relationship between PTSD and associated comorbid disorders. In the current study, we investigated the role of large intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) in the regulation of inflammation in people diagnosed with PTSD. We observed that WNT ligand, WNT10B, was upregulated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PTSD patients. This observation was associated with higher H3K4me3 signals around WNT10B promotor in PTSD patients compared to those without PTSD. Increased H3K4me3 resulted from LINC00926, which we found to be upregulated in the PTSD sample, bringing in histone methyltransferase, MLL1, onto WNT10B promotor leading to the introduction of H3K4 trimethylation. The addition of recombinant human WNT10B to pre-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) led to increased expression of inflammatory genes such as IFNG and IL17A, suggesting that WNT10B is involved in their upregulation. Together, our data suggested that LINC00926 interacts physically with MLL1 and thereby controls the expression of IFNG and IL17A. This is the first time a long non-coding RNA is shown to regulate the expression of WNT10B and consequently inflammation. This observation has high relevance to our understanding of disease mechanisms of PTSD and comorbidities associated with PTSD.© 2022. The Author(s)."

DNA methylation is considered to be an early event in the process of cancer development and progression. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether detection of DNA methylation of selected tumor suppressor genes in CTC and matched ctDNA provides prognostic information in early stage NSCLC.The methylation status of five selected gene promoters (APC, RASSFIA1, FOXA1, SLFN11, SHOX2) was examined by highly specific and sensitive real-time methylation specific PCR assays in: (a) a training group of 35 primary tumors and their corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues of early stage NSCLC patients, (b) a validation group of 22 primary tumor tissues (FFPEs) and 42 peripheral blood samples of early stage NSCLC patients. gDNA was isolated from FFPEs, CTCs (size-based enriched by Parsortix; Angle and plasma, and (c) a control group of healthy blood donors (n = 12).All five gene promoters tested were highly methylated in the training group; methylation of SHOX2 promoter in primary tumors was associated with unfavorable outcome. RASSFIA and APC were found methylated in plasma-cfDNA samples at 14.3% and 11.9%, respectively, whereas in the corresponding CTCs SLFN11 and APC promoters were methylated in 7.1%. The incidence of relapses was higher in patients with a) promoter methylation of APC and SLFN11 in plasma-cfDNA (P = 0.037 and P = 0.042 respectively) and b) at least one detected methylated gene promoter in CTC or plasma-cfDNA (P = 0.015).DNA methylation of these five gene promoters was significantly lower in CTCs and plasma-cfDNA than in the primary tumors. Combination of DNA methylation analysis in CTC and plasma-cfDNA was associated with worse DFI of NSCLC patients. Additional studies are required to validate our findings in a large cohort of early stage NSCLC patients.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Numerous studies have increasingly illustrated the pivotal role that human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) plays in the pathology of T2DM through damage and subsequent loss of pancreatic β-cell mass. HIAPP can misfold and form amyloid fibrils which are preceded by pre-fibrillar oligomers and monomers, all of which have been linked, to a certain extent, to β-cell cytotoxicity through a range of proposed mechanisms. This review provides an up-to-date summary of recent progress in the field, highlighting factors that contribute to hIAPP misfolding and aggregation such as hIAPP protein concentration, cell stress, molecular chaperones, the immune system response and cross-seeding with other amyloidogenic proteins. Understanding the structure of hIAPP and how these factors affect amyloid formation will help us better understand how hIAPP misfolds and aggregates and, importantly, help identify potential therapeutic targets for inhibiting amyloidosis so alternate and more effective treatments for T2DM can be developed."

Here, we designed an experiment to evaluate the impact of delayed processing of whole blood samples on gene transcript abundance in PWBCs. We hypothesized that storing blood samples for 24 h at 4 °C would cause RNA degradation resulting in altered transcriptome profiles. There were no statistical differences in RNA quality parameters among samples processed after one, three, six, or eight hours post collection. Additionally, no significant differences were noted in RNA quality parameters or gene transcript abundance between samples collected from the jugular and coccygeal veins. However, samples processed after 24 h of storage had a lower RNA integrity number value (P = 0.03) in comparison to those processed after one hour of storage. Using RNA-sequencing, we identified four and 515 genes with differential transcript abundance in samples processed after storage for eight and 24 h, respectively, relative to samples processed after one hour. Sequencing coverage of transcripts was similar between samples from the 24-h and one-hour groups, thus showing no indication of RNA degradation. This alteration in transcriptome profiles can impair the accuracy of mRNA-based biomarkers, therefore, blood samples collected for mRNA-based biomarker discovery should be refrigerated immediately and processed within six hours post-sampling.© 2022.

These sex differences are impacted by both genetics and epigenetic alterations during the maturation process, likely for the purpose of preparing for successful reproduction. For females, later in life (~45-50) they undergo another transition leading to a loss of ovarian hormone production at menopause. The reasons for menopause are not clear, but for a subset of females, menopause is accompanied by an increased risk of a number of diseases or conditions that impact a variety of tissues. Most research has mainly focused on the target cells in each of the affected tissues rather than pursue the alternative option that there may be commonalities in the development of these post-menopausal conditions in addition to influences on specific target cells. This review will address some of the potential commonalities presented by an integration of the literature regarding tissue-specific aspects of these post-menopausal conditions and data presented by space flight/microgravity (a condition not anticipated by evolution) that could implicate a loss of a regulatory function of the microvasculature in the risk attached to the affected tissues. Thus, the loss of the integration of the paracrine relationships between endothelial cells of the microvasculature of the tissues affected in the post-menopausal environment could contribute to the risk for post-menopausal diseases/conditions. The validation of this concept could lead to new approaches for interventions to treat post-menopausal conditions, as well as provide new understanding regarding sex-specific biological regulation."

The aim was to determine how factors such as lifestyle, level of education, or severity of stressful life events indicate the appearance of aging symptoms in adult men. The material consisted of data of ethnically homogeneous group of 355 men (32-87 years), invited to the study as a part of the Wroclaw Male Study research project. The analyzed features included (1) socioeconomic status: age, educational level, marital status, and having children; (2) elements of lifestyle: alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, and physical activity; (3) major and most important stressful life events-the Social Readjustment Rating Scale; (4) symptoms related to male aging-the Aging Males' Symptoms. The backward stepwise regression models, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and multiple comparisons of mean ranks were used. Noncentrality parameter δ (delta), two-tailed critical values of the test, and test power with α = 0.05 were calculated. Among the analyzed variables, age was most strongly associated with the intensity of almost all groups of andropausal symptoms in men (p= 0.0001), followed by the level of education (p= 0.0001) and the intensity of stressful life events (p= 0.0108). Selected lifestyle elements turned out to be much less important (p&gt; 0.01). Preventive actions aimed at slowing down the intensification of involutional processes, including teaching strategies for coping with stressful life events, should be implemented in groups of men with specific risk factors from an early age."

Cacnb1 deletion enhances apoptosis and impairs the clonal expansion of T cells after lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. By contrast, Cacnb1 is dispensable for T cell proliferation, cytokine production and Ca2+signaling. Using patch clamp electrophysiology and Ca2+recordings, we are unable to detect voltage-gated Ca2+currents or Ca2+influx in human and mouse T cells upon depolarization with or without prior TCR stimulation. mRNAs of several VGCC α1 subunits are detectable in human (CaV3.3, CaV3.2) and mouse (CaV2.1) T cells, but they lack transcription of many 5' exons, likely resulting in N-terminally truncated and non-functional proteins. Our findings demonstrate that although CaVβ1 regulates T cell function, these effects are independent of VGCC channel activity.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The clinical roles of SYNJ2 were investigated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, univariate Cox regression analysis, and Kaplan-Meier plots. The underlying mechanisms of SYNJ2 in LUSC were explored by gene set enrichment analysis and immune correlation analysis. Further, a pan-cancer analysis based on 10,238 sapiens was performed to promote the understating of the expression and clinical significance of SYNJ2 in multiple human cancers.SYNJ2 was found to be significantly upregulated in LUSC at both mRNA and protein levels (p < 0.05, SMD = 0.89 [95% CI 0.34-1.45]) via public and in-house samples. Overexpressed SYNJ2 predicted poor prognosis for LUSC patients (hazard ratio = 2.38 [95% CI 1.42-3.98]). The cancer-promoting effect of SYNJ2 may be related to protein digestion and absorption and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction. SYNJ2 expression was closely related to immune cell infiltration, indicating its role in the immune response. Moreover, the distinct expression levels and essential clinical relevance of SYNJ2 in a series of cancers were initially revealed in this study.This study disclosed the clinical significance of SYNJ2 in LUSC and multiple cancers, demonstrating the novel and potential biomarker for predicting and treating cancers.© 2022.

To improve our understanding of its functional role in high grade serous ovarian cancer, we determined transcriptomic differences between ovarian tumors with high- versus low-WFDC2 mRNA levels in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. High-WFDC2 transcript levels were significantly associated with reduced survival in stage III/IV serous ovarian cancer patients. Differential expression and correlation analyses revealed secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI/WFDC4) as the gene most positively correlated with WFDC2, while A kinase anchor protein-12 was most negatively correlated. WFDC2 and SLPI were strongly correlated across many cancers. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation in differentially expressed genes associated with high-WFDC2 levels, while extracellular matrix organization was enriched among genes associated with low-WFDC2 levels. Immune cell subsets found to be positively correlated with WFDC2 levels were B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, while neutrophils and endothelial cells were negatively correlated with WFDC2. Results were compared with DepMap cell culture gene expression data. Gene ontology analysis of k-means clustering revealed that genes associated with low-WFDC2 were also enriched in extracellular matrix and adhesion categories, while high-WFDC2 genes were enriched in epithelial cell proliferation and peptidase activity. These results support previous findings regarding the effect of HE4/WFDC2 on ovarian cancer pathogenesis in cell lines and mouse models, while adding another layer of complexity to its potential functions in ovarian tumor tissue. Further experimental explorations of these findings in the context of the tumor microenvironment are merited.© 2022.

"35566582","Ezrin Contributes to the Plasma Membrane Expression of PD-L1 in A2780 Cells.","J Clin Med","Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is one of the immune checkpoint molecule localized on the plasma membrane of numerous cancer cells that negatively regulates T-cell-mediated immunosurveillance. Despite the remarkable efficacy and safety profile of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-L1 antibodies, restricted poor therapeutic responses to ICIs are often observed in patients with ovarian cancer. Because higher expression of PD-L1 in advanced ovarian cancer is associated with a decreased survival rate, identifying the potential molecules to regulate the plasma membrane expression of PD-L1 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy to improve the efficacy of ICIs against ovarian cancers. Here, we reveal the involvement of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family, which crosslinks transmembrane proteins with the actin cytoskeleton by serving as a scaffold protein, in the plasma membrane expression of PD-L1 in the human epithelial ovarian cancer cell line A2780. Our results demonstrate that PD-L1 and all three ERMs were expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in A2780 cells, and that PD-L1 was highly colocalized with ezrin and moesin, but moderately with radixin, in the plasma membrane. Interestingly, RNA interference-mediated gene silencing of ezrin, but not of radixin or moesin, substantially reduced the plasma membrane expression of PD-L1 without altering its mRNA expression. In conclusion, our results indicate that ezrin may be responsible for the plasma membrane expression of PD-L1, possibly by serving as a scaffold protein in A2780 cells. Ezrin is a potential therapeutic target for improving the efficacy of ICIs against ovarian cancers."

Recently, genetic events (e.g., mutations and copy number alterations) and molecular signaling associated with histologically different GC subtypes (diffuse and intestinal) have been elucidated. However, metabolic differences among the histological GC subtypes have not been studied systematically. In this study, we utilized transcriptome-based genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) to identify differential metabolic pathways between Lauren diffuse and intestinal subtypes. We found that diverse metabolic pathways, including cholesterol homeostasis, xenobiotic metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, the MTORC1 pathway, and glycolysis, were dysregulated between the diffuse and intestinal subtypes. Our study provides an overview of the metabolic differences between the two subtypes, possibly leading to an understanding of metabolism in GC heterogeneity."

We show that EGR2, an Ewing-susceptibility gene and an essential direct target of EWSR1-FLI1, directly regulates the transcription of genes encoding key enzymes of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. Consequently, Ewing sarcoma is one of the tumors that expresses the highest levels of mevalonate pathway genes. Moreover, genome-wide screens indicate that MVA pathway genes constitute major dependencies of Ewing cells. Accordingly, the statin inhibitors of HMG-CoA-reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme of the MVA pathway, demonstrate cytotoxicity in EwS. Statins induce increased ROS and lipid peroxidation levels, as well as decreased membrane localization of prenylated proteins, such as small GTP proteins. These metabolic effects lead to an alteration in the dynamics of S-phase progression and to apoptosis. Statin-induced effects can be rescued by downstream products of the MVA pathway. Finally, we further show that statins impair tumor growth in different Ewing PDX models. Altogether, the data show that statins, which are off-patent, well-tolerated, and inexpensive compounds, should be strongly considered in the therapeutic arsenal against this deadly childhood disease."

Platinum-based chemotherapies, in combination with topoisomerase inhibitors, are first-line therapies for SCLC, with rapid chemoresistance as a major barrier. We provided evidence in this study that nicotine and its major metabolite, cotinine, at physiologically relevant concentrations, reduced the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapies and facilitated chemoresistance in SCLC cells. Mechanistically, nicotine or cotinine reduced chemotherapy-induced DNA damage by modulating cellular redox processes, with nAChRs as the upstream targets. Surprisingly, cisplatin treatment alone also increased the levels of nAChRs in SCLC cells, which served as a self-defense mechanism against platinum-based therapies. These discoveries were confirmed in long-term in vitro and in vivo studies. Collectively, our results depicted a novel and clinically important mechanism of chemoresistance in SCLC treatment: nicotine exposure significantly compromises the efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapies in SCLC treatment by reducing therapy-induced DNA damage and accelerating chemoresistance acquisition. The results also emphasized the urgent need for tobacco cessation and the control of NRT use for SCLC management."
"35565274","Cancer Metabolic Subtypes and Their Association with Molecular and Clinical Features.","Cancers (Basel)","The alterations of metabolic pathways in cancer have been investigated for many years, beginning long before the discovery of the role of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and the last few years have witnessed renewed interest in this topic. Large-scale molecular and clinical data on tens of thousands of samples allow us to tackle the problem from a general point of view. Here, we show that transcriptomic profiles of tumors can be exploited to define metabolic cancer subtypes, which can be systematically investigated for associations with other molecular and clinical data. We find thousands of significant associations between metabolic subtypes and molecular features such as somatic mutations, structural variants, epigenetic modifications, protein abundance and activation, and with clinical/phenotypic data, including survival probability, tumor grade, and histological types, which we make available to the community in a dedicated web resource. Our work provides a methodological framework and a rich database of statistical associations, which will contribute to the understanding of the role of metabolic alterations in cancer and to the development of precision therapeutic strategies."

To discover novel druggable targets for cancers carrying co-mutations in Ras and p53, we performed arrayed, kinome focused siRNA and oncology drug phenotypic screening utilizing a set of syngeneic Ras mutant squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines that also carried co-mutations in selected p53 pathway genes. These cell lines were derived from SCCs from carcinogen-treated inbred mice which harbored germline deletions or mutations in Trp53, p19Arf, Atm, or Prkdc. Both siRNA and drug phenotypic screening converge to implicate the phosphoinositol kinases, receptor tyrosine kinases, MAP kinases, as well as cell cycle and DNA damage response genes as targetable dependencies in SCC. Differences in functional kinome profiles between Ras mutant cell lines reflect incomplete penetrance of Ras synthetic lethal kinases and indicate that co-mutations cause a rewiring of survival pathways in Ras mutant tumors. This study describes the functional kinomic landscape of Ras/p53 mutant chemically-induced squamous cell carcinoma in both the baseline unperturbed state and following DNA damage and nominates candidate therapeutic targets, including the Nek4 kinase, for further development.© 2022.

However, the potential mechanisms of TME and DNA methylation remain unclear in cervical cancer (CC).Methods:The immune and stromal scores of TME were generated by the ESTIMATE algorithm for CC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The TME and DNA methylation-related genes were identified by the integrative analysis of DNA promoter methylation and gene expression. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression was performed 1,000 times to further identify a nine-gene TME and DNA methylation-related prognostic signature. The signature was further validated in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. Then, the identified signature was integrated with the Federation International of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage to establish a composite prognostic nomogram.Results:CC patients with high immunity levels have better survival than those with low immunity levels. Both in the training and validation datasets, the risk score of the signature was an independent prognosis factor. The composite nomogram showed higher accuracy of prognosis and greater net benefits than the FIGO stage and the signature. The high-risk group had a significantly higher fraction of genome altered than the low-risk group. Eleven genes were significantly different in mutation frequencies between the high- and low-risk groups. Interestingly, patients with mutantTTNhad better overall survival (OS) than those with wild type. Patients in the low-risk group had significantly higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) than those in the high-risk group. Taken together, the results of TMB, immunophenoscore (IPS), and tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) score suggested that patients in the low-risk group may have greater immunotherapy benefits. Finally, four drugs (panobinostat, lenvatinib, everolimus, and temsirolimus) were found to have potential therapeutic implications for patients with a high-risk score.Conclusions:Our findings highlight that the TME and DNA methylation-related prognostic signature can accurately predict the prognosis of CC and may be important for stratified management of patients and precision targeted therapy.Copyright © 2022 Liu, Zhai, Wang, Liu, Liu, Zhu, Wang, Tian and Zhang."

Here we performed in-depth analysis of the phenotype and tumour specificity of CD4+T cells infiltrating human melanoma specimens, finding that exhausted cytotoxic CD4+T cells could be directly induced by melanoma cells through recognition of HLA class II-restricted neoantigens, and also HLA class I-restricted tumour-associated antigens. CD4+T regulatory (TReg) cells could be indirectly elicited through presentation of tumour antigens via antigen-presenting cells. Notably, numerous tumour-reactive CD4+TRegclones were stimulated directly by HLA class II-positive melanoma and demonstrated specificity for melanoma neoantigens. This phenomenon was observed in the presence of an extremely high tumour neoantigen load, which we confirmed to be associated with HLA class II positivity through the analysis of 116 melanoma specimens. Our data reveal the landscape of infiltrating CD4+T cells in melanoma and point to the presentation of HLA class II-restricted neoantigens and direct engagement of immunosuppressive CD4+TRegcells as a mechanism of immune evasion that is favoured in HLA class II-positive melanoma.© 2022.

Ferroptosis is a newly defined form of regulated cell death characterized by the accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides and exerts an increased attention for cancer treatment. However, little is known about ferroptosis in CRC. In this study, through whole genome sequencing and external differential differentiated expression analysis, we identify CUL9 as a novel important modulator for ferroptosis in CRC. Here we demonstrated that CUL9 can binds p53 to ubiquitylate heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C for degradation. Overexpression of CUL9 increases resistance to erastin-induced ferroptosis. Then, we discovered this resistance was mediated by CUL9-HNRNPC-MATE1 negative loop, which can provide us with a novel target to overcome drug resistance to ferroptosis activators. Finally, we found that targeting MDM2 was developed as an effective strategy to destroy precious drug-resistant CRC cells.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
"35504869","MrgprF acts as a tumor suppressor in cutaneous melanoma by restraining PI3K/Akt signaling.","Signal Transduct Target Ther","The incidence of cutaneous melanoma (CM) has been increasing annually worldwide. In this study, we identify that MrgprF, a MAS related GPR family member, is decreased in cutaneous melanoma tissues and cell lines due to hypermethylation of its promoter region, and show that patients with CM expressing high levels of MrgprF exhibit an improved clinical outcome. We demonstrate that MrgprF forced expression inhibits tumor cell proliferation, migration, xenograft tumor growth, and metastasis. On the contrary, MrgprF knockdown promotes tumor cell proliferation and transformation of immortalized human keratinocyte-HaCaT cells, supporting the inhibitory role of MrgprF during tumor progression. Mechanistic studies reveal that MrgprF reduces the phosphoinositol‑3‑kinase (PI3K) complex formation between p101 and p110γ subunits, the critical step for phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4)-P2 (PIP2) conversion to phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4, 5)-P3 (PIP3), and then reduces the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling. This effect can be reversed by Akt specific agonist SC79. In addition, AMG 706, a previously documented inhibitor for endothelial cell proliferation, is identified as a potential agonist for MrgprF, and can impede tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that MrgprF, a novel tumor suppressor in cutaneous melanoma, may be useful as a therapeutic target in the future.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35502547","Whole-Genome Duplication Shapes the Aneuploidy Landscape of Human Cancers.","Cancer Res","Aneuploidy is a hallmark of cancer with tissue-specific prevalence patterns that suggest it plays a driving role in cancer initiation and progression. However, the contribution of aneuploidy to tumorigenesis depends on both cellular and genomic contexts. Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is a common macroevolutionary event that occurs in more than 30% of human tumors early in tumorigenesis. Although tumors that have undergone WGD are reported to be more permissive to aneuploidy, it remains unknown whether WGD also affects aneuploidy prevalence patterns. Here we analyzed clinical tumor samples from 5,586 WGD- tumors and 3,435 WGD+ tumors across 22 tumor types and found distinct patterns of aneuploidy in WGD- and WGD+ tumors. WGD+ tumors were characterized by more promiscuous aneuploidy patterns, in line with increased aneuploidy tolerance. Moreover, the genetic interactions between chromosome arms differed between WGD- and WGD+ tumors, giving rise to distinct cooccurrence and mutual exclusivity aneuploidy patterns. The proportion of whole-chromosome aneuploidy compared with arm-level aneuploidy was significantly higher in WGD+ tumors, indicating distinct dominant mechanisms for aneuploidy formation. Human cancer cell lines successfully reproduced these WGD/aneuploidy interactions, confirming the relevance of studying this phenomenon in culture. Finally, induction of WGD and assessment of aneuploidy in isogenic WGD-/WGD+ human colon cancer cell lines under standard or selective conditions validated key findings from the clinical tumor analysis, supporting a causal link between WGD and altered aneuploidy landscapes. We conclude that WGD shapes the aneuploidy landscape of human tumors and propose that this interaction contributes to tumor evolution.These findings suggest that the interactions between whole-genome duplication and aneuploidy are important for tumor evolution, highlighting the need to consider genome status in the analysis and modeling of cancer aneuploidy.©2022 American Association for Cancer Research."
"35501486","A T cell resilience model associated with response to immunotherapy in multiple tumor types.","Nat Med","Despite breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, most tumor-reactive T cells cannot persist in solid tumors due to an immunosuppressive environment. We developed Tres (tumor-resilient T cell), a computational model utilizing single-cell transcriptomic data to identify signatures of T cells that are resilient to immunosuppressive signals, such as transforming growth factor-β1, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and prostaglandin E2. Tres reliably predicts clinical responses to immunotherapy in melanoma, lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and B cell malignancies using bulk T cell transcriptomic data from pre-treatment tumors from patients who received immune-checkpoint inhibitors (n = 38), infusion products for chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies (n = 34) and pre-manufacture samples for chimeric antigen receptor T cell or tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapies (n = 84). Further, Tres identified FIBP, whose functions are largely unknown, as the top negative marker of tumor-resilient T cells across many solid tumor types. FIBP knockouts in murine and human donor CD8+ T cells significantly enhanced T cell-mediated cancer killing in in vitro co-cultures. Further, Fibp knockout in murine T cells potentiated the in vivo efficacy of adoptive cell transfer in the B16 tumor model. Fibp knockout T cells exhibit reduced cholesterol metabolism, which inhibits effector T cell function. These results demonstrate the utility of Tres in identifying biomarkers of T cell effectiveness and potential therapeutic targets for immunotherapies in solid tumors.© 2022.

Meanwhile, the protein level of SEMA5B was analyzed by CPTAC and validated by HPA. The diagnostic value of SEMA5B was analyzed according to the TCGA database and validated by GSE53757, GSE46699, and GSE11024 + GSE46699 datasets. Then, the survival analysis was conducted using GEPIA2. R software (v3.6.3) was applied to investigate the relevance between SEMA5B and immune checkpoints and m6A RNA methylation regulator expression. The correlation between SEMA5B and MMRs and DNMT expression and tumor-infiltrating immune cells was explored via TIMER2. Co-expressed genes of SEMA5B were assessed by cBioPortal, and enrichment analysis was conducted by Metascape. The methylation analysis was conducted with MEXPRESS and MethSurv online tools. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied to annotate the biological function of SEMA5B.Results:SEMA5B was significantly upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in KIRC. Further analysis demonstrated that the mRNA expression of SEMA5B was significantly correlated with gender, age, T stage, pathologic stage, and histologic grade. High levels of SEMA5B were found to be a favorable prognostic factor and novel diagnostic biomarker for KIRC. SEMA5B expression was shown to be significantly associated with the abundance of immune cells in KIRC. Also, SEMA5B expression was significantly correlated with the abundance of MMR genes, DNMTs, and m6A regulators in KIRC. Enrichment analysis indicated that the co-expressed genes may involve in crosslinking in the extracellular matrix (ECM). GSEA disclosed that SYSTEMIC_LUPUS_ERYTHEMATOSUS and NABA_ECM_REGULATORS were prominently enriched in the SEMA5B low-expression phenotype.

This study is aimed at conducting a comprehensive analysis about roles of SOX family in HCC for obtaining more therapeutic targets and biomarkers which may bring new ideas for the treatment of HCC.UALCAN, Kaplan Meier plotter, cBioPortal, STRING, WebGestalt, Metascape, TIMER 2.0, DiseaseMeth, MethSurv, HPA, CCLE database, and Cytoscape software were used to comprehensively analyze the bioinformatic data.SOX2, SOX4, SOX8, SOX10, SOX11, SOX12, SOX17, and SOX18 were significantly differentially expressed in HCC and normal tissues and were valuable for the grade and survival of HCC patients. In addition, the gene alterations of SOX family happened frequently, and SOX4 and SOX17 had the highest mutation rate. The function of SOX family on HCC may be closely correlated with the regulation of angiogenesis-related signaling pathways. Moreover, SOX4, SOX8, SOX11, SOX12, SOX17, and SOX18 were correlation with 8 types of immune cells (including CD8+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, B cell, Tregs, neutrophil, macrophage, myeloid DC, and NK cell), and we found that most types of immune cells had a positive correlation with SOX family. Notably, CD4+ T cell and macrophage were positively related with all these SOX family. NK cells were negatively related with most SOX family genes. DNA methylation levels in promoter area of SOX2, SOX4, and SOX10 were lower in HCC than normal tissues, while SOX8, SOX11, SOX17, and SOX18 had higher DNA methylation levels than normal tissues. Moreover, higher DNA methylation level of SOX12 and SOX18 demonstrated worse survival rates in patients with HCC.SOX family genes could predict the prognosis of HCC. In addition, the regulation of angiogenesis-related signaling pathways may participate in the development of HCC. DNA methylation level and immune microenvironment characteristics (especially CD4+ T cell and macrophage immune cell infiltration) could be a novel insight for predicting prognosis in HCC.Copyright © 2022 Sha Qin et al."
"35456317","Ezrin Regulates the Cell Surface Localization of PD-L1 in HEC-151 Cells.","J Clin Med","Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) is an immune checkpoint molecule widely expressed on the surface of cancer cells and is an attractive immunotherapeutic target for numerous cancer cell types. However, patients with endometrial cancer derive little clinical benefit from immune checkpoint blockade therapy because of their poor response rate. Despite the increasingly important function of PD-L1 in tumor immunology, the mechanism of PD-L1 localization on endometrial cancer cell surfaces is largely unknown. We demonstrated the contribution of the ezrin, radixin, and moesin (ERM) family, which consists of scaffold proteins that control the cell surface localization of several transmembrane proteins to the localization of PD-L1 on the cell surface of HEC-151, a human uterine endometrial cancer cell line. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation analysis revealed the colocalization of all the ERM with PD-L1 on the cell surface, as well as their protein-protein interactions. The RNA-interference-mediated knockdown of ezrin, but not radixin and moesin, significantly reduced the cell surface expression of PD-L1, as measured by flow cytometry, with little impact on the PD-L1 mRNA expression. In conclusion, among the three ERM proteins present in HEC-151 cells, ezrin may execute the scaffold function for PD-L1 and may be mainly responsible for the cell surface localization of PD-L1, presumably via the post-translational modification process."
"35452470","Development and characterization of rabbit monoclonal antibodies that recognize human spermine oxidase and application to immunohistochemistry of human cancer tissues.","PLoS One","The enzyme spermine oxidase (SMOX) is involved in polyamine catabolism and converts spermine to spermidine. The enzymatic reaction generates reactive hydrogen peroxide and aldehydes as by-products that can damage DNA and other biomolecules. Increased expression of SMOX is frequently found in lung, prostate, colon, stomach and liver cancer models, and the enzyme also appears to play a role in neuronal dysfunction and vascular retinopathy. Because of growing evidence that links SMOX activity with DNA damage, inflammation, and carcinogenesis, the enzyme has come into view as a potential drug target. A major challenge in cancer research is the lack of characterization of antibodies used for identification of target proteins. To overcome this limitation, we generated a panel of high-affinity rabbit monoclonal antibodies against various SMOX epitopes and selected antibodies for use in immunoblotting, SMOX quantification assays, immunofluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry analysis with the antibody SMAB10 in normal and transformed tissues confirms that SMOX is upregulated in several different cancers. Together, the panel of antibodies generated herein adds to the toolbox of high-quality reagents to study SMOX biology and to facilitate SMOX drug development."
"35449309","KMT2C deficiency promotes small cell lung cancer metastasis through DNMT3A-mediated epigenetic reprogramming.","Nat Cancer","Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is notorious for its early and frequent metastases, which contribute to it as a recalcitrant malignancy. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying SCLC metastasis, we generated SCLC mouse models with orthotopically transplanted genome-edited lung organoids and performed multiomics analyses. We found that a deficiency of KMT2C, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase frequently mutated in extensive-stage SCLC, promoted multiple-organ metastases in mice. Metastatic and KMT2C-deficient SCLC displayed both histone and DNA hypomethylation. Mechanistically, KMT2C directly regulated the expression of DNMT3A, a de novo DNA methyltransferase, through histone methylation. Forced DNMT3A expression restrained metastasis of KMT2C-deficient SCLC through repressing metastasis-promoting MEIS/HOX genes. Further, S-(5'-adenosyl)-L-methionine, the common cofactor of histone and DNA methyltransferases, inhibited SCLC metastasis. Thus, our study revealed a concerted epigenetic reprogramming of KMT2C- and DNMT3A-mediated histone and DNA hypomethylation underlying SCLC metastasis, which suggested a potential epigenetic therapeutic vulnerability.© 2022.

"35444283","CCNE1 amplification is synthetic lethal with PKMYT1 kinase inhibition.","Nature","Amplification of the CCNE1 locus on chromosome 19q12 is prevalent in multiple tumour types, particularly in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, uterine tumours and gastro-oesophageal cancers, where high cyclin E levels are associated with genome instability, whole-genome doubling and resistance to cytotoxic and targeted therapies1-4. To uncover therapeutic targets for tumours with CCNE1 amplification, we undertook genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9-based synthetic lethality screens in cellular models of CCNE1 amplification. Here we report that increasing CCNE1 dosage engenders a vulnerability to the inhibition of the PKMYT1 kinase, a negative regulator of CDK1. To inhibit PKMYT1, we developed RP-6306, an orally bioavailable and selective inhibitor that shows single-agent activity and durable tumour regressions when combined with gemcitabine in models of CCNE1 amplification. RP-6306 treatment causes unscheduled activation of CDK1 selectively in CCNE1-overexpressing cells, promoting early mitosis in cells undergoing DNA synthesis. CCNE1 overexpression disrupts CDK1 homeostasis at least in part through an early activation of the MMB-FOXM1 mitotic transcriptional program. We conclude that PKMYT1 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for CCNE1-amplified cancers.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35440542","A proteogenomic analysis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma in a Chinese population.","Nat Commun","Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a common and aggressive subtype of renal cancer. Here we conduct a comprehensive proteogenomic analysis of 232 tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue pairs from Chinese ccRCC patients. By comparing with tumor adjacent tissues, we find that ccRCC shows extensive metabolic dysregulation and an enhanced immune response. Molecular subtyping classifies ccRCC tumors into three subtypes (GP1-3), among which the most aggressive GP1 exhibits the strongest immune phenotype, increased metastasis, and metabolic imbalance, linking the multi-omics-derived phenotypes to clinical outcomes of ccRCC. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), a one-carbon metabolic enzyme, is identified as a potential marker of ccRCC and a drug target for GP1. We demonstrate that NNMT induces DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) homocysteinylation, increases DNA repair, and promotes ccRCC tumor growth. This study provides insights into the biological underpinnings and prognosis assessment of ccRCC, revealing targetable metabolic vulnerabilities.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35437317","Phosphate dysregulation via the XPR1-KIDINS220 protein complex is a therapeutic vulnerability in ovarian cancer.","Nat Cancer","Despite advances in precision medicine, the clinical prospects for patients with ovarian and uterine cancers have not substantially improved. Here, we analyzed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens across 851 human cancer cell lines and found that frequent overexpression of SLC34A2-encoding a phosphate importer-is correlated with sensitivity to loss of the phosphate exporter XPR1, both in vitro and in vivo. In patient-derived tumor samples, we observed frequent PAX8-dependent overexpression of SLC34A2, XPR1 copy number amplifications and XPR1 messenger RNA overexpression. Mechanistically, in SLC34A2-high cancer cell lines, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of XPR1-dependent phosphate efflux leads to the toxic accumulation of intracellular phosphate. Finally, we show that XPR1 requires the novel partner protein KIDINS220 for proper cellular localization and activity, and that disruption of this protein complex results in acidic ""vacuolar"" structures preceding cell death. These data point to the XPR1-KIDINS220 complex and phosphate dysregulation as a therapeutic vulnerability in ovarian cancer.© 2022.

However, the detailed pleiotropic genetic etiology and neurobiological pathways have not been well understood, and there are many variants with underestimated effect on the comorbidity of the two diseases. Utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of epilepsy (15,212 cases and 29,677 controls) and depression (170,756 cases and 329,443 controls) from large consortia, we assessed the integrated gene-based association with both diseases by Multimarker Analysis of Genomic Annotation (MAGMA) and Fisher's meta-analysis. On the one hand, shared genes with significantly altered transcripts in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets were considered as possible pleiotropic genes. On the other hand, the pathway enrichment analysis was conducted based on the gene lists with nominal significance in the gene-based association test of each disease. We identified a total of two pleiotropic genes (CD3GandSLCO3A1) with gene expression analysis validated and interpreted twenty-five common biological process supported with literature mining. This study indicates the potentially shared genes associated with both epilepsy and depression based on gene expression, meta-data analysis, and pathway enrichment strategy along with traditional GWAS and provides insights into the possible intersecting pathways that were not previously reported.Copyright © 2022 Han Lin et al."

Cycloplegic autorefraction (1% cyclopentolate) and axial length (AL) were measured at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. Questionnaires about parental myopia and environmental risk factors, such as time of outdoors and near work, were collected.A total of 603 right eyes of 603 children were included. Parental myopia was not associated with a change in refraction, but two myopic parents were associated with a longer change in AL (coefficient = 0.153,p= 0.006), after adjusted for baseline spherical refraction, age, gender, change in height, change in weight, and environment risk factors. In the multivariate analyses, boys showed a more myopic refraction shift than girls in 1 year (coefficient = -0.150,p= 0.008) and a quicker AL elongation (coefficient = 0.120,p= 0.008). Time of near work, such as watching television, using computer, reading and writing, and time of outdoor activities, was not associated with a change in refraction or AL.In preschool age, environmental risk factors were not strongly associated with the change in refraction or refractive components. Parental myopia influences the refractive development of children continuously from infancy to preschool age, which might be the biological basis of school myopia.Copyright © 2022 Ma, Lin, Zhu, Zhao, Zhang, Yin, Shao, He, Xu and Zou."

Almost half of CRC patients will develop metastases in the course of the disease and most patients with metastatic CRC are incurable. Particularly, the 5-year survival rate of patients with stage 4 CRC at diagnosis is less than 10%. Although genetic understanding of these CRC tumors and paired metastases has led to major advances in elucidating early driver genes responsible for carcinogenesis and metastasis, the pathophysiological contribution of transcriptional and epigenetic aberrations in this malignancy which influence many central signaling pathways have attracted attention recently. Therefore, treatments that could affect several different molecular pathways may have pivotal implications for their efficacy.

The increasing contribution of lifestyle-associated risk factors to VaD has pointed towards gene-environment interactions (i.e. epigenetics). This study thus aims to investigate the DNA methylation landscape in a chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) mouse model of VaD. As a nexus between the gene-environment interaction, intermittent fasting (IF) was introduced as a prophylactic intervention.Methods:Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) was used to induce CCH by placing micro-coils of 0.18 mm in each common carotid artery of the mice. The coils were left in the mice for 7, 15 and 30 days to study temporal differences. IF was introduced for 16 h daily for 4 months prior to BCAS. Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) was used to study the DNA methylation landscape. Cognitive impairment was measured using Barnes Maze Test. White matter lesions (WML) and neuronal loss were measured using Luxol fast blue staining and cresyl violet staining respectively.Results:IF mice subjected to CCH displayed significantly better cognitive learning ability and memory, improved neuropathological alterations with reduced WMLs and neuronal loss. Modulation of DNA methylation patterns in the cortex of AL CCH mice was re-modelled and signs of reversal was observed in IF CCH mice across all three timepoints.Conclusions:These findings provide an understanding of how IF may protect the brain against damage caused by CCH and show promise in offering potential beneficial effects in mitigating the neuropathology and cognitive deficits in VaD.© The author(s)."
"35457077","Neuroepigenetic Mechanisms of Action of Ultrashort Peptides in Alzheimer's Disease.","Int J Mol Sci","Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is necessary for maintaining higher-order cognitive functions (learning and memory). The current understanding of the role of epigenetics in the mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is focused on DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, histone modifications, and regulation of non-coding RNAs. The pathogenetic links of this disease are the misfolding and aggregation of tau protein and amyloid peptides, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, impaired energy metabolism, destruction of the blood-brain barrier, and neuroinflammation, all of which lead to impaired synaptic plasticity and memory loss. Ultrashort peptides are promising neuroprotective compounds with a broad spectrum of activity and without reported side effects. The main aim of this review is to analyze the possible epigenetic mechanisms of the neuroprotective action of ultrashort peptides in AD. The review highlights the role of short peptides in the AD pathophysiology. We formulate the hypothesis that peptide regulation of gene expression can be mediated by the interaction of short peptides with histone proteins, cis- and transregulatory DNA elements and effector molecules (DNA/RNA-binding proteins and non-coding RNA). The development of therapeutic agents based on ultrashort peptides may offer a promising addition to the multifunctional treatment of AD."

A prospective birth cohort study was performed to clarify the effects of neurotoxicants on child development, namely, the Tohoku Study of Child Development, in Japan. This study aimed to evaluate the association of prenatal exposure to five toxic metals-arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead (Pb), antimony (Sb), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, N = 166)-with global DNA methylation in umbilical cord blood DNA. DNA methylation markers, 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (mC) and 5-hydroxymethyl-2'-deoxycytidine (hmC), were determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The mC content in cord blood DNA was positively correlated with Pb and Sb levels (r= 0.435 and 0.288, respectively) but not with cord blood PCBs. We also observed significant positive correlations among Pb levels, maternal age, and hmC content (r= 0.155 and 0.243, respectively). The multiple regression analysis among the potential predictors demonstrated consistent positive associations between Pb and Sb levels and mC and hmC content. Our results suggest that global DNA methylation is a promising biomarker for prenatal exposure to Pb and Sb."

According to the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease, several factors, both harmful and protective, such as nutrition, diseases, drugs, microbiome, and stressors, interact with genotypic variation to change the capacity of the organism to successfully adapt and grow in later life. In this review, we aim to provide the latest evidence about predictive risk and protective factors for developing asthma in different stages of life, from the fetal period to adolescence, in order to develop strategic preventive and therapeutic interventions to predict and improve health later in life. Our study shows that for some risk factors, such as exposure to cigarette smoke, environmental pollutants, and family history of asthma, the evidence in favor of a strong association of those factors with the development of asthma is solid and widely shared. Similarly, the clear benefits of some protective factors were shown, providing new insights into primary prevention. On the contrary, further longitudinal studies are required, as some points in the literature remain controversial and a source of debate."
"35578131","Candelabrum cells are ubiquitous cerebellar cortex interneurons with specialized circuit properties.","Nat Neurosci","To understand how the cerebellar cortex transforms mossy fiber (MF) inputs into Purkinje cell (PC) outputs, it is vital to delineate the elements of this circuit. Candelabrum cells (CCs) are enigmatic interneurons of the cerebellar cortex that have been identified based on their morphology, but their electrophysiological properties, synaptic connections and function remain unknown. Here, we clarify these properties using electrophysiology, single-nucleus RNA sequencing, in situ hybridization and serial electron microscopy in mice. We find that CCs are the most abundant PC layer interneuron. They are GABAergic, molecularly distinct and present in all cerebellar lobules. Their high resistance renders CC firing highly sensitive to synaptic inputs. CCs are excited by MFs and granule cells and are strongly inhibited by PCs. CCs in turn primarily inhibit molecular layer interneurons, which leads to PC disinhibition. Thus, inputs, outputs and local signals converge onto CCs to allow them to assume a unique role in controlling cerebellar output.© 2022.

Addressing this need, researchers have developed integration methods to combine spatial transcriptomic data with single-cell RNA-seq data to predict the spatial distribution of undetected transcripts and/or perform cell type deconvolution of spots in histological sections. However, to date, no independent studies have comparatively analyzed these integration methods to benchmark their performance. Here we present benchmarking of 16 integration methods using 45 paired datasets (comprising both spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data) and 32 simulated datasets. We found that Tangram, gimVI, and SpaGE outperformed other integration methods for predicting the spatial distribution of RNA transcripts, whereas Cell2location, SpatialDWLS, and RCTD are the top-performing methods for the cell type deconvolution of spots.

Here we describe DIALOGUE, a method to systematically uncover multicellular programs (MCPs)-combinations of coordinated cellular programs in different cell types that form higher-order functional units at the tissue level-from either spatial data or single-cell data obtained without spatial information. Tested on spatial datasets from the mouse hypothalamus, cerebellum, visual cortex and neocortex, DIALOGUE identified MCPs associated with animal behavior and recovered spatial properties when tested on unseen data while outperforming other methods and metrics. In spatial data from human lung cancer, DIALOGUE identified MCPs marking immune activation and tissue remodeling. Applied to single-cell RNA sequencing data across individuals or regions, DIALOGUE uncovered MCPs marking Alzheimer's disease, ulcerative colitis and resistance to cancer immunotherapy. These programs were predictive of disease outcome and predisposition in independent cohorts and included risk genes from genome-wide association studies.

In the canonical pathway, oestradiol exerts its effects through the transcription factor oestrogen receptor-α (ERα)9. Although ERα has been extensively characterized in breast cancer, the neuronal targets of ERα, and their involvement in brain sex differences, remain largely unknown. Here we generate a comprehensive map of genomic ERα-binding sites in a sexually dimorphic neural circuit that mediates social behaviours. We conclude that ERα orchestrates sexual differentiation of the mouse brain through two mechanisms: establishing two male-biased neuron types and activating a sustained male-biased gene expression program. Collectively, our findings reveal that sex differences in gene expression are defined by hormonal activation of neuronal steroid receptors. The molecular targets we identify may underlie the effects of oestradiol on brain development, behaviour and disease.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that GLUE is more accurate, robust and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data. We applied GLUE to various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, integrative regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction over millions of cells, where GLUE was able to correct previous annotations.

However, currently, it is challenging to infer the joint representations and learn relationships among multiple modalities from complex multimodal single-cell data.

The pseudocell generation strategy of scMM compensates for the limited interpretability of deep learning models, and the proposed approach experimentally discovered multimodal regulatory programs associated with latent dimensions. Analysis of recently produced datasets validated that scMM facilitates high-resolution clustering with rich interpretability.

Genetic drivers in PTCL-NOS include genomic alterations affecting the VAV1 oncogene; however, their specific role and mechanisms in PTCL-NOS remain incompletely understood. Here we show that expression of Vav1-Myo1f, a recurrent PTCL-associated VAV1 fusion, induces oncogenic transformation of CD4+T cells. Notably, mouse Vav1-Myo1f lymphomas show T helper type 2 features analogous to high-risk GATA3+human PTCL. Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals that Vav1-Myo1f alters T cell differentiation and leads to accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment, a feature linked with aggressiveness in human PTCL. Importantly, therapeutic targeting of TAMs induces strong anti-lymphoma effects, highlighting the lymphoma cells' dependency on the microenvironment. These results demonstrate an oncogenic role for Vav1-Myo1f in the pathogenesis of PTCL, involving deregulation in T cell polarization, and identify the lymphoma-associated macrophage-tumor microenvironment as a therapeutic target in PTCL.Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

Vertical transmission of COVID-19 is uncommon, but reports show that there are thrombotic, vascular, and inflammatory changes in the placenta to which neonates are prenatally exposed. Individuals exposed in utero to influenza during the 1918 pandemic had increased risk for heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, stomach disease and hypertension. Early exposure of COVID-19 during fetal life may lead to altered gene expression with potential long-term consequences.To determine if gene expression is altered in cord blood cells from term neonates who were exposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy and to identify potential gene pathways impacted by maternal COVID-19.Cord blood was collected from 16 term neonates (8 exposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy and 8 controls without exposure to COVID-19). Genome-wide gene expression screening was performed using Human Clariom S gene chips on total RNA extracted from cord blood cells.We identified 510 differentially expressed genes (374 genes up-regulated, 136 genes down-regulated, fold change ≥1.5,p-value ≤ 0.05) in cord blood cells associated with exposure to COVID-19 during pregnancy. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified important canonical pathways associated with diseases such as cardiovascular disease, hematological disease, embryonic cancer and cellular development. Tox functions related to cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were also altered after exposure to COVID-19 during pregnancy.Exposure to COVID-19 during pregnancy induces differential gene expression in cord blood cells. The differentially expressed genes may potentially contribute to cardiac, hepatic, renal and immunological disorders in offspring exposed to COVID-19 during pregnancy.

Nevertheless, clinical implementation of these biomarkers is limited, as only < 1% of the identified biomarkers is translated into a clinical or commercial setting. Technical factors such as a suboptimal genomic location of the assay and inefficient primer or probe design have been emphasized as important pitfalls in biomarker research. Here, we use eleven diagnostic DNA methylation biomarkers for colorectal cancer (ALX4, APC, CDKN2A, MGMT, MLH1, NDRG4, SDC2, SFRP1, SFRP2, TFPI1 and VIM), previously described in a systematic literature search, to evaluate these pitfalls.To assess the genomic assay location, the optimal genomic locations according to TCGA data were extracted and compared to the genomic locations used in the published assays for all eleven biomarkers. In addition, all primers and probes were technically evaluated according to several criteria, based on literature and expert opinion.

Moreover, the abnormal expression levels of CHDs were related to the clinical outcome of patients with lung adenocarcinoma and, to a lesser extent, patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma, which were significantly associated with the immune infiltrating levels of immune cells. Furthermore, the functions of CHDs and their neighboring genes are mainly related to DNA repair, the cell cycle, and organelle organization. Finally, cellular experiments conducted in vitro confirmed that CHD7/8 played indispensable roles in DNA damage signaling and cell cycle progression in lung adenocarcinoma cells.This study implied that CHD family members, especially in subclass III, are potential targets of precision therapy and new biomarkers for patients with lung cancer.© 2022.

"35454778","Comprehensive Analysis Identifies Ameloblastin-Related Competitive Endogenous RNA as a Prognostic Biomarker for Testicular Germ Cell Tumour.","Cancers (Basel)","Testicular Germ Cell Tumour (TGCT) is one of the most common tumours in young men. Increasing evidence shows that the extracellular matrix has a key role in the prognosis and metastasis of various human cancers. This study analysed the relationship between the matrix protein ameloblastin (AMBN) and potential biological markers associated with TGCT diagnosis and prognosis. The relationship between AMBN and TGCT prognosis was determined by bioinformatic analysis using the expression profiles of three RNAs (long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and available clinical information of the corresponding patients. Prediction and validation of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks related to AMBN was performed. AMBN and its associated ceRNA regulatory network were found to be related to the recurrence of TGCT, and LINC02701 may be used as a diagnostic factor in TGCT. Furthermore, we identified PELATON (Plaque Enriched LncRNA In Atherosclerotic And Inflammatory Bowel Macrophage Regulation) as an independent prognostic factor for TGCT progression-free interval."

However, to date, studies on the relationship between gap junctions and colorectal cancer (CRC) are limited.We synthesized connexins-coding gene expression data from public Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using R software and several database resources such as MEXPRESS database, Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA) database, Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, Tumor Immune Single Cell Hub (TISCH) database, Search Tool for Retrieval of Gene Interaction Relationships (STRING), and Cytoscape software, etc., to investigate the biological mechanisms that may be involved in connexins. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining were used to validate the expression and localization of GJA4.We found that CRC patients can be divided into two connexin clusters and that patients in cluster C1 had shorter survival than in cluster C2. The infiltration of M1 macrophages and NK cells was lower in cluster C1, while the levels of M2 macrophages and immune checkpoints were higher, indicating an immunosuppressed state in cluster C1. In addition, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype was significantly activated in cluster C1. We observed that GJA4 was up-regulated in colorectal cancer tissues, which was related to poor prognosis. It was mainly expressed in fibroblasts, but the expression levels in normal intestinal epithelial cells were low. Finally, we found that GJA4 was associated with M2 macrophages and may be a potential immunosuppressive factor.We found that there is a significant correlation between abnormal connexins expression and patients' prognosis, and connexins play an important role in stromal-tumor interactions. Connexins, especially GJA4, can help enhance our understanding of tumor microenvironment (TME) and may guide more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.© 2022 Liu et al."
"35445161","Analysis of the DNA methylation pattern of the promoter region of calcitonin gene-related peptide 1 gene in patients with episodic migraine: An exploratory case-control study.","Neurobiol Pain","Recent studies suggested that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, may be involved in migraine pathogenesis. The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), encoded by calcitonin gene-related peptide 1(CALCA)gene, plays a key role in the disease. The aim of the study was to evaluate DNA methylation ofCALCAgene in patients with episodic migraine. 22 patients with episodic migraine (F/M 15/7, mean age 39.7 ± 13.4 years) and 20 controls (F/M 12/8, mean age 40.5 ± 14.8 years) were recruited. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. Cytosine-to-thymine conversion was obtained with sodium bisulfite. The methylation pattern of two CpG islands in the promoter region ofCALCAgene was analyzed. No difference of methylation of the 30 CpG sites at the distal region ofCALCApromoter was observed between migraineurs and controls. Interestingly, in patients with episodic migraine the methylation level was lower in 2 CpG sites at the proximal promoter region (CpG -1461, p = 0.037, and -1415, p = 0.035, respectively). Furthermore, DNA methylation level at different CpG sites correlates with several clinical characteristics of the disease, as age at onset, presence of nausea/vomiting, depression and anxiety (p < 0.05). In conclusion, we found that DNA methylation profile in two CpG sites at the proximal promoter region ofCALCAis lower in migraineurs when compared to controls. Intriguingly, the -1415 hypomethylated unit is located at the CREB binding site, a nuclear transcription factor. In addition, we found a correlation between the level ofCALCAmethylation and several clinical features of migraine. Further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these results.© 2022 The Authors."
"35480112","CpG Site-Specific Methylation-Modulated Divergent Expression of <i>PRSS3</i> Transcript Variants Facilitates Nongenetic Intratumor Heterogeneity in Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma.","Front Oncol","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal human tumors with extensive intratumor heterogeneity (ITH). Serine protease 3 (PRSS3) is an indispensable member of the trypsin family and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several malignancies, including HCC. However, the paradoxical effects ofPRSS3on carcinogenesis due to an unclear molecular basis impede the utilization of its biomarker potential. We hereby explored the contribution ofPRSS3transcripts to tumor functional heterogeneity by systematically dissecting the expression of four known splice variants ofPRSS3(PRSS3-SVs, V1~V4) and their functional relevance to HCC.The expression and DNA methylation ofPRSS3transcripts and their associated clinical relevance in HCC were analyzed using several publicly available datasets and validated using qPCR-based assays. Functional experiments were performed in gain- and loss-of-function cell models, in whichPRSS3transcript constructs were separately transfected after deletingPRSS3expression by CRISPR/Cas9 editing.PRSS3was aberrantly differentially expressed toward bipolarity from very low (PRSS3Low) to very high (PRSS3High) expression across HCC cell lines and tissues. This was attributable to the disruption ofPRSS3-SVs, in whichPRSS3-V2and/orPRSS3-V1were dominant transcripts leading toPRSS3expression, whereasPRSS3-V3and-V4were rarely or minimally expressed. The expression ofPRSS3-V2or-V1was inversely associated with site-specific CpG methylation at thePRSS3promoter region that distinguished HCC cells and tissues phenotypically between hypermethylated low-expression (mPRSS3-SVLow) and hypomethylated high-expression (umPRSS3-SVHigh) groups.PRSS3-SVsdisplayed distinct functions from oncogenicPRSS3-V2to tumor-suppressivePRSS3-V1,-V3orPRSS3-V4in HCC cells. Clinically, aberrant expression ofPRSS3-SVswas translated into divergent relevance in patients with HCC, in which significant epigenetic downregulation ofPRSS3-V2was seen in early HCC and was associated with favorable patient outcome.These results provide the first evidence for the transcriptional and functional characterization ofPRSS3transcripts in HCC. Aberrant expression of divergentPRSS3-SVsdisrupted by site-specific CpG methylation may integrate the effects of oncogenicPRSS3-V2and tumor-suppressivePRSS3-V1, resulting in the molecular diversity and functional plasticity ofPRSS3in HCC. Dysregulated expression ofPRSS3-V2by site-specific CpG methylation may have potential diagnostic value for patients with early HCC.Copyright © 2022 Lin, Xu, Pang, Zhou, Pan, Zhang, Guan, Wang, Lin, Tian, Chen, Zhang, Yang, Ji, Huang, Wei, Gong, Ren, Wang, Guo and Huang."

Various hematological factors have been proven to predict the prognosis of patients with gliomas. The aim of this study is to integrate these hematological markers and develop a comprehensive system for predicting the prognosis of patients with gliomas.This retrospective study included 723 patients pathologically diagnosed with diffused gliomas. Hematological indicators were collected preoperatively, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), albumin globulin ratio (AGR), platelet distribution width (PDW), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), fibrinogen (FIB), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox was applied to screen the hematological indicators for a better prediction of patients' prognosis and to build an inflammation-nutrition score. A nomogram model was developed to predict the overall survival (OS), which included age, tumor grade, IDH-1 mutations, and inflammation-nutrition score.Patients were randomly divided into a primary cohort (n= 509) and a validation cohort (n= 214). There was no difference in age and IDH-1 mutation frequency between the cohorts. In the primary cohort, NLR, LMR, AGR, FIB, and PNI were selected to build an inflammation nutrition score. Patients with a high-risk inflammation-nutrition score had a short median OS of 17.40 months compared with 27.43 months in the low-risk group [HR2.54; 95%CI(1.91-3.37);p< 0.001]. Moreover, age, tumor grade, IDH-1 mutations, and inflammation-nutrition score were independent prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis and thus were included in the nomogram model. The nomogram model showed a high prediction value with a Harrell's concordance index (C-index) of 0.75 [95%CI(0.72-0.77)]. The validation cohort supported these results.The prognostic nomogram model provided a high prognostic predictive power for patients with gliomas.Copyright © 2022 Han, Qu, Wang, Liu, Li and Yan."
"35564732","Intermittent Hypoxia as a Therapeutic Tool to Improve Health Parameters in Older Adults.","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Aging is associated with metabolic alterations, and with a loss of strength, muscle and bone mass. Moderate intermittent hypoxia has been proposed as a new tool to enhance health-related function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of moderate intermittent hypoxia exposures on parameters related to cardiovascular and bone health in older adults. A total of 38 healthy older adults (aged 65-75 years) were divided into two groups: control group (C), and hypoxia group (H) that was subjected to an intermittent hypoxia exposure (at simulated altitude of 2500 m asl) during a 24-week period (3 days/week). Body composition, blood pressure, metabolic parameters (Cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose), C-reactive protein (CRP), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 10 (IL-10), N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PINP) and beta C-terminal telopeptide of collagen bone formation (b-CTX) were analyzed before and after the intervention. A repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to evaluate between-group differences. The results showed that the hypoxia group achieved after the intervention a decrease in fat mass, CRP (pro-inflammatory biomarker) and b-CTX (bone resorption biomarker), as well as an increase in PINP (bone formation biomarker). In conclusion, the intermittent hypoxia might be a useful therapeutic tool to deal with problems associated with aging, such as the increase in body fat, the loss of bone mass or low-grade inflammation."

Here, we define the evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial enzyme ALH-6/ALDH4A1 as a predictive biomarker for age-related changes in muscle health by combiningCaenorhabditis elegansgenetics and a gene-wide association scanning (GeneWAS) from older human participants of the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS). In a screen for mutations that activate oxidative stress responses, specifically in the muscle ofC. elegans, we identified 96 independent genetic mutants harboring loss-of-function alleles ofalh-6, exclusively. Each of these genetic mutations mapped to the ALH-6 polypeptide and led to the age-dependent loss of muscle health. Intriguingly, genetic variants inALDH4A1show associations with age-related muscle-related function in humans. Taken together, our work uncovers mitochondrialalh-6/ALDH4A1as a critical component to impact normal muscle aging across species and a predictive biomarker for muscle health over the lifespan.© 2022, Villa et al."
"35585119","Prion protein gene mutation detection using long-read Nanopore sequencing.","Sci Rep","Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative conditions that affect humans and animals. Rapid and accurate sequencing of the prion gene PRNP is paramount to human prion disease diagnosis and for animal surveillance programmes. Current methods for PRNP genotyping involve sequencing of small fragments within the protein-coding region. The contribution of variants in the non-coding regions of PRNP including large structural changes is poorly understood. Here, we used long-range PCR and Nanopore sequencing to sequence the full length of PRNP, including its regulatory region, in 25 samples from blood and brain of individuals with inherited or sporadic prion diseases. Nanopore sequencing detected the same variants as identified by Sanger sequencing, including repeat expansions/deletions. Nanopore identified additional single-nucleotide variants in the non-coding regions of PRNP, but no novel structural variants were discovered. Finally, we explored somatic mosaicism of PRNP's octapeptide repeat region, which is a hypothetical cause of sporadic prion disease. While we found changes consistent with somatic mutations, we demonstrate that they may have been generated by the PCR. Our study illustrates the accuracy of Nanopore sequencing for rapid and field prion disease diagnosis and highlights the need for single-molecule sequencing methods for the detection of somatic mutations.© 2022.

MDD is ranked as a major contributor to worldwide disability. The complex pathogenesis of MDD is not yet understood, and this is a major cause of failure to develop new therapies and MDD recurrence. Here we summarize the literature on existing hypotheses about the pathophysiological mechanisms of MDD. We describe the different approaches undertaken to understand the molecular mechanism of MDD using genetic data. Hundreds of loci have now been identified by large genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We describe these studies and how they have provided information on the biological processes, cell types, tissues and druggable targets that are enriched for MDD risk genes. We detail our understanding of the genetic correlations and causal relationships between MDD and many psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders and traits. We highlight the challenges associated with genetic studies, including the complexity of MDD genetics in diverse populations and the need for a study of rare variants and new studies of gene-environment interactions."
"35451785","From Genotype to Phenotype: Polygenic Prediction of Complex Human Traits.","Methods Mol Biol","Decoding the genome confers the capability to predict characteristics of the organism (phenotype) from DNA (genotype). We describe the present status and future prospects of genomic prediction of complex traits in humans. Some highly heritable complex phenotypes such as height and other quantitative traits can already be predicted with reasonable accuracy from DNA alone. For many diseases, including important common conditions such as coronary artery disease, breast cancer, type I and II diabetes, individuals with outlier polygenic scores (e.g., top few percent) have been shown to have 5 or even 10 times higher risk than average. Several psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and autism also fall into this category. We discuss related topics such as the genetic architecture of complex traits, sibling validation of polygenic scores, and applications to adult health, in vitro fertilization (embryo selection), and genetic engineering.© 2022.

However, identifying these expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) is complicated by differences in gene regulation across fluid functional cell states within cell types. These states-for example, neurotransmitter-driven programs in astrocytes or perivascular fibroblast differentiation-are obscured in eQTL studies that aggregate cells1,2. Here we modelled eQTLs at single-cell resolution in one complex cell type: memory T cells. Using more than 500,000 unstimulated memory T cells from 259 Peruvian individuals, we show that around one-third of 6,511 cis-eQTLs had effects that were mediated by continuous multimodally defined cell states, such as cytotoxicity and regulatory capacity. In some loci, independent eQTL variants had opposing cell-state relationships. Autoimmune variants were enriched in cell-state-dependent eQTLs, including risk variants for rheumatoid arthritis near ORMDL3 and CTLA4; this indicates that cell-state context is crucial to understanding potential eQTL pathogenicity. Moreover, continuous cell states explained more variation in eQTLs than did conventional discrete categories, such as CD4+versus CD8+, suggesting that modelling eQTLs and cell states at single-cell resolution can expand insight into gene regulation in functionally heterogeneous cell types.© 2022.

In children, it has positive effects in the prevention of obesity and cardiovascular diseases, as well as in the prevention of diabetes. We aimed to evaluate the medium-term efficacy of an intervention programme, targeting adherence to the Mediterranean diet among preschool children.In a randomised, parallel trial of participants aged 3-5 years, a school garden was attended in the experimental group, and in the control group, the usual content on the human body and health were taught. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed using the KIDMED questionnaire, controlling for weight, height, body mass index (BMI) and socio-demographic variables.A reduction in BMI was found in the experimental group after one year and at the end of the follow-up period. In the overall score obtained in the KIDMED survey, a statistical trend was found between the two groups (p= 0.076). In multivariate analysis, consumption of pulses more than once a week' was predictive of improved diet quality, with an Odds Ratio (OR) in the experimental group of 1.382 (95% CI 1.126-1.695;p= 0.009).The experimental approach improved the quality of the participants' diet, increasing adherence to the Mediterranean diet due to increased consumption of plant-based protein."

We identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs35691438 and rs671 that were significantly associated with serum copper levels (SCLs). The bidirectional two-sample MR analysis in the East Asian population showed that gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels have a causal effect on SCLs. SCLs have causal effects on six outcomes, namely risks of esophageal varix, glaucoma, sleep apnea syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus, white blood cell count, and usage of drugs affecting bone structure and mineralization.

Among studies assessing heritability and biological vulnerability for GD, neurotrophin (NTF) genes have emerged as promising targets, since a growing literature showed a possible link between NTF and addiction-related disorders. Thus, we aimed to explore the role of NTF genes and GD with the hypothesis that some NTF gene polymorphisms could constitute biological risk factors. The sample included 166 patients with GD and 191 healthy controls. 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from NTFs (NGF, NGFR, NTRK1, BDNF, NTRK2, NTF3, NTRK3, NTF4, CNTF and CNTFR) were selected and genotyped. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype constructions were analyzed, in relationship with the presence of GD. Finally, regulatory elements overlapping the identified SNPs variants associated with GD were searched. The between groups comparisons of allele frequencies indicated that 6 SNPs were potentially associated with GD. Single and multiple-marker analyses showed a strong association between both NTF3 and NTRK2 genes, and GD. The present study supports the involvement of the NTF family in the aetiopathogenesis of GD. An altered cross-regulation of different NTF members signalling pathways might be considered as a biological vulnerability factor for GD.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Our study was conducted for uncovering the roles of immune-associated genes during atherosclerotic plaque progression.Methods:Gene expression profiling of GSE28829, GSE43292, GSE41571, and GSE120521 datasets was retrieved from the GEO database. Three machine learning algorithms, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator (LASSO), random forest, and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) were utilized for screening characteristic genes among atherosclerotic plaque progression- and immune-associated genes. ROC curves were generated for estimating the diagnostic efficacy. Immune cell infiltrations were estimated via ssGSEA, and immune checkpoints were quantified. CMap analysis was implemented to screen potential small-molecule compounds. Atherosclerotic plaque specimens were classified using a consensus clustering approach.Results:Seven characteristic genes (TNFSF13B, CCL5, CCL19, ITGAL, CD14, GZMB, and BTK) were identified, which enabled the prediction of progression of atherosclerotic plaques. Higher immune cell infiltrations and immune checkpoint expressions were found in advanced-stage than in early-stage atherosclerotic plaques and were positively linked to characteristic genes. Patients could clinically benefit from the characteristic gene-based nomogram. Several small molecular compounds were predicted based on the characteristic genes. Two subtypes, namely, C1 immune subtype and C2 non-immune subtype, were classified across atherosclerotic plaques. The characteristic genes presented higher expression in C1 than in C2 subtypes.Conclusion:Our findings provide several promising atherosclerotic plaque progression- and immune-associated genes as well as immune subtypes, which might enable to assist the design of more accurately tailored cardiovascular immunotherapy.Copyright © 2022 Yang, Yi, Cai, Zhang and Xu."

However, the correlation and potential mechanism between clear cell renal cell carcinoma(ccRCC) and its TIME are not clear. Therefore, we aimed to identify potential prognostic biomarkers related to TIME of ccRCC. Unsupervised consensus clustering analysis was performed to divide patients into different immune subgroups according to their single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) scores. Then, we validated the differences in immune cell infiltration, prognosis, clinical characteristics and expression levels of HLA and immune checkpoint genes between different immune subgroups. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the significant modules and hub genes that were related to the immune subgroups. A nomogram was established to predict the overall survival (OS) outcomes after independent prognostic factors were identified by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Five clusters (immune subgroups) were identified. There was no significant difference in age, sex or N stage. And there were significant differences in race, T stage, M stage, grade, prognosis and tumor microenvironment. WGCNA revealed that the red module has an important relationship with TIME, and obtained 14 hub genes. In addition, the nomogram containingLAG3andGZMKaccurately predicted OS outcomes of ccRCC patients.LAG3andGZMKhave a certain correlation with the prognosis of ccRCC patients, and play an important role in the TIME.

Cross-lagged path analysis was used to examine the temporal relationship between BMI and gut microbial features. The associations between the gut microbes and insulin resistance-related phenotypes were examined using a linear mixed-effect model. We examined the mediation effect of gut microbes on the association between adiposity and insulin resistance-related phenotypes.

Among them, results of four species (Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Parabacteroides unclassified, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3 1 57FAA CT1, Lachnospiraceae bacterium 7 1 58FAA) were replicated in the independent HMP cohort. Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3 1 57FAA CT1 was inversely associated with HOMA-IR and fasting insulin. Lachnospiraceae bacterium 3 1 57FAA CT1 mediated the association of overweight/obesity with HOMA-IR (FDR<0.05).

"35551445","Altered DNA methylation at age-associated CpG sites in children with growth disorders: impact on age estimation?","Int J Legal Med","Age estimation based on DNA methylation (DNAm) can be applied to children, adolescents and adults, but many CG dinucleotides (CpGs) exhibit different kinetics of age-associated DNAm across these age ranges. Furthermore, it is still unclear how growth disorders impact epigenetic age predictions, and this may be particularly relevant for a forensic application. In this study, we analyzed buccal mucosa samples from 95 healthy children and 104 children with different growth disorders. DNAm was analysed by pyrosequencing for 22 CpGs in the genes PDE4C, ELOVL2, RPA2, EDARADD and DDO. The relationship between DNAm and age in healthy children was tested by Spearman's rank correlation. Differences in DNAm between the groups ""healthy children"" and the (sub-)groups of children with growth disorders were tested by ANCOVA. Models for age estimation were trained (1) based on the data from 11 CpGs with a close correlation between DNAm and age (R ≥ 0.75) and (2) on five CpGs that also did not present significant differences in DNAm between healthy and diseased children. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between the healthy group and the group with growth disorders (11 CpGs), the subgroup with a short stature (12 CpGs) and the non-short stature subgroup (three CpGs). The results are in line with the assumption of an epigenetic regulation of height-influencing genes. Age predictors trained on 11 CpGs with high correlations between DNAm and age revealed higher mean absolute errors (MAEs) in the group of growth disorders (mean MAE 2.21 years versus MAE 1.79 in the healthy group) as well as in the short stature (sub-)groups; furthermore, there was a clear tendency for overestimation of ages in all growth disorder groups (mean age deviations: total growth disorder group 1.85 years, short stature group 1.99 years). Age estimates on samples from children with growth disorders were more precise when using a model containing only the five CpGs that did not present significant differences in DNAm between healthy and diseased children (mean age deviations: total growth disorder group 1.45 years, short stature group 1.66 years). The results suggest that CpGs in genes involved in processes relevant for growth and development should be avoided in age prediction models for children since they may be sensitive for alterations in the DNAm pattern in cases of growth disorders.© 2022.

Loss- and gain-of-function mutations in H3K36 methyltransferases are closely linked to human developmental disorders and various cancers. Structural analyses suggest that nucleosomal components such as the linker DNA and a hydrophobic patch constituted by histone H2A and H3 are likely determinants of H3K36 methylation in addition to the histone H3 tail, which encompasses H3K36 and the catalytic SET domain. Interaction of H3K36 methyltransferases with the nucleosome collaborates with regulation of their auto-inhibitory changes fine-tunes the precision of H3K36me in mediating dimethylation by NSD2 and NSD3 as well as trimethylation by Set2/SETD2. The identification of specific structural features and various cis-acting factors that bind to different forms of H3K36me, particularly the di-(H3K36me2) and tri-(H3K36me3) methylated forms of H3K36, have highlighted the intricacy of H3K36me functional significance. Here, we consolidate these findings and offer structural insight to the regulation of H3K36me2 to H3K36me3 conversion. We also discuss the mechanisms that underlie the cooperation between H3K36me and other chromatin modifications (in particular, H3K27me3, H3 acetylation, DNA methylation and N6-methyladenosine in RNAs) in the physiological regulation of the epigenomic functions of chromatin.© 2022.

"35534561","The disordered N-terminal domain of DNMT3A recognizes H2AK119ub and is required for postnatal development.","Nat Genet","DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3A) plays a crucial role during mammalian development. Two isoforms of DNMT3A are differentially expressed from stem cells to somatic tissues, but their individual functions remain largely uncharacterized. Here we report that the long isoform DNMT3A1, but not the short DNMT3A2, is essential for mouse postnatal development. DNMT3A1 binds to and regulates bivalent neurodevelopmental genes in the brain. Strikingly, Dnmt3a1 knockout perinatal lethality could be partially rescued by DNMT3A1 restoration in the nervous system. We further show that the intrinsically disordered N terminus of DNMT3A1 is required for normal development and DNA methylation at DNMT3A1-enriched regions. Mechanistically, a ubiquitin-interacting motif embedded in a putative α-helix within the N terminus binds to mono-ubiquitinated histone H2AK119, probably mediating recruitment of DNMT3A1 to Polycomb-regulated regions. These data demonstrate an isoform-specific role for DNMT3A1 in mouse postnatal development and reveal the N terminus as a necessary regulatory domain for DNMT3A1 chromatin occupancy and functions in the nervous system.© 2022.

The interest in this topic, belonging to psycho-sexology and sexual medicine, has been due to its still unclear aetiology, nature, and its manifestation in relationship with several organic and psychopathological conditions. So, the specialist (the psychologist, psychiatrist, endocrinologist, neurologist) may encounter some difficulties in diagnosing and managing this symptom. The first main objective of this position statement, which has been developed in collaboration between the Italian Society of Andrology and Sexual Medicine (SIAMS) and the Italian Society of Psychopathology (SOPSI) is to give to the reader evidence about the necessity to consider hypersexuality as a symptom related to another underlying condition. Following this consideration, the second main objective is to give specific statements, for the biopsychosocial assessment and the diagnosis of hypersexual behavior, developed on the basis of the most recent literature evidence. To develop a psycho-pharmacological treatment tailored on patients' needs, our suggestion is to assess the presence of specific comorbid psychopathological and organic conditions, and the impact of pharmacological treatments on the presence of an excess of sexual behavior. Finally, a suggestion of a standardized psychometric evaluation of hypersexuality will be given.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE)."
"35585070","Extended intergenic DNA contributes to neuron-specific expression of neighboring genes in the mammalian nervous system.","Nat Commun","Mammalian genomes comprise largely intergenic noncoding DNA with numerous cis-regulatory elements. Whether and how the size of intergenic DNA affects gene expression in a tissue-specific manner remain unknown. Here we show that genes with extended intergenic regions are preferentially expressed in neural tissues but repressed in other tissues in mice and humans. Extended intergenic regions contain twice as many active enhancers in neural tissues compared to other tissues. Neural genes with extended intergenic regions are globally co-expressed with neighboring neural genes controlled by distinct enhancers in the shared intergenic regions. Moreover, generic neural genes expressed in multiple tissues have significantly longer intergenic regions than neural genes expressed in fewer tissues. The intergenic regions of the generic neural genes have many tissue-specific active enhancers containing distinct transcription factor binding sites specific to each neural tissue. We also show that genes with extended intergenic regions are enriched for neural genes only in vertebrates. The expansion of intergenic regions may reflect the regulatory complexity of tissue-type-specific gene expression in the nervous system.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35508662","Transcriptional coupling of distant regulatory genes in living embryos.","Nature","The prevailing view of metazoan gene regulation is that individual genes are independently regulated by their own dedicated sets of transcriptional enhancers. Past studies have reported long-range gene-gene associations1-3, but their functional importance in regulating transcription remains unclear. Here we used quantitative single-cell live imaging methods to provide a demonstration of co-dependent transcriptional dynamics of genes separated by large genomic distances in living Drosophila embryos. We find extensive physical and functional associations of distant paralogous genes, including co-regulation by shared enhancers and co-transcriptional initiation over distances of nearly 250 kilobases. Regulatory interconnectivity depends on promoter-proximal tethering elements, and perturbations in these elements uncouple transcription and alter the bursting dynamics of distant genes, suggesting a role of genome topology in the formation and stability of co-transcriptional hubs. Transcriptional coupling is detected throughout the fly genome and encompasses a broad spectrum of conserved developmental processes, suggesting a general strategy for long-range integration of gene activity.© 2022.

"35504952","Investigating how the accuracy of teacher expectations of pupil performance relate to socioeconomic and genetic factors.","Sci Rep","Teacher expectations of pupil ability can influence educational progression, impacting subsequent streaming and exam level. Systematic discrepancies between teacher expectations of pupil achievement may therefore have a detrimental effect on children's education. Associations between socioeconomic and demographic factors with teacher expectation accuracy have been demonstrated, but it is not known how teacher expectations of achievement may relate to genetic factors. We investigated these relationships using nationally standardized exam results at ages 11 and 14 from a UK longitudinal cohort study. We found that teacher expectation of achievement was strongly correlated with educational test scores. Furthermore, the accuracy of teacher expectation was patterned by pupil socioeconomic background but not teacher characteristics. The accuracy of teacher expectation related to pupil's genetic liability to education as captured by a polygenic score for educational attainment. Despite correlation with the polygenic score, we found no strong evidence for genomewide SNP heritability in teacher reporting accuracy.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Despite a variety of biological studies, lumbar DD is not yet fully understood, partially because there are only few studies that use systematic and integrative approaches. This urges the need for studies that integrate different omics (including genomics and transcriptomics) measured on samples within a single cohort. This protocol describes a disease-oriented Russian disc degeneration study (RuDDS) biobank recruitment and analyses aimed to facilitate further omics studies of lumbar DD integrating genomic, transcriptomic and glycomic data. A total of 1,100 participants aged over 18 with available lumbar MRI scans, medical histories and biological material (whole blood, plasma and intervertebral disc tissue samples from surgically treated patients) will be enrolled during the three-year period from two Russian clinical centers. Whole blood, plasma and disc tissue specimens will be used for genotyping with genome-wide SNP-arrays, glycome profiling and RNA sequencing, respectively. Omics data will be further used for a genome-wide association study of lumbar DD with in silico functional annotation, analysis of plasma glycome and lumbar DD disease interactions and transcriptomic data analysis including an investigation of differential expression patterns associated with lumbar DD disease. Statistical tests applied in each of the analyses will meet the standard criteria specific to the attributed study field. In a long term, the results of the study will expand fundamental knowledge about lumbar DD development and contribute to the elaboration of novel personalized approaches for disease prediction and therapy. Additionally to the lumbar disc degeneration study, a RuDDS cohort could be used for other genetic studies, as it will have unique omics data. Trial registration number NCT04600544."
"35484127","Kronos scRT: a uniform framework for single-cell replication timing analysis.","Nat Commun","Mammalian genomes are replicated in a cell type-specific order and in coordination with transcription and chromatin organization. Currently, single-cell replication studies require individual processing of sorted cells, yielding a limited number (<100) of cells. Here, we develop Kronos scRT, a software for single-cell Replication Timing (scRT) analysis. Kronos scRT does not require a specific platform or cell sorting, which allows investigating large datasets obtained from asynchronous cells. By applying our tool to published data as well as droplet-based single-cell whole-genome sequencing data generated in this study, we exploit scRT from thousands of cells for different mouse and human cell lines. Our results demonstrate that although genomic regions are frequently replicated around their population average RT, replication can occur stochastically throughout S phase. Altogether, Kronos scRT allows fast and comprehensive investigations of the RT programme at the single-cell resolution for both homogeneous and heterogeneous cell populations.© 2022. The Author(s)."

While numerous databases have collected a large amount of predicted circRNA candidates and provided the corresponding circRNA-regulated interactions, a stand-alone package for constructing circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions based on user-identified circRNAs across species is lacking.We present CircMiMi (circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions), a modular, Python-based software to identify circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions across 18 species (including 16 animals and 2 plants) with the given coordinates of circRNA junctions. The CircMiMi-constructed circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions are derived from circRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA axes with the support of computational predictions and/or experimental data. CircMiMi also allows users to examine alignment ambiguity of back-splice junctions for checking circRNA reliability and examine reverse complementary sequences residing in the sequences flanking the circularized exons for investigating circRNA formation. We further employ CircMiMi to identify circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions based on the circRNAs collected in NeuroCirc, a large-scale database of circRNAs in the human brain. We construct circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions comprising differentially expressed circRNAs, and miRNAs in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and cross-species analyze the relevance of the targets to ASD. We thus provide a rich set of ASD-associated circRNA-miRNA-mRNA axes and a useful starting point for investigation of regulatory mechanisms in ASD pathophysiology.CircMiMi allows users to identify circRNA-mediated interactions in multiple species, shedding light on regulatory roles of circRNAs.

"35440779","Genomics, convergent neuroscience and progress in understanding autism spectrum disorder.","Nat Rev Neurosci","More than a hundred genes have been identified that, when disrupted, impart large risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Current knowledge about the encoded proteins - although incomplete - points to a very wide range of developmentally dynamic and diverse biological processes. Moreover, the core symptoms of ASD involve distinctly human characteristics, presenting challenges to interpreting evolutionarily distant model systems. Indeed, despite a decade of striking progress in gene discovery, an actionable understanding of pathobiology remains elusive. Increasingly, convergent neuroscience approaches have been recognized as an important complement to traditional uses of genetics to illuminate the biology of human disorders. These methods seek to identify intersection among molecular-level, cellular-level and circuit-level functions across multiple risk genes and have highlighted developing excitatory neurons in the human mid-gestational prefrontal cortex as an important pathobiological nexus in ASD. In addition, neurogenesis, chromatin modification and synaptic function have emerged as key potential mediators of genetic vulnerability. The continued expansion of foundational 'omics' data sets, the application of higher-throughput model systems and incorporating developmental trajectories and sex differences into future analyses will refine and extend these results. Ultimately, a systems-level understanding of ASD genetic risk holds promise for clarifying pathobiology and advancing therapeutics.© 2022. Springer Nature Limited."

In affective disorders, recent precision nomothetic psychiatry studies disclosed new pathway phenotypes, including an ROI-reoccurrence of illness (ROI)-oxidative stress latent construct. The aim of the present study is to delineate a) whether ACEs sensitize the M1 macrophage, the T helper cells (Th)1, Th2, and Th17, the IRS (immune-inflammatory-responses system), the CIRS (compensatory immunoregulatory system), and the neuroimmunotoxic and growth factor (GF) profiles and whether they are associated with ROI and the phenome of affective disorders and b) the molecular pathways underpinning the effects of the ACEs. We collected supernatants of stimulated (5 μg/mL of PHA and 25 μg/mL of LPS) and unstimulated diluted whole blood in 20 healthy controls and 30 depressed patients and measured a panel of 27 cytokines/GF using a Luminex method. ACEs (comprising mental and physical trauma, mental neglect, domestic violence, family history of mental disease, and parent loss) are accompanied by the increased stimulated, but not unstimulated, production of M1, Th1, Th2, Th17, IRS, neuroimmunotoxic, and GF profiles and are strongly correlated with ROI and the phenome. A latent vector extracted from the ROI features (recurrent episodes and suicidal behaviors) and the IRS/neuroimmunotoxic/GF profiles explains 66.8% of the variance in the phenome and completely mediates the effects of ACEs on the phenome. Enrichment analysis showed that the ACE-associated sensitization of immune/GF profiles involves JAK-STAT, nuclear factor-κB, tumor necrosis factor-α, G-protein coupled receptor, PI3K/Akt/RAS/MAPK, and hypoxia signaling. In summary, the ACE-induced sensitization of immune pathways and secondary immune hits predicts the phenome of affective disorders."

Neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments are underreported comorbidities of reward dysregulation due to genetic antecedents and epigenetic insults. Recent genome-wide association studies involving millions of subjects revealed frequent comorbidity with substance use disorder (SUD) in a sizeable meta-analysis of depression. It found significant associations with the expression of NEGR1 in the hypothalamus and DRD2 in the nucleus accumbens, among others. However, despite the rise in SUD and neuropsychiatric illness, there are currently no standard objective brain assessments being performed on a routine basis. The rationale for encouraging a standard objective Brain Health Check (BHC) is to have extensive data available to treat clinical syndromes in psychiatric patients. The BHC would consist of a group of reliable, accurate, cost-effective, objective assessments involving the following domains: Memory, Attention, Neuropsychiatry, and Neurological Imaging. Utilizing primarily PUBMED, over 36 years of virtually all the computerized and written-based assessments of Memory, Attention, Psychiatric, and Neurological imaging were reviewed, and the following assessments are recommended for use in the BHC: Central Nervous System Vital Signs (Memory), Test of Variables of Attention (Attention), Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III (Neuropsychiatric), and Quantitative Electroencephalogram/P300/Evoked Potential (Neurological Imaging). Finally, we suggest continuing research into incorporating a new standard BHC coupled with qEEG/P300/Evoked Potentials and genetically guided precision induction of ""dopamine homeostasis"" to diagnose and treat reward dysregulation to prevent the consequences of dopamine dysregulation from being epigenetically passed on to generations of our children."
"35457203","The Relaxin-3 Receptor, RXFP3, Is a Modulator of Aging-Related Disease.","Int J Mol Sci","During the aging process our body becomes less well equipped to deal with cellular stress, resulting in an increase in unrepaired damage. This causes varying degrees of impaired functionality and an increased risk of mortality. One of the most effective anti-aging strategies involves interventions that combine simultaneous glucometabolic support with augmented DNA damage protection/repair. Thus, it seems prudent to develop therapeutic strategies that target this combinatorial approach. Studies have shown that the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPase activating protein GIT2 (GIT2) acts as a keystone protein in the aging process. GIT2 can control both DNA repair and glucose metabolism. Through in vivo co-regulation analyses it was found that GIT2 forms a close coexpression-based relationship with the relaxin-3 receptor (RXFP3). Cellular RXFP3 expression is directly affected by DNA damage and oxidative stress. Overexpression or stimulation of this receptor, by its endogenous ligand relaxin 3 (RLN3), can regulate the DNA damage response and repair processes. Interestingly, RLN3 is an insulin-like peptide and has been shown to control multiple disease processes linked to aging mechanisms, e.g., anxiety, depression, memory dysfunction, appetite, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Here we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the various roles of RXFP3/RLN3 signaling in aging and age-related disorders."

However, the molecular basis underlying the female-bias in pSS remains elusive. To address this knowledge gap, we performed genome-wide, allele-specific profiling of minor salivary gland-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from pSS patients and control subjects, and detected major differences in the regulation of X-linked genes. In control female MSCs, X-linked genes were expressed from both paternal and maternal X chromosomes with a median paternal ratio of ~ 0.5. However, in pSS female MSCs, X-linked genes exhibited preferential expression from one of the two X chromosomes. Concomitantly, pSS MSCs showed decrease in XIST levels and reorganization of H3K27me3+foci in the nucleus. Moreover, the HLA-locus-expressed miRNA miR6891-5p was decreased in pSS MSCs. miR6891-5p inhibition in control MSCs caused XIST dysregulation, ectopic silencing, and allelic skewing. Allelic skewing was accompanied by the mislocation of protein products encoded by the skewed genes, which was recapitulated by XIST and miR6891-5p disruption in control MSCs. Our data reveal X skewing as a molecular hallmark of pSS and highlight the importance of restoring X-chromosomal allelic balance for pSS treatment. KEY MESSAGES: X-linked genes exhibit skewing in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). X skewing in pSS associates with alterations in H3K27me3 deposition. pSS MSCs show decreased levels of miR6891-5p, a HLA-expressed miRNA. miR6891-5p inhibition causes H3K27me3 dysregulation and allelic skewing.© 2022.

Epidemiologic studies have highlighted smoking as an important driver of somatic mutations across multiple tissues. However, establishing the causal role of smoking in clonal hematopoiesis has been limited by observational study designs, which may suffer from confounding and reverse-causality. We performed two complementary analyses to investigate the role of smoking in mCAs and CHIP. First, using an observational study design among UK Biobank participants, we confirmed strong associations between smoking and mCAs. Second, using two-sample Mendelian randomization, smoking was strongly associated with mCA but not with CHIP. Overall, these results support a causal association between smoking and mCAs and suggest smoking may variably shape the fitness of clones bearing somatic mutations.© 2022. The Author(s)."

E-cigarettes typically contain nicotine and other relatively hydrophilic chemicals while vaping products typically contain cannabinoids and other hydrophobic chemicals. For example, vaping products can include hydrophobic terpenes such as squalane (SQA) and squalene (SQE). However, little is known about the SQA and SQE transmission from liquid to aerosol. SQA and SQE are used in commercial products that are applied dermally and ingested orally, but limited information is available on their inhalational exposure and toxicity. We developed and validated a quantitative method to measure SQE and SQA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid to assess if these chemicals accumulate in lung epithelial lining fluid after inhalation. Calibration curves spanned a range of 0.50-30.0 µg analyte per mL bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Recoveries were found to be 97-105% for SQE and 81-106% for SQA. Limits of detection were 0.50 μg/ml for both SQE and SQA. The method was applied to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples of patients from the 2019 outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) and a comparison group. Neither SQA nor SQE was detected above the method LOD for any samples analyzed; conversely, SQA or SQE were reproducibly measured in spiked quality control BAL fluids (relative standards deviations <15% for both analytes). Further applications of this method may help to evaluate the potential toxicity of SQA and SQE chronically inhaled from EVPs.Copyright © 2022 Cowan, Tran, Watson, Blount and Valentín-Blasini."

"35565206","Modeling Pancreatic Cancer with Patient-Derived Organoids Integrating Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts.","Cancers (Basel)","Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease and is highly resistant to anticancer drugs because of its complex microenvironment. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an important source of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, which alter the physical and chemical properties of pancreatic tissue, thus impairing effective intratumoral drug delivery and resulting in resistance to conventional chemotherapy. The objective of this study was to develop a new cancer organoid model, including a fibrous tumor microenvironment (TME) using CAFs. The CAF-integrated pancreatic cancer organoid (CIPCO) model developed in this study histologically mimicked human pancreatic cancer and included ECM production by CAFs. The cancer cell-CAF interaction in the CIPCO promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cancer cells, which was reversed by CAF inhibition using all-trans retinoic acid. Deposition of newly synthesized collagen I in the CIPCO disturbed the delivery of gemcitabine to cancer cells, and treatment with collagenase increased the cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine. This model may lead to the development of next-generation cancer organoid models recapitulating the fibrous TME."

Although many breast cancer studies conducted to date have investigated genetic variations and differential target gene expression, how 3D chromatin architectures are reorganized in TNBC has been poorly elucidated. Here, using in situ Hi-C technology, we characterized the 3D chromatin organization in cells representing five distinct subtypes of breast cancer (including TNBC) compared to that in normal cells. We found that the global and local 3D architectures were severely disrupted in breast cancer. TNBC cell lines (especially BT549 cells) showed the most dramatic changes relative to normal cells. Importantly, we detected CTCF-dependent TNBC-susceptible losses/gains of 3D chromatin organization and found that these changes were strongly associated with perturbed chromatin accessibility and transcriptional dysregulation. In TNBC tissue, 3D chromatin disorganization was also observed relative to the 3D chromatin organization in normal tissues. We observed that the perturbed local 3D architectures found in TNBC cells were partially conserved in TNBC tissues. Finally, we discovered distinct tissue-specific chromatin loops by comparing normal and TNBC tissues. In this study, we elucidated the characteristics of the 3D chromatin organization in breast cancer relative to normal cells/tissues at multiple scales and identified associations between disrupted structures and various epigenetic features and transcriptomes.

Endocrine therapy and chemotherapy are promising therapeutic approaches to mitigate breast cancer proliferation and recurrence. However, the treatment of therapy-resistant breast cancer is a major challenge. Recent studies on breast cancer etiology have revealed the critical roles of epigenetic factors in luminal breast cancer tumorigenesis and drug resistance. Tumorigenic epigenetic factor-induced aberrant chromatin dynamics dysregulate the onset of gene expression and consequently promote tumorigenesis and metastasis. Epigenetic dysregulation, a type of somatic mutation, is a high-risk factor for breast cancer progression and therapy resistance. Therefore, epigenetic modulators alone or in combination with other therapies are potential therapeutic agents for breast cancer. Several clinical trials have analyzed the therapeutic efficacy of potential epi-drugs for breast cancer and reported beneficial clinical outcomes, including inhibition of tumor cell adhesion and invasiveness and mitigation of endocrine therapy resistance. This review focuses on recent findings on the mechanisms of epigenetic factors in the progression of luminal breast cancer. Additionally, recent findings on the potential of epigenetic factors as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer are discussed."
"35456894","DnaJC7 in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.","Int J Mol Sci","Protein misfolding is a common basis of many neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Misfolded proteins, such as TDP-43, FUS, Matrin3, and SOD1, mislocalize and form the hallmark cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions in neurons of ALS patients. Cellular protein quality control prevents protein misfolding under normal conditions and, particularly, when cells experience protein folding stress due to the fact of increased levels of reactive oxygen species, genetic mutations, or aging. Molecular chaperones can prevent protein misfolding, refold misfolded proteins, or triage misfolded proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or autophagy. DnaJC7 is an evolutionarily conserved molecular chaperone that contains both a J-domain for the interaction with Hsp70s and tetratricopeptide domains for interaction with Hsp90, thus joining these two major chaperones' machines. Genetic analyses reveal that pathogenic variants in the gene encoding DnaJC7 cause familial and sporadic ALS. Yet, the underlying ALS-associated molecular pathophysiology and many basic features of DnaJC7 function remain largely unexplored. Here, we review aspects of DnaJC7 expression, interaction, and function to propose a loss-of-function mechanism by which pathogenic variants inDNAJC7contribute to defects in DnaJC7-mediated chaperoning that might ultimately contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS."

Since both clades evolutionarily diverged approximately 85 million years ago, it is critical to know to what extent the myelin protein composition has remained similar. Here, we use quantitative proteomics to analyze myelin purified from human white matter and find that the relative abundance of the structural myelin proteins PLP, MBP, CNP, and SEPTIN8 correlates well with that in C57Bl/6N mice. Conversely, multiple other proteins were identified exclusively or predominantly in human or mouse myelin. This is exemplified by peripheral myelin protein 2 (PMP2), which was specific to human central nervous system myelin, while tetraspanin-2 (TSPAN2) and connexin-29 (CX29/GJC3) were confined to mouse myelin.

Innovative techniques further expose new disease-associated immune cell populations and reinforce how environmental context is critical to their phenotype and subsequent role in disease. Importantly, the differentiation of immune cells into a pathogenic state is potentially reversible through therapeutic manipulation.

FI-Self Report and FI-Blood scores were higher in females, whereas FI-Examination scores were higher in males. All FI scores increased nonlinearly with age and were highest at lower education levels. In sex and age-adjusted models, a 0.01 increase in FI score was associated with a 1.08 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07,1.10], 1.05 (1.04,1.06), 1.07 (1.05,1.08) and a 1.13 (1.11,1.16) increased odds of mortality for FI-Self Report, FI-Blood, FI-Examination and FI-Combined, respectively. Inclusion of the three distinct FI types in a single model yielded the best prognostic accuracy and model fit, even compared to the FI-Combined, with all FIs remaining independently associated with mortality.Characteristics of all FIs were largely consistent with previously established FIs. To adequately capture frailty levels and to improve our understanding of the heterogeneity of ageing, FIs should consider multiple types of deficits including self-reported, blood and examination-based measures.© The Author(s) 2022.

"35505436","Sex differences in the aging murine urinary bladder and influence on the tumor immune microenvironment of a carcinogen-induced model of bladder cancer.","Biol Sex Differ","Sex and age associated differences in the tumor immune microenvironment of non-muscle invasive bladder (NMIBC) cancer and associated clinical outcomes are emerging indicators of treatment outcomes. The incidence of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is four times higher in males than females; however, females tend to present with a more aggressive disease, a poorer response to immunotherapy and suffer worse clinical outcomes. Recent findings have demonstrated sex differences in the tumor immune microenvironment of non-muscle invasive and muscle invasive bladder cancer and associated clinical outcomes. However, a significant gap in knowledge remains with respect to the current pre-clinical modeling approaches to more precisely recapitulate these differences towards improved therapeutic design. Given the similarities in mucosal immune physiology between humans and mice, we evaluated the sex and age-related immune alterations in healthy murine bladders. Bulk-RNA sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence-based spatial immune profiling of healthy murine bladders from male and female mice of age groups spanning young to old showed a highly altered immune landscape that exhibited sex and age associated differences, particularly in the context of B cell mediated responses. Spatial profiling of healthy bladders, using markers specific to macrophages, T cells, B cells, activated dendritic cells, high endothelial venules, myeloid cells and the PD-L1 immune checkpoint showed sex and age associated differences. Bladders from healthy older female mice also showed a higher presence of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) compared to both young female and male equivalents. Spatial immune profiling of N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN) carcinogen exposed male and female bladders from young and old mice revealed a similar frequency of TLS formation, sex differences in the bladder immune microenvironment and, age associated differences in latency of tumor induction. These findings support the incorporation of sex and age as factors in pre-clinical modeling of bladder cancer and will potentially advance the field of immunotherapeutic drug development to improve clinical outcomes.© 2022.

"35493954","Estrogen, the Peripheral Immune System and Major Depression - A Reproductive Lifespan Perspective.","Front Behav Neurosci","Major depression is a significant medical issue impacting millions of individuals worldwide. Identifying factors contributing to its manifestation has been a subject of intense investigation for decades and several targets have emerged including sex hormones and the immune system. Indeed, an extensive body of literature has demonstrated that sex hormones play a critical role in modulating brain function and impacting mental health, especially among female organisms. Emerging findings also indicate an inflammatory etiology of major depression, revealing new opportunities to supplement, or even supersede, currently available pharmacological interventions in some patient populations. Given the established sex differences in immunity and the profound impact of fluctuations of sex hormone levels on the immune system within the female, interrogating how the endocrine, nervous, and immune systems converge to impact women's mental health is warranted. Here, we review the impacts of endogenous estrogens as well as exogenously administered estrogen-containing therapies on affect and immunity and discuss these observations in the context of distinct reproductive milestones across the female lifespan. A theoretical framework and important considerations for additional study in regards to mental health and major depression are provided.Copyright © 2022 Engler-Chiurazzi, Chastain, Citron, Lambert, Kikkeri and Shrestha."
"35484164","Glycaemic control is associated with SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in vaccinated patients with type 2 diabetes.","Nat Commun","Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are characterized by blunted immune responses, which are affected by glycaemic control. Whether glycaemic control influences the response to COVID-19 vaccines and the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections is unknown. Here we show that poor glycaemic control, assessed as mean HbA1c in the post-vaccination period, is associated with lower immune responses and an increased incidence of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in T2D patients vaccinated with mRNA-BNT162b2. We report data from a prospective observational study enroling healthcare and educator workers with T2D receiving the mRNA-BNT162b2 vaccine in Campania (Italy) and followed for one year (5 visits, follow-up 346 ± 49 days) after one full vaccination cycle. Considering the 494 subjects completing the study, patients with good glycaemic control (HbA1c one-year mean < 7%) show a higher virus-neutralizing antibody capacity and a better CD4 + T/cytokine response, compared with those with poor control (HbA1c one-year mean ≥ 7%). The one-year mean of HbA1c is linearly associated with the incidence of breakthrough infections (Beta = 0.068; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.032-0.103; p < 0.001). The comparison of patients with poor and good glycaemic control through Cox regression also show an increased risk for patients with poor control (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.261; 95% CI, 0.097-0.700; p = 0.008). Among other factors, only smoking (HR = 0.290, CI 0.146-0.576 for non-smokers; p < 0.001) and sex (HR = 0.105, CI 0.035-0.317 for females; p < 0.001) are significantly associated with the incidence of breakthrough infections.© 2022.

"35476843","Differential immune landscapes in appendicular versus axial skeleton.","PLoS One","Roughly 400,000 people in the U.S. are living with bone metastases, the vast majority occurring in the spine. Metastases to the spine result in fractures, pain, paralysis, and significant health care costs. This predilection for cancer to metastasize to the bone is seen across most cancer histologies, with the greatest incidence seen in prostate, breast, and lung cancer. The molecular process involved in this predilection for axial versus appendicular skeleton is not fully understood, although it is likely that a combination of tumor and local micro-environmental factors plays a role. Immune cells are an important constituent of the bone marrow microenvironment and many of these cells have been shown to play a significant role in tumor growth and progression in soft tissue and bone disease. With this in mind, we sought to examine the differences in immune landscape between axial and appendicular bones in the normal noncancerous setting in order to obtain an understanding of these landscapes. To accomplish this, we utilized mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to examine differences in the immune cell landscapes between the long bone and vertebral body bone marrow from patient clinical samples and C57BL/6J mice. We demonstrate significant differences between immune populations in both murine and human marrow with a predominance of myeloid progenitor cells in the spine. Additionally, cytokine analysis revealed differences in concentrations favoring a more myeloid enriched population of cells in the vertebral body bone marrow. These differences could have clinical implications with respect to the distribution and permissive growth of bone metastases."
"35476452","ETS1 acts as a regulator of human healthy aging via decreasing ribosomal activity.","Sci Adv","Adaptation to reduced energy production during aging is a fundamental issue for maintaining healthspan or prolonging life span. Currently, however, the underlying mechanism in long-lived people remains poorly understood. Here, we analyzed transcriptomes of 193 long-lived individuals (LLIs) and 86 spouses of their children from two independent Chinese longevity cohorts and found that the ribosome pathway was significantly down-regulated in LLIs. We found that the down-regulation is likely controlled byETS1(ETS proto-oncogene 1), a transcription factor down-regulated in LLIs and positively coexpressed with most ribosomal protein genes (RPGs). Functional assays showed that ETS1 can bind to RPG promoters, whileETS1knockdown reduces RPG expression and alleviates cellular senescence in human dermal fibroblast (HDF) and embryonic lung fibroblast (IMR-90) cells. As protein synthesis/turnover in ribosomes is an energy-intensive cellular process, the decline in ribosomal biogenesis governed byETS1in certain female LLIs may serve as an alternative mechanism to achieve energy-saving and healthy aging."

In human serum, there are two subclasses of IgA, IgA1 (≅ 90%) and IgA2 (≅ 10%), transcribed from two distinct heavy chain constant regions. This study evaluated the serum concentrations of total IgA, IgA1, and IgA2, and total IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 in T2-high asthmatics compared to healthy controls and the presence of gender-related variations of immunoglobulins. Total IgA levels were increased in asthmatics compared to controls. Even more marked was the increase in total IgA in male asthmatics compared to healthy male donors. IgA1 were increased only in male, but not in female asthmatics, compared to controls. Concentrations of IgG2, but not IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4, were reduced in asthmatics compared to controls. IgG4 levels were reduced in female compared to male asthmatics. In female asthmatics, IgA and IgA1 levels were increased in postmenopause compared to premenopause. IgA concentrations were augmented in mild, but not severe asthmatics. A positive correlation was found between IgA levels and the age of patients and an inverse correlation between serum concentrations of IgA2 and IgE in asthmatics. A positive correlation between total IgA or IgA2 and IgG2 was found in asthmatics. These results highlight a gender dimorphism in IgA subclasses in male and female T2-high asthmatics. More adequate consideration of immunological gender disparity in asthma may open new opportunities in personalized medicine by optimizing diagnosis and targeted therapy.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35563306","A Single-Cell Raman Spectroscopy Analysis of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells to Identify Inter-Individual Diversity.","Int J Mol Sci","The heterogeneity of stem cells represents the main challenge in regenerative medicine development. This issue is particularly pronounced when it comes to the use of primary mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) due to a lack of identification markers. Considering the need for additional approaches in MSCs characterization, we applied Raman spectroscopy to investigate inter-individual differences between bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs). Based on standard biological tests, BM-MSCs of analyzed donors fulfill all conditions for their characterization, while no donor-related specifics were observed in terms of BM-MSCs morphology, phenotype, multilineage differentiation potential, colony-forming capacity, expression of pluripotency-associated markers or proliferative capacity. However, examination of BM-MSCs at a single-cell level by Raman spectroscopy revealed that despite similar biochemical background, fine differences in the Raman spectra of BM-MSCs of each donor can be detected. After extensive principal component analysis (PCA) of Raman spectra, our study revealed the possibility of this method to diversify BM-MSCs populations, whereby the grouping of cell populations was most prominent when cell populations were analyzed in pairs. These results indicate that Raman spectroscopy, as a label-free assay, could have a huge potential in understanding stem cell heterogeneity and sorting cell populations with a similar biochemical background that can be significant for the development of personalized therapy approaches."

"35565787","PN Administration in Critically Ill Children in Different Phases of the Stress Response.","Nutrients","Nutritional support is an important part of the treatment of critical ill children and the phase of disease has to be taken into account. The metabolic stress response during acute critical illness is characterized by severe catabolism. So far, there is no evidence that the acute catabolic state can be prevented with nutritional support. The Pediatric 'Early versus Late Parenteral Nutrition' (PEPaNIC) trial showed that withholding supplemental parenteral nutrition (PN) during the first week in critically ill children, when enteral nutrition was not sufficient, prevented infections and shortened the stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and the hospital. A follow-up performed 2 and 4 years later showed that withholding parenteral nutrition (PN) also improved several domains of the neurocognitive outcome of the children. Current international guidelines recommend considering withholding parenteral macronutrients during the first week of pediatric critical illness, while providing micronutrients. These guidelines also recommend upper and lower levels of intake of macronutrients and micronutrients if PN is administered."
"35549984","Impact of critical illness and withholding of early parenteral nutrition in the pediatric intensive care unit on long-term physical performance of children: a 4-year follow-up of the PEPaNIC randomized controlled trial.","Crit Care","Many critically ill children face long-term developmental impairments. The PEPaNIC trial attributed part of the problems at the level of neurocognitive and emotional/behavioral development to early use of parenteral nutrition (early-PN) in the PICU, as compared with withholding it for 1 week (late-PN). Insight in long-term daily life physical functional capacity after critical illness is limited. Also, whether timing of initiating PN affects long-term physical function of these children remained unknown.This preplanned follow-up study of the multicenter PEPaNIC randomized controlled trial subjected 521 former critically ill children (253 early-PN, 268 late-PN) to quantitative physical function tests 4 years after PICU admission in Leuven or Rotterdam, in comparison with 346 age- and sex-matched healthy children. Tests included handgrip strength measurement, timed up-and-go test, 6-min walk test, and evaluation of everyday overall physical activity with an accelerometer. We compared these functional measures for the former critically ill and healthy children and for former critically ill children randomized to late-PN versus early-PN, with multivariable linear or logistic regression analyses adjusting for risk factors.As compared with healthy children, former critically ill children showed less handgrip strength (p < 0.0001), completed the timed up-and-go test more slowly (p < 0.0001), walked a shorter distance in 6 min (p < 0.0001) during which they experienced a larger drop in peripheral oxygen saturation (p ≤ 0.026), showed a lower energy expenditure (p ≤ 0.024), performed more light and less moderate physical activity (p ≤ 0.047), and walked fewer steps per day (p = 0.0074). Late-PN as compared with early-PN did not significantly affect these outcomes.Four years after PICU admission, former critically ill children showed worse physical performance as compared with healthy children, without impact of timing of supplemental PN in the PICU.

We aim to examine the association between gestational hypertension and childhood anemia at different ages in two large Chinese birth cohorts. Cohort 1 was conducted in 5 counties in northern China and was comprised of 17,264 mother-children pairs (97.3%) during 2006-2009, whereas cohort 2 was conducted in 21 counties in southern China and was comprised of 185,093 mother-children pairs (93.8%) during 1993-1996. All pregnant women were registered in a monitoring system and followed up until the termination of pregnancies. The childhood anemia was diagnosed at 6 month and 12 month in cohort 1 and at 55 month in cohort 2. The overall incidence of childhood anemia was 6.78% and 5.28% at 6 month and 12 month, respectively, in cohort 1 and 13.18% at 55 month in cohort 2. Gestational hypertension was associated with increased risk of anemia at 6 month (adjusted Odds Ratio (OR): 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05, 1.63) and at 12 month (adjusted OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.18, 1.90) in cohort 1 and at 55 month (adjusted OR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.12) in cohort 2. The hemoglobin values of children at different ages were lower among gestational hypertension group in the linear models, which was consistent with the results of binary regression analysis. Our study found gestational hypertension may associate with an increased risk of childhood anemia. It suggests a possible need for exploring changes in prenatal care that might prevent childhood anemia."

ITP demonstrated age and sex biases in both occurrences and prognosis, and adult ITP was mainly induced by the living environments. The current diagnosis guideline lacks the integration of molecular heterogenicity. This study recruited the largest cohort of platelet transcriptome samples. A comprehensive procedure of feature selection, feature engineering, and stacking classification was carried out to detect the ITP biomarkers using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) transcriptomes. The 40 detected biomarkers were loaded to train the final ITP detection model, with an overall accuracy 0.974. The biomarkers suggested that ITP onset may be associated with various transcribed components, including protein-coding genes, long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) genes, and pseudogenes with apparent transcriptions.

Most of the systematic studies currently focuses on individual omics aspect and provide insightful yet limited knowledge about the comprehensive and complex crosstalk between various omics levels.Therefore, we performed a most comprehensive trans-omics study with various omics data from 104 subjects, to identify interactions/networks and particularly causal regulatory relationships within and especially those between omic molecules with the purpose to discover molecular genetic mechanisms underlying obesity etiology in vivo in humans.By applying differentially analysis, we identified 8 differentially expressed hub genes (DEHGs), 14 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 12 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) for obesity individually. By integrating those multi-omics biomarkers using Mendelian Randomization (MR) and network MR analyses, we identified 18 causal pathways with mediation effect. For the 20 biomarkers involved in those 18 pairs, 17 biomarkers were implicated in the pathophysiology of obesity or related diseases.The integration of trans-omics and MR analyses may provide us a holistic understanding of the underlying functional mechanisms, molecular regulatory information flow and the interactive molecular systems among different omic molecules for obesity risk and other complex diseases/traits.© 2022.

Understanding the genetic basis underlying MS could help decipher the pathogenesis and shed light on MS treatment. We refined a recently developed Bayesian framework, Integrative Risk Gene Selector (iRIGS), to prioritize risk genes associated with MS by integrating the summary statistics from the largest GWAS to date (n = 115,803), various genomic features, and gene-gene closeness.We identified 163 MS-associated prioritized risk genes (MS-PRGenes) through the Bayesian framework. We replicated 35 MS-PRGenes through two-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR) approach by integrating data from GWAS and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) of 19 tissues. We demonstrated that MS-PRGenes had more substantial deleterious effects and disease risk. Moreover, single-cell enrichment analysis indicated MS-PRGenes were more enriched in activated macrophages and microglia macrophages than non-activated ones in control samples. Biological and drug enrichment analyses highlighted inflammatory signaling pathways.In summary, we predicted and validated a high-confidence MS risk gene set from diverse genomic, epigenomic, eQTL, single-cell, and drug data. The MS-PRGenes could further serve as a benchmark of MS GWAS risk genes for future validation or genetic studies.© 2022. The Author(s)."

Its surgical resection is technically very challenging and has a high risk of complications even after discharge. This study analyzed the risk factors associated with unplanned readmission after pancreatic cancer surgery.Pancreatic cancer patients who were readmitted within 30 days after surgery were classified as the observation group, while those not readmitted within 30 days postsurgery were classified as the control group. The serum levels of gastrointestinal hormones, stress hormones, and peripheral immune cells of the two groups were compared at different intervals.No significant differences in gender and age were observed between the two groups. At 7, 14, and 21 days postsurgery, the levels of gastrointestinal hormones motilin, gastrin, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and growth hormone-releasing peptide of the observation group were lower than the control group, while the levels of adrenocorticotropin, renin, angiotensin, and plasma aldosterone of the observation group were significantly higher than the control group. In addition, compared to the control group, lower levels of CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, and NKT cells and higher levels of Treg, Breg, and MDSC cells were observed in the peripheral blood of the observation group.The serum levels of gastrointestinal hormones, stress hormones, and peripheral immune cells could be associated with the risk of unplanned readmission within 30 days after pancreatic cancer surgery.Copyright © 2022 Xiaojing Gu et al."

Here we report that cfRNA sequencing enables the discovery of messenger RNA (mRNA) biomarkers in plasma with the tissue of origin-specific to cancer types and precancerous conditions in both solid and hematologic malignancies. To explore the diagnostic potential of total cfRNA from blood, we sequenced plasma samples of eight hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and ten multiple myeloma (MM) patients, 12 patients of their respective precancerous conditions, and 20 non-cancer (NC) donors. We identified distinct gene sets and built classification models using Random Forest and linear discriminant analysis algorithms that could distinguish cancer patients from premalignant conditions and NC individuals with high accuracy. Plasma cfRNA biomarkers of HCC are liver-specific genes and biomarkers of MM are highly expressed in the bone marrow compared to other tissues and are related to cell cycle processes. The cfRNA level of these biomarkers displayed a gradual transition from noncancerous states through precancerous conditions and cancer. Sequencing data were cross-validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and cfRNA biomarkers were validated in an independent sample set (20 HCC, 9 MM, and 10 NC) with AUC greater than 0.86. cfRNA results observed in precancerous conditions require further validation. This work demonstrates a proof of principle for using mRNA transcripts in plasma with a small panel of genes to distinguish between cancers, noncancerous states, and precancerous conditions.© 2022.

However, chromatin conformation profiling assays are usually expensive, time-consuming, and may report fuzzy insulator annotations with low resolution. Therefore, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning method, InsuLock, to address these challenges. Specifically, InsuLock first utilizes a Siamese neural network to predict the existence of insulators within a given region (up to 2000 bp). Then, it uses an object detection module for precise insulator boundary localization via gradient-weighted class activation mapping (~40 bp resolution). Finally, it quantifies variant impacts by comparing the insulator score differences between the wild-type and mutant alleles. We applied InsuLock on various bulk and single-cell datasets for performance testing and benchmarking. We showed that it outperformed existing methods with an AUROC of ~0.96 and condensed insulator annotations to ~2.5% of their original size while still demonstrating higher conservation scores and better motif enrichments. Finally, we utilized InsuLock to make cell-type-specific variant impacts from brain scATAC-seq data and identified a schizophrenia GWAS variant disrupting an insulator loop proximal to a known risk gene, indicating a possible new mechanism of action for the disease."
"35469332","Nucleic acid liquid biopsies in Alzheimer's disease: current state, challenges, and opportunities.","Heliyon","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and affects persons of all races, ethnic groups, and sexes. The disease is characterized by neuronal loss leading to cognitive decline and memory loss. There is no cure and the effectiveness of existing treatments is limited and depends on the time of diagnosis. The long prodromal period, during which patients' ability to live a normal life is not affected despite neuronal loss, often leads to a delayed diagnosis because it can be mistaken for normal aging of the brain. In order to make a substantial impact on AD patient survival, early diagnosis may provide a greater therapeutic window for future therapies to slow AD-associated neurodegeneration. Current gold standards for disease detection include magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography scans, which visualize amyloid β and phosphorylated tau depositions and aggregates. Liquid biopsies, already an active field of research in precision oncology, are hypothesized to provide early disease detection through minimally or non-invasive sample collection techniques. Liquid biopsies in AD have been studied in cerebrospinal fluid, blood, ocular, oral, and olfactory fluids. However, most of the focus has been on blood and cerebrospinal fluid due to biomarker specificity and sensitivity attributed to the effects of the blood-brain barrier and inter-laboratory variation during sample collection. Many studies have identified amyloid β and phosphorylated tau levels as putative biomarkers, however, advances in next-generation sequencing-based liquid biopsy methods have led to significant interest in identifying nucleic acid species associated with AD from liquid tissues. Differences in cell-free RNAs and DNAs have been described as potential biomarkers for AD and hold the potential to affect disease diagnosis, treatment, and future research avenues.© 2022 The Authors."

Unhealthy environments are often clustered in deprived areas, thus interventions to improve the built environments may improve health and reduce inequalities. The aim of this review was to identify whether street-level built environment interventions can improve children's health in high income countries. A secondary aim was to describe key built environment elements targeted in interventions and research gaps. A systematic review of published literature was conducted by a multi-disciplinary team. Ten intervention papers were included. Physical activity or play was the only health outcome assessed. Most interventions described temporary changes including closure of streets to traffic (N = 6), which were mainly located in deprived neighbourhoods, or the addition of technology to 'gamify' active travel to school (N = 2). Two studies reported permanent changes to street design. There was limited evidence that closing streets to traffic was associated with increases in activity or play and inconclusive evidence with changes to street design and using technology to gamify active travel. Our ability to draw conclusions was hampered by inadequate study designs. Description of interventions was poor. Rigorous evaluation of built environment interventions remains challenging. We recommend a multi-disciplinary approach to evaluation, explicit reporting of built environment indicators targeted in interventions and offer solutions to others working in this area."

The Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort is a unique resource with quantitative pathology from multiple brain regions, RNA sequencing, and longitudinal cognitive data. Our previous work applying machine learning to the RNA sequencing data identified lactoferrin (LTF) as the gene most predictive of amyloid accumulation with a potential amyloidogenic mechanism identifiedin vitroand with cell-culture models. In the present study, we examined which pathologies and genes were related to cognitive status (dementia, mild impairment, and no cognitive impairment) and rate of cognitive decline. Tau load in the anterior cingulate andADAMTS2, encoding a metallopeptidase, were the respective regional pathology and gene most associated with cognitive decline, whilePRTN3, encoding a serine protease, was the key protective feature.ADAMTS2, but notPRTN3, was related to amyloid and tau load in the previous study whileLTFwas not related to cognitive decline here. These findings confirm a general relationship between tau pathology and dementia, show the specific importance of tau pathology in the anterior cingulate cortex and identify ADAMTS2 as a potential target for slowing cognitive decline.Copyright © 2022 McCorkindale, Patrick, Duce, Guennewig and Sutherland."
"35530274","Pyroptosis impacts the prognosis and treatment response in gastric cancer via immune system modulation.","Am J Cancer Res","Pyroptosis plays a vital role in the development of cancers; however, its role in regulating immune cell infiltration in tumor microenvironment (TME) and pyroptosis-related molecular subtypes remain unclear. Herein, we comprehensively analyzed the molecular subtypes mediated by the pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) in gastric cancer (GC). Three pyroptosis patterns were determined with distinct TME cell-infiltrating characteristics and prognosis. Principal component analysis was performed to establish the pyroptosis score. The high pyroptosis score group was featured by increased activated CD4+ T cell infiltration, better prognosis, elevated tumor mutation burden, higher immune and stromal scores, and enhanced response to immunotherapy. However, the low pyroptosis score group was characterized by poorer survival, decreased immune infiltration, and glycerolipid and histidine metabolism pathways. Additionally, high pyroptosis score was confirmed as an independent favorable prognostic factor for overall survival. Three cohorts designed to analyze the response to immunotherapy verified that patients with higher pyroptosis score showed treatment benefit. In summary, our study demonstrated that pyroptosis regulates the complex TME. Assessing the pyroptosis patterns will advance our understanding on TME features and tumor immunology and provide the rationale for designing personalized immunotherapy strategies.AJCR Copyright © 2022."
"35551305","DeepSTARR predicts enhancer activity from DNA sequence and enables the de novo design of synthetic enhancers.","Nat Genet","Enhancer sequences control gene expression and comprise binding sites (motifs) for different transcription factors (TFs). Despite extensive genetic and computational studies, the relationship between DNA sequence and regulatory activity is poorly understood, and de novo enhancer design has been challenging. Here, we built a deep-learning model, DeepSTARR, to quantitatively predict the activities of thousands of developmental and housekeeping enhancers directly from DNA sequence in Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. The model learned relevant TF motifs and higher-order syntax rules, including functionally nonequivalent instances of the same TF motif that are determined by motif-flanking sequence and intermotif distances. We validated these rules experimentally and demonstrated that they can be generalized to humans by testing more than 40,000 wildtype and mutant Drosophila and human enhancers. Finally, we designed and functionally validated synthetic enhancers with desired activities de novo.© 2022. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc."

Previous studies indicate that rare orde novogenetic variants significantly contribute to EA/TEF risk, and most individuals with EA/TEF do not have pathogenic genetic variants in established risk genes. To identify the genetic contributions to EA/TEF, we performed whole genome sequencing of 185 trios (probands and parents) with EA/TEF, including 59 isolated and 126 complex cases with additional congenital anomalies and/or neurodevelopmental disorders. There was a significant burden of protein-alteringde novocoding variants in complex cases (p = 3.3 × 10-4), especially in genes that are intolerant of loss-of-function variants in the population. We performed simulation analysis of pathway enrichment based on background mutation rate and identified a number of pathways related to endocytosis and intracellular trafficking that as a group have a significant burden of protein-alteringde novovariants. We assessed 18 variants for disease causality using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis inXenopusand confirmed 13 with tracheoesophageal phenotypes. Our results implicate disruption of endosome-mediated epithelial remodeling as a potential mechanism of foregut developmental defects. Our results suggest significant genetic heterogeneity of EA/TEF and may have implications for the mechanisms of other rare congenital anomalies.© 2022 The Author(s)."
"35562986","Inflammation: A New Look at an Old Problem.","Int J Mol Sci","Pro-inflammatory stress is inherent in any cells that are subject to damage or threat of damage. It is defined by a number of universal components, including oxidative stress, cellular response to DNA damage, unfolded protein response to mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress, changes in autophagy, inflammasome formation, non-coding RNA response, formation of an inducible network of signaling pathways, and epigenetic changes. The presence of an inducible receptor and secretory phenotype in many cells is the cause of tissue pro-inflammatory stress. The key phenomenon determining the occurrence of a classical inflammatory focus is the microvascular inflammatory response (exudation, leukocyte migration to the alteration zone). This same reaction at the systemic level leads to the development of life-critical systemic inflammation. From this standpoint, we can characterize the common mechanisms of pathologies that differ in their clinical appearance. The division of inflammation into alternative variants has deep evolutionary roots. Evolutionary aspects of inflammation are also described in the review. The aim of the review is to provide theoretical arguments for the need for an up-to-date theory of the relationship between key human pathological processes based on the integrative role of the molecular mechanisms of cellular and tissue pro-inflammatory stress."

Epigenetic modification refers to heritable changes in the genetic material without any changes in the nucleic acid sequence and results in heritable phenotypic changes. Epigenetic modifications regulate many biological processes, such as growth, aging, and various diseases, including cancer. With the advancement of next-generation sequencing technology, the role of RNA modifications in cancer progression has become increasingly prominent and is a hot spot in scientific research. This review studied several common RNA modifications, such as N6-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine, and pseudouridine. The deposition and roles of these modifications in coding and noncoding RNAs are summarized in detail. Based on the RNA modification background, this review summarized the expression, function, and underlying molecular mechanism of these modifications and their regulators in cancer and further discussed the role of some existing small-molecule inhibitors. More in-depth studies on RNA modification and cancer are needed to broaden the understanding of epigenetics and cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.© 2022. The Author(s)."

It has been shown that both active enhancers and intranuclear eRNAs are preferentially expressed over inflammation-related genes in response to inflammatory stimuli, suggesting that enhancer transcription events and their products influence the expression and function of inflammatory genes.

Yet, the mechanisms controlling postmitotic neuronal chromatin accessibility are poorly understood. Here, we show that unique distal enhancers define thePet1neuron lineage that generates serotonin (5-HT) neurons in mice. Heterogeneous single-cell chromatin landscapes are established early in postmitoticPet1neurons and reveal the putative regulatory programs drivingPet1neuron subtype identities. Distal enhancer accessibility is highly dynamic asPet1neurons mature, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors that reorganize postmitotic neuronal chromatin. We find that Pet1 and Lmx1b control chromatin accessibility to selectPet1-lineage-specific enhancers for 5-HT neurotransmission. Additionally, these factors are required to maintain chromatin accessibility during early maturation suggesting that postmitotic neuronal open chromatin is unstable and requires continuous regulatory input. Together, our findings reveal postmitotic transcription factors that reorganize accessible chromatin for neuron specialization.© 2022, Zhang et al."

Our method produces high-quality data and is a cost-effective alternative to single-cell techniques.

The differentiation and characterization of iECs are well established; however, the mechanisms governing their angiogenic phenotype remain unknown. Here, we aimed to determine the angiogenic phenotype of iECs and the regulatory mechanism controlling their regenerative capacity. In a comparative study with HUVECs, we show that iECs increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) mediates their highly angiogenic phenotype via regulation of glycolysis enzymes, filopodia formation, VEGF mediated migration, and robust sprouting. We find that the elevated expression of VEGFR2 is epigenetically regulated via intrinsic acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 by histone acetyltransferase P300. Utilizing a zebrafish xenograft model, we demonstrate that the ability of iECs to promote the regeneration of the amputated fin can be modulated by P300 activity. These findings demonstrate how the innate epigenetic status of iECs regulates their phenotype with implications for their therapeutic potential.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The XIST locus (in cis) on each additional X chromosome initiates the transcriptional silence of that chromosome, making it an inactive X. How the active X in both males and females is protected from inactivation by its own XIST locus is not well understood in any mammal. Previous studies of autosomal duplications suggest that gene(s) on the short arm of human chromosome 19 repress XIST on the active X. Here, we examine the time of transcription of some candidate genes in preimplantation embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing data from human embryos and qRT-PCR from bovine embryos. The candidate genes assayed are those transcribed from 19p13.3-13.2, which are widely expressed and can remodel chromatin. Our results confirm that XIST is expressed at low levels from the future active X in embryos of both sexes; they also show that the XIST locus is repressed in both sexes when pluripotency factors are being upregulated, during the 4-8 cell and morula stages in human and bovine embryos - well before the early blastocyst (E5) when XIST on the inactive X in females starts to be upregulated. Our data suggest a role for DNMT1, UHRF1, SAFB and SAFB2 in XIST repression; they also exclude XACT and other 19p candidate genes and provide the transcriptional timing for some genes not previously assayed in human or bovine preimplantation embryos.© 2022.

In animals, one of the key enzymes for the DNA demethylation of 5-methylcytosine is TET2. Although TET2 is essential for muscle development, the mechanisms by which TET2 regulates myogenesis, particularly the implication for muscle stem cells, remains unclear. In the present study, we employed the TET2 knockout mouse model to investigate the function of TET2 in muscle development and regeneration. We observed that TET2 deficiency caused impaired muscle stem cell proliferation and differentiation, resulting in the reduction in both myofiber number and muscle tissue size. Specifically, TET2 maintains calcium homeostasis in muscle stem cells by controlling the DNA methylation levels of the calcium pathway genes. Forced expression of the sodium/calcium exchanger protein SLC8A3 could rescue the myogenic defects in TET2 knockout cells. Our data not only illustrated the vital function of TET2 during myogenesis but also identified novel targets that contribute to calcium homeostasis for enhancing muscle function.© 2022.

To identify a new disease-associated gene of HLD, trio-based whole exome sequencing was performed for unexplained patients with HLD. Functional studies were performed to confirm the phenotypic effect of candidate protein variants. Two de novo heterozygous variants, c.227T&gt;G p.(L76R) or c.227T&gt;C p.(L76P) inTMEM163were identified in two unrelated HLD patients. TMEM163 protein is a zinc efflux transporter localized within the plasma membrane, lysosomes, early endosomes, and other vesicular compartments. It has not been associated with hypomyelination. Functional zinc flux assays in HeLa cells stably-expressing TMEM163 protein variants, L76R and L76P, revealed distinct attenuation or enhancement of zinc efflux, respectively. Experiments using a zebrafish model with knockdown oftmem163aandtmem163b(morphants) showed that loss oftmem163causes dysplasia of the larvae, locomotor disability and myelin deficit. Expression of human wild typeTMEM163mRNAs in morphants rescues the phenotype, while theTMEM163L76P and L76R mutants aggravated the condition.

The immune analysis revealed significant CD8 T cells, monocytes, and NK cells in CAD and found that EMT-related lncRNAs were correlated with these immune cell subsets. Moreover, SNAI2, an EMT-TF gene, was found in the trans-regulatory network of EMT-related lncRNAs.

Oxidation is often a by-product of processes involved in the acute phase response, which may result in antimicrobial or self-damaging effects. We measured the immunological and oxidative status responses of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) to a simulated bacterial infection using lipopolysaccharide injection. As expected, experimental bats exhibited increases in two humoral immunological markers. However, they surprisingly did not show any effects across two markers of oxidative damage and four antioxidant markers. We propose that this lack of effects on oxidative status may be due to a reduction in cell metabolism through sickness behaviours or given life history traits, such as a long lifespan and a frugivorous diet. Finally, the consistency in the pattern of elevation in haptoglobin and lysozyme between current and previous findings highlights their utility as diagnostic markers for extracellular infections in bats.© The Author(s) 2022.

Several key pathways are understood in CVEC function that lead to the development and maintenance of their barrier properties, the dysregulation of which leads to BBB breakdown and neuronal injury. Endothelial lncRNAs have been discovered and functionally validated in the past decade, spanning a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms in health and disease. We summarize here the lncRNA-mediated regulation of established pathways that maintain or disrupt the barrier property of CVECs, including in conditions such as ischemic stroke and glioma. These lncRNAs namely regulate the tight junction assembly/disassembly, angiogenesis, autophagy, apoptosis, and so on. The identification of these lncRNAs suggests a less understood mechanistic layer, calling for further studies in appropriate models of the blood brain barrier to shed light on the lncRNA-mediated regulation of CVEC function.

Through a colocalization analysis, here we demonstrate that genomic regions coding for the TT are significantly enriched for MS-associated GWAS variants and DNA binding sites for molecular transducers mediating putative, non-genetic, determinants of MS (vitamin D deficiency, Epstein Barr virus latent infection, B cell dysfunction), indicating TT-coding regions as MS etiopathogenetic hotspots.

When the phenotype is protein abundance, a reasonable hypothesis is that the gene encoding that protein is the causal gene. However, as variants impacting protein levels can occur thousands or even millions of base pairs from the gene encoding the protein, it is unclear at what distance this simple hypothesis breaks down.By making the simple assumption that cis-pQTLs should be distance dependent while trans-pQTLs are distance independent, we arrive at a simple and empirical distance cutoff separating cis- and trans-pQTLs. Analyzing a recent large-scale pQTL study (Pietzner in Science 374:eabj1541, 2021) we arrive at an estimated distance cutoff of 944 kilobasepairs (95% confidence interval: 767-1,161) separating the cis and trans regimes.We demonstrate that this simple model can be applied to other molecular GWAS traits. Since much of biology is built on molecular traits like protein, transcript and metabolite abundance, we posit that the mathematical models for cis and trans distance distributions derived here will also apply to more complex phenotypes and traits.© 2022.

Both markers were strongly and negatively correlated to cortisol, as measured by the area under the curve for the full-day salivary cortisol excretion. Surprisingly, patients had similar levels of 8-oxodG excretion and lower levels of 8-oxoGuo excretion at baseline compared to the controls. We conclude that intervention with serotonin reuptake inhibitors in unipolar depression is associated with a reduction in systemic DNA and RNA damage from oxidation. To our knowledge, this to date the largest intervention study to characterize this phenomenon, and the first to include a marker of RNA oxidation.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35563638","Lactoferrin as a Human Genome ""Guardian""-An Overall Point of View.","Int J Mol Sci","Structural abnormalities causing DNA modifications of the ethene and propanoadducts can lead to mutations and permanent damage to human genetic material. Such changes may cause premature aging and cell degeneration and death as well as severe impairment of tissue and organ function. This may lead to the development of various diseases, including cancer. In response to a damage, cells have developed defense mechanisms aimed at preventing disease and repairing damaged genetic material or diverting it into apoptosis. All of the mechanisms described above are part of the repertoire of action of Lactoferrin-an endogenous protein that contains iron in its structure, which gives it numerous antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and anticancer properties. The aim of the article is to synthetically present the new and innovative role of lactoferrin in the protection of human genetic material against internal and external damage, described by the modulation mechanisms of the cell cycle at all its levels and the mechanisms of its repair."
"35499801","The Effect of Smoking Habits on Blood Cadmium and Lead Levels in Residents Living Near a Mining and Smelting Area in Northwest China: a Cross-Sectional Study.","Biol Trace Elem Res","Few studies have focused on environmental cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) exposure while exploring the effect of smoking on blood Cd (BCd) and blood Pb (BPb) levels. Moreover, essential trace elements affect the absorption, accumulation, and toxicity of Cd and Pb. To investigate the effect of smoking on BCd and BPb levels under high Cd and Pb exposure and the influence of essential trace elements on the effect, 301 residents living near a mining and smelting area in Northwest China were included in our study. After collecting health information and measuring BCd, BPb, serum iron, magnesium, and total calcium levels, we analyzed the association between smoking and BCd and BPb levels and the influence of the essential trace elements on the association. The results showed that BCd and BPb levels in smokers were significantly higher than those in non-smokers. There was a dose-response association between pack-years and the odds ratios (ORs) of high BCd and BPb levels in all participants compared with non-smokers. Serum iron, magnesium, and calcium had a negative effect on the elevations of the ORs of high BCd and BPb levels. In addition, smoking-related elevations of BCd and BPb levels vary by sex, age, BMI, and age of smoking initiation. Our findings present evidence for the effect of smoking on BCd and BPb levels under high Cd and Pb exposure and may provide guidance for the prevention and control of BCd and BPb elevations in residents living in Cd- and Pb-polluted areas.© 2022.

In this study, Tetragenococcus halophilus No. 1 in miso was found to possess salient immunomodulatory functions. Recently, we also demonstrated its effect on boosting immunological robustness. Although the consumption of miso is suggested to affect health over generations, such a long-term experiment has not been conducted until now. Thus, we evaluated the effects of miso-derived T. halophilus No. 1 over generations on the immune system of mice. As the generations increase, the proportion of germinal center B cells tends to increase. Furthermore, we found that CD4+ T cells expressing CD69, an activation marker, were increased in the third generation of mice. In addition, the proportion of follicular helper T cells and regulatory T cells tended to increase. Among the subsets of CD4+ T cells in the fourth generation, effector T cells and effector memory T cells tended to increase. In contrast, central memory T cells and naive T cells decreased. Moreover, autoimmunity was suppressed by long-term administration of T. halophilus No. 1. Based on these findings, we believe that the long-term administration of T. halophilus No. 1 over generations promotes immune activation and tolerance and enhances immunological robustness."

Yet, how viral infection alters epithelial-immune cell interactions regulating inflammatory responses, is not well known. Available experimental approaches are insufficient to properly analyse this complex system, and computational predictions and targeted data integration are needed as an alternative approach. In this work, we propose an integrated computational biology framework that models how infection alters intracellular signalling of epithelial cells and how this change impacts the systemic immune response through modified interactions between epithelial cells and local immune cell populations. As a proof-of-concept, we focused on the role of intestinal and upper-airway epithelial infection. To characterise the modified epithelial-immune interactome, we integrated intra- and intercellular networks with single-cell RNA-seq data from SARS-CoV-2 infected human ileal and colonic organoids as well as from infected airway ciliated epithelial cells. This integrated methodology has proven useful to point out specific epithelial-immune interactions driving inflammation during disease response, and propose relevant molecular targets to guide focused experimental analysis.© 2022.

We systematically analyze 484 peripheral cellular or soluble immune features in a longitudinal cohort of 63 mild and 15 hospitalized patients versus 14 asymptomatic and 26 household controls. We observe a transient increase of IP10/CXCL10 and interferon-β levels, coordinated responses of dominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 and fewer CD8 T cells, and various antigen-presenting and antibody-secreting cells in mild patients within 3 days of PCR diagnosis. The frequency of key innate immune cells and their functional marker expression are impaired in hospitalized patients at day 1 of inclusion.

Because capturing representative mild and asymptomatic cases require active surveillance, they are less characterized than moderate or severe cases of COVID-19. However, a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infections might shed light into the immune mechanisms associated with the control of symptoms and protection. To this aim, we have determined the temporal dynamics of the humoral immune response, as well as the serum inflammatory profile, of mild and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in a cohort of 172 initially seronegative prospectively studied United States Marine recruits, 149 of whom were subsequently found to be SARS-CoV-2 infected. The participants had blood samples taken, symptoms surveyed and PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 performed periodically for up to 105 days. We found similar dynamics in the profiles of viral load and in the generation of specific antibody responses in asymptomatic and mild symptomatic participants. A proteomic analysis using an inflammatory panel including 92 analytes revealed a pattern of three temporal waves of inflammatory and immunoregulatory mediators, and a return to baseline for most of the inflammatory markers by 35 days post-infection. We found that 23 analytes were significantly higher in those participants that reported symptoms at the time of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR compared with asymptomatic participants, including mostly chemokines and cytokines associated with inflammatory response or immune activation (i.e., TNF-α, TNF-β, CXCL10, IL-8). Notably, we detected 7 analytes (IL-17C, MMP-10, FGF-19, FGF-21, FGF-23, CXCL5 and CCL23) that were higher in asymptomatic participants than in participants with symptoms; these are known to be involved in tissue repair and may be related to the control of symptoms. Overall, we found a serum proteomic signature that differentiates asymptomatic and mild symptomatic infections in young adults, including potential targets for developing new therapies and prognostic tests.Copyright © 2022 Soares-Schanoski, Sauerwald, Goforth, Periasamy, Weir, Lizewski, Lizewski, Ge, Kuzmina, Nair, Vangeti, Marjanovic, Cappuccio, Cheng, Mofsowitz, Miller, Yu, George, Zaslavsky, Bukreyev, Troyanskaya, Sealfon, Letizia and Ramos."
"35563490","Stem Cell-Derived Islets for Type 2 Diabetes.","Int J Mol Sci","Since the discovery of insulin a century ago, insulin injection has been a primary treatment for both type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is a complicated disea se that is triggered by the dysfunction of insulin-producing β cells and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Insulin injection partially compensates for the role of endogenous insulin which promotes glucose uptake, lipid synthesis and organ growth. However, lacking the continuous, rapid, and accurate glucose regulation by endogenous functional β cells, the current insulin injection therapy is unable to treat the root causes of the disease. Thus, new technologies such as human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived islets are needed for both identifying the key molecular and genetic causes of T2D and for achieving a long-term treatment. This perspective review will provide insight into the efficacy of hPSC-derived human islets for treating and understanding T2D. We discuss the evidence that β cells should be the primary target for T2D treatment, the use of stem cells for the modeling of T2D and the potential use of hPSC-derived islet transplantation for treating T2D."

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), such as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), offer infinite resources for newly synthesized human islets. Recent advancements in hPSCs technology have enabled direct differentiation to human islet-like clusters, which can sense glucose and secrete insulin, and those islet clusters can ameliorate diabetes when transplanted into rodents or non-human primates (NHPs). However, the generated hPSC-derived human islet-like clusters are functionally immature compared with primary human islets. There remains a challenge to establish a technology to create fully functional human isletsin vitro, which are functionally and transcriptionally indistinguishable from cadaveric human islets. Understanding the complex differentiation and maturation pathway is necessary to generate fully functional human islets for a tremendous supply of high-quality human islets with less batch-to-batch difference for millions of patients.

"35482056","Lessons from single-cell RNA sequencing of human islets.","Diabetologia","Islet dysfunction is central in type 2 diabetes and full-blown type 2 diabetes develops first when the beta cells lose their ability to secrete adequate amounts of insulin in response to raised plasma glucose. Several mechanisms behind beta cell dysfunction have been put forward but many important questions still remain. Furthermore, our understanding of the contribution of each islet cell type in type 2 diabetes pathophysiology has been limited by technical boundaries. Closing this knowledge gap will lead to a leap forward in our understanding of the islet as an organ and potentially lead to improved treatments. The development of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has led to a breakthrough for characterising the transcriptome of each islet cell type and several important observations on the regulation of cell-type-specific gene expression have been made. When it comes to identifying type 2 diabetes disease mechanisms, the outcome is still limited. Several studies have identified differentially expressed genes, although there is very limited consensus between the studies. As with all new techniques, scRNAseq has limitations; in addition to being extremely expensive, genes expressed at low levels may not be detected, noise may not be appropriately filtered and selection biases for certain cell types are at hand. Furthermore, recent advances suggest that commonly used computational tools may be suboptimal for analysis of scRNAseq data in small-scale studies. Fortunately, development of new computational tools holds promise for harnessing the full potential of scRNAseq data. Here we summarise how scRNAseq has contributed to increasing the understanding of various aspects of islet biology as well as type 2 diabetes disease mechanisms. We also focus on challenges that remain and propose steps to promote the utilisation of the full potential of scRNAseq in this area.© 2022. The Author(s)."

However, in many cases the phenotypic impacts of such variants are not well understood. Intriguingly, while some SNVs cause debilitating diseases, other variants in the same gene may have no, or limited, impact. The mechanisms underlying these complex patterns are difficult to study at scale. Additionally, current data and research is mainly focused on European populations, and the mechanisms underlying genetic traits in other populations are poorly studied. Novel technologies may be able to mitigate this disparity and improve the applicability of personalized healthcare to underserved populations. In this review we discuss base editing technologies and their potential to accelerate progress in this field, particularly in combination with single-cell RNA sequencing. We further explore how base editing screens can help link SNVs to distinct disease phenotypes. We then highlight several studies that take advantage of single-cell RNA sequencing and CRISPR screens to emphasize the current limitations and future potential of this technique. Lastly, we consider the use of such approaches to potentially accelerate the study of genetic mechanisms in non-European populations.© 2022 The Authors.

"35462851","An Implementation Strategy to Develop Sustainable Surveillance Activities Through Adoption of a Target Operating Model.","Front Public Health","The increasing threat of emerging and re-emerging pathogens calls for a shared vision toward developing and maintaining global surveillance mechanisms to enable rapid characterization of pathogens, a foundational requirement for effective outbreak response. Efforts establishing new surveillance programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have repeatedly led to siloed systems that prove unsustainable or ineffective due to narrowly focused approaches, competing priorities, or lack of resourcing. Barriers inherent to LMICs, such as resource limitations, workforce strain, unreliable supply chains, and lack of enduring champions exacerbate implementation and sustainability challenges. In order to improve adoption and endurance of new surveillance programs, more effective design and implementation of programs is needed to adequately reflect stakeholder needs and simultaneously support population-level disease monitoring and clinical decision-making across a range of chronic and acute health issues. At the heart of this cross-sectorial integration between clinical care and public health initiatives are emerging technologies and data modalities, including sequencing data. In this prospective, we propose an implementation strategy for genomics-based surveillance initiatives in LMICs founded on the use of a target operating model. Adoption of a target operating model for the design and implementation of genomic surveillance programs will ensure programs are agile, relevant, and unified across diverse stakeholder communities, thereby increasing their overall impact and sustainability.Copyright © 2022 Lee, Stewart, Dymond and Lewis."

Variant surveillance from genome sequencing has become crucial to determine if mutations in these variants are rendering the virus more infectious, potent, or resistant to existing vaccines and therapeutics. Meanwhile, analyzing many raw sequencing data repeatedly with currently available code-based bioinformatics tools is tremendously challenging to be implemented in this unprecedented pandemic time due to the fact of limited experts and computational resources. Therefore, in order to hasten variant surveillance efforts, we developed an installation-free cloud workflow for robust mutation profiling of SARS-CoV-2 variants from multiple Illumina sequencing data. Herein, 55 raw sequencing data representing four early SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) from an open-access database were used to test our workflow performance. As a result, our workflow could automatically identify mutated sites of the variants along with reliable annotation of the protein-coding genes at cost-effective and timely manner for all by harnessing parallel cloud computing in one execution under resource-limitation settings. In addition, our workflow can also generate a consensus genome sequence which can be shared with others in public data repositories to support global variant surveillance efforts."
"35488064","Genetic genealogy uncovers a founder deletion mutation in the cerebral cavernous malformations 2 gene.","Hum Genet","Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) are vascular malformations consisting of collections of enlarged capillaries occurring in the brain or spinal cord. These vascular malformations can occur sporadically or susceptibility to develop these can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait due to mutation in one of three genes. Over a decade ago, we described a 77.6 Kb germline deletion spanning exons 2-10 in the CCM2 gene found in multiple affected individuals from seemingly unrelated families. Segregation analysis using linked, microsatellite markers indicated that this deletion may have arisen at least twice independently. In the ensuing decades, many more CCM patients have been identified with this deletion. In this present study we examined 27 reportedly unrelated affected individuals with this deletion. To investigate the origin of the deletion at base pair level resolution, we sequenced approximately 10 Kb upstream and downstream from the recombination junction on the deleted allele. All patients showed the identical SNP haplotype across this combined 20 Kb interval. In parallel, genealogical records have traced 11 of these individuals to five separate pedigrees dating as far back as the 1600-1700s. These haplotype and genealogical data suggest that these families and the remaining ""unrelated"" samples converge on a common ancestor due to a founder mutation occurring centuries ago on the North American continent. We also note that another gene, NACAD, is included in this deletion. Although patient self-reporting does not indicate an apparent phenotypic consequence for heterozygous deletion of NACAD, further investigation is warranted for these patients.© 2022.

These methods lack sensitivity and specificity, so new antemortem non-invasive strategies to diagnose AD are needed. Herein, we designed a machine learning predictor based on transcriptomic data obtained from the blood of AD patients and individuals without dementia (non-AD) through an 8 × 60 K microarray. The dataset was used to train different models with different hyperparameters. The support vector machines method allowed us to reach a Receiver Operating Characteristic score of 93% and an accuracy of 89%. High score levels were also achieved by the neural network and logistic regression methods. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the features selected to train the model along with the genes differentially expressed between the non-AD and AD transcriptomic profiles shows the ""mitochondrial translation"" biological process to be the most interesting. In addition, inspection of the KEGG pathways suggests that the accumulation of β-amyloid triggers electron transport chain impairment, enhancement of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, all these elements suggest that the oxidative stress induced by β-amyloid is a key feature trained by the model for the prediction of AD with high accuracy."

A total of 486 patients (January 2010-December 2015) were used for morphological feature model development and optimization. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to determine significant morphological features of EVAR-related severe adverse events (SAEs) and to build a morphological feature model based on different machine learning algorithms. Subsequently, to develop the morphological feature model more easily and better compare with other modal models, 340 patients of AAA with intraluminal thrombosis (ILT) were used for automatic segmentation of ILT based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). Notably, 493 patients (January 2016-December 2019) were used for the development and comparison of multimodal models (optimized morphological feature, DL, and radiomic models). Of note, 80% of patients were classified as the training set and 20% of patients were classified as the test set. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the predictive abilities of different modal models.The mean age of the patients was 69.9 years, the mean follow-up was 54 months, and 307 (31.4%) patients experienced SAEs. Statistical analysis revealed that short neck, angulated neck, conical neck, ILT, ILT percentage ≥51.6%, luminal calcification, double iliac sign, and common iliac artery index ≥1.255 were associated with SAEs. The morphological feature model based on the support vector machine had a better predictive performance with an AUC of 0.76, an accuracy of 0.76, and an F1 score of 0.82. Our DCNN model achieved a mean intersection over union score of more than 90.78% for the segmentation of ILT and AAA aortic lumen. The multimodal model result showed that the radiomic model based on logistics regression had better predictive performance (AUC 0.93, accuracy 0.86, and F1 score 0.91) than the optimized morphological feature model (AUC 0.62, accuracy 0.69, and F1 score 0.81) and the DL model (AUC 0.82, accuracy 0.85, and F1 score 0.89).The radiomic model has better predictive performance for patient status after EVAR.

We analysed RNA-sequence data from 28 sea lamprey gonads sampled across life-history stages, generated a genome-guided de novo superTranscriptome with annotations, and identified germline-specific genes (GSGs). Overall, we identified 638 GSGs that are enriched for reproductive processes and exhibit 36x greater odds of being expressed in testes than ovaries. Next, while 55% of the GSGs have putative somatic paralogs, the somatic paralogs are not differentially expressed between sexes. Further, putative orthologs of some the male-biased GSGs have known functions in sex determination or differentiation in other vertebrates. We conclude that the GSR of sea lamprey plays an important role in testicular differentiation and potentially sex determination.© 2022. The Author(s)."

The project aims to identify new biomarkers that enable detection of systemic recurrences at the molecular level. As blood represents the biological interface between the primary tumour, the microenvironment and distant metastases, liquid biopsies represent the ideal medium to monitor the patient's cancer biology for identification of patients at high risk of relapse and for early detection systemic relapse.Including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) allows for a vast number of possibilities to compare PROM data with biological information, enabling the study of fatigue and Quality of Life in patients with breast cancer.A total of 1455 patients with early-stage breast cancer are enrolled in the PBCB study, which has a one-armed prospective observational design. Participants consent to contribute liquid biopsies (i.e., peripheral blood and urine samples) every 6 or 12 months for 11 years.

"35507132","Functional Implications and Clinical Potential of MicroRNAs in Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Concise Review.","Dig Dis Sci","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are tiny (20-24 nucleotides long), non-coding, highly conserved RNA molecules that play a crucial role within the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via sequence-specific mechanisms. Since the miRNA transcriptome is involved in multiple molecular processes needed for cellular homeostasis, its altered expression can trigger the development and progression of several human pathologies. In this context, over the last few years, several relevant studies have demonstrated that dysregulated miRNAs affect a wide range of molecular mechanisms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a common gastrointestinal disorder. For instance, abnormal miRNA expression in IBS patients is related to the alteration of intestinal permeability, visceral hyperalgesia, inflammatory pathways, and pain sensitivity. Besides, specific miRNAs are differentially expressed in the different subtypes of IBS, and therefore, they might be used as biomarkers for precise diagnosis of these pathological conditions. Accordingly, miRNAs have noteworthy potential as theragnostic targets for IBS. Hence, in this current review, we present an overview of the recent discoveries regarding the clinical relevance of miRNAs in IBS, which might be useful in the future for the development of miRNA-based drugs against this disorder.© 2022.

However, only a few studies investigate longitudinal effects during middle childhood and adolescence and compare two domains of early caregiving. In a longitudinal follow-up with a sample ofN= 87, we studied the effects of differences in the DRD4 tandem repeat polymorphisms and two domains of early maternal caregiving quality on children's personality development using Block's California Child Q-Set (CCQ) at age six and age 12 and on problem behavior at ages six and seven. Early maternal regulation quality predicted later ego-resiliency and aggressiveness. In addition, significant gene-environment interactions revealed that children with the 7+ DRD4 tandem repeat polymorphism and poor maternal regulation quality in infancy showed lower scores in ego-resiliency and higher scores in ego-undercontrol and CCQ aggressiveness. In contrast, children who had experienced effective maternal regulation in infancy showed a comparable level in personality traits and problem behavior as the DRD4 7- group independent of the levels of maternal regulatory behavior. Similarly, longitudinal caregiving × DRD4 interactions were found for behavior problems in middle childhood, especially for oppositional-aggression, inattentive-hyperactivity, and social competence. Early caregiving effects were only found for maternal regulation quality, but not for maternal responsiveness. Effective early maternal regulation in infancy can moderate the negative effect of DRD4 7+ on children's self-regulation in middle childhood and adolescence. However, maternal responsiveness has no comparable effects. It seems relevant to consider several dimensions of early caregiving and to also measure the environment in more detail in gene-environment studies.Copyright © 2022 Zimmermann and Spangler."
"35456408","Chromosome Changes in Soma and Germ Line: Heritability and Evolutionary Outcome.","Genes (Basel)","The origin and inheritance of chromosome changes provide the essential foundation for natural selection and evolution. The evolutionary fate of chromosome changes depends on the place and time of their emergence and is controlled by checkpoints in mitosis and meiosis. Estimating whether the altered genome can be passed to subsequent generations should be central when we consider a particular genome rearrangement. Through comparative analysis of chromosome rearrangements in soma and germ line, the potential impact of macromutations such as chromothripsis or chromoplexy appears to be fascinating. What happens with chromosomes during the early development, and which alterations lead to mosaicism are other poorly studied but undoubtedly essential issues. The evolutionary impact can be gained most effectively through chromosome rearrangements arising in male meiosis I and in female meiosis II, which are the last divisions following fertilization. The diversity of genome organization has unique features in distinct animals; the chromosome changes, their internal relations, and some factors safeguarding genome maintenance in generations under natural selection were considered for mammals."
"35577912","Maternal attachment insecurity, maltreatment history, and depressive symptoms are associated with broad DNA methylation signatures in infants.","Mol Psychiatry","The early environment, including maternal characteristics, provides many cues to young organisms that shape their long-term physical and mental health. Identifying the earliest molecular events that precede observable developmental outcomes could help identify children in need of support prior to the onset of physical and mental health difficulties. In this study, we examined whether mothers' attachment insecurity, maltreatment history, and depressive symptoms were associated with alterations in DNA methylation patterns in their infants, and whether these correlates in the infant epigenome were associated with socioemotional and behavioral functioning in toddlerhood. We recruited 156 women oversampled for histories of depression, who completed psychiatric interviews and depression screening during pregnancy, then provided follow-up behavioral data on their children at 18 months. Buccal cell DNA was obtained from 32 of their infants for a large-scale analysis of methylation patterns across 5 × 106individual CpG dinucleotides, using clustering-based significance criteria to control for multiple comparisons. We found that tens of thousands of individual infant CpGs were alternatively methylated in association with maternal attachment insecurity, maltreatment in childhood, and antenatal and postpartum depressive symptoms, including genes implicated in developmental patterning, cell-cell communication, hormonal regulation, immune function/inflammatory response, and neurotransmission. Density of DNA methylation at selected genes from the result set was also significantly associated with toddler socioemotional and behavioral problems. This is the first report to identify novel regions of the human infant genome at which DNA methylation patterns are associated longitudinally both with maternal characteristics and with offspring socioemotional and behavioral problems in toddlerhood.© 2022.

"35449380","Epigenetic clock and methylation studies in marsupials: opossums, Tasmanian devils, kangaroos, and wallabies.","Geroscience","The opossum (Monodelphis domestica), with its sequenced genome, ease of laboratory care and experimental manipulation, and unique biology, is the most used laboratory marsupial. Using the mammalian methylation array, we generated DNA methylation data from n = 100 opossum samples from the ear, liver, and tail. We contrasted postnatal development and later aging effects in the opossum methylome with those in mouse (Mus musculus, C57BL/6 J strain) and other marsupial species such as Tasmanian devil, kangaroos, and wallabies. While the opossum methylome is similar to that of mouse during postnatal development, it is distinct from that shared by other mammals when it comes to the age-related gain of methylation at target sites of polycomb repressive complex 2. Our immunohistochemical staining results provide additional support for the hypothesis that PRC2 activity increases with later aging in mouse tissues but remains constant in opossum tissues. We present several epigenetic clocks for opossums that are distinguished by their compatibility with tissue type (pan-tissue and blood clock) and species (opossum and human). Two dual-species human-opossum pan-tissue clocks accurately measure chronological age and relative age, respectively. The human-opossum epigenetic clocks are expected to provide a significant boost to the attractiveness of opossum as a biological model. Additional epigenetic clocks for Tasmanian devil, red kangaroos and other species of the genus Macropus may aid species conservation efforts.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35546682","SKA3 is a prognostic biomarker and associated with immune infiltration in bladder cancer.","Hereditas","Spindle and kinetochore‑associated complex subunit 3 (SKA3) has recently been considered a key regulator of carcinogenesis. However, the connection between SKA3 and immune cell infiltration remains unknown.The current study investigated the expression mode, prognostic effect, and functional role of SKA3 in different tumors, particularly bladder cancer using numerous databases, comprising TIMER, GEPIA, HPA, UALCAN, PrognoScan, and Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Differentially expressed gene and enrichment analyses were implemented on SKA3 using R packages ""edgR"" and ""clusterProfiler"". Immunohistochemistry was further used to validate the expression of SKA3 gene in bladder cancer. Following that, the relevance of SKA3 expression to immune infiltration level in bladder cancer was evaluated using TIMER.Overall, the level of SKA3 expression in tumor tissue significantly increased than in normal tissue. In bladder cancer and other tumors, patients with high SKA3 expression levels had worse overall survival (OS) (p = 0.016), disease-specific survival (DSS) (p = 0.00004), and disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.032). Additionally, the major molecular functions for SKA3 included nuclear division, mitotic nuclear division, mitotic sister chromatid segregation, humoral immune response, and cell chemotaxis. Additionally, SKA3 expression was found to be positively associated with enhanced M2 macrophage and T helper (Th) 2 cell infiltration in bladder cancer.Our study implies that SKA3 contributes to M2 macrophage and Th2 cell polarization by acting as an oncogene in bladder cancer. SKA3 might be a novel biomarker for evaluating prognosis and immune infiltration in bladder cancer.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35453658","Testicular ""Inherited Metabolic Memory"" of Ancestral High-Fat Diet Is Associated with Sperm sncRNA Content.","Biomedicines","Excessive adiposity caused by high-fat diets (HFDs) is associated with testicular metabolic and functional abnormalities up to grand-offspring, but the mechanisms of this epigenetic inheritance are unclear. Here we describe an association of sperm small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) with testicular ""inherited metabolic memory"" of ancestral HFD, using a transgenerational rodent model. Male founders were fed a standard chow for 200 days (CTRL), HFD for 200 days (HFD), or standard chow for 60 days followed by HFD for 140 days (HFDt). The male offspring and grand-offspring were fed standard chow for 200 days. The sncRNA sequencing from epidydimal spermatozoa revealed signatures associated with testicular metabolic plasticity in HFD-exposed mice and in the unexposed progeny. Sperm tRNA-derived RNA (tsRNA) and repeat-derived small RNA (repRNA) content were specially affected by HFDt and in the offspring of HFD and HFDt mice. The grand-offspring of HFD and HFDt mice showed lower sperm counts than CTRL descendants, whereas the sperm miRNA content was affected. Although the causality between sperm sncRNAs content and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of HFD-related traits remains elusive, our results suggest that sperm sncRNA content is influenced by ancestral exposure to HFD, contributing to the sperm epigenome up to the grand-offspring."

We determined the association of genetic variants within ±500 kb of LAG3 with plasma LAG3 and defined LAG3-associated plasma proteins with HDL-C and clinical outcomes. Whole genome sequencing and plasma proteomics were obtained from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) cohorts as part of the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. In situ Hi-C chromatin capture was performed in EBV-transformed cell lines isolated from four MESA participants. Genetic association analyses were performed in MESA using multivariate regression models, with validation in FHS. A LAG3-associated protein network was tested for association with HDL-C, coronary heart disease, and all-cause mortality. We identify an association between the LAG3 rs3782735 variant and plasma LAG3 protein. Proteomics analysis reveals 183 proteins significantly associated with LAG3 with four proteins associated with HDL-C. Four proteins discovered for association with all-cause mortality in FHS shows nominal associations in MESA. Chromatin capture analysis reveals significant cis interactions between LAG3 and C1S, LRIG3, TNFRSF1A, and trans interactions between LAG3 and B2M. A LAG3-associated protein network has significant associations with HDL-C and mortality.© 2022. The Author(s)."
"35504286","Single-cell analysis of human testis aging and correlation with elevated body mass index.","Dev Cell","Aging men display reduced reproductive health; however, testis aging is poorly understood at the molecular and genomic levels. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA-seq to profile over 44,000 cells from both young and older men and examined age-related changes in germline development and in the testicular somatic cells. Age-related changes in spermatogonial stem cells appeared modest, whereas age-related dysregulation of spermatogenesis and somatic cells ranged from moderate to severe. Altered pathways included signaling and inflammation in multiple cell types, metabolic signaling in Sertoli cells, hedgehog signaling and testosterone production in Leydig cells, cell death and growth in testicular peritubular cells, and possible developmental regression in both Leydig and peritubular cells. Remarkably, the extent of dysregulation correlated with body mass index in older but not in younger men. Collectively, we reveal candidate molecular mechanisms underlying the complex testicular changes conferred by aging and their possible exacerbation by concurrent chronic conditions such as obesity.Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

"35565847","HDHL-INTIMIC: A European Knowledge Platform on Food, Diet, Intestinal Microbiomics, and Human Health.","Nutrients","Studies indicate that the intestinal microbiota influences general metabolic processes in humans, thereby modulating the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, allergy, cardiovascular disease, and colorectal cancer (CRC). Dietary factors are also directly related to chronic disease risk, and they affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Still, detailed knowledge on the relation between diet, the microbiota, and chronic disease risk is limited. The overarching aim of the HDHL-INTIMIC (INtesTInal MICrobiomics) knowledge platform is to foster studies on the microbiota, nutrition, and health by assembling available knowledge of the microbiota and of the other aspects (e.g., food science and metabolomics) that are relevant in the context of microbiome research. The goal is to make this information findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) to the scientific community, and to share information with the various stakeholders. Through these efforts a network of transnational and multidisciplinary collaboration has emerged, which has contributed to further develop and increase the impact of microbiome research in human health. The roles of microbiota in early infancy, during ageing, and in subclinical and clinically manifested disease are identified as urgent areas of research in this knowledge platform."
"35508500","Concurrent outcomes from multiple approaches of epistasis analysis for human body mass index associated loci provide insights into obesity biology.","Sci Rep","Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have focused on elucidating the genetic architecture of complex traits by assessing single variant effects in additive genetic models, albeit explaining a fraction of the trait heritability. Epistasis has recently emerged as one of the intrinsic mechanisms that could explain part of this missing heritability. We conducted epistasis analysis for genome-wide body mass index (BMI) associated SNPs in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and followed up top significant interacting SNPs for replication in the UK Biobank imputed genotype dataset. We report two pairwise epistatic interactions, between rs2177596 (RHBDD1) and rs17759796 (MAPK1), rs1121980 (FTO) and rs6567160 (MC4R), obtained from a consensus of nine different epistatic approaches. Gene interaction maps and tissue expression profiles constructed for these interacting loci highlights co-expression, co-localisation, physical interaction, genetic interaction, and shared pathways emphasising the neuronal influence in obesity and implicating concerted expression of associated genes in liver, pancreas, and adipose tissues insinuating to metabolic abnormalities characterized by obesity. Detecting epistasis could thus be a promising approach to understand the effect of simultaneously interacting multiple genetic loci in disease aetiology, beyond single locus effects.© 2022.

"35463305","Does the Microbiota Composition Influence the Efficacy of Colorectal Cancer Immunotherapy?","Front Oncol","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common malignancy globally, and many people with CRC suffer the fate of death. Due to the importance of CRC and its negative impact on communities, treatment strategies to control it or increase patient survival are being studied. Traditional therapies, including surgery and chemotherapy, have treated CRC patients. However, with the advancement of science, we are witnessing the emergence of novel therapeutic approaches such as immunotherapy for CRC treatment, which have had relatively satisfactory clinical outcomes. Evidence shows that gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota, including various bacterial species, viruses, and fungi, can affect various biological events, regulate the immune system, and even treat diseases like human malignancies. CRC has recently shown that the gut microorganism pattern can alter both antitumor and pro-tumor responses, as well as cancer immunotherapy. Of course, this is also true of traditional therapies because it has been revealed that gut microbiota can also reduce the side effects of chemotherapy. Therefore, this review summarized the effects of gut microbiota on CRC immunotherapy.Copyright © 2022 Lin, Kong and Zhang."
"35568729","TDP-43 regulates cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2.","Sci Rep","Dyslipidemia is considered an essential component of the pathological process of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal motor neuron disease. Although TAR DNA Binding Protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) links both familial and sporadic forms of ALS and cytoplasmic aggregates are a hallmark of most cases of ALS, the molecular mechanism and the in vivo relation of ALS dyslipidemia with TDP-43 have been unclear. To analyze the dyslipidemia-related gene expression by TDP-43, we performed expression microarray and RNA deep sequencing (RNA-Seq) using cell lines expressing high levels of TDP-43 and identified 434 significantly altered genes including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2), a master regulator of cholesterol homeostasis and its downstream genes. Elevated TDP-43 impaired SREBP2 transcriptional activity, leading to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. The amount of cholesterol was significantly decreased in the spinal cords of TDP-43-overexpressed ALS model mice and in the cerebrospinal fluids of ALS patients. These results suggested that TDP-43 could play an essential role in cholesterol biosynthesis in relation to ALS dyslipidemia.© 2022. The Author(s)."
