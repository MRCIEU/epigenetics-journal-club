No ,DNAm age,33656257,BiT age: A transcriptome-based aging clock near the theoretical limit of accuracy.,Aging Cell,"Aging clocks dissociate biological from chronological age. The estimation of biological age is important for identifying gerontogenes and assessing environmental, nutritional, or therapeutic impacts on the aging process. Recently, methylation markers were shown to allow estimation of biological age based on age-dependent somatic epigenetic alterations. However, DNA methylation is absent in some species such as Caenorhabditis elegans and it remains unclear whether and how the epigenetic clocks affect gene expression. Aging clocks based on transcriptomes have suffered from considerable variation in the data and relatively low accuracy. Here, we devised an approach that uses temporal scaling and binarization of C. elegans transcriptomes to define a gene set that predicts biological age with an accuracy that is close to the theoretical limit. Our model accurately predicts the longevity effects of diverse strains, treatments, and conditions. The involved genes support a role of specific transcription factors as well as innate immunity and neuronal signaling in the regulation of the aging process. We show that this binarized transcriptomic aging (BiT age) clock can also be applied to human age prediction with high accuracy. The BiT age clock could therefore find wide application in genetic, nutritional, environmental, and therapeutic interventions in the aging process.© 2021 The Authors.

No ,Methods,33623021,Single-cell multiomics sequencing reveals the functional regulatory landscape of early embryos.,Nat Commun,"Extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs during preimplantation embryo development. However, it remains largely unclear how the drastic epigenetic reprogramming contributes to transcriptional regulatory network during this period. Here, we develop a single-cell multiomics sequencing technology (scNOMeRe-seq) that enables profiling of genome-wide chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression in the same individual cell. We apply this method to depict a single-cell multiomics map of mouse preimplantation development. We find that genome-wide DNA methylation remodeling facilitates the reconstruction of genetic lineages in early embryos. Further, we construct a zygotic genome activation (ZGA)-associated regulatory network and reveal coordination among multiple epigenetic layers, transcription factors and repeat elements that instruct proper ZGA. Cell fates associated cis-regulatory elements are activated stepwise in post-ZGA stages. Trophectoderm (TE)-specific transcription factors play dual roles in promoting the TE program while repressing the inner cell mass (ICM) program during the ICM/TE separation."
No ,Prediction,33608029,Genome-wide cell-free DNA methylation analyses improve accuracy of non-invasive diagnostic imaging for early-stage breast cancer.,Mol Cancer,"Early detection is crucial to improve breast cancer (BC) patients' outcomes and survival. Mammogram and ultrasound adopting the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categorization are widely used for BC early detection, while suffering high false-positive rate leading to unnecessary biopsy, especially in BI-RADS category-4 patients. Plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) carrying on DNA methylation information has emerged as a non-invasive approach for cancer detection. Here we present a prospective multi-center study with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data to address the clinical utility of cfDNA methylation markers from 203 female patients with breast lesions suspected for malignancy. The cfDNA is enriched with hypo-methylated genomic regions. A practical computational framework was devised to excavate optimal cfDNA-rich DNA methylation markers, which significantly improved the early diagnosis of BI-RADS category-4 patients (AUC from 0.78-0.79 to 0.93-0.94). As a proof-of-concept study, we performed the first blood-based whole-genome DNA methylation study for detecting early-stage breast cancer from benign tumors at single-base resolution, which suggests that combining the liquid biopsy with the traditional diagnostic imaging can improve the current clinical practice, by reducing the false-positive rate and avoiding unnecessary harms."
No ,DNAm age,33606025,Epigenetic Age Acceleration and Cognitive Decline: A Twin Study.,J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,"Little is known about the role of DNA methylation (DNAm) epigenetic age acceleration in cognitive decline. Using a twin study design, we examined whether DNAm age acceleration is related to cognitive decline measured longitudinally in persons without a clinical diagnosis of dementia.We studied 266 paired male twins (133 pairs) with a mean age of 56 years at baseline. Of these, 114 paired twins returned for a follow-up after an average of 11.5 years. We obtained six indices of DNAm age acceleration based on epigenome-wide data from peripheral blood lymphocytes. At both baseline and follow-up, we administered a battery of cognitive measures and constructed two composite scores, one for executive function and one for memory function. We fitted multivariable mixed regression models to examine the association of DNAm age acceleration markers with cognitive function within pairs.In cross sectional analyses at baseline, there was no association between DNAm age acceleration and cognitive function scores. In longitudinal analyses, however, comparing twins within pairs, each additional year of age acceleration using the Horvath's method was associated with a 3% decline (95% CI, 1% to 5%) in the composite executive function score and a 2.5% decline (95% CI, 0.01% to 4.9%) in the memory function score. These results did not attenuate after adjusting for education and other risk factors.Middle-aged men who had older DNAm age relative to their brothers of the same demographic age, showed a faster rate of cognitive decline in the subsequent 11.5 years. These results point to the role of epigenetic modifications in cognitive aging.© The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.

No ,Epigenetics,33619309,Skewness of X-chromosome inactivation increases with age and varies across birth cohorts in elderly Danish women.,Sci Rep,"Mosaicism in blood varies with age, and cross-sectional studies indicate that for women, skewness of X-chromosomal mosaicism increases with age. This pattern could, however, also be due to less X-inactivation in more recent birth cohorts. Skewed X-chromosome inactivation was here measured longitudinally by the HUMARA assay in 67 septuagenarian and octogenarian women assessed at 2 time points, 10 years apart, and in 10 centenarian women assessed at 2 time points, 2-7 years apart. Skewed X-chromosome inactivation was also compared in 293 age-matched septuagenarian twins born in 1917-1923 and 1931-1937, and 212 centenarians born in 1895, 1905 and 1915. The longitudinal study of septuagenarians and octogenarians revealed that 16% (95% CI 7-29%) of the women developed skewed X-inactivation over a 10-year period. In the cross-sectional across-birth cohort study, the earlier-born septuagenarian (1917-1923) and centenarian women (1895) had a higher degree of skewness than the respective recent age-matched birth cohorts, which indicates that the women in the more recent cohorts, after the age of 70, had not only changed degree of skewness with age, they had also undergone less age-related hematopoietic sub-clone expansion. This may be a result of improved living conditions and better medical treatment in the more recent birth cohorts."
No,Prediction,33632303,DNA methylation and cancer incidence: lymphatic-hematopoietic versus solid cancers in the Strong Heart Study.,Clin Epigenetics,"Epigenetic alterations may contribute to early detection of cancer. We evaluated the association of blood DNA methylation with lymphatic-hematopoietic cancers and, for comparison, with solid cancers. We also evaluated the predictive ability of DNA methylation for lymphatic-hematopoietic cancers.Blood DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina Infinium methylationEPIC array in 2324 Strong Heart Study participants (41.4% men, mean age 56 years). 788,368 CpG sites were available for differential DNA methylation analysis for lymphatic-hematopoietic, solid and overall cancers using elastic-net and Cox regression models. We conducted replication in an independent population: the Framingham Heart Study. We also analyzed differential variability and conducted bioinformatic analyses to assess for potential biological mechanisms.Over a follow-up of up to 28 years (mean 15), we identified 41 lymphatic-hematopoietic and 394 solid cancer cases. A total of 126 CpGs for lymphatic-hematopoietic cancers, 396 for solid cancers, and 414 for overall cancers were selected as predictors by the elastic-net model. For lymphatic-hematopoietic cancers, the predictive ability (C index) increased from 0.58 to 0.87 when adding these 126 CpGs to the risk factor model in the discovery set. The association was replicated with hazard ratios in the same direction in 28 CpGs in the Framingham Heart Study. When considering the association of variability, rather than mean differences, we found 432 differentially variable regions for lymphatic-hematopoietic cancers.This study suggests that differential methylation and differential variability in blood DNA methylation are associated with lymphatic-hematopoietic cancer risk. DNA methylation data may contribute to early detection of lymphatic-hematopoietic cancers."
