33661023,Epigenomics,cord blood vs placenta,cord blood and placenta,444,,loads,?,Comparative epigenome-wide analysis highlights placenta-specific differentially methylated regions.,Aim:The placenta undergoesÂ DNA methylation (DNAm) programming that is unique comparedÂ withÂ all other fetal tissues. We aim to decipher some of the physiologic roles of the placenta by comparing its DNAm profile with that of another fetal tissue.Materials & methods:We performed a comparative analysis of genome-wide DNAm of 444 placentas paired with cord blood samples collected at birth. Gene ontologyÂ term analyses were conducted on the resulting differentially methylated regions.Results:Genomic regions upstream of transcription start sites showing lower DNAm in the placenta were enriched with terms related to miRNAÂ functions and genes encoding G protein-coupled receptors.Conclusion:These results highlight genomic regions that are differentially methylated in the placenta in contrast to fetal blood.
33646943,Elife,psychosis and schizophrenia,blood,4483,7 cohorts,95;1048,many scz assocs present in treatment resistant,DNA methylation meta-analysis reveals cellular alterations in psychosis and markers of treatment-resistant schizophrenia.,"We performed a systematic analysis of blood DNA methylation profiles from 4,483 participants from seven independent cohorts identifying differentially methylated positions (DMPs) associated with psychosis, schizophrenia and treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Psychosis cases were characterized by significant differences in measures of blood cell proportions and elevated smoking exposure derived from the DNA methylation data, with the largest differences seen in treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients. We implemented a stringent pipeline to meta-analyze epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) results across datasets, identifying 95 DMPs associated with psychosis and 1,048 DMPs associated with schizophrenia, with evidence of colocalization to regions nominated by genetic association studies of disease. Many schizophrenia-associated DNA methylation differences were only present in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, potentially reflecting exposure to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Our results highlight how DNA methylation data can be leveraged to identify physiological (e.g., differential cell counts) and environmental (e.g., smoking) factors associated with psychosis and molecular biomarkers of treatment-resistant schizophrenia.Â© 2021, Hannon et al."
33622391,Clin Epigenetics,type 2 diabetes,blood,3428,ALSPAC;LBC1936;Rotterdam,6,3 novel,DNA methylation of blood cells is associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes in a meta-analysis of four European cohorts.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease with well-known genetic and environmental risk factors contributing to its prevalence. Epigenetic mechanisms related to changes in DNA methylation (DNAm), may also contribute to T2D risk, but larger studies are required to discover novel markers, and to confirm existing ones.We performed a large meta-analysis of individual epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of prevalent T2D conducted in four European studies using peripheral blood DNAm. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMR) was also undertaken, based on the meta-analysis results. We found three novel CpGs associated with prevalent T2D in Europeans at cg00144180 (HDAC4), cg16765088 (near SYNM) and cg24704287 (near MIR23A) and confirmed three CpGs previously identified (mapping to TXNIP, ABCG1 and CPT1A). We also identified 77 T2D associated DMRs, most of them hypomethylated in T2D cases versus controls. In adjusted regressions among diabetic-free participants in ALSPAC, we found that all six CpGs identified in the meta-EWAS were associated with white cell-types. We estimated that these six CpGs captured 11% of the variation in T2D, which was similar to the variation explained by the model including only the common risk factors of BMI, sex, age and smoking (R2â€‰=â€‰10.6%).This study identifies novel loci associated with T2D in Europeans. We also demonstrate associations of the same loci with other traits. Future studies should investigate if our findings are generalizable in non-European populations, and potential roles of these epigenetic markers in T2D etiology or in determining long term consequences of T2D."
