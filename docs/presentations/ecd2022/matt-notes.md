"Finding your place: transcription factors as sensors and modifiers of the epigenome"

Lots of lab work to investigate details about transcription factors

- transcription factors are different, some are inibited by or attracted to DNA methylation, chromatin, etc.

- DNA methylation maintenance depends on context, in heterochromatin it tends to be stable, at TF binding sites it may be highly unstable.

"Paleoepigenetics: Using ancient bones to peek into the Neanderthal brain"

Compare DNA methylation in chimps, neanderthal, denisovan and modern human, generally follows evolutionary history.

Genes that affect the voice box are most differently methylated in modern humans among 600 genes that influence anatomy.

3 brain genes differently methylated between modern humans and others, 41 between humans and chimps

"Epigenetic changes induced by environmental exposures"

Focus on imprinted genes because these tend to have stable regulation. Any changes are likely to have functional impact.

Cdkn1c (maternally expressed) and Dlk1 (paternally expressed) targetted with reporting system in mice

Investigated Cdkn1c/Dlk1 expression in offspring whose fathers/mothers had the reporter gene (so reporter silenced)

Observed loss of imprinting (Dlk1) in mice whose mothers were fed a high-fat diet
- loss was progressive during gestation
- correlates with expression

Next generation 
- weaker effect
- highly variable
- only transmitted maternally

Next next generation
- no effect

Show that *prior* exposure to glucocorticoids increases *future* transcriptional response

Further examined using cerebral organoids 
- (because rodents don't have the structure and cell types of humans)
- GR expressed at different levels in all organoid cell types
- Glucocorticoid treatment had cell-type specific effects (hundreds of genes per cell type, but only 48 in common)
- One is gene ZBTB16, a GR response transcription factor, contains GR response elements with reduced DNAm after glucocorticoid treatment, one contains a SNP associated with educational attainment, MR PheWAS showed glucocorticoid response element effect associated with a variety of phenotypes related to education
- Another gene, PAX6, is regulated by ZBTB16

However: 
- Not sure what keeps DNAm changes stable after glucocorticoids are no longer present
- Not sure what cases the *future* transcriptional response

Spatial and single cell multi-omic analysis of human cardiac disease

- Kuppe et al. Nature 2022
- Infarction has spatial effects on the heart (tissue fibrosis) 
- What causes this?
- Have created a spatial multi-omic heart infarction atlas (snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq)
- Used tissue from heart transplants
- Observed cell count variation across individuals
- Somehow know spatially where each cell came from 
- Used cell2location to determine most likely cell type
- 'cell type niche' - small regions containing 5-6 cells
- characterised niches by cell type composition

Cell-free DNAm analysis enables early preeclampsia prediction

bisulfite treated DNA, captured regions, read depth >= 40

cfDNA predictor performs similarly to maternal characteristics, but are somewhat independent so AUC of the combined predictor increases by about 0.1 (independent dataset)

predictions made in first trimester (I think...)

potentially just detecting placental DNAm

capture regions selected from placenta DNAm analysis

(appears to have presented this previously as a poster in April)

Multiple sclerosis

**Early on** there are several relapses and remissions and then eventually disability takes over

Most pronounced DNAm differences are in B lymphocytes (compared to cd8, cd4, cd14);
however there are shared changes across cell types

Created consortium investigating factors that predispose for MS development

e.g. investigating mediation of genotype by DNAm to MS
	- currently validating mediation of HLA variants by DNAm in samples from early MS

B cell story suggests EBV infection a factor, known to have big and somewhat similar effects on B cell DNAm

Running cell experiments treating B cells with 'epigenetic drugs'

Epigenome editing by crisper to show effect of increased DNAm on gene expression (decreased DNAm is apparently easier)

Observed off-target effects on expression and variation in the stability of deposited DNA methylation

Conclusions: adaptive immunity involved in MS development, potentially mediated by DNAm in B cells

What determines MS **outcomes**?

SYSF-ZNF638 known to predispose for more severe MS

Disregulation of myeloid cells and phagocytosis 

Difficult to investigate because brain tissue not available to observe progression

Epigenetics and LncRNAs in diabetic complications and metabolic memory

So far, not much evidence for genetic role in complications, observed recent increases even in young people

'metabolic memory' - long term sustained diabetic complications even after glycemic control 

Investigated mouse model

DCCT/EDIC 30 year trial
- achieving glycemic control massively reduced complications, the sooner the better
- profiled histone modifications and DNAm at two times 17 years apart 
- several sites showed persistant DNAm differences in white blood cells (TXNIP 3'UTR)
- follow-up study (n=500) identifies 186 sites associated with HbA1c
- HbA1c associated with complications, appears to be mediated by some of the DNAm sites including some at TXNIP

Long non-coding RNAs
- DRAIR is down-regulated in monocytes from type 2 diabetes
- applied assays to determine where DRAIR interacts with chromatin and what proteins DRAIR interacts with
- several papers from 2017-2022 present the results ...

Translational potential 
- found a microRNA knockout mouse that is protected from diabetic kidney disease, etc. 
- *too fast to take notes!*

IHEC oversees
- Blueprint
- EpiAtlas is the latest effort

RNA-seq
WGBS
Chip-seq of histone modifications

Standardizing experimental workflows

Standardizing analytical pipelines
- using Singularity  http://github.com/IHEC
- quality metrics - can compare your metric to those in IHEC data

Epigenomic Reference Registry (EpiRR)
- only searchable repository for human epigenomic datasets
- standardized metadata framework and validator to facilitate community submissions
- Peter Harrison and Garth Ilsley
- plan is to open it up to the community for reuse

Gaps in protected data sharing
- datasets are in dbgap -- which takes a long time to get permission
- downloading 1000s of datasets requires a concerted long-term effort over years!

Findings
- cell lines do not recapitulate patterns in primary tissues
- Use a Bayesian hierarchical model to calculate probabilistic epigenomic profiles
  that summarizes the epigenomes of multiple individuals (Steif et al. unpublished) 
  -- useful to get an idea where 'normal' epigenomes vary
- breast cancer example 

Future
- more tissues/cell types
- computational tools
- more reanalyses

*Funders aren't generally interested in building Singularity objects and reanalysing dbGap datasets without a dominanting scentific hypothesis.  What is your secret?!*

Answer: move to Canada a few years ago

EpiSCORE for estimating cell type fraction in solid-state tumours

Hierarchical EpiDISH

Barnett JE et al. Nat Commun 2022
- DNAm from blood, buccal, cervical smears from 300 women
- conclusion: large inter-individual variation in cell-type composition of tissues ("healthy variation")

Reference-based inference is very robust to noise in the DNAm reference matrix (25% errors)

But, reference data is often not available

Hence, EpiSCORE -- deconvolution of bulk-tissue DNA methylation from single-cell RNA-seq data 
- based on hypothesis that gene expression differences between tissues 
  are almost always driven by promoter DNA methylation 

EpiSCORE DNAm atlas
- Zhu et al Nat Methods 2022
- github.com/aet21/EpiSCORE
- validation of the atlas
  - compare to tumour purity in TCGA
  - snmC-seq2 data available in brain
  - accuracy 74%-82% in Kaplan's DNAm-Atlas

Kaplan's DNAm-Atlas 
 - manuscript https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.24.477547v1
 - whole-genome bisulfite sequenced at 30X depth
 - "39 cell types sorted from 207 healthy tissue samples"

Applications
- molecular classification of olfactory neuroblastoma
- episcore reveals misdiagnosed pancreatic cancer cases 
  (correctly identifies them as neuroendocrine tumours)
- identified smoking-associations in saliva DNAm specific to immune cells and epithelial cells
- did something with episcore + celldmc
- mitotic epigenetic clocks with cell-type specific correlations

Have done some validation of human-based EpiSCORE in animal data

Detecting rare epigenetic dysregulation in common psychiatric disorder

Outlier methylation region: a DMR but where one sample is an outlier 
- Could be defined as outside 95% CI.  Is this correct/best? 
- How to identify regions? - something like comb-p to combine z-scores from individual compared to everyone else
- method available on gitlab 

Applied in 
- three DNAm schizophrenia datasets (from GEO)
- 4 iPSYCH datasets from neonatal blood

Did any gene have OMR overrepresentation?
- GFI1 identified for schizophrenia

*Couldn't you use this as a biomarker of disease risk, diagnosis, outcome, etc.?*

*Likely enriched for true biological variation compared to single-site outlier analyses.*

*Seems like dmrff could be used for this*
