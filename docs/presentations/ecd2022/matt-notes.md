"Finding your place: transcription factors as sensors and modifiers of the epigenome"

Lots of lab work to investigate details about transcription factors

- transcription factors are different, some are inibited by or attracted to DNA methylation, chromatin, etc.

- DNA methylation maintenance depends on context, in heterochromatin it tends to be stable, at TF binding sites it may be highly unstable.

"Paleoepigenetics: Using ancient bones to peek into the Neanderthal brain"

Compare DNA methylation in chimps, neanderthal, denisovan and modern human, generally follows evolutionary history.

Genes that affect the voice box are most differently methylated in modern humans among 600 genes that influence anatomy.

3 brain genes differently methylated between modern humans and others, 41 between humans and chimps

"Epigenetic changes induced by environmental exposures"

Focus on imprinted genes because these tend to have stable regulation. Any changes are likely to have functional impact.

Cdkn1c (maternally expressed) and Dlk1 (paternally expressed) targetted with reporting system in mice

Investigated Cdkn1c/Dlk1 expression in offspring whose fathers/mothers had the reporter gene (so reporter silenced)

Observed loss of imprinting (Dlk1) in mice whose mothers were fed a high-fat diet
- loss was progressive during gestation
- correlates with expression

Next generation 
- weaker effect
- highly variable
- only transmitted maternally

Next next generation
- no effect

Show that *prior* exposure to glucocorticoids increases *future* transcriptional response

Further examined using cerebral organoids 
- (because rodents don't have the structure and cell types of humans)
- GR expressed at different levels in all organoid cell types
- Glucocorticoid treatment had cell-type specific effects (hundreds of genes per cell type, but only 48 in common)
- One is gene ZBTB16, a GR response transcription factor, contains GR response elements with reduced DNAm after glucocorticoid treatment, one contains a SNP associated with educational attainment, MR PheWAS showed glucocorticoid response element effect associated with a variety of phenotypes related to education
- Another gene, PAX6, is regulated by ZBTB16

However: 
- Not sure what keeps DNAm changes stable after glucocorticoids are no longer present
- Not sure what cases the *future* transcriptional response
