34155504,genotype and 12 prenatal environmental factors,placenta,301 NICHD Fetal Growth Studies–Singletons,"5850 variably methylated regions, of which 70% GxE, 17.7% G, 12.3% G+E, 0.03% E",Hum Mol Genet,Genetic and in-utero environmental contributions to DNA methylation variation in placenta.,"Genetic and prenatal environmental factors shape fetal development and cardiometabolic health in later life. A key target of genetic and prenatal environmental factors is the epigenome of the placenta, an organ that is implicated in fetal growth and diseases in later life. This study had two aims: 1) to identify and functionally characterize placental variably methylated regions (VMRs), which are regions in the epigenome with high interindividual methylation variability; 2) to investigate the contributions of fetal genetic loci and 12 prenatal environmental factors (maternal psychosocial-, cardiometabolic-, demographic-, and obstetric- related) on methylation at each VMR. Akaike's information criterion was used to select the best model out of four models (prenatal environment only, genotype only, additive effect of genotype and prenatal environment [Gâ€‰+â€‰E], and their interaction effect [GxE]). We identified 5850 VMRs in placenta. Methylation at 70% of VMRs was best explained by GxE followed by genotype only (17.7%), and Gâ€‰+â€‰E (12.3%). Prenatal environment alone best explained only 0.03% of VMRs. We observed that 95.4% of GxE models and 93.9% of Gâ€‰+â€‰E models included maternal age, parity, delivery mode, maternal depression, or gestational weight gain. VMR methylation sites and their regulatory genetic variants were enriched (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) for genomic regions that have known links with regulatory functions and complex traits. This study provided a genome-wide catalog of VMRs in placenta and highlighted that variation in placental DNA methylation at loci with regulatory and trait relevance is best elucidated by integrating genetic and prenatal environmental factors, and rarely by environmental factors alone.Published by Oxford University Press 2021."
34116986,gestational diabetes mellitus,cord blood,536 FinnGeDi cohort,1,Diabetes Care,Epigenome-Wide Association Study Reveals Methylation Loci Associated With Offspring Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Exposure and Maternal Methylome.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with an increased risk of obesity and insulin resistance in offspring later in life, which might be explained by epigenetic changes in response to maternal hyperglycemic exposure.We explored the association between GDM exposure and maternal blood and newborn cord blood methylation in 536 mother-offspring pairs from the prospective FinnGeDi cohort using Illumina MethylationEPIC 850K BeadChip arrays. We assessed two hypotheses. First, we tested for shared maternal and offspring epigenetic effects resulting from GDM exposure. Second, we tested whether GDM exposure and maternal methylation had an epigenetic effect on the offspring.We did not find any epigenetic marks (differentially methylated CpG probes) with shared and consistent effects between mothers and offspring. After including maternal methylation in the model, we identified a single significant (false discovery rate 1.38 Ã— 10-2) CpG at the cg22790973 probe (TFCP2)associated with GDM. We identified seven additional FDR-significant interactions of maternal methylation and GDM status, with the strongest association at the same cg22790973 probe (TFCP2), as well as cg03456133, cg24440941 (H3C6), cg20002843 (LOC127841), cg19107264, and cg11493553 located within theUBE3Cgene and cg17065901 inFAM13A,both susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes and BMI, and cg23355087 within theDLGAP2gene, known to be involved in insulin resistance during pregnancy.Our study reveals the potential complexity of the epigenetic transmission between mothers with GDM and their offspring, likely determined by not only GDM exposure but also other factors indicated by maternal epigenetic status, such as maternal metabolic history.Â© 2021 by the American Diabetes Association."
34086604,telomere length,cord blood,247,47 (76% of TL at baseline) and 31 (72% of TL at age 4.5),Aging,Different epigenetic signatures of newborn telomere length and telomere attrition rate in early life.,"Telomere length (TL) and telomere shortening are biological indicators of aging, and epigenetic associates have been found for TL in adults. However, the role of epigenetic signatures in setting newborn TL and early life telomere dynamics is unknown. In the present study, based on 247 participating newborns from the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort, whole-genome DNA methylation, profiled on the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip microarray, and TL were measured in cord blood. In a follow-up visit at a mean age of 4.58 years, leukocyte TL was evaluated. We combined an epigenome-wide association study and a statistical learning method with re-sampling to select CpGs and their two-way interactions to model baseline (cord blood) TL and early-life telomere attrition rate, where distinct epigenetic signatures were identified for the two outcomes. In addition, a stronger epigenetic regulation was suggested in setting newborn TL than that of telomere dynamics in early life: 47 CpGs and 7 between-CpG interactions explained 76% of the variance in baseline TLs, while 72% of the total variance in telomere attrition rate was explained by 31 CpGs and 5 interactions. Functional enrichment analysis based on the selected CpGs in the two models revealed GLUT4 translocation and immune cell signaling pathways, respectively. These CpGs and interactions, as well as the cellular pathways, are potential novel targets of further investigation of telomere biology and aging."
34095363,childhood adversity,saliva (5 times age 3-5),173 children,"null at baseline, trajectories in 6 regions moderated by adversity (interactions merged into DMRs by comb-p)",Neurobiol Stress,Childhood adversity correlates with stable changes in DNA methylation trajectories in children and converges with epigenetic signatures of prenatal stress.,"Childhood maltreatment (CM) is an established major risk factor for a number of negative health outcomes later in life. While epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), have been proposed as a means of embedding this environmental risk factor, little is known about its timing and trajectory, especially in very young children. It is also not clear whether additional environmental adversities, often experienced by these children, converge on similar DNAm changes. Here, we calculated a cumulative adversity score, which additionally to CM includes socioeconomic status (SES), other life events, parental psychopathology and epigenetic biomarkers of prenatal smoking and alcohol consumption. We investigated the effects of CM alone as well as the adversity score on longitudinal DNAm trajectories in the Berlin Longitudinal Child Study. This is a cohort of 173 children aged 3-5 years at baseline of whom 86 were exposed to CM. These children were followed-up for 2 years with extensive psychometric and biological assessments as well as saliva collection at 5 time points providing genome-wide DNAm levels. Overall, only a few DNAm patterns were stable over this timeframe, but less than 10 DNAm regions showed significant changes. At baseline, neither CM nor the adversity score associated with DNAm changes. However, in 6 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), CM and the adversity score significantly moderated DNAm trajectories over time. A number of these DMRs have previously been associated with adverse prenatal exposures. In our study, children exposed to CM also presented with epigenetic signatures indicative of increased prenatal exposure to tobacco and alcohol, as compared to non-CM exposed children. These epigenetic signatures of prenatal exposure strongly correlate with DNAm regions associated with CM and the adversity score. Finally, weighted correlation network analysis revealed a module of CpGs exclusively associated with CM. While our study identifies DNAm loci specifically associated with CM, especially within long non-coding RNAs, the majority of associations were found with the adversity score with convergent association with indicators of adverse prenatal exposures. This study highlights the importance of mapping not only of the epigenome but also the exposome and extending the observational timeframe to well before birth.Â© 2021 The Authors."
34116608,mammographic density,blood,385 postmenopausal women,250,Epigenetics,Association of mammographic density with blood DNA methylation.,"Background:Altered DNA methylation may be an intermediate phenotype between breast cancer risk factors and disease. Mammographic density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer. However, no studies to date have identified an epigenetic signature of mammographic density. We performed an epigenome-wide association study of mammographic density.Methods:White blood cell DNA methylation was measured for 385 postmenopausal women using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Differential methylation was assessed using genome-wide, probe-level, and regional analyses. We implemented a resampling-based approach to improve the stability of our findings.Results:On average, women with elevated mammographic density exhibited DNA hypermethylation within CpG islands and gene promoters compared to women with lower mammographic density. We identified 250 CpG sites for which DNA methylation was significantly associated with mammographic density. The top sites were located within genes associated with cancer, includingHDLBP, TGFB2, CCT4, andPAX8, and were more likely to be located in regulatory regions of the genome. We also identified differential DNA methylation in 37 regions, including within the promoters ofPAX8andPF4, a gene involved in the regulation of angiogenesis. Overall, our results paint a picture of epigenetic dysregulation associated with mammographic density.Conclusion:Mammographic density is associated with differential DNA methylation throughout the genome, including within genes associated with cancer. Our results suggest the potential involvement of several genes in the biological mechanisms behind differences in breast density between women. Further studies are warranted to explore these potential mechanisms and potential links to breast cancer risk."
34101077,mammographic density,blood (pre-diagnostic),96 pairs of women with breast cancer with low and high density,null but so many DMRs using mCSEA …,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Pre-diagnostic DNA methylation patterns differ according to mammographic breast density amongst women who subsequently develop breast cancer: a case-only study in the EPIC-Florence cohort.,"Mammographic breast density (MBD) is a marker of increased breast cancer (BC) risk, yet much remains to be clarified about the underlying mechanisms. We investigated whether DNA methylation patterns differ between high- vs. low-MBD women who developed BC during an 8.9-year median follow-up in the Florence section of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition.We analysed 96 pairs of women with BC arising on high- vs. low-MBD breasts (BI-RADS category III-IV vs. I). DNA methylation was determined on pre-diagnostic blood samples using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip assay. The statistical analysis was conducted by performing an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), by searching differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in gene promoters (followed by functional enrichment and gene annotation analysis); and through a ""candidate pathways"" approach focusing on pre-defined inflammation-related pathways.In EWAS, no single CpG site was differentially methylated between high- and low-MBD women after correction for multiple testing. A total of 140 DMRs were identified, of which 131 were hyper- and 9 hypo-methylated amongst high-MBD women. These DMRs encompassed an annotation cluster of 35 genes coding for proteins implicated in transcription regulation and DNA binding. The ""apoptosis signalling"" was the only inflammation-related candidate pathway differentially methylated between high- and low-MBD women.Pre-diagnostic methylation patterns differ between high- vs. low-MBD women who subsequently develop BC, particularly, in genes involved in the regulation of DNA transcription and cell apoptosis. Our study provides novel clues about the mechanisms linking MBD and BC."
34091768,common carotid intima-media thickness,blood,6400 from 9 cohorts,"1 (cg05575921), MR evidence of mediation on stroke risk",Eur J Epidemiol,Meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies of carotid intima-media thickness.,"Common carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) is an index of subclinical atherosclerosis that is associated with ischemic stroke and coronary artery disease (CAD). We undertook a cross-sectional epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of measures of cIMT in 6400 individuals. Mendelian randomization analysis was applied to investigate the potential causal role of DNA methylation in the link between atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk factors and cIMT or clinical cardiovascular disease. The CpG site cg05575921 was associated with cIMT (betaâ€‰=â€‰-0.0264, p valueâ€‰=â€‰3.5â€‰Ã—â€‰10-8) in the discovery panel and was replicated in replication panel (betaâ€‰=â€‰-0.07, p valueâ€‰=â€‰0.005). This CpG is located at chr5:81649347 in the intron 3 of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor gene (AHRR). Our results indicate that DNA methylation at cg05575921 might be in the pathway between smoking, cIMT and stroke. Moreover, in a region-based analysis, 34 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified of which a DMR upstream of ALOX12 showed the strongest association with cIMT (p valueâ€‰=â€‰1.4â€‰Ã—â€‰10-13). In conclusion, our study suggests that DNA methylation may play a role in the link between cardiovascular risk factors, cIMT and clinical cardiovascular disease."
34117263,C-reactive protein,blood,589 RODAM study,14 and replicated 24% assocs from previous study,NPJ Genom Med,Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on C-reactive protein among Ghanaians suggests molecular links to the emerging risk of cardiovascular diseases.,"Molecular mechanisms at the intersection of inflammation and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among Africans are still unknown. We performed an epigenome-wide association study to identify loci associated with serum C-reactive protein (marker of inflammation) among Ghanaians and further assessed whether differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were linked to CVD in previous reports, or to estimated CVD risk in the same population. We used the Illumina InfiniumÂ® HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to obtain DNAm profiles of blood samples in 589 Ghanaians from the RODAM study (without acute infections, not taking anti-inflammatory medications, CRP levelsâ€‰<â€‰40â€‰mg/L). We then used linear models to identify DMPs associated with CRP concentrations. Post-hoc, we evaluated associations of identified DMPs with elevated CVD risk estimated via ASCVD risk score. We also performed subset analyses at CRP levels â‰¤10â€‰mg/L and replication analyses on candidate probes. Finally, we assessed for biological relevance of our findings in public databases. We subsequently identified 14 novel DMPs associated with CRP. In post-hoc evaluations, we found that DMPs in PC, BTG4 and PADI1 showed trends of associations with estimated CVD risk, we identified a separate DMP in MORC2 that was associated with CRP levels â‰¤10â€‰mg/L, and we successfully replicated 65 (24%) of previously reported DMPs. All DMPs with gene annotations (13) were biologically linked to inflammation or CVD traits. We have identified epigenetic loci that may play a role in the intersection between inflammation and CVD among Ghanaians. Further studies among other Africans are needed to confirm our findings."
34112773,Alzheimer's disease,cortex,1408,220,Nat Commun,A meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies in Alzheimer's disease highlights novel differentially methylated loci across cortex.,"Epigenome-wide association studies of Alzheimer's disease have highlighted neuropathology-associated DNA methylation differences, although existing studies have been limited in sample size and utilized different brain regions. Here, we combine data from six DNA methylomic studies of Alzheimer's disease (Nâ€‰=â€‰1453 unique individuals) to identify differential methylation associated with Braak stage in different brain regions and across cortex. We identify 236 CpGs in the prefrontal cortex, 95 CpGs in the temporal gyrus and ten CpGs in the entorhinal cortex at Bonferroni significance, with none in the cerebellum. Our cross-cortex meta-analysis (Nâ€‰=â€‰1408 donors) identifies 220 CpGs associated with neuropathology, annotated to 121 genes, of which 84 genes have not been previously reported at this significance threshold. We have replicated our findings using two further DNA methylomic datasets consisting of a further >600 unique donors. The meta-analysis summary statistics are available in our online data resource ( www.epigenomicslab.com/ad-meta-analysis/ )."
