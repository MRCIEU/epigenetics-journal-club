No,EWAS,34112938,Differential methylation of G-protein coupled receptor signaling genes in gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors.,Sci Rep,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the small intestine undergo large chromosomal and methylation changes. The objective of this study was to identify methylation differences in NETs and consider how the differentially methylated genes may impact patient survival. Genome-wide methylation and chromosomal copy number variation (CNV) of NETs from the small intestine and appendix were measured. Tumors were divided into three molecular subtypes according to CNV results: chromosome 18 loss (18LOH), Multiple CNV, and No CNV. Comparison of 18LOH tumors with MultiCNV and NoCNV tumors identified 901 differentially methylated genes. Genes from the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways are statistically overrepresented in the differentially methylated genes. One of the highlighted genes from the GPCR pathway is somatostatin (SST), a clinical target for NETs. Patient survival based on low versus high methylation in all samples identified four significant genes (p < 0.05) OR2S2, SMILR, RNU6-653P, and AC010543.1. Within the 18LOH molecular subtype tumors, survival differences were identified in high versus low methylation of 24 genes. The most significant is TRHR (p < 0.01), a GPCR with multiple FDA-approved drugs. By separating NETs into different molecular subtypes based on chromosomal changes, we find that multiple GPCRs and their ligands appear to be regulated through methylation and correlated with survival. These results suggest opportunities for better treatment strategies for NETs based on molecular features."
No,Methods,34103055,Gene set enrichment analysis for genome-wide DNA methylation data.,Genome Biol,"DNA methylation is one of the most commonly studied epigenetic marks, due to its role in disease and development. Illumina methylation arrays have been extensively used to measure methylation across the human genome. Methylation array analysis has primarily focused on preprocessing, normalization, and identification of differentially methylated CpGs and regions. GOmeth and GOregion are new methods for performing unbiased gene set testing following differential methylation analysis. Benchmarking analyses demonstrate GOmeth outperforms other approaches, and GOregion is the first method for gene set testing of differentially methylated regions. Both methods are publicly available in the missMethyl Bioconductor R package."
No,Methods,34155396,The triumphs and limitations of computational methods for scRNA-seq.,Nat Methods,"The rapid progress of protocols for sequencing single-cell transcriptomes over the past decade has been accompanied by equally impressive advances in the computational methods for analysis of such data. As capacity and accuracy of the experimental techniques grew, the emerging algorithm developments revealed increasingly complex facets of the underlying biology, from cell type composition to gene regulation to developmental dynamics. At the same time, rapid growth has forced continuous reevaluation of the underlying statistical models, experimental aims, and sheer volumes of data processing that are handled by these computational tools. Here, I review key computational steps of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, examine assumptions made by different approaches, and highlight successes, remaining ambiguities, and limitations that are important to keep in mind as scRNA-seq becomes a mainstream technique for studying biology."
No,mtDNA,34099068,Mitochondrial genome copy number measured by DNA sequencing in human blood is strongly associated with metabolic traits via cell-type composition differences.,Hum Genomics,"Mitochondrial genome copy number (MT-CN) varies among humans and across tissues and is highly heritable, but its causes and consequences are not well understood. When measured by bulk DNA sequencing in blood, MT-CN may reflect a combination of the number of mitochondria per cell and cell-type composition. Here, we studied MT-CN variation in blood-derived DNA from 19184 Finnish individuals using a combination of genome (N = 4163) and exome sequencing (N = 19034) data as well as imputed genotypes (N = 17718).We identified two loci significantly associated with MT-CN variation: a common variant at the MYB-HBS1L locus (P = 1.6 × 10-8), which has previously been associated with numerous hematological parameters; and a burden of rare variants in the TMBIM1 gene (P = 3.0 × 10-8), which has been reported to protect against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We also found that MT-CN is strongly associated with insulin levels (P = 2.0 × 10-21) and other metabolic syndrome (metS)-related traits. Using a Mendelian randomization framework, we show evidence that MT-CN measured in blood is causally related to insulin levels. We then applied an MT-CN polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from Finnish data to the UK Biobank, where the association between the PRS and metS traits was replicated. Adjusting for cell counts largely eliminated these signals, suggesting that MT-CN affects metS via cell-type composition.These results suggest that measurements of MT-CN in blood-derived DNA partially reflect differences in cell-type composition and that these differences are causally linked to insulin and related traits."
No,Prediction,34149812,Multi-Omics Marker Analysis Enables Early Prediction of Breast Tumor Progression.,Front Genet,"Ductal carcinomain situ(DCIS) is a preinvasive form of breast cancer with a highly variable potential of becoming invasive and affecting mortality of the patients. Due to the lack of accurate markers of disease progression, many women with detected DCIS are currently overtreated. To distinguish those DCIS cases who are likely to require therapy from those who should be left untreated, there is a need for robust and predictive biomarkers extracted from molecular or genetic profiles. We developed a supervised machine learning approach that implements multi-omics feature selection and model regularization for the identification of biomarker combinations that could be used to distinguish low-risk DCIS lesions from those with a higher likelihood of progression. To investigate the genetic heterogeneity of disease progression, we applied this approach to 40 pure DCIS and 259 invasive breast cancer (IBC) samples profiled with genome-wide transcriptomics, DNA methylation, and DNA copy number variation. Feature selection using the multi-omics Lasso-regularized algorithm identified both known genes involved in breast cancer development, as well as novel markers for early detection. Even though the gene expression-based model features led to the highest classification accuracy alone, methylation data provided a complementary source of features and improved especially the sensitivity of correctly classifying DCIS cases. We also identified a number of repeatedly misclassified DCIS cases when using either the expression or methylation markers. A small panel of 10 gene markers was able to distinguish DCIS and IBC cases with high accuracy in nested cross-validation (AU-ROC = 0.99). The marker panel was not specific to any of the established breast cancer subtypes, suggesting that the 10-gene signature may provide a subtype-agnostic and cost-effective approach for breast cancer detection and patient stratification. We further confirmed high accuracy of the 10-gene signature in an external validation cohort (AU-ROC = 0.95), profiled using distinct transcriptomic assay, hence demonstrating robustness of the risk signature.Copyright © 2021 Xu, Lien, Bergholtz, Fleischer, Djerroudi, Vincent-Salomon, Sørlie and Aittokallio."
No,TWAS,34158615,Transcriptome-wide association study of treatment-resistant depression and depression subtypes for drug repurposing.,Neuropsychopharmacology,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the single largest contributor to global disability and up to 20-30% of patients do not respond to at least two antidepressants (treatment-resistant depression, TRD). This study leveraged imputed gene expression in TRD to perform a drug repurposing analysis. Among those with MDD, we defined TRD as having at least two antidepressant switches according to primary care records in UK Biobank (UKB). We performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) of TRD (n = 2165) vs healthy controls (n = 11,188) using FUSION and gene expression levels from 21 tissues. We identified compounds with opposite gene expression signatures (ConnectivityMap data) compared to our TWAS results using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Spearman and Pearson correlation. As symptom patterns are routinely assessed in clinical practice and could be used to provide targeted treatments, we identified MDD subtypes associated with TRD in UKB and analysed them using the same pipeline described for TRD. Anxious MDD (n = 14,954) and MDD with weight gain (n = 4697) were associated with TRD. In the TWAS, two genes were significantly dysregulated (TMEM106B and ATP2A1 for anxious and weight gain MDD, respectively). A muscarinic receptor antagonist was identified as top candidate for repurposing in TRD; inhibition of heat shock protein 90 was the main mechanism of action identified for anxious MDD, while modulators of metabolism such as troglitazone showed promising results for MDD with weight gain. This was the first TWAS of TRD and associated MDD subtypes. Our results shed light on possible pharmacological approaches in individuals with difficult-to-treat depression."
No ,Methods,34130352,Inverse probability weighting is an effective method to address selection bias during the analysis of high dimensional data.,Genet Epidemiol,"Omics studies frequently use samples collected during cohort studies. Conditioning on sample availability can cause selection bias if sample availability is nonrandom. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) is purported to reduce this bias. We evaluated IPW in an epigenome-wide analysis testing the association between DNA methylation (261,435 probes) and age in healthy adolescent subjects (n = 114). We simulated age and sex to be correlated with sample selection and then evaluated four conditions: complete population/no selection bias (all subjects), naïve selection bias (no adjustment), and IPW selection bias (selection bias with IPW adjustment). Assuming the complete population condition represented the ""truth,"" we compared each condition to the complete population condition. Bias or difference in associations between age and methylation was reduced in the IPW condition versus the naïve condition. However, genomic inflation and type 1 error were higher in the IPW condition relative to the naïve condition. Postadjustment using bacon, type 1 error and inflation were similar across all conditions. Power was higher under the IPW condition compared with the naïve condition before and after inflation adjustment. IPW methods can reduce bias in genome-wide analyses. Genomic inflation is a potential concern that can be minimized using methods that adjust for inflation.© 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
